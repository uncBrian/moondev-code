Why? Because we had the ability to come

54
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
Why? Because we had the ability to come
 

55
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,429
Why? Because we had the ability to come
up here in base, right? We talked about

56
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
up here in base, right? We talked about
 

57
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,150
up here in base, right? We talked about
this move here. Did they do it? No. We

58
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
this move here. Did they do it? No. We
 

59
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,310
this move here. Did they do it? No. We
came up, we failed, we came downside, we

60
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
came up, we failed, we came downside, we
 

61
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,949
came up, we failed, we came downside, we
came up, and we're back into what? Into

62
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959

63
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,350
came up, and we're back into what? Into
this area here. All right. So, this is

64
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
this area here. All right. So, this is
 

65
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,350
this area here. All right. So, this is
very much a failed breakout. We're

66
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
very much a failed breakout. We're
 

67
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,310
very much a failed breakout. We're
actually waiting to see if we're going

68
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
actually waiting to see if we're going
 

69
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,469
actually waiting to see if we're going
to get continuation lower outside of

70
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
to get continuation lower outside of
 

71
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,550
to get continuation lower outside of
this or continuation higher. We've had a

72
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
this or continuation higher. We've had a
 

73
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,310
this or continuation higher. We've had a
failed breakout to the top side. So,

74
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
failed breakout to the top side. So,
 

75
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,670
failed breakout to the top side. So,
we're probably going to test this bottom

76
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
we're probably going to test this bottom
 

77
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,350
we're probably going to test this bottom
side. And if we start getting weak,

78
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
side. And if we start getting weak,
 

79
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,510
side. And if we start getting weak,
well, we can see this 200 day maybe

80
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
well, we can see this 200 day maybe
 

81
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,909
well, we can see this 200 day maybe
being looked at. And all these stops

82
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
being looked at. And all these stops
 

83
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,909
being looked at. And all these stops
here. But for now, we're going to

84
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:41,919
here. But for now, we're going to
 

85
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,510

Even if we think about the weekly

110
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919

00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
going to risk the low to get to the high
 

123
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,150
going to risk the low to get to the high
or risk the high to get to the low at

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,110
mean, lower ballinger and 50-day acting
as a big support system. All right, on

158
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
as a big support system. All right, on
 

159
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,950
as a big support system. All right, on
that lower Ballinger, we don't have that

160
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
that lower Ballinger, we don't have that
 

161
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,469
that lower Ballinger, we don't have that
right now. We are in a liquidity

162
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
right now. We are in a liquidity
 

163
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,390
right now. We are in a liquidity
building phase. It very much might be

164
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
building phase. It very much might be
 

165
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,230
building phase. It very much might be
that we collapse this market, but it

166
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
that we collapse this market, but it
 

167
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,230
that we collapse this market, but it
probably won't be today. Right. So,

168
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
probably won't be today. Right. So,
 

169
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,390
probably won't be today. Right. So,
we're expecting what probably as we're

170
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
we're expecting what probably as we're
 

171
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,790
we're expecting what probably as we're
opening up in an inside bar, as we're

172
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
opening up in an inside bar, as we're
 

173
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,550
opening up in an inside bar, as we're
opening up inside the week, as we're

174
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
opening up inside the week, as we're
 

175
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,629
opening up inside the week, as we're
opening up inside the range, we're

176
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
opening up inside the range, we're
 

177
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,710
opening up inside the range, we're
probably expecting some rotation in

178
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
probably expecting some rotation in
 

179
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,990
probably expecting some rotation in
here. All right. So, we want to be

180
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
here. All right. So, we want to be
 

181
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,309
here. All right. So, we want to be
careful with that. Moving down into the

182
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
careful with that. Moving down into the
 

183
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,670
careful with that. Moving down into the
hourly charts.

184
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
hourly charts.
 

185
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,350
hourly charts.
Make sure you guys can see all this. All

186
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
Make sure you guys can see all this. All
 

187
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,029
Make sure you guys can see all this. All
right. I've got this lined up right.

188
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,039
right. I've got this lined up right.
 

189
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,469
right. I've got this lined up right.
Yeah, that looks pretty good. All right.

190
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
Yeah, that looks pretty good. All right.
 

191
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,790
Yeah, that looks pretty good. All right.
Moving down into the hourly,

192
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
Moving down into the hourly,
 

193
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,710
Moving down into the hourly,
we can look at previous week's

194
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
we can look at previous week's
 

195
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,790
we can look at previous week's
developing profiles and current week's

196
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
developing profiles and current week's
 

197
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,110
developing profiles and current week's
developing profile. So, right now, this

198
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
developing profile. So, right now, this
 

199
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,110
developing profile. So, right now, this
is our current week developing profile.

200
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
is our current week developing profile.
 

201
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,510
is our current week developing profile.
You can see this level here is

202
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520
You can see this level here is
 

203
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,870
You can see this level here is
absolutely pivotal. Okay, this block

204
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
absolutely pivotal. Okay, this block
 

205
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,550
absolutely pivotal. Okay, this block
here, what can we call it? We can call

206
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
here, what can we call it? We can call
 

207
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,629
here, what can we call it? We can call
this block basically, let's just call it

208
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
this block basically, let's just call it
 

209
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,990
this block basically, let's just call it
900 down to 850. All right, in that

210
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
900 down to 850. All right, in that
 

211
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,070
900 down to 850. All right, in that
block we have the current week or

212
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
block we have the current week or
 

213
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,070
block we have the current week or
developing week value area low. We have

214
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
developing week value area low. We have
 

215
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,150
developing week value area low. We have
the previous day value area high. So we

216
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
the previous day value area high. So we
 

217
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,749
the previous day value area high. So we
have the previous day point of control.

218
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
have the previous day point of control.
 

219
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,150
have the previous day point of control.
We can we have the previous week value

220
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
We can we have the previous week value
 

221
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,150
We can we have the previous week value
area high, right? Previous week value

222
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
area high, right? Previous week value
 

223
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,510
area high, right? Previous week value
area high. And we have the week before

224
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
area high. And we have the week before
 

225
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,350
area high. And we have the week before
that point of control. We can see this

226
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
that point of control. We can see this
 

227
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,510
that point of control. We can see this
area here. Look how many times we want

228
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520
area here. Look how many times we want
 

229
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,670
area here. Look how many times we want
to test this area here. Look at this.

230
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
to test this area here. Look at this.
 

231
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,230
to test this area here. Look at this.
All these value area highs. This node

232
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240
All these value area highs. This node
 

233
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,070
All these value area highs. This node
here, this point of control, this node

234
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
here, this point of control, this node
 

235
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,870
here, this point of control, this node
here. All right. This is a big area for

236
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
here. All right. This is a big area for
 

237
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,309
here. All right. This is a big area for
the market dating back to mid December.

238
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
the market dating back to mid December.
 

239
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,390
the market dating back to mid December.
Okay. Dating back to mid December. All

240
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
Okay. Dating back to mid December. All
 

241
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,710
Okay. Dating back to mid December. All
right. We're going back a long time now.

242
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:30,720
right. We're going back a long time now.
 

243
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,909
right. We're going back a long time now.
6 weeks. So we got to be understanding

244
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
6 weeks. So we got to be understanding
 

245
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,469
6 weeks. So we got to be understanding
of that. If we can hold all right, if we

246
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:36,479
of that. If we can hold all right, if we
 

247
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,390
of that. If we can hold all right, if we
are able to hold bids over 900, this is

248
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
are able to hold bids over 900, this is
 

249
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,070
are able to hold bids over 900, this is
the same trigger as those in Discord

250
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
the same trigger as those in Discord
 

251
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,790
the same trigger as those in Discord
took uh yesterday in the afternoon. If

252
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
took uh yesterday in the afternoon. If
 

253
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,350
took uh yesterday in the afternoon. If
we are able to hold bids over 900, you

254
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
we are able to hold bids over 900, you
 

255
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,749
we are able to hold bids over 900, you
can see we're thin here. It's possible

256
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
can see we're thin here. It's possible
 

257
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,110
can see we're thin here. It's possible
at that point they want to come and

258
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
at that point they want to come and
 

259
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,790
at that point they want to come and
retest up here into 26,000, possibly

260
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
retest up here into 26,000, possibly
 

261
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,110
retest up here into 26,000, possibly
even this point of control up here. All

262
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
even this point of control up here. All
 

263
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,110
even this point of control up here. All
right, developing weak point of control.

264
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120
right, developing weak point of control.
 

265
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,790
right, developing weak point of control.
This was the relief. Anyone that got

266
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
This was the relief. Anyone that got
 

267
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,869
This was the relief. Anyone that got
long yesterday, remember I said the

268
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
long yesterday, remember I said the
 

269
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,589
long yesterday, remember I said the
final target if we got long down here.

270
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
final target if we got long down here.
 

271
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,350
final target if we got long down here.
All right, the final target would be

272
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
All right, the final target would be
 

273
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,270
All right, the final target would be
into what? This shelf here because up

274
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
into what? This shelf here because up
 

275
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,270
into what? This shelf here because up
here we have trapped buyers. All right,

276
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
here we have trapped buyers. All right,
 

277
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,589
here we have trapped buyers. All right,
we from Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday we

278
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
we from Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday we
 

279
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,029
we from Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday we
have trapped buyers. We flushed away

280
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
have trapped buyers. We flushed away
 

281
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,189
have trapped buyers. We flushed away
from them. All right, we expect that now

282
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199
from them. All right, we expect that now
 

283
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,230
from them. All right, we expect that now
to hold as resistance. All right, so

284
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
to hold as resistance. All right, so
 

285
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,950
to hold as resistance. All right, so
this is the pain point. If we come up

286
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
this is the pain point. If we come up
 

287
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,710
this is the pain point. If we come up
here, all right, there might be a lift

288
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,720
here, all right, there might be a lift
 

289
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,790
here, all right, there might be a lift
from 900 up to there. you would expect

290
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
from 900 up to there. you would expect
 

291
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,629
from 900 up to there. you would expect
shorts to come back in play for the

292
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
shorts to come back in play for the
 

293
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,510
shorts to come back in play for the
rotation back down. If they don't come

294
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,520
rotation back down. If they don't come
 

295
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,509
rotation back down. If they don't come
back in play, and this is today or next

296
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
back in play, and this is today or next
 

297
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,990
back in play, and this is today or next
week, if we come up here and we start to

298
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
week, if we come up here and we start to
 

299
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,909
week, if we come up here and we start to
base, you best believe we're probably

300
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
base, you best believe we're probably
 

301
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,670
base, you best believe we're probably
going to go alltime highs because then

302
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
going to go alltime highs because then
 

303
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,310
going to go alltime highs because then
we will use this liquidity to move

304
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
we will use this liquidity to move
 

305
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,389
we will use this liquidity to move
higher. All right, so the first thing

306
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
higher. All right, so the first thing
 

307
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,230
higher. All right, so the first thing
I'll be watching today is can we find

308
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
I'll be watching today is can we find
 

309
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,110
I'll be watching today is can we find
acceptance over 900? If we can find

310
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,120
acceptance over 900? If we can find
 

311
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,269
acceptance over 900? If we can find
acceptance over 900, I'm looking for

312
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
acceptance over 900, I'm looking for
 

313
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,070
acceptance over 900, I'm looking for
that whole number 26,000, right? Right.

314
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
that whole number 26,000, right? Right.
 

315
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,269
that whole number 26,000, right? Right.
And if we get over there up into 2694,

316
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:57,279
And if we get over there up into 2694,
 

317
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,670
And if we get over there up into 2694,
26100 we just call it. I'm not expecting

318
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
26100 we just call it. I'm not expecting
 

319
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,110
26100 we just call it. I'm not expecting
the market to be able to move above

320
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,120
the market to be able to move above
 

321
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,190
the market to be able to move above
that. I'm expecting shorts to either

322
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
that. I'm expecting shorts to either
 

323
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,269
that. I'm expecting shorts to either
hammer us back down here or hammer us

324
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
hammer us back down here or hammer us
 

325
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,150
hammer us back down here or hammer us
back down here to the bottom side. Okay.

326
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
back down here to the bottom side. Okay.
 

327
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,910
back down here to the bottom side. Okay.
If we're going to lose the 850s,

328
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
If we're going to lose the 850s,
 

329
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,190
If we're going to lose the 850s,
right? So, if we're going to come down

330
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
right? So, if we're going to come down
 

331
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,750
right? So, if we're going to come down
here and reject this shelf, then we're

332
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
here and reject this shelf, then we're
 

333
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,269
here and reject this shelf, then we're
what? We're looking for the rotation

334
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
what? We're looking for the rotation
 

335
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,269
what? We're looking for the rotation
back lower. So, where's the next point?

336
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
back lower. So, where's the next point?
 

337
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,110
back lower. So, where's the next point?
Probably previous week point of control.

338
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
Probably previous week point of control.
 

339
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,750
Probably previous week point of control.
This node here. So if we lose 850s on a

340
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:23,760
This node here. So if we lose 850s on a
 

341
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,590
This node here. So if we lose 850s on a
retest, there's probably a move back

342
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
retest, there's probably a move back
 

343
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,110
retest, there's probably a move back
down to 700. If we lose 700, we have a

344
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
down to 700. If we lose 700, we have a
 

345
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,269
down to 700. If we lose 700, we have a
runner back down to 600. So we are going

346
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:31,279
runner back down to 600. So we are going
 

347
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,829
runner back down to 600. So we are going
to need to be available to play both

348
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
to need to be available to play both
 

349
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,710
to need to be available to play both
sides of the tape. This is available.

350
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
sides of the tape. This is available.
 

351
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,990
sides of the tape. This is available.
This is available. This is not an area I

352
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
This is available. This is not an area I
 

353
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,670
This is available. This is not an area I
want to trade in. All right, I do not

354
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
want to trade in. All right, I do not
 

355
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,030
want to trade in. All right, I do not
want to trade in 850 to 900. No interest

356
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
want to trade in 850 to 900. No interest
 

357
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,710
want to trade in 850 to 900. No interest
in trading in there. I will let everyone

358
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
in trading in there. I will let everyone
 

359
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,630
in trading in there. I will let everyone
else piss about in there become the

360
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:48,640
else piss about in there become the
 

361
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,030
else piss about in there become the
liquidity and if we leave that area we

362
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
liquidity and if we leave that area we
 

363
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,509
liquidity and if we leave that area we
can use it. The other thing I should say

364
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
can use it. The other thing I should say
 

365
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,550
can use it. The other thing I should say
and preface with this this a little poke

366
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
and preface with this this a little poke
 

367
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,030
and preface with this this a little poke
above 900 without basing is not a buy.

368
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
above 900 without basing is not a buy.
 

369
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,110
above 900 without basing is not a buy.
All right, that can easily be a trap and

370
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
All right, that can easily be a trap and
 

371
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,269
All right, that can easily be a trap and
a flush. Same as here. A little poke

372
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
a flush. Same as here. A little poke
 

373
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,150
a flush. Same as here. A little poke
under 800 that doesn't retest and stay

374
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
under 800 that doesn't retest and stay
 

375
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,990
under 800 that doesn't retest and stay
heavy is not a sell. That can be a

376
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
heavy is not a sell. That can be a
 

377
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,710
heavy is not a sell. That can be a
little poke under and a trap. All right,

378
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
little poke under and a trap. All right,
 

379
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,870
little poke under and a trap. All right,
we can trap each side of this like just

380
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
we can trap each side of this like just
 

381
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,230
we can trap each side of this like just
like here. So, we're going to be aware

382
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
like here. So, we're going to be aware
 

383
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,910
like here. So, we're going to be aware
of those. Let's have a quick look at

384
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
of those. Let's have a quick look at
 

385
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,509
of those. Let's have a quick look at
GlobeEx, which is just above us right

386
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
GlobeEx, which is just above us right
 

387
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,470
GlobeEx, which is just above us right
now, and uh see what we've got in here.

388
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
now, and uh see what we've got in here.
 

389
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,069
now, and uh see what we've got in here.
In fact, you know what I'll do? I'll

390
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
In fact, you know what I'll do? I'll
 

391
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,190
In fact, you know what I'll do? I'll
just put on a profile from Globex. Give

392
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,200
just put on a profile from Globex. Give
 

393
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,069
just put on a profile from Globex. Give
me a second.

394
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
me a second.
 

395
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,829
me a second.
I mean, just in case there's some key

396
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
I mean, just in case there's some key
 

397
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,590
I mean, just in case there's some key
levels that match up. There we go.

398
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:31,600
levels that match up. There we go.
 

399
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,990
levels that match up. There we go.
Right, there's our GlobeEx profile.

400
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,000
Right, there's our GlobeEx profile.
 

401
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,509
Right, there's our GlobeEx profile.
Here's the Asia high. So, Asia, we got a

402
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
Here's the Asia high. So, Asia, we got a
 

403
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,430
Here's the Asia high. So, Asia, we got a
drift down. We found a bid on. Guess

404
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440
drift down. We found a bid on. Guess
 

405
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,590
drift down. We found a bid on. Guess
what? The 20-day we came back up to that

406
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
what? The 20-day we came back up to that
 

407
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,350
what? The 20-day we came back up to that
thick area and point of control value

408
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
thick area and point of control value
 

409
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,030
thick area and point of control value
area high. There was a fade from that in

410
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
area high. There was a fade from that in
 

411
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,269
area high. There was a fade from that in
GlobeEx back down to the Yep. 20-day.

412
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
GlobeEx back down to the Yep. 20-day.
 

413
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,030
GlobeEx back down to the Yep. 20-day.
Retested the previous week point of

414
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
Retested the previous week point of
 

415
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,509
Retested the previous week point of
control. Found a bid. Reheld 20-day back

416
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
control. Found a bid. Reheld 20-day back
 

417
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,150
control. Found a bid. Reheld 20-day back
up. You can see the rotation, right?

418
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
up. You can see the rotation, right?
 

419
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,949
up. You can see the rotation, right?
Failing here. Drift down 20-day. Recheck

420
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
Failing here. Drift down 20-day. Recheck
 

421
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,949
Failing here. Drift down 20-day. Recheck
point of control. Drift down 20-day.

422
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
point of control. Drift down 20-day.
 

423
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,190
point of control. Drift down 20-day.
Lose 20-day. Previous week point of

424
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
Lose 20-day. Previous week point of
 

425
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,949
Lose 20-day. Previous week point of
control. Back to 20-day point of

426
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
control. Back to 20-day point of
 

427
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,389
control. Back to 20-day point of
control. 20-day reclaim back to previous

428
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
control. 20-day reclaim back to previous
 

429
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,910
control. 20-day reclaim back to previous
day point of control. And you can see

430
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:07,920
day point of control. And you can see
 

431
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,910
day point of control. And you can see
the rinse repeat. All right. So, more

432
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
the rinse repeat. All right. So, more
 

433
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,230
the rinse repeat. All right. So, more
liquidity being built out in the GlobeEx

434
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
liquidity being built out in the GlobeEx
 

435
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,750
liquidity being built out in the GlobeEx
session. No edge there for me right now.

436
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
session. No edge there for me right now.
 

437
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,949
session. No edge there for me right now.
Okay, let's come up to this screen here.

438
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
Okay, let's come up to this screen here.
 

439
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,630
Okay, let's come up to this screen here.
And we're gonna have to get a little bit

440
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
And we're gonna have to get a little bit
 

441
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,110
And we're gonna have to get a little bit
of a move on here, guys. I'm sorry. Uh,

442
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
of a move on here, guys. I'm sorry. Uh,
 

443
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,870
of a move on here, guys. I'm sorry. Uh,
quick look for ES and the spiders for

444
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
quick look for ES and the spiders for
 

445
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,030
quick look for ES and the spiders for
you. You're basically looking at the

446
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
you. You're basically looking at the
 

447
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,269
you. You're basically looking at the
same story. Okay, that drive up and ES,

448
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
same story. Okay, that drive up and ES,
 

449
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,550
same story. Okay, that drive up and ES,
this is the same thing we just talked

450
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,560
this is the same thing we just talked
 

451
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,110
this is the same thing we just talked
about. Trapped buyers from this week are

452
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
about. Trapped buyers from this week are
 

453
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,870
about. Trapped buyers from this week are
trapped above here. There's the flush.

454
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
trapped above here. There's the flush.
 

455
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,949
trapped above here. There's the flush.
There's the retest. It stayed heavy.

456
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
There's the retest. It stayed heavy.
 

457
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,910
There's the retest. It stayed heavy.
This is now your range on ES. If you get

458
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
This is now your range on ES. If you get
 

459
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,069
This is now your range on ES. If you get
acceptance of follow through under this

460
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
acceptance of follow through under this
 

461
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,550
acceptance of follow through under this
right then you can dig for lower prices

462
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:44,560
right then you can dig for lower prices
 

463
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,509
right then you can dig for lower prices
looking for probably yeah 78s and maybe

464
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
looking for probably yeah 78s and maybe
 

465
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,430

00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
back even into this cluster right down
 

467
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,750
back even into this cluster right down
into there into 830s but not necessarily

468
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
into there into 830s but not necessarily
 

469
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,430
into there into 830s but not necessarily
today but it's something we can

470
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440
today but it's something we can
 

471
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,069
today but it's something we can
consider. Uh we can have a quick look at

472
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
consider. Uh we can have a quick look at
 

473
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,110
consider. Uh we can have a quick look at
the spiders and it will be the same

474
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
the spiders and it will be the same
 

475
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,269
the spiders and it will be the same
story. Yeah, same story. So 85 was the

476
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
story. Yeah, same story. So 85 was the
 

477
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,350
story. Yeah, same story. So 85 was the
gamma level. You can see we cleaned out

478
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
gamma level. You can see we cleaned out
 

479
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,509
gamma level. You can see we cleaned out
this liquidity at 85 found a bid. Same

480
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:05,519
this liquidity at 85 found a bid. Same
 

481
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,949
this liquidity at 85 found a bid. Same
story. All right, there's your range

482
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
story. All right, there's your range
 

483
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,190
story. All right, there's your range
here to here. That's the range that

484
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,200
here to here. That's the range that
 

485
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,790
here to here. That's the range that
we're currently in. So, you want edges

486
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
we're currently in. So, you want edges
 

487
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,310
we're currently in. So, you want edges
on range until proves otherwise. Same

488
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
on range until proves otherwise. Same
 

489
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,590
on range until proves otherwise. Same
story on the cues. It's going to be

490
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
story on the cues. It's going to be
 

491
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,430
story on the cues. It's going to be
exactly the same. There you go. Never

492
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
exactly the same. There you go. Never
 

493
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,030
exactly the same. There you go. Never
really got up into this pain point. We

494
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
really got up into this pain point. We
 

495
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,870
really got up into this pain point. We
only came into here. So, there's the

496
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
only came into here. So, there's the
 

497
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,430
only came into here. So, there's the
flush. There's the rebound. The question

498
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,440
flush. There's the rebound. The question
 

499
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,750
flush. There's the rebound. The question
is, do they sell this now or do we just

500
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
is, do they sell this now or do we just
 

501
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,790
is, do they sell this now or do we just
get stuck in here on the Friday?

502
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:28,800
get stuck in here on the Friday?
 

503
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,949
get stuck in here on the Friday?
Dollar um is trying to find a bid at the

504
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:30,959
Dollar um is trying to find a bid at the
 

505
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,550
Dollar um is trying to find a bid at the
moment. Actually, it's trying to curl

506
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
moment. Actually, it's trying to curl
 

507
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,470
moment. Actually, it's trying to curl
off these lows, but again, just one big

508
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480
off these lows, but again, just one big
 

509
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,310
off these lows, but again, just one big
range. Very similar to the indexes,

510
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320
range. Very similar to the indexes,
 

511
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,150
range. Very similar to the indexes,
right? We're stuck up here. Buyers are

512
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
right? We're stuck up here. Buyers are
 

513
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,590
right? We're stuck up here. Buyers are
trapped up here. So, that's the

514
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:39,600
trapped up here. So, that's the
 

515
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,350
trapped up here. So, that's the
liquidity build. Is this a giant bare

516
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
liquidity build. Is this a giant bare
 

517
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,030
liquidity build. Is this a giant bare
flag? We will find out by next week, I

518
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,040
flag? We will find out by next week, I
 

519
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,990
flag? We will find out by next week, I
would imagine. And we can have a quick

520
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
would imagine. And we can have a quick
 

521
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,230
would imagine. And we can have a quick
look at the VIX,

522
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
look at the VIX,
 

523
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,389
look at the VIX,
which is probably still in this channel.

524
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:50,399
which is probably still in this channel.
 

525
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,069
which is probably still in this channel.
Uh, let's just zoom this out a little

526
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
Uh, let's just zoom this out a little
 

527
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,670
Uh, let's just zoom this out a little
bit. Clean this up.

528
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
bit. Clean this up.
 

529
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,509
bit. Clean this up.
Yeah, still finding in this channel.

530
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:57,519
Yeah, still finding in this channel.
 

531
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,190
Yeah, still finding in this channel.
Still kind of getting stuck top side,

532
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200
Still kind of getting stuck top side,
 

533
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,949
Still kind of getting stuck top side,
but we have found a bit of a bid the

534
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
but we have found a bit of a bid the
 

535
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,030
but we have found a bit of a bid the
last few days. So, I'll be watching some

536
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
last few days. So, I'll be watching some
 

537
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,629
last few days. So, I'll be watching some
of these areas. I'll clean them up on my

538
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
of these areas. I'll clean them up on my
 

539
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,629
of these areas. I'll clean them up on my
other chart right quickly. We got 5

540
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639
other chart right quickly. We got 5
 

541
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,190
other chart right quickly. We got 5
minutes to go through the mag, right?

542
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
minutes to go through the mag, right?
 

543
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,590
minutes to go through the mag, right?
Apple held this key level uh that we

544
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
Apple held this key level uh that we
 

545
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,430
Apple held this key level uh that we
talked about yesterday. We can know that

546
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
talked about yesterday. We can know that
 

547
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,990
talked about yesterday. We can know that
this is now support. Had good earnings

548
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000
this is now support. Had good earnings
 

549
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,990
this is now support. Had good earnings
yesterday, but uh obviously they didn't

550
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
yesterday, but uh obviously they didn't
 

551
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,829
yesterday, but uh obviously they didn't
like the guidance. So, there's a big

552
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:19,839
like the guidance. So, there's a big
 

553
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,910
like the guidance. So, there's a big
blowout on there and then Tim Cook

554
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920
blowout on there and then Tim Cook
 

555
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,269
blowout on there and then Tim Cook
probably opened his mouth. I haven't

556
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
probably opened his mouth. I haven't
 

557
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,389
probably opened his mouth. I haven't
didn't watch the guidance, but I'd

558
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
didn't watch the guidance, but I'd
 

559
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,990
didn't watch the guidance, but I'd
imagine open his mouth and we get it all

560
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
imagine open his mouth and we get it all
 

561
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,509
imagine open his mouth and we get it all
back and we're just dancing in that

562
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:27,519
back and we're just dancing in that
 

563
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,350
back and we're just dancing in that
range. Nothing's actually changed there

564
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
range. Nothing's actually changed there
 

565
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,150
range. Nothing's actually changed there
on Apple opening up flat. Uh Amazon is

566
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160
on Apple opening up flat. Uh Amazon is
 

567
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,750
on Apple opening up flat. Uh Amazon is
on a gap down. All right, you can see

568
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:33,760
on a gap down. All right, you can see
 

569
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,670
on a gap down. All right, you can see
this key pivot here. This is its key

570
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,680
this key pivot here. This is its key
 

571
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,710
this key pivot here. This is its key
area to hold right now on Amazon. It's a

572
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:38,720
area to hold right now on Amazon. It's a
 

573
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,629
area to hold right now on Amazon. It's a
big drive out. It is possible if we

574
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
big drive out. It is possible if we
 

575
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,990
big drive out. It is possible if we
start snapping under this. All right,

576
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,000
start snapping under this. All right,
 

577
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,430
start snapping under this. All right,
we're building liquidity. It can get

578
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:43,440
we're building liquidity. It can get
 

579
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,710
we're building liquidity. It can get
weak, might drag the market down. Goo

580
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720
weak, might drag the market down. Goo
 

581
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,230
weak, might drag the market down. Goo
gapping down as well. Same kind of

582
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
gapping down as well. Same kind of
 

583
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,990
gapping down as well. Same kind of
story. There's your liquidity build. If

584
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
story. There's your liquidity build. If
 

585
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,150
story. There's your liquidity build. If
we start losing these areas, right,

586
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160
we start losing these areas, right,
 

587
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,230
we start losing these areas, right,
here's your right shoulder. Left right

588
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240
here's your right shoulder. Left right
 

589
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,590
here's your right shoulder. Left right
shoulder will be built in here. Sorry.

590
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
shoulder will be built in here. Sorry.
 

591
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,430
shoulder will be built in here. Sorry.
If we lose that, that's where weakness

592
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,440
If we lose that, that's where weakness
 

593
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,829
If we lose that, that's where weakness
will come. Uh Meta continues to be

594
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
will come. Uh Meta continues to be
 

595
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,509
will come. Uh Meta continues to be
strong, I would imagine. Yeah. So, a

596
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:01,519
strong, I would imagine. Yeah. So, a
 

597
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,189
strong, I would imagine. Yeah. So, a
slight gap down, but again, we are just

598
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
slight gap down, but again, we are just
 

599
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,870
slight gap down, but again, we are just
in a range here at Meta. Remember, I'm

600
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
in a range here at Meta. Remember, I'm
 

601
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,670
in a range here at Meta. Remember, I'm
long meta up like 25% on this now. So,

602
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:07,680
long meta up like 25% on this now. So,
 

603
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,189
long meta up like 25% on this now. So,
just looking to see if we can fill up

604
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199
just looking to see if we can fill up
 

605
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,110
just looking to see if we can fill up
into there and I'll probably lock in

606
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
into there and I'll probably lock in
 

607
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,790
into there and I'll probably lock in
most of the rest of my profit.

608
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:12,800
most of the rest of my profit.
 

609
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,150
most of the rest of my profit.
Microsoft. All right, that is nasty.

610
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
Microsoft. All right, that is nasty.
 

611
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,790
Microsoft. All right, that is nasty.
That is a nasty one. All right, here's

612
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
That is a nasty one. All right, here's
 

613
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,110
That is a nasty one. All right, here's
failure to reclaim of the highs and

614
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,120
failure to reclaim of the highs and
 

615
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,030
failure to reclaim of the highs and
there's the giant sell. So, Microsoft

616
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
there's the giant sell. So, Microsoft
 

617
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,470
there's the giant sell. So, Microsoft
really stuck in this pivot. You'd be

618
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
really stuck in this pivot. You'd be
 

619
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,150
really stuck in this pivot. You'd be
watching 39s, so 40s to 50s really for a

620
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160
watching 39s, so 40s to 50s really for a
 

621
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,230
watching 39s, so 40s to 50s really for a
resell on Microsoft. I would imagine

622
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
resell on Microsoft. I would imagine
 

623
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,870
resell on Microsoft. I would imagine
even if you you sell that and you cover

624
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:32,880
even if you you sell that and you cover
 

625
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,550
even if you you sell that and you cover
some into the lows and then wait to see

626
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560
some into the lows and then wait to see
 

627
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,150
some into the lows and then wait to see
if you get underneath it. If it starts

628
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
if you get underneath it. If it starts
 

629
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,870
if you get underneath it. If it starts
reclaiming 50s, I wouldn't be risk off.

630
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:38,880
reclaiming 50s, I wouldn't be risk off.
 

631
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,350
reclaiming 50s, I wouldn't be risk off.
I'd say it's possible for a squeeze.

632
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360
I'd say it's possible for a squeeze.
 

633
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,430
I'd say it's possible for a squeeze.
Nvidia gap down as well, but that is

634
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:43,440
Nvidia gap down as well, but that is
 

635
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,509
Nvidia gap down as well, but that is
very messy in its range, but holding up

636
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
very messy in its range, but holding up
 

637
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,230
very messy in its range, but holding up
pretty well right now.

638
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,240
pretty well right now.
 

639
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,470
pretty well right now.
Tesla trying to find a bid. Zoom out of

640
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
Tesla trying to find a bid. Zoom out of
 

641
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,910
Tesla trying to find a bid. Zoom out of
this a little bit. This has been messy

642
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:51,920
this a little bit. This has been messy
 

643
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,430
this a little bit. This has been messy
for the last week or two. Yeah, it

644
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
for the last week or two. Yeah, it
 

645
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,790
for the last week or two. Yeah, it
continues to be a bit of a mess. So,

646
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
continues to be a bit of a mess. So,
 

647
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,389
continues to be a bit of a mess. So,
back to the bottom side of its range.

648
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
back to the bottom side of its range.
 

649
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,590
back to the bottom side of its range.
There you go. That's the range since the

650
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,600
There you go. That's the range since the
 

651
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,670
There you go. That's the range since the
whole of this month on Tesla. All right,

652
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:01,680
whole of this month on Tesla. All right,
 

653
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,750
whole of this month on Tesla. All right,
it's just in a range until it finds

654
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:03,760
it's just in a range until it finds
 

655
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,710
it's just in a range until it finds
acceptance outside of the range. There

656
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
acceptance outside of the range. There
 

657
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,230
acceptance outside of the range. There
will be no continuation. So, you'd be

658
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:08,240
will be no continuation. So, you'd be
 

659
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,990
will be no continuation. So, you'd be
playing edges unless we break out and

660
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000
playing edges unless we break out and
 

661
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,949
playing edges unless we break out and
retest. And the mag as a whole

662
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959

 

663
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,629

doesn't look too good, does it? It just

664
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:18,639
doesn't look too good, does it? It just
 

665
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,389
doesn't look too good, does it? It just
looks a little bit messy since that

666
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
looks a little bit messy since that
 

667
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,310
looks a little bit messy since that
Wednesday pivot. Okay, let's have a look

668
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
Wednesday pivot. Okay, let's have a look
 

669
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,910
Wednesday pivot. Okay, let's have a look
just at some broader names quickly.

670
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:23,920
just at some broader names quickly.
 

671
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,670
just at some broader names quickly.
Oracle trying to find a bid, but again

672
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:25,680
Oracle trying to find a bid, but again
 

673
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,910
Oracle trying to find a bid, but again
underneath that range. Any back test of

674
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:27,920
underneath that range. Any back test of
 

675
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,389
underneath that range. Any back test of
70 to 72, I'd expect them to try and

676
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399
70 to 72, I'd expect them to try and
 

677
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,069
70 to 72, I'd expect them to try and
sell Oracle. Uh Infl

678
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
sell Oracle. Uh Infl
 

679
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,590
sell Oracle. Uh Infl
coming back down to its pivot. So let's

680
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
coming back down to its pivot. So let's
 

681
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,189
coming back down to its pivot. So let's
see if they rebid that or if we just get

682
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
see if they rebid that or if we just get
 

683
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,750
see if they rebid that or if we just get
a collapse. Looks like very possible for

684
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:39,760
a collapse. Looks like very possible for
 

685
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,389
a collapse. Looks like very possible for
a collapse here

686
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,399
a collapse here
 

687
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,230
a collapse here
and then we might get the 70s on Netflix

688
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
and then we might get the 70s on Netflix
 

689
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,230
and then we might get the 70s on Netflix
that we talked about. AMD, yeah, pulling

690
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
that we talked about. AMD, yeah, pulling
 

691
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,310
that we talked about. AMD, yeah, pulling
back after that huge drive out the last

692
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,320
back after that huge drive out the last
 

693
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,590
back after that huge drive out the last
few weeks. So it's going to come back

694
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
few weeks. So it's going to come back
 

695
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,670
few weeks. So it's going to come back
and back test this kind of area here,

696
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680
and back test this kind of area here,
 

697
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,430
and back test this kind of area here,
right? That's the expectation. Remember

698
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
right? That's the expectation. Remember
 

699
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,670
right? That's the expectation. Remember
breakout pullback. Question is then do

700
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
breakout pullback. Question is then do
 

701
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,230
breakout pullback. Question is then do
they rebid not if the market's weak they

702
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
they rebid not if the market's weak they
 

703
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,230
they rebid not if the market's weak they
won't.

704
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,240
won't.
 

705
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,710
won't.
Okay. So bias for today neutral bias in

706
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
Okay. So bias for today neutral bias in
 

707
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,870
Okay. So bias for today neutral bias in
a range

708
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
a range
 

709
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,310
a range
until we see otherwise. And uh remember

710
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,320
until we see otherwise. And uh remember
 

711
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,790
until we see otherwise. And uh remember
seven. What did I say? I'm going to have

712
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
seven. What did I say? I'm going to have
 

713
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,949
seven. What did I say? I'm going to have
to have a look at this again. Get this

714
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:12,959
to have a look at this again. Get this
 

715
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,269
to have a look at this again. Get this
off.

716
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,279
off.
 

717
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,590
off.
We will be watching trigger points of

718
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,600
We will be watching trigger points of
 

719
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,829
We will be watching trigger points of
900s and sort of 850s. 900s and 850s. So

720
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:21,839
900s and sort of 850s. 900s and 850s. So
 

721
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,910
900s and sort of 850s. 900s and 850s. So
there's the 800s right now. Is it 850s?

722
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
there's the 800s right now. Is it 850s?
 

723
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,910
there's the 800s right now. Is it 850s?
Just check this. 830s.

724
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:27,920

 

725
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,910

Yeah, there or thereabouts. What is this

726
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
Yeah, there or thereabouts. What is this
 

727
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:37,269
Yeah, there or thereabouts. What is this
level? No, don't need you.

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:30,400

 

769
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,150

Get my charts ready on Ninja. Making

770
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,160
Get my charts ready on Ninja. Making
 

771
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:43,430
Get my charts ready on Ninja. Making
sure they're all lined up. Okay,

772
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440

 

773
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,190

it's probably no trade to start the day

774
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
it's probably no trade to start the day
 

775
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,789
it's probably no trade to start the day
for me today. probably just going to let

776
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
for me today. probably just going to let
 

777
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,190
for me today. probably just going to let
this uh play out and do what it is it

778
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,200
this uh play out and do what it is it
 

779
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,669
this uh play out and do what it is it
needs to do

780
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:51,679
needs to do
 

781
00:17:51,679 --> 00:18:01,909
needs to do
and we will go from there.

782
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919

 

783
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,909

Okay, here's the morning drive. Let's

784
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:03,919
Okay, here's the morning drive. Let's
 

785
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,750
Okay, here's the morning drive. Let's
see how we come up into these areas.

786
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
see how we come up into these areas.
 

787
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,310
see how we come up into these areas.
These 900s, remember key

788
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320

 

789
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:22,150

these 900s key

790
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,160

 

791
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,990

into this sort of old supply block where

792
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
into this sort of old supply block where
 

793
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,230
into this sort of old supply block where
we got a bit stuck and we get thin

794
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,240
we got a bit stuck and we get thin
 

795
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,909
we got a bit stuck and we get thin
through there. I can we can think about

796
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:27,919
through there. I can we can think about
 

797
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,669
through there. I can we can think about
GlobeEx, but I'm going to wait to see if

798
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
GlobeEx, but I'm going to wait to see if
 

799
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,590
GlobeEx, but I'm going to wait to see if
we get acceptance above all of this.

800
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:33,600
we get acceptance above all of this.
 

801
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,909
we get acceptance above all of this.
Letting this do what it wants.

802
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:39,919

 

803
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,430

Spy coming up trying to fill its gap

804
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
Spy coming up trying to fill its gap
 

805
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,669
Spy coming up trying to fill its gap
right now. Q's trying to do the same big

806
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:45,679
right now. Q's trying to do the same big
 

807
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,150
right now. Q's trying to do the same big
drive. Gap fills all the way up here.

808
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,160
drive. Gap fills all the way up here.
 

809
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,510
drive. Gap fills all the way up here.
Remember this yellow line would be gap

810
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
Remember this yellow line would be gap
 

811
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,950
Remember this yellow line would be gap
fill. This is GlobeEx. So bunch of

812
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:50,960
fill. This is GlobeEx. So bunch of
 

813
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,390
fill. This is GlobeEx. So bunch of
liquidity up here. Remember this is the

814
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
liquidity up here. Remember this is the
 

815
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,070
liquidity up here. Remember this is the
edge where we talked about we kept

816
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,080
edge where we talked about we kept
 

817
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,190
edge where we talked about we kept
getting stuck in. So if we get

818
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
getting stuck in. So if we get
 

819
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,029
getting stuck in. So if we get
acceptance over all of this, if we pull

820
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
acceptance over all of this, if we pull
 

821
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,549
acceptance over all of this, if we pull
back and find acceptance over all of

822
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
back and find acceptance over all of
 

823
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,789
back and find acceptance over all of
this, then we can expect 26,000.

824
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:00,799
this, then we can expect 26,000.
 

825
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,230
this, then we can expect 26,000.
Otherwise, this can be a failed look

826
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,240
Otherwise, this can be a failed look
 

827
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,150
Otherwise, this can be a failed look
above. Again, this is why I don't want

828
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,160
above. Again, this is why I don't want
 

829
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,590
above. Again, this is why I don't want
to trade in this range that we're in at

830
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:05,600
to trade in this range that we're in at
 

831
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,029
to trade in this range that we're in at
the moment. I want to let this market

832
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039
the moment. I want to let this market
 

833
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,430
the moment. I want to let this market
make its decision.

834
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:09,440
make its decision.
 

835
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,190
make its decision.
Let market make the decision. So failed

836
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
Let market make the decision. So failed
 

837
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,549
Let market make the decision. So failed

see the choppiness to start the day

844
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:16,960
see the choppiness to start the day
 

845
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,470

Another 250 point day. We We'll see. We
 

849
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,190
Another 250 point day. We We'll see. We
got a few of those yesterday, didn't we?

850
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
got a few of those yesterday, didn't we?
 

851

00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:26,960
Two. So, if you're joining me new on
 

853
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,870
Two. So, if you're joining me new on
stream today, we had two 250 point

854
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880
stream today, we had two 250 point
 

855
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,230

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
Um, but we're end of week when lowering
 

859
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,870
Um, but we're end of week when lowering
the expectations. We did just wash like

860
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,880
the expectations. We did just wash like
 

861
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,830
the expectations. We did just wash like
quite a few stops here above the uh 904

862
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:39,840
quite a few stops here above the uh 904
 

863
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,510
quite a few stops here above the uh 904
90s.

So, we'll see. I'll give you a readout

866
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,039
So, we'll see. I'll give you a readout
 

867
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,750
So, we'll see. I'll give you a readout
on the MAC. Tesla 2.66% up. That's then

868
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760
on the MAC. Tesla 2.66% up. That's then
 

869
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,909
on the MAC. Tesla 2.66% up. That's then
followed by Microsoft half a percent up.

870
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
followed by Microsoft half a percent up.
 

871

Remember, this is the area of the other

882
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:03,919
Remember, this is the area of the other
 

883
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,110
Remember, this is the area of the other
side of the range. So, we've already

884
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,120
side of the range. So, we've already
 

885
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,390
side of the range. So, we've already
traded the range we talked about

886
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:06,400
traded the range we talked about
 

887
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,230
traded the range we talked about
pre-market. Sort of 825s up to the 900s.

888
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,240
pre-market. Sort of 825s up to the 900s.
 

889
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,070
pre-market. Sort of 825s up to the 900s.
Remember, this is our no trade zone. We

890
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,080
Remember, this is our no trade zone. We
 

891
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,990
Remember, this is our no trade zone. We
don't want to get stuck in here. I don't

892
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,000
don't want to get stuck in here. I don't
 

893
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,430
don't want to get stuck in here. I don't
want to trade these edges. I don't like

894
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,440
want to trade these edges. I don't like
 

895
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,990
want to trade these edges. I don't like
trading edges. If that's a bit of you,

896
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,000
trading edges. If that's a bit of you,
 

897
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,190
trading edges. If that's a bit of you,
for sure, go for it. You're talking

898
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,200
for sure, go for it. You're talking
 

899
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,430
for sure, go for it. You're talking
about 100 point rippers there out the

900
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,440
about 100 point rippers there out the
 

901
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,909
about 100 point rippers there out the
gate. Watch your ATR. Okay. Watch your

902
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919
gate. Watch your ATR. Okay. Watch your
 

903
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,789
gate. Watch your ATR. Okay. Watch your
ATR.

904
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:26,799
ATR.
 

905
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,470
ATR.
I'm going to wait for us to move outside

906
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:28,480
I'm going to wait for us to move outside
 

907
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,990
I'm going to wait for us to move outside
of here. In fact, I'm going to remove

908
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,000
of here. In fact, I'm going to remove
 

909
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,029
of here. In fact, I'm going to remove
that and just watch this. Right. So, the

910
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:33,039
that and just watch this. Right. So, the
 

911
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,789
that and just watch this. Right. So, the
range we talked about pre-market already

912
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:34,799
range we talked about pre-market already
 

913
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,549
range we talked about pre-market already
come into effect. Right. We keep holding

914
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559
come into effect. Right. We keep holding
 

915
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,270
come into effect. Right. We keep holding
around these sort of 800s, 825s and we

916
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,280
around these sort of 800s, 825s and we
 

917
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,549
around these sort of 800s, 825s and we
come up to the 900s and we're not

918
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559
come up to the 900s and we're not
 

919
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,710
come up to the 900s and we're not
finding follow through over 900. So this

920
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,720
finding follow through over 900. So this
 

921
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,510
finding follow through over 900. So this
is our avoiding zone right now. This is

922
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520
is our avoiding zone right now. This is
 

923
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,350
is our avoiding zone right now. This is
why we're leaving this zone alone.

924
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,360

 

925
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,510

VIX finding a bit of a bid in an old

926
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
VIX finding a bit of a bid in an old
 

927
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,669
VIX finding a bit of a bid in an old
pivot here. It's got gap fill potential

928
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
pivot here. It's got gap fill potential
 

929
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,870
pivot here. It's got gap fill potential
below as well. If it loses this pivot,

930
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:58,880
below as well. If it loses this pivot,
 

931
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,350
below as well. If it loses this pivot,
gap fill on VIX would be 1687. And that

932
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,360
gap fill on VIX would be 1687. And that
 

933
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,870
gap fill on VIX would be 1687. And that
will obviously be very bullish for the

934
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:02,880
will obviously be very bullish for the
 

935
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,870
will obviously be very bullish for the
market if the VIX does want to do that

936
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
market if the VIX does want to do that
 

937
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,710
market if the VIX does want to do that
gap though.

938
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
gap though.
 

939
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,549
gap though.
Okay, back up to current value area

940
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:08,559
Okay, back up to current value area
 

941
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,230
Okay, back up to current value area
high, previous day point of control. If

942
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:10,240
high, previous day point of control. If
 

943
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,669
high, previous day point of control. If
they resell this, there's probably a

944
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:11,679
they resell this, there's probably a
 

945
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,909
they resell this, there's probably a
retest down towards the 800s again,

946
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:13,919
retest down towards the 800s again,
 

947
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,470
retest down towards the 800s again,
which is coming now.

948
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480
which is coming now.
 

949
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,750
which is coming now.
So, let's see if they give follow

950
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:17,760
So, let's see if they give follow
 

951
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,830
So, let's see if they give follow
through now underneath this. Looking for

952
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,840
through now underneath this. Looking for
 

953
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,549
through now underneath this. Looking for
this to see if they want to give follow

954
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:22,559
this to see if they want to give follow
 

955
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,190
this to see if they want to give follow
through underneath the 800s, underneath

956
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,200
through underneath the 800s, underneath
 

957
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,990
through underneath the 800s, underneath
820s to come back down into previous

958
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,000
820s to come back down into previous
 

959
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,510
820s to come back down into previous
week close. That's what we're waiting to

960
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520
week close. That's what we're waiting to
 

961
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,950
week close. That's what we're waiting to
see if we're going to see that follow

962
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960
see if we're going to see that follow
 

963
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,190
see if we're going to see that follow
through. Now,

964
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,200
through. Now,
 

965
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,710
through. Now,
don't want to trade in this range. So,

966
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
don't want to trade in this range. So,
 

967
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,070
don't want to trade in this range. So,
I'm going to wait either side. I'm

968
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,080
I'm going to wait either side. I'm
 

969
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,750
I'm going to wait either side. I'm
willing to play above this long and I'm

970
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:37,760
willing to play above this long and I'm
 

971
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,750
willing to play above this long and I'm
willing to to play below all of this

972
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:39,760
willing to to play below all of this
 

973
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,230
willing to to play below all of this
short if they base and retest the areas.

974
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
short if they base and retest the areas.
 

975
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,110
short if they base and retest the areas.
I'm not willing to play in between this.

976
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,120
I'm not willing to play in between this.
 

977
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,070
I'm not willing to play in between this.
Right. Not for me. That's not a trade

978
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,080
Right. Not for me. That's not a trade
 

979
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,390
Right. Not for me. That's not a trade
for me. Maybe it's a trade for you that

980
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
for me. Maybe it's a trade for you that
 

981
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,310
for me. Maybe it's a trade for you that
you guys like.

982
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,320

 

983
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,149

Back to the 900s then. They're still

984
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:56,159
Back to the 900s then. They're still
 

985
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,190
Back to the 900s then. They're still
chopping around.

986
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,200
chopping around.
 

987
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,029
chopping around.
Pop, drop, drop, pop. Yeah, both both

988
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:01,039
Pop, drop, drop, pop. Yeah, both both
 

989

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:02,960
sides right now, Josh. Both sides.
 

991
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,310
sides right now, Josh. Both sides.
They're just testing each side of this

992
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:04,320
They're just testing each side of this
 

993
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,549
They're just testing each side of this
range. Very, very tricky area. Like we

994
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
range. Very, very tricky area. Like we
 

995
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,029
range. Very, very tricky area. Like we
went over premarket. It's a huge area

996
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
went over premarket. It's a huge area
 

997
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,070
went over premarket. It's a huge area
dating back six weeks. Six weeks. You

998
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,080
dating back six weeks. Six weeks. You
 

999
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,270
dating back six weeks. Six weeks. You
got to understand that. Six weeks of uh

1000
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,280
got to understand that. Six weeks of uh
 

1001
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,950
got to understand that. Six weeks of uh
liquidity been built up around this

liquidity been built up around this
 

1003

All right, back to these 900s. Remember,
we keep failing over these 900s for now.

1028
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:02,880
we keep failing over these 900s for now.
 

1029
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,190
we keep failing over these 900s for now.
So, it's still inside the dance. 100

1030
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,200
So, it's still inside the dance. 100
 

1031
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,870
So, it's still inside the dance. 100
point dance here.

1032
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:08,880

 

1033
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,470

100 point dance here.

1034
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:12,480
100 point dance here.
 

1035
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,909
100 point dance here.
So, what I was saying, folks, lower your

1036
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:13,919
So, what I was saying, folks, lower your
 

1037
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,870
So, what I was saying, folks, lower your
expectations today. We had a fantastic

1038
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:16,880
expectations today. We had a fantastic
 

1039
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,510
expectations today. We had a fantastic
day yesterday. We had a fantastic week.

1040
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:19,520
day yesterday. We had a fantastic week.
 

1041
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,270
day yesterday. We had a fantastic week.
100 point shop is crazy. It is indeed,

1042
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,280
100 point shop is crazy. It is indeed,
 

1043
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,190
100 point shop is crazy. It is indeed,
isn't it? Remember it is end of the week

1044
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,200
isn't it? Remember it is end of the week
 

1045
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,350
isn't it? Remember it is end of the week
and end of the month. All right? So,

1046
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,360
and end of the month. All right? So,
 

1047
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,430
and end of the month. All right? So,
we'll have to see how they position.

1048
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:29,440

 

1049
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,070

It's very possible uh that they if they

1050
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,080
It's very possible uh that they if they
 

1051
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,950
It's very possible uh that they if they
can get over the 900s and base they can

1052
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:34,960
can get over the 900s and base they can
 

1053
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,430
can get over the 900s and base they can
lift it like I said 26,000 and even

1054
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:37,440
lift it like I said 26,000 and even
 

1055
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,070
lift it like I said 26,000 and even
26,100 and then I expect sellers

1056
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,080
26,100 and then I expect sellers
 

1057
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,710
26,100 and then I expect sellers
probably come in up there. If we can

1058
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
probably come in up there. If we can
 

1059
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,990
probably come in up there. If we can
come underneath sort of the 825s and

1060
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,000
come underneath sort of the 825s and
 

1061
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,830
come underneath sort of the 825s and
base under that start to reject that

1062
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:47,840
base under that start to reject that
 

1063
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,710
base under that start to reject that
then that rotation down to 700 and even

1064
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:50,720
then that rotation down to 700 and even
 

1065
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,830
then that rotation down to 700 and even
5 575 is possible. So don't want to play

1066
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:53,840
5 575 is possible. So don't want to play
 

1067
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,510
5 575 is possible. So don't want to play
in here. Want them to make their

1068
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:55,520
in here. Want them to make their
 

1069
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,350
in here. Want them to make their
decision and we can join afterwards.

1070
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,360
decision and we can join afterwards.
 

1071
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,710
decision and we can join afterwards.
Understanding the conditions is so

1072
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:58,720
Understanding the conditions is so
 

1073
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,990
Understanding the conditions is so
important. Which days I want to attack

1074
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
important. Which days I want to attack
 

1075
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,990
important. Which days I want to attack
the open, which days I don't. Yesterday

1076
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,000
the open, which days I don't. Yesterday
 

1077
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,390
the open, which days I don't. Yesterday
once we washed, we got in very quickly.

1078
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,400
once we washed, we got in very quickly.
 

1079
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,470
once we washed, we got in very quickly.
I think it was 3, four, five minutes in

1080
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:06,480
I think it was 3, four, five minutes in
 

1081
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,590
I think it was 3, four, five minutes in
yesterday and we were ready to go.

1082
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:11,600

 

1083
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,430

Not today. That's not the type of market

1084
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:13,440
Not today. That's not the type of market
 

1085
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,990
Not today. That's not the type of market
condition we have today.

1086
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
condition we have today.
 

1087
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,909
condition we have today.

1091
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,190

The range is nasty for a long time.

1092
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,200
The range is nasty for a long time.
 

1093
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,190
The range is nasty for a long time.
Yeah, I I agree, Mark Hammond. I agree.

Ballingers as well. Like if you just
 

1101
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,830
Ballingers as well. Like if you just
zoom out on a daily chart, go back to

1102
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:37,840
zoom out on a daily chart, go back to
 

1103
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,430
zoom out on a daily chart, go back to
the beginning of November. In fact, you

1104
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,440
the beginning of November. In fact, you
 

1105
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,190
the beginning of November. In fact, you
can go back beyond that. Go back all the

1106
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200
can go back beyond that. Go back all the
 

1107
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,710
can go back beyond that. Go back all the
way to uh the the first week of October.

1108
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:44,720
way to uh the the first week of October.
 

1109
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,590
way to uh the the first week of October.
Go back to sort of October, what's this?

1110
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:47,600
Go back to sort of October, what's this?
 

1111
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,669
Go back to sort of October, what's this?
The 10th, right? We're still dancing

1112
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:49,679
The 10th, right? We're still dancing
 

1113
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,830
The 10th, right? We're still dancing
around that same kind of level. It's a

1114
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:51,840
around that same kind of level. It's a
 

1115
00:24:51,840 --> 00:25:04,549
around that same kind of level. It's a
long time that we've been around here.

1116
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:04,559

 

1117
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,149

I still can't get through the 900s.

1118
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:08,159
I still can't get through the 900s.
 

1119
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,750
I still can't get through the 900s.
Let's put some volume on here. Now we

1120
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:09,760
Let's put some volume on here. Now we
 

1121
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,549
Let's put some volume on here. Now we
can see what we're playing with on this

1122
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:12,559
can see what we're playing with on this
 

1123
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,549
can see what we're playing with on this
opening print.

1124
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:14,559
opening print.
 

1125
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,830
opening print.
Right. So 900's still being sold.

1126
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:17,840
Right. So 900's still being sold.
 

1127
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,909
Right. So 900's still being sold.
And back down to the other side we come.

1128
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:19,919
And back down to the other side we come.
 

1129
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,830
And back down to the other side we come.
And if they don't bid this, then we're

1130
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:21,840
And if they don't bid this, then we're
 

1131
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,070
And if they don't bid this, then we're
looking for the fail underneath the 825s

1132
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,080
looking for the fail underneath the 825s
 

1133
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,070
looking for the fail underneath the 825s
or 830s. If they rebid this, then we're

1134
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,080
or 830s. If they rebid this, then we're
 

1135
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,590
or 830s. If they rebid this, then we're
going to go all the way back up again.

1136
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:27,600
going to go all the way back up again.
 

1137
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,630
going to go all the way back up again.
It's the rotation. Fun, fun, fun,

1138
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:32,640
It's the rotation. Fun, fun, fun,
 

1139
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,510
It's the rotation. Fun, fun, fun,

fun, fun. This is the market we're in.
We have to be patient. You do not want

1142
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:37,279
We have to be patient. You do not want
 

1143
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:48,549
We have to be patient. You do not want
to front run this.

1144
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:48,559

 

1145
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,470

Back up we go.

1146
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:52,480

 

1147
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,029

So, if you're a range trader, you should

1148
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:55,039
So, if you're a range trader, you should
 

1149
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,789
So, if you're a range trader, you should
be uh really enjoying yourself this

far beyond my appetite.

1160
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,000

 

1161
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,149

Okay, back up towards the sort of 900

1162
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159
Okay, back up towards the sort of 900
 

1163
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,950
Okay, back up towards the sort of 900
area again.

1164
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:20,960

 

1165
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,190

I'll say uh buyers keep getting stuck up

1166
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,200
I'll say uh buyers keep getting stuck up
 

1167
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,190
I'll say uh buyers keep getting stuck up
here into into around here. No

1168
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:25,200
here into into around here. No
 

1169
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,230
here into into around here. No
acceptance above it yet.

1170
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,240
acceptance above it yet.
 

1171
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,750
acceptance above it yet.
See if they lift. They're going to base

1172
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:29,760
See if they lift. They're going to base
 

1173
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,750
See if they lift. They're going to base
above here. Maybe there's a gap fill on

1174
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:31,760
above here. Maybe there's a gap fill on
 

1175
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,070
above here. Maybe there's a gap fill on
the spy. They can get above previous day

1176
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,080
the spy. They can get above previous day
 

1177
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,310
the spy. They can get above previous day
value area very high. Maybe maybe we get

1178
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:36,320
value area very high. Maybe maybe we get
 

1179
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,630
value area very high. Maybe maybe we get
this move here. We got to we're going to

1180
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:38,640
this move here. We got to we're going to
 

1181
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,029
this move here. We got to we're going to
have to see it do something like this.

1182
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:41,039
have to see it do something like this.
 

1183
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,870
have to see it do something like this.
And I would be taking partials on the

1184
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:42,880
And I would be taking partials on the
 

1185
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,789
And I would be taking partials on the
way. If you if we're going to see this

1186
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:44,799
way. If you if we're going to see this
 

1187
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,110
way. If you if we're going to see this
in a base above, you want to be very

1188
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,120
in a base above, you want to be very
 

1189
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,549
in a base above, you want to be very
very very careful.

1190
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:50,559
very very careful.
 

1191
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,750
very very careful.
And it's not something you want to

1192
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:51,760
And it's not something you want to
 

1193
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,510
And it's not something you want to
oversize in. It was not something you

1194
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:53,520
oversize in. It was not something you
 

1195
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,350
oversize in. It was not something you
want to add to a loser in. It is nothing

1196
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,360
want to add to a loser in. It is nothing
 

1197
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:02,149
want to add to a loser in. It is nothing
like that. Still no base above.

1198
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:02,159

 

1199
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,190

If I walk away go 900s. Yeah.

1200
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,200
If I walk away go 900s. Yeah.
 

1201
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,549
If I walk away go 900s. Yeah.
Or maybe I'll walk away and I'll come

1202
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:06,559
Or maybe I'll walk away and I'll come
 

1203
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,549
Or maybe I'll walk away and I'll come
back and it'll be 600 straight away. Who

1204
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:08,559
back and it'll be 600 straight away. Who
 

1205
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,669
back and it'll be 600 straight away. Who
knows? Who bloody knows, right? Who

1206
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:11,679
knows? Who bloody knows, right? Who
 

1207
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,870
knows? Who bloody knows, right? Who
knows?

1208
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:14,880

 

1209
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,110

After how they treated me yesterday, the

1210
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,120
After how they treated me yesterday, the
 

1211
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,070
After how they treated me yesterday, the
dirty dirty buggers yesterday letting me

1212
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,080
dirty dirty buggers yesterday letting me
 

1213
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,470
dirty dirty buggers yesterday letting me
uh go to the toilet and have back and

1214
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:22,480
uh go to the toilet and have back and
 

1215
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,269
uh go to the toilet and have back and
come back and you guys get a 250 point

1216
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:25,279
come back and you guys get a 250 point
 

1217
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,430
come back and you guys get a 250 point
move. It was actually more like a 400

1218
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:27,440
move. It was actually more like a 400
 

1219
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,549
move. It was actually more like a 400
point move if you held it to the end of

1220
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:28,559
point move if you held it to the end of
 

1221
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,990
point move if you held it to the end of
the day. Okay, here's the break above.

1222
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,000
the day. Okay, here's the break above.
 

1223
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,990
the day. Okay, here's the break above.
Here's the 920s. Let's see if they pull

1224
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,000
Here's the 920s. Let's see if they pull
 

1225
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,750
Here's the 920s. Let's see if they pull
back and hold now.

1226
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:33,760
back and hold now.
 

1227
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,750
back and hold now.
And if we can lift to 26,000.

1228
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:37,760
And if we can lift to 26,000.
 

1229
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,590
And if we can lift to 26,000.
Yes, going for that gap fill. Spy going

1230
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:39,600
Yes, going for that gap fill. Spy going
 

1231
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,269
Yes, going for that gap fill. Spy going
for that gap fill. Just just be aware of

1232
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:41,279
for that gap fill. Just just be aware of
 

1233
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,750
for that gap fill. Just just be aware of
this. We might not make 26,000 if the

1234
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:43,760
this. We might not make 26,000 if the
 

1235
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,590
this. We might not make 26,000 if the
obligation is for spy to fill its gap

1236
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:45,600
obligation is for spy to fill its gap
 

1237
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,390
obligation is for spy to fill its gap
and then fail. So you're looking for 94s

1238
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:48,400
and then fail. So you're looking for 94s
 

1239
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,830
and then fail. So you're looking for 94s
on the spiders if you're playing the

1240
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:49,840
on the spiders if you're playing the
 

1241
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:58,630
on the spiders if you're playing the
ETFs.

1242
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:58,640

 

1243
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,070

So 9350s now on the ETFs. you're looking

1244
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,080
So 9350s now on the ETFs. you're looking
 

1245
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,230
So 9350s now on the ETFs. you're looking
for 94s, I'd take absolutely take a

1246
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:04,240
for 94s, I'd take absolutely take a
 

1247
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,149
for 94s, I'd take absolutely take a
partial if you are long into that. This

1248
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:06,159
partial if you are long into that. This
 

1249
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,070
partial if you are long into that. This
dip's going to have to hold these 900s

1250
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,080
dip's going to have to hold these 900s
 

1251
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,110
dip's going to have to hold these 900s
or 890s. I would not hold beyond that.

1252
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,120
or 890s. I would not hold beyond that.
 

1253
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,470
or 890s. I would not hold beyond that.
If it's not willing to hold that, you

1254
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:12,480
If it's not willing to hold that, you
 

1255
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,310
If it's not willing to hold that, you
want to be out. You do not want to be

1256
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:14,320
want to be out. You do not want to be
 

1257
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,549
want to be out. You do not want to be
caught in a flush right back down the

1258
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:16,559
caught in a flush right back down the
 

1259
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,029
caught in a flush right back down the
820s. All right, so long from here. See

1260
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:19,039
820s. All right, so long from here. See
 

1261
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,350
820s. All right, so long from here. See
if we can get up into here. Watching the

1262
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360
if we can get up into here. Watching the
 

1263
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,430
if we can get up into here. Watching the
ES very closely. Gloex, this will be a

1264
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:23,440
ES very closely. Gloex, this will be a
 

1265
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,950
ES very closely. Gloex, this will be a
TP1, by the way, into 34s, 34s, 35s.

1266
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:28,960
TP1, by the way, into 34s, 34s, 35s.
 

1267
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,710
TP1, by the way, into 34s, 34s, 35s.
There's your TP1 pretty much hit. Don't

1268
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:30,720
There's your TP1 pretty much hit. Don't
 

1269
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,230
There's your TP1 pretty much hit. Don't
be a dick for a tick like we always talk

1270
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,240
be a dick for a tick like we always talk
 

1271
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,669
be a dick for a tick like we always talk
about. And let's see if we can lift up

1272
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:33,679
about. And let's see if we can lift up
 

1273
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,310
about. And let's see if we can lift up
to 26,000. So TP1 TP2.

1274
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,320
to 26,000. So TP1 TP2.
 

1275
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,470
to 26,000. So TP1 TP2.
Move your stop up now. Do not get caught

1276
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:40,480
Move your stop up now. Do not get caught
 

1277
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,630
Move your stop up now. Do not get caught
in this.

1278
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:42,640
in this.
 

1279
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,310
in this.
Right. You do not want it under here.

1280
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:44,320
Right. You do not want it under here.
 

1281
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,870
Right. You do not want it under here.
TP1 here. TP2 is up here. That'll be 100

1282
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:46,880
TP1 here. TP2 is up here. That'll be 100
 

1283
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,870
TP1 here. TP2 is up here. That'll be 100
pointer if we get it.

1284
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:50,880

 

1285
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,190

It goes spy. Very getting very very

1286
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,200
It goes spy. Very getting very very
 

1287
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,590
It goes spy. Very getting very very
close. Another 304 cents on spy will do

1288
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:55,600
close. Another 304 cents on spy will do
 

1289
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,190
close. Another 304 cents on spy will do
it.

1290
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,200
it.
 

1291
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,750
it.
I would move your stop now up. You don't

1292
00:28:59,750 --> 00:28:59,760
I would move your stop now up. You don't
 

1293
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,110
I would move your stop now up. You don't
actually have to. You can protect it

1294
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,120
actually have to. You can protect it
 

1295
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,630
actually have to. You can protect it
versus this, but it depends how much

1296
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:02,640
versus this, but it depends how much
 

1297
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,389
versus this, but it depends how much
size you've got. At least trim some on

1298
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:04,399
size you've got. At least trim some on
 

1299
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,990
size you've got. At least trim some on
that last push because you do not want

1300
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,000
that last push because you do not want
 

1301
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,029
that last push because you do not want
to get collapsed. If spy fills the gap,

1302
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:09,039
to get collapsed. If spy fills the gap,
 

1303
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,710
to get collapsed. If spy fills the gap,
if we do this and we fill the gap and do

1304
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:10,720
if we do this and we fill the gap and do
 

1305
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,149
if we do this and we fill the gap and do
that, you do not want to get collapsed

1306
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:12,159
that, you do not want to get collapsed
 

1307
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,549
that, you do not want to get collapsed
on. All right? You do not want to be

1308
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:14,559
on. All right? You do not want to be
 

1309
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,470
on. All right? You do not want to be
collapsed on.

1310
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,480

 

1311
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,110

Big sellers coming in here. Huge seller

1312
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,120
Big sellers coming in here. Huge seller
 

1313

Big sellers coming in here. Huge seller
just came in at 24. More sellers coming

just came in at 24. More sellers coming
 

1315
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,269
just came in at 24. More sellers coming
in at 33s. Right. Just be aware of that.

1316
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:27,279

That's some big big boy size.

1318

1319
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,230

So, we have an imbalance down to 900. I

1320
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,240
So, we have an imbalance down to 900. I
 

1321
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,510
So, we have an imbalance down to 900. I
will not let this come underneath.

00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:37,520
will not let this come underneath.
 

1323
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,950
will not let this come underneath.
Certainly don't want it underneath that

1324
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:38,960
Certainly don't want it underneath that
 

1325
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,269
Certainly don't want it underneath that
previous day value area high. We have

buyers join in on the tape at 95 and

buyers join in on the tape at 95 and
900s and someone's trying to join in at

900s and someone's trying to join in at
 

1331
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,630
900s and someone's trying to join in at
17s. Really don't want this to flush

1332
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:48,640
17s. Really don't want this to flush
 

1333
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,950
17s. Really don't want this to flush
much further down. Don't want to sit

1334
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:50,960
much further down. Don't want to sit
 

1335
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,230

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,030
they're bidding down there. So, still
into the edge of today's rotation. So,

1534
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,040
into the edge of today's rotation. So,
 

1535
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,550
into the edge of today's rotation. So,
right now 40s to 900s is the rotation.

1536
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:44,560
right now 40s to 900s is the rotation.

acceptance underneath that. We'll wait

1540
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:48,879
acceptance underneath that. We'll wait
 

1541
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,470
acceptance underneath that. We'll wait
to find if we can find acceptance

1542
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:50,480
to find if we can find acceptance
 

1543
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,190
to find if we can find acceptance
underneath that.

1544

Can have a look at the breadth. Let's

1562
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:16,400
Can have a look at the breadth. Let's
 

1563

healthcare, healthcare is the only one
 

1571
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,990
healthcare, healthcare is the only one
holding up right now, which is why it's

1572
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,000
holding up right now, which is why it's
 

1573
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,069
holding up right now, which is why it's
holding up ES pretty well. ES just held

1574
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:28,079
holding up ES pretty well. ES just held
 

1575
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,310
holding up ES pretty well. ES just held
a bid into its New York open there, as

1576
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:30,320
a bid into its New York open there, as
 

1577
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,069
a bid into its New York open there, as
did we. We didn't quite get down that

1578
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:32,079
did we. We didn't quite get down that
 

1579
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,430
did we. We didn't quite get down that
low. All right, so they're rebidding the

1580
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:33,440
low. All right, so they're rebidding the
 

1581
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,910
low. All right, so they're rebidding the
rotation. Back to 900. Still no trade.

1582
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:35,920
rotation. Back to 900. Still no trade.
 

1583
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,750
rotation. Back to 900. Still no trade.
Just that first attempt where we cleaned

1584
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:37,760
Just that first attempt where we cleaned
 

1585
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,589
Just that first attempt where we cleaned
out GlobeEx.

1586
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:39,599
out GlobeEx.
 

1587
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,670
out GlobeEx.
Back towards the 900 now.

1588
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:43,680
Back towards the 900 now.
 

1589
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,470
Back towards the 900 now.
Do I look at gold or silver? Sometimes.

1590
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:48,480

 

1591
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,630

And see, silver's in that like 12% down

1592
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:50,640
And see, silver's in that like 12% down
 

1593
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,990
And see, silver's in that like 12% down
right now. Not touching it right now. I

1594
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,000
right now. Not touching it right now. I
 

1595
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,670
right now. Not touching it right now. I
will touch those trades, right? I will

1596
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:55,680
will touch those trades, right? I will
 

1597
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,270
will touch those trades, right? I will
happily trade gold and silver when

1598
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:57,280
happily trade gold and silver when
 

1599
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,550
happily trade gold and silver when
they're less crowded, when everyone's

1600
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:58,560
they're less crowded, when everyone's
 

1601
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,829
they're less crowded, when everyone's
forgotten about it. I'm going to treat

1602
00:35:59,829 --> 00:35:59,839
forgotten about it. I'm going to treat
 

1603
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,990
forgotten about it. I'm going to treat
it like a small cap. When you guys when

1604
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,000
it like a small cap. When you guys when
 

1605
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,069
it like a small cap. When you guys when
retail have stopped talking about it,

1606
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:04,079
retail have stopped talking about it,
 

1607
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,230
retail have stopped talking about it,
I'll start a position for a long-term

1608
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,240
I'll start a position for a long-term
 

1609
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,829
I'll start a position for a long-term
short and

1610
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:09,839

 

1611
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,710

when it's done with for a fade right

1612
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:12,720
when it's done with for a fade right
 

1613
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:21,430
when it's done with for a fade right
back down.

1614
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:21,440

 

1615
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,670

Bounce on Dixie last night. Yep, it was.

1616
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:23,680
Bounce on Dixie last night. Yep, it was.
 

1617
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,630
Bounce on Dixie last night. Yep, it was.
It was indeed half% up. Trying to find a

1618
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:26,640
It was indeed half% up. Trying to find a
 

1619
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,310
It was indeed half% up. Trying to find a
bid on it, aren't they? was probably

1620
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:28,320
bid on it, aren't they? was probably
 

1621
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,109
bid on it, aren't they? was probably
from the comments of uh Trump and the

1622
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:31,119
from the comments of uh Trump and the
 

1623
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,589
from the comments of uh Trump and the
yen.

1624
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:35,599

 

1625
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,670

Come on, get out this range. Give us

1626
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:37,680
Come on, get out this range. Give us
 

1627
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,430
Come on, get out this range. Give us
something to do today. Give us something

1628
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:39,440
something to do today. Give us something
 

1629
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,710
something to do today. Give us something
to play with.

1630
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:44,720

 

1631
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,349

Yeah, I agree. Yeah, the orb is is doing

1632
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:47,359
Yeah, I agree. Yeah, the orb is is doing
 

1633
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,950
Yeah, I agree. Yeah, the orb is is doing
exactly what we expect. There's your

1634
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:48,960
exactly what we expect. There's your
 

1635
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,550
exactly what we expect. There's your
opening range high, opening range low.

1636
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:50,560
opening range high, opening range low.
 

1637
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,790
opening range high, opening range low.
These were the areas, right? So 900s,

1638
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:54,800
These were the areas, right? So 900s,
 

1639
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,030
These were the areas, right? So 900s,
800s, that's your rotation. Can we get

1640
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,040
800s, that's your rotation. Can we get
 

1641
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,310
800s, that's your rotation. Can we get
acceptance underneath?

1642
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:00,320
acceptance underneath?
 

1643
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,589
acceptance underneath?
Remember under sort of 835 we and we can

1644
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:03,599
Remember under sort of 835 we and we can
 

1645
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,390
Remember under sort of 835 we and we can
look for 800s. Under I would say under

1646
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:06,400
look for 800s. Under I would say under
 

1647
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,190
look for 800s. Under I would say under
790s that's where the bigger wash really

1648
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:09,200
790s that's where the bigger wash really
 

1649
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,910
790s that's where the bigger wash really
starts to accelerate. Under 790s we can

1650
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:11,920
starts to accelerate. Under 790s we can
 

1651
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,670
starts to accelerate. Under 790s we can
probably get a move down into the 700s.

1652
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:15,680
probably get a move down into the 700s.
 

1653
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,190
probably get a move down into the 700s.
Right now it just doesn't know what it

1654
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,200
Right now it just doesn't know what it
 

1655
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,870
Right now it just doesn't know what it
wants to do. That's why I said lower

1656
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:18,880
wants to do. That's why I said lower
 

1657
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,190
wants to do. That's why I said lower
expectations today.

1658
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,200
expectations today.
 

1659
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,030
expectations today.
Green dotted line, that's your 24hour

1660
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,040
Green dotted line, that's your 24hour
 

1661
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,109
Green dotted line, that's your 24hour
view up. All right, that's 24hour and

1662
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:25,119
view up. All right, that's 24hour and
 

1663
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,550
view up. All right, that's 24hour and
this is the New York view up. So that's

1664
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:26,560
this is the New York view up. So that's
 

1665
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,230
this is the New York view up. So that's
anchored to the 930 print. This one's

1666
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,240
anchored to the 930 print. This one's
 

1667
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:41,589
anchored to the 930 print. This one's
the 24hour one.

1668
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:41,599

1692
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:13,280
very, very patient. And it was similar
 

1693
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,030
very, very patient. And it was similar
the last few days. We had to be patient

1694
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,040
the last few days. We had to be patient
 

1695
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,950
the last few days. We had to be patient
on stream, but if you stuck with me, we

1696
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:16,960
on stream, but if you stuck with me, we
 

1697
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,589
on stream, but if you stuck with me, we
then probably caught a net 6 or 700

1698
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:19,599
then probably caught a net 6 or 700
 

1699
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,109
then probably caught a net 6 or 700
points yesterday. All right, back above

1700
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:21,119
points yesterday. All right, back above
 

1701
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,750
points yesterday. All right, back above
the 900s. Do they find acceptance now?

1702
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:23,760
the 900s. Do they find acceptance now?
 

1703
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,430
the 900s. Do they find acceptance now?
Same question. We're asking the same

1704
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:25,440
Same question. We're asking the same
 

1705
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,670
Same question. We're asking the same
question. Is there acceptance for this

1706
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:27,680
question. Is there acceptance for this
 

1707
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,310
question. Is there acceptance for this
drive up into 26,000? We're back up to

1708
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:30,320
drive up into 26,000? We're back up to
 

1709
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,670
drive up into 26,000? We're back up to
that same level up here.

1710
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:33,680
that same level up here.
 

1711
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,069
that same level up here.
So, does this next pullback hold in and

1712
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:36,079
So, does this next pullback hold in and
 

1713
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,910
So, does this next pullback hold in and
around the 900s or they just going to

1714
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:37,920
around the 900s or they just going to
 

1715
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:48,150
around the 900s or they just going to
keep selling pushes over 900?

1716
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:48,160

 

1717
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,750

Yeah, I agree Raph. We made our money

00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:56,800
Totally agree, Raph. That's why I'm
 

1725
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,030
Totally agree, Raph. That's why I'm
lowering expectations today. We had a

1726
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,040
lowering expectations today. We had a
 

1727
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,310
lowering expectations today. We had a
massive week. It was a big big week.

1728
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,320
massive week. It was a big big week.
 

1729
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,750
massive week. It was a big big week.
It's going to be one of my best months

1730
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:03,760
It's going to be one of my best months
 

1731
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,589
It's going to be one of my best months
for a long time. And remember, I didn't

1732
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:05,599
for a long time. And remember, I didn't
 

1733
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,069
for a long time. And remember, I didn't
even trade for the first 10 days or so

1734
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:08,079
even trade for the first 10 days or so
 

1735
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,589
even trade for the first 10 days or so
of this month. I was away with some

1736
00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:09,599
of this month. I was away with some
 

1737
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,390
of this month. I was away with some
personal matters. Um, so we don't need

1738
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:12,400
personal matters. Um, so we don't need
 

1739
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,790
personal matters. Um, so we don't need
to force. Not every day is an A+ trade

1740
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:14,800
to force. Not every day is an A+ trade
 

1741
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,950
to force. Not every day is an A+ trade
day. Right now, this is not an A+ trade

1742
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:16,960
day. Right now, this is not an A+ trade
 

1743
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,430
day. Right now, this is not an A+ trade
day. It's probably going to be a B a B

1744
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:19,440
day. It's probably going to be a B a B
 

1745
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,270
day. It's probably going to be a B a B
scope trade day at best. At best. And

1746
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:23,280
scope trade day at best. At best. And
 

1747
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,750
scope trade day at best. At best. And
that's if we hold bids or hold offers

1748
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:25,760
that's if we hold bids or hold offers
 

1749
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,510
that's if we hold bids or hold offers
lower each side of this range. Right.

1750
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:27,520
lower each side of this range. Right.
 

1751
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,270
lower each side of this range. Right.
They're trying to build here versus 900.

1752
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:33,280

 

1753
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,510

VIX new lower day. VIX is going for gap

1754
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:35,520
VIX new lower day. VIX is going for gap
 

1755
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,430
VIX new lower day. VIX is going for gap
fill as well. So ES and SPY look like

1756
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:37,440
fill as well. So ES and SPY look like
 

1757
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,069
fill as well. So ES and SPY look like
they want the gap fill. Our gap fill is

1758
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:40,079
they want the gap fill. Our gap fill is
 

1759
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,430
they want the gap fill. Our gap fill is
this yellow line. If we can get going.

1760
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:41,440
this yellow line. If we can get going.
 

1761
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,950
this yellow line. If we can get going.
So there is a long here. If we can get

1762
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:42,960
So there is a long here. If we can get
 

1763
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,630
So there is a long here. If we can get
going above here. If we can get going. I

going above here. If we can get going. I
 

1765
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,270
going above here. If we can get going. I
want to see it firm up and do this. All

1766
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:49,280
want to see it firm up and do this. All
 

1767
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,349
want to see it firm up and do this. All
right. If we can't firm up, if we can't

1768
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:51,359
right. If we can't firm up, if we can't
 

1769
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,270
right. If we can't firm up, if we can't
just keep holding this, then I'm not

1770
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:53,280
just keep holding this, then I'm not
 

1771
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,950
just keep holding this, then I'm not
interested in it because I do not want

1772
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
interested in it because I do not want
 

1773
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,109
interested in it because I do not want
to get dunked back on again just like

1774
00:39:57,109 --> 00:39:57,119
to get dunked back on again just like
 

1775
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,470
to get dunked back on again just like
here. So, same kind of player we looked

1776
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:58,480
here. So, same kind of player we looked
 

1777
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,670
here. So, same kind of player we looked
at earlier. I want to see it firm up.

1778
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:03,680
at earlier. I want to see it firm up.
 

1779
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,030

I want to see sellers get trapped.

1780
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,040

 

1781
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,630

Not seeing that yet. Is back down into

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,710
Not seeing that yet. Is back down into
that previous day value high test. They

1784
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:14,720
that previous day value high test. They
 

1785
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,310
that previous day value high test. They
will need to bid here and firm up and

1786
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:16,320
will need to bid here and firm up and
 

1787
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,589
will need to bid here and firm up and
trap sellers. If they do, I'm

1788
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:17,599
trap sellers. If they do, I'm
 

1789
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,190
trap sellers. If they do, I'm
interested. But at the moment, I'm not

1790
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,200
interested. But at the moment, I'm not
 

1791
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,349
interested. But at the moment, I'm not
seeing that.

1792
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:21,359
seeing that.
 

1793
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,030
seeing that.
Some sellers starting to get caught

1794
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,040
Some sellers starting to get caught
 

1795
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,589
Some sellers starting to get caught
there now. How big were you? 115. Not

1796
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:27,599

massive. Not massive.

1798
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:35,680

 

1799
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,589

Not convinced.

1800
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:37,599
Not convinced.
 

1801
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,589
Not convinced.
They're coming back into that 115 lot

1802
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:39,599
They're coming back into that 115 lot
 

1803
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,670
They're coming back into that 115 lot
around the 900 895. Let's see if they

1804
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:41,680
around the 900 895. Let's see if they
 

1805
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,349
around the 900 895. Let's see if they
absorb this tape or not.

1806
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:45,359
absorb this tape or not.
 

1807
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,990
absorb this tape or not.
No, they're bidding lower now. Don't

1808
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,000
No, they're bidding lower now. Don't
 

1809
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,150
No, they're bidding lower now. Don't
like it. Even if it goes without me, I

1810
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:50,160
like it. Even if it goes without me, I
 

1811
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,310
like it. Even if it goes without me, I
don't like this. I don't like it. Think

1812
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:52,320
don't like this. I don't like it. Think
 

1813
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,630
don't like this. I don't like it. Think
they sell through it. This is the level

1814
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:54,640
they sell through it. This is the level
 

1815
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,550
they sell through it. This is the level
where he got stuck. So, it's right here

1816
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:56,560
where he got stuck. So, it's right here
 

1817
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,550
where he got stuck. So, it's right here
at 95s.

1818
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:58,560
at 95s.
 

1819
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,670
at 95s.
Selling through. That's what I said.

1820
00:40:59,670 --> 00:40:59,680
Selling through. That's what I said.
 

1821
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,109
Selling through. That's what I said.
Don't like it. Don't like what I'm

1822
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:01,119
Don't like it. Don't like what I'm
 

1823
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:17,430
Don't like it. Don't like what I'm
seeing on the tape.

1824
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:17,440

 

1825
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,030

Still selling down back into the range

1826
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:19,040
Still selling down back into the range

sorry. I can't control the market. I can

1832
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,000
sorry. I can't control the market. I can

not seeing this move here. Here, we did
not see that. We saw sellers come

1988
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:08,240
not see that. We saw sellers come
 

1989
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,190
not see that. We saw sellers come
through with follow through, which is

1990
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:09,200
through with follow through, which is
 

1991
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,430
through with follow through, which is
why I did not touch it. Right? And this

1992
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:11,440
why I did not touch it. Right? And this
 

1993
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,510
why I did not touch it. Right? And this
can snap soon. If they can't get going

1994
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:13,520
can snap soon. If they can't get going
 

1995
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,190
can snap soon. If they can't get going
soon, they're going to trap lots of

1996
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:15,200
soon, they're going to trap lots of
 

1997
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,349
soon, they're going to trap lots of
balls here. And under here, there can be

1998
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:17,359
balls here. And under here, there can be
 

1999
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,349
balls here. And under here, there can be
a rotation, right? There can also be a

2000
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:19,359
a rotation, right? There can also be a
 

2001
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,950
a rotation, right? There can also be a
failure like this. So, we want to be

2002
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:20,960
failure like this. So, we want to be
 

2003
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,790
failure like this. So, we want to be
very, very careful. This is the same

2004
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:22,800
very, very careful. This is the same
 

2005
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,550
very, very careful. This is the same
level we went over pre-market. So, I'm

2006
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:24,560
level we went over pre-market. So, I'm
 

2007
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,829
level we went over pre-market. So, I'm
trying to be as patient as humanly

2008
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:27,839
trying to be as patient as humanly
 

2009
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,670
trying to be as patient as humanly
possible right now.

2010
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:31,680

 

2011
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,829

How do I find define basing above

2012
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:33,839
How do I find define basing above
 

2013
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,710
How do I find define basing above
pulling back in? So, breaking out. So,

2014
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:36,720
pulling back in? So, breaking out. So,
 

2015
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,069
pulling back in? So, breaking out. So,
if we break out and we pull back in and

2016
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:40,079
if we break out and we pull back in and
 

2017
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,309
if we break out and we pull back in and
we base, we hold here and I see passive

2018
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:42,319
we base, we hold here and I see passive
 

2019
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,630
we base, we hold here and I see passive
buyers absorbing the tape. Right? Where

2020
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:44,640
buyers absorbing the tape. Right? Where
 

2021
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,150
buyers absorbing the tape. Right? Where
are we? If we see passive buyers

2022
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:46,160
are we? If we see passive buyers
 

2023
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:51,430
are we? If we see passive buyers
absorbing the tape above here,

2024
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:51,440

 

2025
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,589

right? If we break above and we see

2026
00:45:53,589 --> 00:45:53,599
right? If we break above and we see
 

2027
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,190
right? If we break above and we see
passive buyers absorbing the tape and

2028
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:55,200
passive buyers absorbing the tape and
 

2029
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,309
passive buyers absorbing the tape and
sellers getting stuck, we're not seeing

2030
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:56,319
sellers getting stuck, we're not seeing
 

2031
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,670

This is looking very weak now. Back down

2042
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:08,079
This is looking very weak now. Back down
 

2043
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,910
This is looking very weak now. Back down
to the 860s point of control down here.

2044
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:13,920
to the 860s point of control down here.
 

2045

2050
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:20,800
under 60s. 60s was a huge level where
 

2051
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,790

big sellers came in earlier. This candle

2052
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:22,800
big sellers came in earlier. This candle
 

2053

2061
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,069

Back to these 60s where the big seller

Do we start to lose the bid now? Are we

2066
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:47,200
Do we start to lose the bid now? Are we
 

2067
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,710
Do we start to lose the bid now? Are we
going to be more aggressive now is the

2068
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:48,720
going to be more aggressive now is the
 

2069
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,309
going to be more aggressive now is the
question. Tape looks pretty thin. I'm

2070
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:50,319
question. Tape looks pretty thin. I'm
 

2071
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,069

All right, here we go. Here's the 50s.
Are we going to expand value now? We're

2076
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:55,839
Are we going to expand value now? We're
 

2077
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,390
Are we going to expand value now? We're
expanding value. Here's the VWAP now.

2078
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:58,400
expanding value. Here's the VWAP now.
 

2079
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,150
expanding value. Here's the VWAP now.
Does the next pull up, do they defend

2080
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:00,160
Does the next pull up, do they defend
 

2081
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,829
Does the next pull up, do they defend
50s and 60s and do we start selling

2082
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:01,839
50s and 60s and do we start selling
 

2083
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,430
50s and 60s and do we start selling
aggressively now? This coming back down

2084
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:03,440
aggressively now? This coming back down
 

2085
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,790
aggressively now? This coming back down
to the edge of the range now. I'm

2086
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:04,800
to the edge of the range now. I'm
 

2087
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,230
to the edge of the range now. I'm
starting to get interested in the short

2088
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:06,240
starting to get interested in the short
 

2089
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,470
starting to get interested in the short
for follow through. If we can do the

2090
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:08,480
for follow through. If we can do the
 

2091
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,710
for follow through. If we can do the
same thing if we expand and break out

2092
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:10,720
same thing if we expand and break out
 

2093
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,030
same thing if we expand and break out
and hold the pullback.

2094
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:13,040
and hold the pullback.
 

2095
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,829
and hold the pullback.
Here we go. So, watching these 25s down

2096
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:15,839
Here we go. So, watching these 25s down
 

2097
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,430
Here we go. So, watching these 25s down
to

2098
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:17,440
to
 

2099
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,230
to
even 790s and to see what we do. The

2100
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:20,240
even 790s and to see what we do. The
 

2101
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,910
even 790s and to see what we do. The
pullback now you would need sellers to

2102
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:21,920
pullback now you would need sellers to
 

2103
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,670
pullback now you would need sellers to
defend 60s, right? Sellers, you would

2104
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:23,680
defend 60s, right? Sellers, you would
 

2105
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,910
defend 60s, right? Sellers, you would
want sellers to defend 60s. Now, looking

2106
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:25,920
want sellers to defend 60s. Now, looking
 

2107
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,750
want sellers to defend 60s. Now, looking
for this continuation. Here comes the

2108
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:27,760
for this continuation. Here comes the
 

2109
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,510
for this continuation. Here comes the
low of day. I would expect here. Here we

2110
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:29,520
low of day. I would expect here. Here we
 

2111
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,309
low of day. I would expect here. Here we
go in this now. See how much we can

2112
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:32,319
go in this now. See how much we can
 

2113
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,150
go in this now. See how much we can
expand underneath. Trimming some into

2114
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:34,160
expand underneath. Trimming some into
 

2115
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,829
expand underneath. Trimming some into
this.

2116
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:35,839
this.
 

2117
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,270
this.
And let's see if we can get follow

2118
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:37,280
And let's see if we can get follow
 

2119
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,109
And let's see if we can get follow
through now. Down to previous week close

2120
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:39,119
through now. Down to previous week close
 

2121
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,950
through now. Down to previous week close
would be nice.

2122
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:40,960
would be nice.
 

2123
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,150
would be nice.
Can we get follow through

2124
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:44,160
Can we get follow through
 

2125
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,670
Can we get follow through
the moment? No follow through. Come on.

2126
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:45,680
the moment? No follow through. Come on.
 

2127
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,430
the moment? No follow through. Come on.
But Matt, why have you stopped? We've

2128
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:47,440
But Matt, why have you stopped? We've
 

2129
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,510
But Matt, why have you stopped? We've
got a bid at 800. We want to watch 800.

2130
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:49,520
got a bid at 800. We want to watch 800.
 

2131
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,589
got a bid at 800. We want to watch 800.
So going to trim some into 800. Buyer

2132
00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:51,599
So going to trim some into 800. Buyer
 

2133
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:52,790
So going to trim some into 800. Buyer
stepping in here. I think we should

2134
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:52,800
stepping in here. I think we should
 

2135
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,950
stepping in here. I think we should
break him.

2136
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:54,960
break him.
 

2137
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,430
break him.
790 is big level. So already trimming a

2138
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:57,440
790 is big level. So already trimming a
 

2139
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,190
790 is big level. So already trimming a
lot of the position here. Remember big

2140
00:47:59,190 --> 00:47:59,200

Good defense of 50 so far. That was the
 

2153
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,910
Good defense of 50 so far. That was the
level where the sellers came in. We need

2154
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:17,920
level where the sellers came in. We need
 

2155
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,349

cut. There was a seller and some
 

2179
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,790

00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:48,800
imbalance all the way up to 67 but I'd
 

2181
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,270
imbalance all the way up to 67 but I'd
rather cut and then read. So far we're

going to stay heavy. Now, I just didn't
 

2259

00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,349
value area high. That's going to be the
key level. I would not play this if we

start breaking above this. There we go.

00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:15,440
start breaking above this. There we go.
 

2389

So, no interest yet. Still waiting to

00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:19,280
see if we can break that low of day and
 

2393
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,870
see if we can break that low of day and
get follow through. So, we had one

get follow through. So, we had one
 

2395
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,790
get follow through. So, we had one
attempt. Patiently waiting to see if we

And that's not just based on today.

2430
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:58,480
And that's not just based on today.
 

2431
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,790
And that's not just based on today.
That's based on previous day, previous

2432
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:00,800
That's based on previous day, previous
 

2433
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,870
That's based on previous day, previous
week, and everything we went over

2434
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:02,880
week, and everything we went over
 

2435
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,030
week, and everything we went over
pre-market. So, all we've had today,

2436
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:05,040
pre-market. So, all we've had today,
 

2437
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,950
pre-market. So, all we've had today,
unfortunately, is two little scalps. One

2438
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:06,960
unfortunately, is two little scalps. One
 

2439
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,829
unfortunately, is two little scalps. One

Not really, cuz we we got filled from

2461
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,030
Sellers got caught under 25s. That's why
we kept talking about the 20s and 25s.

there are bids at the low of day. That
is not a good auction at the current low

2470

is not a good auction at the current low
 

2471

we've got stuck again. Sellers up here

2486
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:08,880
we've got stuck again. Sellers up here
 

2487
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,670
we've got stuck again. Sellers up here
were at 24s and 33s. If we get over

2488
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:11,680
were at 24s and 33s. If we get over
 

2489
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,190
were at 24s and 33s. If we get over
those levels there's probably

00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:13,200
those levels there's probably
 

2491
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:19,750
those levels there's probably

move it. So like here, you'll hear me
 

2507
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,630
move it. So like here, you'll hear me
say like I'm long partial here. Once we

2508
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:36,640
say like I'm long partial here. Once we
 

2509
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,630
say like I'm long partial here. Once we
get up there, I'm moving my stop break

00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:38,640
get up there, I'm moving my stop break
 

2511
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,470
get up there, I'm moving my stop break

which way. We can come up for a back
 

2579
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:03,030
which way. We can come up for a back
test of here and then fail that or maybe

come for a back test of this and come
 

2585
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:08,069
come for a back test of this and come
down to here. I'm happy to play either

zones, they're flat. Look at VWOPS,
they're flat. Look at previous day value

they're flat. Look at previous day value
 

2659
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,349
they're flat. Look at previous day value
area high. Are we finding acceptance

2660
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:33,359
area high. Are we finding acceptance
 

2661
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,190

2664
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:37,280
right now? No, we can't find acceptance
 

2665
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,230
right now? No, we can't find acceptance
above. Are we finding acceptance below

00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:40,240
above. Are we finding acceptance below
 

2667
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,630
above. Are we finding acceptance below
previous week value area high? No. What

2668
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:42,640
previous week value area high? No. What
 

2669
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,230
previous week value area high? No. What
does that mean? We're not rotating the

2670
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:44,240
does that mean? We're not rotating the
 

2671
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,589
does that mean? We're not rotating the
previous week. If we're going to rotate

2672
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:45,599
previous week. If we're going to rotate
 

2673
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,270
previous week. If we're going to rotate
the previous week, then we can expect

2674
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:49,280
the previous week, then we can expect
 

2675
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,589
the previous week, then we can expect
this and this, can't we? We're not

2676
00:58:51,589 --> 00:58:51,599
this and this, can't we? We're not
 

2677
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,030
this and this, can't we? We're not
seeing that. This is the current week

2678
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:53,040
seeing that. This is the current week
 

2679
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,950
seeing that. This is the current week
developing as well. So, we can expect

2680
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:54,960
developing as well. So, we can expect
 

2681
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,109
developing as well. So, we can expect
this today if we let go. We're not

2682
00:58:57,109 --> 00:58:57,119
this today if we let go. We're not
 

2683
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:59,349
this today if we let go. We're not
finding acceptance either side. What we

2684
00:58:59,349 --> 00:58:59,359
finding acceptance either side. What we
 

2685
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,510
finding acceptance either side. What we
are doing is building out lots of

2686
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:01,520
are doing is building out lots of
 

2687
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,510
are doing is building out lots of
people. So when we have these sideways

2688
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:03,520
people. So when we have these sideways
 

2689
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,870
people. So when we have these sideways
actions, if you imagine bulls are all

2690
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:06,880
actions, if you imagine bulls are all
 

2691
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,630
actions, if you imagine bulls are all
positioned in this and bears, all right,

2692
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:08,640
positioned in this and bears, all right,
 

2693
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,150
positioned in this and bears, all right,
and bulls have their stops here and

2694
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:10,160
and bulls have their stops here and
 

2695
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,230
and bulls have their stops here and
bears have their stops here. If we pop

2696
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:12,240
bears have their stops here. If we pop
 

2697
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,910
bears have their stops here. If we pop
this, you will get a ripper. If we pop

2698
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:13,920
this, you will get a ripper. If we pop
 

2699
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,750
this, you will get a ripper. If we pop
this, you will get a ripper, right? So

2700
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:15,760
this, you will get a ripper, right? So
 

2701
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,990
this, you will get a ripper, right? So
don't join in on this. Unless you like

2702
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:18,000
don't join in on this. Unless you like
 

2703
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,589
don't join in on this. Unless you like
trading range and you're buying that,

2704
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:19,599
trading range and you're buying that,
 

2705
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,030
trading range and you're buying that,
selling that, selling that, buying it

2706
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:21,040
selling that, selling that, buying it
 

2707
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,349
selling that, selling that, buying it
back, buying it back, selling it, buying

2708
00:59:23,349 --> 00:59:23,359
back, buying it back, selling it, buying
 

2709
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,030
back, buying it back, selling it, buying
it back, selling it back. All right?

2710
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:25,040
it back, selling it back. All right?
 

2711
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,630
it back, selling it back. All right?
Unless you, if that's your bread and

2712
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:26,640
Unless you, if that's your bread and
 

2713
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,829
Unless you, if that's your bread and
butter, you should be very rich today.

2714
00:59:29,829 --> 00:59:29,839
butter, you should be very rich today.
 

2715
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:31,430
butter, you should be very rich today.
It's not my bread and butter. I try and

2716
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:31,440
It's not my bread and butter. I try and
 

2717
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,750
It's not my bread and butter. I try and
avoid those. The reason uh yesterday was

2718
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:35,760
avoid those. The reason uh yesterday was
 

2719
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,349
avoid those. The reason uh yesterday was
so good and this week's been so good is

2720
00:59:37,349 --> 00:59:37,359
so good and this week's been so good is
 

2721
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:39,510
so good and this week's been so good is
because we've been in breakout or in

2722
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:39,520
because we've been in breakout or in
 

2723
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,349
because we've been in breakout or in
failed breakout of higher time frame.

2724
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:41,359
failed breakout of higher time frame.
 

2725
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,589
failed breakout of higher time frame.
And those are the moves that I like that

2726
00:59:43,589 --> 00:59:43,599
And those are the moves that I like that
 

2727
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,750
And those are the moves that I like that
that's when we've been nailing those 250

2728
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:45,760
that's when we've been nailing those 250
 

2729
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:56,069
that's when we've been nailing those 250
point trades.

2730
00:59:56,069 --> 00:59:56,079

 

2731
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,309

Just make sure my best advice is like

2732
00:59:58,309 --> 00:59:58,319
Just make sure my best advice is like
 

2733
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,230
Just make sure my best advice is like
keep being zoomed out. Look at this

2734
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:00,240
keep being zoomed out. Look at this
 

2735
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,710
keep being zoomed out. Look at this
chart here. Understand where we are. All

2736
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:02,720
chart here. Understand where we are. All
 

2737
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,950
chart here. Understand where we are. All
right. We've broken away from trap

2738
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:04,960
right. We've broken away from trap
 

2739
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,670
right. We've broken away from trap
participants.

Broken away from trap participants.
We've washed. We're now in the liquidity

2744
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:11,680
We've washed. We're now in the liquidity
 

2745
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,309
We've washed. We're now in the liquidity
building phase in this huge node. And if

2746
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:14,319
building phase in this huge node. And if
 

2747
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,309
building phase in this huge node. And if
you zoom back, you can see the

2748
01:00:16,309 --> 01:00:16,319
you zoom back, you can see the
 

2749
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:19,190
you zoom back, you can see the
importance of this level, right? It's a

2750
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:19,200
importance of this level, right? It's a
 

2751
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,430
importance of this level, right? It's a
huge level. Massive, massive level. All

2752
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:21,440
huge level. Massive, massive level. All
 

2753
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,030
huge level. Massive, massive level. All
right, let's see if they have another go

2754
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:23,040
right, let's see if they have another go
 

2755
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,750
right, let's see if they have another go
here.

2756
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:25,760
here.
 

2757
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,190
here.
Let's see. Do they hold bids now? ES is

2758
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:29,200
Let's see. Do they hold bids now? ES is
 

2759
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,710
Let's see. Do they hold bids now? ES is
about to fill its gap. Be very careful

2760
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:30,720
about to fill its gap. Be very careful
 

2761
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,630
about to fill its gap. Be very careful
here. If ES fills its gap, right, SPY

2762
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:32,640
here. If ES fills its gap, right, SPY
 

2763
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,870
here. If ES fills its gap, right, SPY
has now filled its gap. If you see a

2764
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:34,880
has now filled its gap. If you see a
 

2765
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,309
has now filled its gap. If you see a
failure here, it's because SPY's filled

2766
01:00:36,309 --> 01:00:36,319
failure here, it's because SPY's filled
 

2767
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:37,589
failure here, it's because SPY's filled
its gap and that's all they wanted to do

2768
01:00:37,589 --> 01:00:37,599
its gap and that's all they wanted to do
 

2769
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,910
its gap and that's all they wanted to do
on the cash market. So, SPY's just

2770
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:39,920
on the cash market. So, SPY's just
 

2771
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,510
on the cash market. So, SPY's just
filled its gap. ES has got a bit longer

2772
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:41,520
filled its gap. ES has got a bit longer
 

2773
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,150
filled its gap. ES has got a bit longer
to go. SPY pulling pulling back off that

2774
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:44,160
to go. SPY pulling pulling back off that
 

2775
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,710
to go. SPY pulling pulling back off that
gap fill. This is why I watch the ETFs

2776
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:46,720
gap fill. This is why I watch the ETFs
 

2777
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,549
gap fill. This is why I watch the ETFs
at the same time. SPY with the yellow

2778
01:00:48,549 --> 01:00:48,559
at the same time. SPY with the yellow
 

2779
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,630
at the same time. SPY with the yellow
line. There you go. Has filled its gap.

2780
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:50,640
line. There you go. Has filled its gap.
 

2781
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,270
line. There you go. Has filled its gap.
ES is not too far away, right? It's

2782
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:53,280
ES is not too far away, right? It's
 

2783
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,910
ES is not too far away, right? It's
almost at the cash gap. Q's are nowhere

2784
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:55,920
almost at the cash gap. Q's are nowhere
 

2785
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,230
almost at the cash gap. Q's are nowhere
near. They've got a decent amount of way

2786
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:58,240
near. They've got a decent amount of way
 

2787
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,990
near. They've got a decent amount of way
to go. All right. So, we have relative

2788
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,000
to go. All right. So, we have relative
 

2789
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:09,750
to go. All right. So, we have relative
weakness in the cues.

2790
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:09,760

 

2791
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,309

Obligation filled in the spiders for

2792
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:12,319
Obligation filled in the spiders for
 

2793
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,549
Obligation filled in the spiders for
sure. Cash market has filled the gap in

2794
01:01:14,549 --> 01:01:14,559
sure. Cash market has filled the gap in
 

2795
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:24,549
sure. Cash market has filled the gap in
the spiders.

2796
01:01:24,549 --> 01:01:24,559

 

2797
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,789

Can I talk more about the ATR? Yeah.

2798
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:26,799
Can I talk more about the ATR? Yeah.
 

2799
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:28,230
Can I talk more about the ATR? Yeah.
What what what is it that you want to

2800
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:28,240
What what what is it that you want to
 

2801
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,670
What what what is it that you want to
know? I use the ATR on a very lower time

2802
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:31,680
know? I use the ATR on a very lower time
 

2803
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,510
know? I use the ATR on a very lower time
low time frame. So your opening print

2804
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:33,520
low time frame. So your opening print
 

2805
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,349
low time frame. So your opening print
this morning, the ATR was

2806
01:01:37,349 --> 01:01:37,359
this morning, the ATR was
 

2807
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:40,950
this morning, the ATR was
95. So you had 95 point candle in the

2808
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:40,960
95. So you had 95 point candle in the
 

2809
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,549
95. So you had 95 point candle in the
first minute and then you gave the whole

2810
01:01:42,549 --> 01:01:42,559
first minute and then you gave the whole
 

2811
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:44,789
first minute and then you gave the whole
thing back. Right now we're trading on

2812
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:44,799
thing back. Right now we're trading on
 

2813
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:47,030
thing back. Right now we're trading on
an average I'd say of about 30 points.

2814
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:47,040
an average I'd say of about 30 points.
 

2815
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,190
an average I'd say of about 30 points.
So per one minute candle, you're looking

2816
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:49,200
So per one minute candle, you're looking
 

2817
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,750
So per one minute candle, you're looking
at 30 points. So if you're someone that

2818
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:51,760
at 30 points. So if you're someone that
 

2819
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,870
at 30 points. So if you're someone that
uses a 20 point stop loss,

2820
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:54,880
uses a 20 point stop loss,
 

2821
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,950
uses a 20 point stop loss,
you're probably going to get stopped at

2822
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:56,960
you're probably going to get stopped at
 

2823
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,589
you're probably going to get stopped at
a lot today. So what's the best thing to

2824
01:01:59,589 --> 01:01:59,599
a lot today. So what's the best thing to
 

2825
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,630
a lot today. So what's the best thing to
do? Shrink your contract size, increase

2826
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:02,640
do? Shrink your contract size, increase
 

2827
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,349
do? Shrink your contract size, increase
the stop- loss a little bit.

2828
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:05,359
the stop- loss a little bit.
 

2829
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:07,510
the stop- loss a little bit.
Yeah, shrink the contract size, increase

2830
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:07,520
Yeah, shrink the contract size, increase
 

2831
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,470
Yeah, shrink the contract size, increase
the stop loss a little bit.

2832
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:10,480
the stop loss a little bit.
 

2833
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,870
the stop loss a little bit.
All right, SPY really got hammered off

2834
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:12,880
All right, SPY really got hammered off
 

2835
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,950
All right, SPY really got hammered off
that gap though, guys.

2836
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:14,960
that gap though, guys.
 

2837
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,549
that gap though, guys.
So, we're just trading on the if you

2838
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:16,559
So, we're just trading on the if you
 

2839
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:18,230
So, we're just trading on the if you
look at the spiders and the cues. If you

2840
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:18,240
look at the spiders and the cues. If you
 

2841
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,230
look at the spiders and the cues. If you
look at the 5day and the 20-day, guess

2842
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:20,240
look at the 5day and the 20-day, guess
 

2843
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,069
look at the 5day and the 20-day, guess
where we're stuck between? You know it.

2844
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:22,079
where we're stuck between? You know it.
 

2845
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,549
where we're stuck between? You know it.
You best believe it.

2846
01:02:24,549 --> 01:02:24,559
You best believe it.
 

2847
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:32,390
You best believe it.
It's the 5day 20-day chop.

2848
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:32,400

 

2849
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,309

What do I mean by spy cash gap? There is

2850
01:02:34,309 --> 01:02:34,319
What do I mean by spy cash gap? There is
 

2851
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:35,990
What do I mean by spy cash gap? There is
a free video on my YouTube on that. But

2852
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:36,000
a free video on my YouTube on that. But
 

2853
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,950
a free video on my YouTube on that. But
what I mean is when I look at gaps, all

2854
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:38,960
what I mean is when I look at gaps, all
 

2855
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,470
what I mean is when I look at gaps, all
right, I don't just look at daily

2856
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:40,480
right, I don't just look at daily
 

2857
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,190
right, I don't just look at daily
candles. I look at the 4:00 close. All I

2858
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:43,200
candles. I look at the 4:00 close. All I
 

2859
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,670
candles. I look at the 4:00 close. All I
care about is the 9:30 open and the four

2860
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:45,680
care about is the 9:30 open and the four
 

2861
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,150
care about is the 9:30 open and the four
o'clock close because where is cash

2862
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:48,160
o'clock close because where is cash
 

2863
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,309
o'clock close because where is cash
traded? Look at the volume here. Look at

2864
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:50,319
traded? Look at the volume here. Look at
 

2865
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,549
traded? Look at the volume here. Look at
what's traded before that. Right? Look

2866
01:02:52,549 --> 01:02:52,559
what's traded before that. Right? Look
 

2867
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,230
what's traded before that. Right? Look
at the volume here. Look at what's

2868
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:54,240
at the volume here. Look at what's
 

2869
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,789
at the volume here. Look at what's
traded after 4:00. Very thin. So I care

2870
01:02:56,789 --> 01:02:56,799
traded after 4:00. Very thin. So I care
 

2871
01:02:56,799 --> 01:02:58,710
traded after 4:00. Very thin. So I care
about what I call cash. Where is most

2872
01:02:58,710 --> 01:02:58,720
about what I call cash. Where is most
 

2873
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,069
about what I call cash. Where is most
the money traded is in the cash market.

2874
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:02,079
the money traded is in the cash market.
 

2875
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:03,430
the money traded is in the cash market.
Where are the options traded? They're

2876
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:03,440
Where are the options traded? They're
 

2877
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,510
Where are the options traded? They're
are trading in the cash market. So they

2878
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:05,520
are trading in the cash market. So they
 

2879
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,230
are trading in the cash market. So they
care about the 4:00 close. They don't

2880
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:08,240
care about the 4:00 close. They don't
 

2881
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,270
care about the 4:00 close. They don't
care so much about a five:00 close,

2882
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:11,280
care so much about a five:00 close,
 

2883
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,950
care so much about a five:00 close,
right? 4:00 close matters. 9:30 open

2884
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:14,960
right? 4:00 close matters. 9:30 open
 

2885
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,270
right? 4:00 close matters. 9:30 open
matters.

2886
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:19,280

 

2887
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,029

How long will I continue these lives? I

2888
01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:21,039
How long will I continue these lives? I
 

2889
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:22,950
How long will I continue these lives? I
mean, I've been doing them for, I don't

2890
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:22,960

2898
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:33,200
because trading is a very lonely job.
 

2899
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:38,789
because trading is a very lonely job.
Um,

2900
01:03:38,789 --> 01:03:38,799

 

2901
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:41,190

01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:45,119
Other than the developing week, I set
 

2907
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,870
Other than the developing week, I set

01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:46,880
from the Sunday open, right? So,
 

2909
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,190
from the Sunday open, right? So,
developing week or weekly profile,

2910
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:49,200
developing week or weekly profile,
 

2911
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,990
developing week or weekly profile,
Sunday open, but each day's profile cash

2912
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:52,000
Sunday open, but each day's profile cash
 

2913
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,390
Sunday open, but each day's profile cash
for me. That's how I like to trade it,

2914
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:54,400
for me. That's how I like to trade it,
 

2915
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,069
for me. That's how I like to trade it,
but you know, each to their own. Some

2916
01:03:56,069 --> 01:03:56,079
but you know, each to their own. Some
 

2917
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:57,190
but you know, each to their own. Some
people might not do that, but that's

2918
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:57,200
people might not do that, but that's
 

2919
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,950
people might not do that, but that's
what I like. I like trading for cash.

basically we are starting to hold here.

2924
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:04,720
basically we are starting to hold here.
 

2925
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,430
basically we are starting to hold here.
It's starting to look a bit better,

2926
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:07,440
It's starting to look a bit better,
 

2927
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,950
It's starting to look a bit better,
but the problem is for me now, we've

2928
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:08,960
but the problem is for me now, we've
 

2929
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,910
but the problem is for me now, we've
taken the low hanging fruit on spy.

2930
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:11,920
taken the low hanging fruit on spy.
 

2931
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,990
taken the low hanging fruit on spy.
It's looking a little better, but we've

2932
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:14,000
It's looking a little better, but we've
 

2933
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,069
It's looking a little better, but we've
taken a low hanging fruit on spy. So,

2934
01:04:16,069 --> 01:04:16,079
taken a low hanging fruit on spy. So,
 

2935
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:17,910
taken a low hanging fruit on spy. So,
you know,

2936
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:17,920
you know,
 

2937
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,710
you know,
for us to do this, if Spyy's completed

2938
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:20,720
for us to do this, if Spyy's completed
 

2939
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,670
for us to do this, if Spyy's completed
it here, that's it's risky. I'm I'm

2940
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:23,680
it here, that's it's risky. I'm I'm
 

2941
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,630
it here, that's it's risky. I'm I'm
watching.

2942
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:26,640
watching.
 

2943
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,270
watching.

Sellers definitely just got caught under

3142
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:43,839
Sellers definitely just got caught under
 

3143
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:46,309
Sellers definitely just got caught under
89 there. Definitely got caught at 80

3144
01:08:46,309 --> 01:08:46,319
89 there. Definitely got caught at 80
 

3145
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:49,269
89 there. Definitely got caught at 80
there. Under 89 and 80. 20s is still the

3146
01:08:49,269 --> 01:08:49,279
there. Under 89 and 80. 20s is still the
 

3147
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,550
there. Under 89 and 80. 20s is still the
level that they can't get through. But

3148
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:50,560
level that they can't get through. But
 

3149
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,709
level that they can't get through. But
sellers definitely just got caught on

3150
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:52,719
sellers definitely just got caught on
 

3151
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,870
sellers definitely just got caught on
this last dip to VW up. If we have a

3152
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:54,880
this last dip to VW up. If we have a
 

3153
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,470
this last dip to VW up. If we have a
look in here, you will see it. Look at

3154
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:56,480
look in here, you will see it. Look at
 

3155
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,149
look in here, you will see it. Look at
these sellers. They just got caught in

3156
01:08:58,149 --> 01:08:58,159
these sellers. They just got caught in
 

3157
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:00,390
these sellers. They just got caught in
here. Right, this guy here, he's caught

3158
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:00,400
here. Right, this guy here, he's caught
 

3159
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,990
here. Right, this guy here, he's caught
offside. So, if they can't get back

3160
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:02,000
offside. So, if they can't get back
 

3161
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,070
offside. So, if they can't get back
under here, there is a chance. So,

3162
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:04,080
under here, there is a chance. So,
 

3163
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,030
under here, there is a chance. So,
they're going to come back down and

3164
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:05,040
they're going to come back down and
 

3165
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,269
they're going to come back down and
retest this. If they rebid this, this

3166
01:09:07,269 --> 01:09:07,279
retest this. If they rebid this, this
 

3167
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:09,110
retest this. If they rebid this, this
will look okay. If they flush this, this

3168
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:09,120
will look okay. If they flush this, this
 

3169
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,789
will look okay. If they flush this, this
is a big sell. So, they're trying to

3170
01:09:10,789 --> 01:09:10,799
is a big sell. So, they're trying to
 

3171
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:12,630
is a big sell. So, they're trying to
rebid now. See? See how this seller got

3172
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:12,640
rebid now. See? See how this seller got
 

3173
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,630

3177
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,590
guy here into 90 down to sort of 77.
That is his pain point. If they flush

3178
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:19,600
That is his pain point. If they flush
 

3179
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,430
That is his pain point. If they flush
through, you'll get a wash. If they hold

3180
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:21,440
through, you'll get a wash. If they hold
 

3181
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,669
through, you'll get a wash. If they hold
this, they rebid it. This is why I'm

3182
01:09:23,669 --> 01:09:23,679

just being very patient. It's a
 

3185
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,550
just being very patient. It's a
two-sided tape right now. And we're

3186
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:26,560
two-sided tape right now. And we're
 

3187
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,870
two-sided tape right now. And we're

01:12:45,669 --> 01:12:45,679
WZ, and Chris Lorenzo, right? That was
 

3347
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:47,830
WZ, and Chris Lorenzo, right? That was
our first ever record on our label and

3348
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:47,840
our first ever record on our label and
 

3349
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,590
our first ever record on our label and
it flew and then after that we started

3350
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:49,600
it flew and then after that we started
 

3351
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,590
it flew and then after that we started
getting some traction and then in 2014

3352
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:51,600
getting some traction and then in 2014
 

3353
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,669
getting some traction and then in 2014
we were pitching a song around that no

3354
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:53,679
we were pitching a song around that no
 

3355
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:55,830
we were pitching a song around that no
one wanted to touch. We gave it to Annie

3356
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:55,840
one wanted to touch. We gave it to Annie
 

3357
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,149
one wanted to touch. We gave it to Annie
Mack on Radio One. She gave it a spin

3358
01:12:58,149 --> 01:12:58,159
Mack on Radio One. She gave it a spin
 

3359
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:00,149
Mack on Radio One. She gave it a spin
and guess what? My phone did not stop

3360
01:13:00,149 --> 01:13:00,159
and guess what? My phone did not stop
 

3361
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,310
and guess what? My phone did not stop
ringing on the Monday and we had every

3362
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:02,320
ringing on the Monday and we had every
 

3363
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,709
ringing on the Monday and we had every
single label chasing us for a deal. We

3364
01:13:04,709 --> 01:13:04,719
single label chasing us for a deal. We
 

3365
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:06,550
single label chasing us for a deal. We
did a huge deal which lasted a long

3366
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:06,560
did a huge deal which lasted a long
 

3367
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,310
did a huge deal which lasted a long
time. Two years later, we sold our

3368
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:08,320
time. Two years later, we sold our
 

3369
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,709
time. Two years later, we sold our
record label to Sony and I still managed

3370
01:13:10,709 --> 01:13:10,719
record label to Sony and I still managed
 

3371
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,310
record label to Sony and I still managed
to anard that label and I spent most

3372
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:14,320
to anard that label and I spent most
 

3373
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,470
to anard that label and I spent most
that time bringing young artists

3374
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:16,480
that time bringing young artists
 

3375
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,550
that time bringing young artists
through. All right. I didn't really care

3376
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:18,560
through. All right. I didn't really care
 

3377
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,470
through. All right. I didn't really care
about the big established artists. I

3378
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:20,480
about the big established artists. I
 

3379
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,470
about the big established artists. I
think it's important to give young or

3380
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:22,480
think it's important to give young or
 

3381
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,550
think it's important to give young or
doesn't even need to be young. People

3382
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:24,560
doesn't even need to be young. People
 

3383
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,470
doesn't even need to be young. People
who haven't had their break. Give them

3384
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:26,480
who haven't had their break. Give them
 

3385
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,790
who haven't had their break. Give them
the opportunity. All right? There are so

3386
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:28,800
the opportunity. All right? There are so
 

3387
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,470
the opportunity. All right? There are so
many talented people out in this world

3388
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:30,480
many talented people out in this world
 

3389
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,990
many talented people out in this world
who just are never given the

3390
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:32,000
who just are never given the
 

3391
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,630
who just are never given the
opportunity. So, it's really important.

3392
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:34,640
opportunity. So, it's really important.
 

3393
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,229
opportunity. So, it's really important.
So, it's the same in this. So, I want

So, it's the same in this. So, I want
want to help as much as I can.

3396
01:13:42,149 --> 01:13:42,159

 

3397
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:45,189

All right. Still stuck. Jeez Louise.

01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:51,360
built enough liquidity, you might get a
 

3405
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,950
built enough liquidity, you might get a
very quick snap. It might be in the

3406
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:52,960
very quick snap. It might be in the
 

3407
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,950
very quick snap. It might be in the
afternoon if they don't do it soon. All

3408
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:54,960
afternoon if they don't do it soon. All
 

3409
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,709
afternoon if they don't do it soon. All
right, Google coming back down. All the

3410
01:13:56,709 --> 01:13:56,719
right, Google coming back down. All the
 

3411
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:58,950
right, Google coming back down. All the
mag coming back down other than Tesla.

3412
01:13:58,950 --> 01:13:58,960
mag coming back down other than Tesla.
 

3413
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,350
mag coming back down other than Tesla.
Tesla's on a pumper. 4% up. Let's have a

3414
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:01,360
Tesla's on a pumper. 4% up. Let's have a
 

3415
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:04,630
Tesla's on a pumper. 4% up. Let's have a
quick look if that's peaked out.

3416
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:04,640
quick look if that's peaked out.
 

3417
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,110
quick look if that's peaked out.
Let me zoom out here on a 30. See if

3418
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:07,120
Let me zoom out here on a 30. See if
 

3419
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,350
Let me zoom out here on a 30. See if
we're coming into a pivot. We are at

3420
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:09,360
we're coming into a pivot. We are at
 

3421
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,110
we're coming into a pivot. We are at
that same zone. So Tesla's coming back

3422
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:11,120
that same zone. So Tesla's coming back
 

3423
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,030
that same zone. So Tesla's coming back
up. This is like a two-leg one, two,

3424
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:13,040
up. This is like a two-leg one, two,
 

3425
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,870
up. This is like a two-leg one, two,
back into these pivots. If it can't

3426
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:14,880
back into these pivots. If it can't
 

3427
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,350
back into these pivots. If it can't
reclaim, we might see some weakness come

3428
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:17,360
reclaim, we might see some weakness come
 

3429
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,270
reclaim, we might see some weakness come
in the market. All right. Watching this

3430
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:19,280
in the market. All right. Watching this
 

3431
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,270
in the market. All right. Watching this
now for downside. All right. Same as we

3432
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:21,280
now for downside. All right. Same as we
 

3433
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,550
now for downside. All right. Same as we
were watching for upside, I'm now

3434
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:22,560
were watching for upside, I'm now
 

3435
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,630
were watching for upside, I'm now
watching for downside. If we want to

3436
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:24,640
watching for downside. If we want to
 

3437
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,229
watching for downside. If we want to
accelerate,

3438
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:26,239
accelerate,
 

3439
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:31,990
accelerate,
if we're going to let go

3440
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:32,000

 

3441
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,390

back into value area high from previous

3442
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:34,400
back into value area high from previous
 

3443
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,270
back into value area high from previous
week, can we find acceptance underneath

3444
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:37,280
week, can we find acceptance underneath
 

3445
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,270
week, can we find acceptance underneath
this and start getting aggressive? If we

3446
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:39,280
this and start getting aggressive? If we
 

3447
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,030
this and start getting aggressive? If we
can, we will trade it down and we will

3448
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:41,040
can, we will trade it down and we will
 

3449
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,550
can, we will trade it down and we will
try and get down into these gray lines.

3450
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:42,560
try and get down into these gray lines.
 

3451
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,270
try and get down into these gray lines.
We're looking good here now.

3452
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:45,280
We're looking good here now.
 

3453
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,030
We're looking good here now.
Watching this very carefully. Can we

3454
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:47,040
Watching this very carefully. Can we
 

3455
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,950
Watching this very carefully. Can we
trap some buyers down here and start

3456
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:48,960
trap some buyers down here and start
 

3457
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,229
trap some buyers down here and start
washing? Yes, we can. Come on, market.

3458
01:14:52,229 --> 01:14:52,239
washing? Yes, we can. Come on, market.
 

3459
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:54,390
washing? Yes, we can. Come on, market.
Let's do something fun here. Let's start

3460
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:54,400
Let's do something fun here. Let's start
 

3461
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,990
Let's do something fun here. Let's start
snapping.

3462
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:56,000
snapping.
 

3463
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,350
snapping.
So, we've got an imbalance all the way

3464
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:57,360
So, we've got an imbalance all the way
 

3465
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,070
So, we've got an imbalance all the way
up to 50s again. That same level as area

3466
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:00,080
up to 50s again. That same level as area
 

3467
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,790
up to 50s again. That same level as area
as earlier is going to be key. Let's see

3468
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:02,800
as earlier is going to be key. Let's see
 

3469
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,470
as earlier is going to be key. Let's see
if we can get outside of all of this.

3470
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:04,480
if we can get outside of all of this.
 

3471
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,149
if we can get outside of all of this.
Let's see if they push back up and trap

3472
01:15:06,149 --> 01:15:06,159
Let's see if they push back up and trap
 

3473
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:08,950
Let's see if they push back up and trap
some buyers and then start washing.

3474
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:08,960
some buyers and then start washing.
 

3475
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,630
some buyers and then start washing.
Here's the push back. The previous week

3476
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:10,640
Here's the push back. The previous week
 

3477
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,510
Here's the push back. The previous week
area high imbalances up to 50. Remember,

3478
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:13,520
area high imbalances up to 50. Remember,
 

3479
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,110
area high imbalances up to 50. Remember,
we've still got this buyer on the tape

3480
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:15,120
we've still got this buyer on the tape
 

3481
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,550
we've still got this buyer on the tape
down at 800 100 lot and below. So

3482
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:18,560
down at 800 100 lot and below. So
 

3483
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,149
down at 800 100 lot and below. So
watching to see if we come up and reject

3484
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:20,159
watching to see if we come up and reject
 

3485
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:21,590
watching to see if we come up and reject
and then if we see follow through or

3486
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:21,600
and then if we see follow through or
 

3487
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,149
and then if we see follow through or
not. ES still holding New York open VWAP

3488
01:15:24,149 --> 01:15:24,159
not. ES still holding New York open VWAP
 

3489
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:26,310
not. ES still holding New York open VWAP
and 20 days. Say this is exactly the

3490
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:26,320
and 20 days. Say this is exactly the
 

3491
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,910
and 20 days. Say this is exactly the
same as last time we were here. We're in

3492
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:27,920
same as last time we were here. We're in
 

3493
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,669
same as last time we were here. We're in
a complete alignment is exactly the same

3494
01:15:29,669 --> 01:15:29,679
a complete alignment is exactly the same
 

3495
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:31,750
a complete alignment is exactly the same
as last time we were here which was at

3496
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:31,760
as last time we were here which was at
 

3497
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,709
as last time we were here which was at
10:00. I think we might get expansion

60s. Do they resell this or not? This is
 

3515

01:15:58,709 --> 01:15:58,719
the dance back to the upside again. But
 

3521
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:00,709
the dance back to the upside again. But
if so, and they catch enough, I think we

3522
01:16:00,709 --> 01:16:00,719
if so, and they catch enough, I think we
 

3523
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:03,350
if so, and they catch enough, I think we
will get a wash. Good rejection there.

3557
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,350
see one more push down and come and wick
out all of this. And if we run all these

3558
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:37,360
out all of this. And if we run all these
 

3559
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,950
out all of this. And if we run all these
stops, I think we can get down into

3560
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:38,960
stops, I think we can get down into
 

3561
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,430
stops, I think we can get down into
here. Let me just make sure I'm checking

3562
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:41,440
here. Let me just make sure I'm checking
 

3563
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,950
here. Let me just make sure I'm checking
these profiles. I'm going to just get a

3564
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:42,960
these profiles. I'm going to just get a
 

3565
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,790
these profiles. I'm going to just get a
gray box on where we thickened up on the

3566
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:44,800
gray box on where we thickened up on the
 

3567
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,550
gray box on where we thickened up on the
current week, just so we know. This

3568
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:46,560
current week, just so we know. This
 

3569
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,350
current week, just so we know. This
right here is key. This right here is

3570
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:49,360
right here is key. This right here is
 

3571
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,390
right here is key. This right here is
key. Under that we have room. Under this

3572
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:52,400
key. Under that we have room. Under this
 

3573
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,870
key. Under that we have room. Under this
we have a lot of room down into here.

3574
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:54,880
we have a lot of room down into here.
 

3575
01:16:54,880 --> 01:17:00,870
we have a lot of room down into here.
Here we go folks.

3576
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:00,880

 

3577
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,950

Come on. I like I said low of day

3578
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:02,960
Come on. I like I said low of day
 

3579
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,550
Come on. I like I said low of day
auction is terrible right now. I think

3580
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:04,560
auction is terrible right now. I think
 

3581
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,910
auction is terrible right now. I think
we will make a new low of day because

3582
01:17:05,910 --> 01:17:05,920
we will make a new low of day because
 

3583
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,990
we will make a new low of day because
there's a buyer down there. I don't

3584
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:08,000
there's a buyer down there. I don't
 

3585
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,510
there's a buyer down there. I don't
think that holds. I don't think it's a

3586
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:09,520
think that holds. I don't think it's a
 

3587
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,990
think that holds. I don't think it's a
good low date auction.

3588
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:12,000
good low date auction.
 

3589
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,310
good low date auction.
But this is a big area. So, if you're in

3590
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:14,320
But this is a big area. So, if you're in
 

3591
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,430
But this is a big area. So, if you're in
this, make sure you're paying yourself

3592
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:15,440
this, make sure you're paying yourself
 

3593
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,870
this, make sure you're paying yourself
into this. Outside of this, we're going

3594
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:16,880
into this. Outside of this, we're going
 

3595
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:20,870
into this. Outside of this, we're going
to get very weak.

3596
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:20,880

 

3597
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,350

Partial here. Let's see if we get
 

3607
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,149
Partial here. Let's see if we get
acceptance now down into here. So, TP1

3608
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:34,159

The wash now is to 90. If we break out
 

3619

The wash now is to 90. If we break out
of 90, we're looking for 38s. We can

3620
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:47,120
of 90, we're looking for 38s. We can

actually risk up there and see if we can
 

3645
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,110
actually risk up there and see if we can
get here. All right. See if we can get

3646
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:15,120
get here. All right. See if we can get
 

3647
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,669
get here. All right. See if we can get
this and then this. Really nice, guys.

3648
01:18:17,669 --> 01:18:17,679
this and then this. Really nice, guys.
 

3649
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:20,229
this and then this. Really nice, guys.
Really good work. Patience, patience,

3650
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:20,239
Really good work. Patience, patience,
 

3651
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:21,669
Really good work. Patience, patience,
patience. Right. Patience, patience,

3652
01:18:21,669 --> 01:18:21,679
patience. Right. Patience, patience,
 

3653
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:23,270
patience. Right. Patience, patience,
patience. Ideally, we reject the gray

3654
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:23,280
patience. Ideally, we reject the gray
 

3655
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,790
patience. Ideally, we reject the gray
box. I would not want this back above

3656
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:24,800
box. I would not want this back above
 

3657
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,189
box. I would not want this back above
the gray box. Certainly not above the 20

3658
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:27,199
the gray box. Certainly not above the 20
 

3659
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:41,590
the gray box. Certainly not above the 20
level, right? Where we built this shelf.

3660
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:41,600

 

3661
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,870

Let's see if we can get some follow

3662
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:42,880
Let's see if we can get some follow
 

3663
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,510
Let's see if we can get some follow
through.

3664
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:45,520
through.
 

3665
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,430
through.
Really don't want this back into 20s.

3666
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:47,440
Really don't want this back into 20s.
 

3667
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,990
Really don't want this back into 20s.
So, taken partial, stops now at 20s

3668
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:50,000
So, taken partial, stops now at 20s
 

3669
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,669
So, taken partial, stops now at 20s
because that was the break of 25s,

3670
01:18:51,669 --> 01:18:51,679
because that was the break of 25s,
 

3671
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:54,310
because that was the break of 25s,
right? It was at 20 stops around here. I

3672
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:54,320
right? It was at 20 stops around here. I
 

3673
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,750
right? It was at 20 stops around here. I
don't want to risk back up to 50s.

3674
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:55,760
don't want to risk back up to 50s.
 

3675
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,189
don't want to risk back up to 50s.
Really nice. This rejection here was

3676
01:18:57,189 --> 01:18:57,199
Really nice. This rejection here was
 

3677
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:58,470
Really nice. This rejection here was
key. Do you remember here? I said we're

3678
01:18:58,470 --> 01:18:58,480
key. Do you remember here? I said we're
 

3679
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,470
key. Do you remember here? I said we're
doing the same thing as earlier. The 50

3680
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:00,480
doing the same thing as earlier. The 50
 

3681
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,510
doing the same thing as earlier. The 50
lift, the 50 lift, the 50 lift. Once we

3682
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:03,520
lift, the 50 lift, the 50 lift. Once we
 

3683
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,830
lift, the 50 lift, the 50 lift. Once we
broke 25s, that was it. right down into

3684
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:05,840
broke 25s, that was it. right down into
 

3685
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,910
broke 25s, that was it. right down into
here and see if we can get this, this,

3686
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:07,920
here and see if we can get this, this,
 

3687
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,510
here and see if we can get this, this,
and this now on the runners. It might

3688
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:09,520
and this now on the runners. It might
 

3689
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,189
and this now on the runners. It might
not give us the runners today. Might

3690
01:19:11,189 --> 01:19:11,199
not give us the runners today. Might
 

3691
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:12,630
not give us the runners today. Might
very well do something like this. So,

3692
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:12,640
very well do something like this. So,
 

3693
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,149
very well do something like this. So,
we're not going to play for that. We

3694
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:14,159
we're not going to play for that. We
 

3695
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:16,790
we're not going to play for that. We
want this now down into here. If we

3696
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:16,800
want this now down into here. If we
 

3697
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,030
want this now down into here. If we
reclaim, I'll be out on it. Not going to

3698
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:19,040
reclaim, I'll be out on it. Not going to
 

3699
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,590
reclaim, I'll be out on it. Not going to
sit in case we do a failed break. We do

3700
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:21,600
sit in case we do a failed break. We do
 

3701
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,870
sit in case we do a failed break. We do
a failed break. I'm not going to let

3702
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:22,880
a failed break. I'm not going to let
 

3703
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,750
a failed break. I'm not going to let
this reclaim this level here. So, 2025s

3704
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:25,760
this reclaim this level here. So, 2025s
 

3705
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,110
this reclaim this level here. So, 2025s
is the squeeze back up. So, they're

3706
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:27,120
is the squeeze back up. So, they're
 

3707
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,630
is the squeeze back up. So, they're
going to test this level. If they do not

3708
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:28,640
going to test this level. If they do not
 

3709
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,110
going to test this level. If they do not
reject this level, then I will cut. Nice

3710
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:31,120
reject this level, then I will cut. Nice
 

3711
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,590
reject this level, then I will cut. Nice
rejection in front of that so far.

3712
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:33,600
rejection in front of that so far.
 

3713
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,870
rejection in front of that so far.
Really good.

3714
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:36,880

 

3715
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,630

really good. This is what we want to

3716
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:38,640
really good. This is what we want to
 

3717
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,310
really good. This is what we want to
see. We want to see big rejections now

3718
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:40,320
see. We want to see big rejections now
 

3719
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,110
see. We want to see big rejections now
and follow through. I would love to see

3720
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:43,120
and follow through. I would love to see
 

3721
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:58,470
and follow through. I would love to see
Amazon go red here as well.

3722
01:19:58,470 --> 01:19:58,480

 

3723
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:01,350

I trade like by by 2% knowledge. What do

3724
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:01,360
I trade like by by 2% knowledge. What do
 

3725
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:05,030
I trade like by by 2% knowledge. What do
you mean I trade by 2% knowledge?

3726
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:05,040
you mean I trade by 2% knowledge?
 

3727
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,390
you mean I trade by 2% knowledge?
Not sure what you mean. If you think

3728
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:06,400
Not sure what you mean. If you think
 

3729
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,510
Not sure what you mean. If you think
I've got 2% knowledge, then when I get

3730
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:09,520
I've got 2% knowledge, then when I get
 

3731
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,270
I've got 2% knowledge, then when I get
the rest 98, I'm going to be a dangerous

3732
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:11,280
the rest 98, I'm going to be a dangerous
 

3733
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:18,870
the rest 98, I'm going to be a dangerous
man, aren't I?

3734
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:18,880

 

3735
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,910

Here's the 800 test.

3736
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:21,920
Here's the 800 test.
 

3737
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,510
Here's the 800 test.
That trade passed your funded account.

3738
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:23,520
That trade passed your funded account.
 

3739
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,669
That trade passed your funded account.
Nice. Good work. We had a big seller at

3740
01:20:25,669 --> 01:20:25,679
Nice. Good work. We had a big seller at
 

3741
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:27,830
Nice. Good work. We had a big seller at
800 now.

3742
01:20:27,830 --> 01:20:27,840
800 now.
 

3743
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,790
800 now.
Right. Bring you over here. Big seller

3744
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:30,800
Right. Bring you over here. Big seller
 

3745
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,950
Right. Bring you over here. Big seller
at 800. We have an imbalance up here

3746
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:32,960
at 800. We have an imbalance up here
 

3747
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,310
at 800. We have an imbalance up here
into twelves. All right. So, we're

3748
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:34,320
into twelves. All right. So, we're
 

3749
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,550
into twelves. All right. So, we're
watching for a rejection. 800 to 12.

3750
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:36,560
watching for a rejection. 800 to 12.
 

3751
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,070
watching for a rejection. 800 to 12.
Ideally, I don't really want it lift up

3752
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:38,080
Ideally, I don't really want it lift up
 

3753
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,990
Ideally, I don't really want it lift up
here. Want to see delta stay heavy and

3754
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:40,000
here. Want to see delta stay heavy and
 

3755
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,030
here. Want to see delta stay heavy and
follow through. So, I'm expecting a

3756
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:41,040
follow through. So, I'm expecting a
 

3757
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,310
follow through. So, I'm expecting a
pullback. I want to see that pullback

3758
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:42,320
pullback. I want to see that pullback
 

3759
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,149
pullback. I want to see that pullback
sold into. If we don't sell into it,

3760
01:20:44,149 --> 01:20:44,159
sold into. If we don't sell into it,
 

3761
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:45,750
sold into. If we don't sell into it,
it's going to be problematic. And I will

3762
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:45,760
it's going to be problematic. And I will
 

3763
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:50,950
it's going to be problematic. And I will
cut the rest break even.

3764
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:50,960

 

3765
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,870

Where did I enter on the break after we

3766
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:52,880
Where did I enter on the break after we
 

3767
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,910
Where did I enter on the break after we
broke 25s? Right here where where we are

3768
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:55,920
broke 25s? Right here where where we are
 

3769
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,669
broke 25s? Right here where where we are
basically where this line is. Remember I

3770
01:20:57,669 --> 01:20:57,679
basically where this line is. Remember I
 

3771
01:20:57,679 --> 01:20:59,270
basically where this line is. Remember I
said I want to see 50s reject and a

3772
01:20:59,270 --> 01:20:59,280
said I want to see 50s reject and a
 

3773
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:02,390
said I want to see 50s reject and a
break of 25s. 50s reject and a break of

3774
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:02,400
break of 25s. 50s reject and a break of
 

3775
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,229
break of 25s. 50s reject and a break of
25s. Same thing we were looking for

3776
01:21:04,229 --> 01:21:04,239
25s. Same thing we were looking for
 

3777
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:06,390
25s. Same thing we were looking for
here. We want 50's reject and a break

3778
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:06,400
here. We want 50's reject and a break
 

3779
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,189
here. We want 50's reject and a break
25s. There's the break of 25s.

3780
01:21:09,189 --> 01:21:09,199
25s. There's the break of 25s.
 

3781
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:11,990
25s. There's the break of 25s.
All right. So here to here and then

3782
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:12,000
All right. So here to here and then
 

3783
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,229
All right. So here to here and then
waiting to see if we reject this now

3784
01:21:14,229 --> 01:21:14,239
waiting to see if we reject this now
 

3785
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:16,149
waiting to see if we reject this now
anywhere here for continuation. If we

3786
01:21:16,149 --> 01:21:16,159
anywhere here for continuation. If we
 

3787
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:17,990
anywhere here for continuation. If we
reclaim this, I will not touch it. We

3788
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:18,000
reclaim this, I will not touch it. We
 

3789
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,990
reclaim this, I will not touch it. We
can always trade again afterwards. All

3790
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:20,000
can always trade again afterwards. All
 

3791
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,910
can always trade again afterwards. All
right. But if we start reclaiming these

3792
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:21,920
right. But if we start reclaiming these
 

3793
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,830
right. But if we start reclaiming these
levels, I will not touch it in case we

3794
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:23,840
levels, I will not touch it in case we
 

3795
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,510
levels, I will not touch it in case we
do that. Fail breakouts are very

3796
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:25,520
do that. Fail breakouts are very
 

3797
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,510
do that. Fail breakouts are very
possible each side of a range. So I'm

3798
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:27,520
possible each side of a range. So I'm
 

3799
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:33,830
possible each side of a range. So I'm
being extra careful today.

3800
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:33,840

 

3801
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:38,149

What is a break of 25? Right here. 825.

3802
01:21:38,149 --> 01:21:38,159
What is a break of 25? Right here. 825.
 

3803
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:42,709
What is a break of 25? Right here. 825.
825. The level 825.

3804
01:21:42,709 --> 01:21:42,719
825. The level 825.
 

3805
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:45,189
825. The level 825.
No, 825. If I'm giving you a number,

3806
01:21:45,189 --> 01:21:45,199
No, 825. If I'm giving you a number,
 

3807
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:46,630
No, 825. If I'm giving you a number,
guys, it's here. I'm not going to say

3808
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:46,640
guys, it's here. I'm not going to say
 

3809
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,310
guys, it's here. I'm not going to say
25,825.

3810
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:48,320
25,825.
 

3811
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,910
25,825.
I can't say that all the time. So, we

3812
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:49,920
I can't say that all the time. So, we
 

3813
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:59,270
I can't say that all the time. So, we
just call it 25s, right?

3814
01:21:59,270 --> 01:21:59,280

 

3815
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,870

Let's see if we can get continuation

3816
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:00,880
Let's see if we can get continuation
 

3817
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,790
Let's see if we can get continuation
now.

3818
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:02,800
now.
 

3819
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,629
now.
Initial balance now set. Is that right?

3820
01:22:04,629 --> 01:22:04,639
Initial balance now set. Is that right?
 

3821
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:06,310
Initial balance now set. Is that right?
Yeah. IB now set. So, we want to be

3822
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:06,320
Yeah. IB now set. So, we want to be
 

3823
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,229
Yeah. IB now set. So, we want to be
careful of a failed IB. So, IB high to

3824
01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:08,239
careful of a failed IB. So, IB high to
 

3825
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:11,030
careful of a failed IB. So, IB high to
IB low here. Let's just see what that

3826
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:11,040
IB low here. Let's just see what that
 

3827
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,430
IB low here. Let's just see what that
expansion might look like. Can we line

3828
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:13,440
expansion might look like. Can we line
 

3829
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,510
expansion might look like. Can we line
it up with something? Yes, that would

3830
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:15,520
it up with something? Yes, that would
 

3831
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:18,229
it up with something? Yes, that would
look pretty good. This would look pretty

3832
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:18,239
look pretty good. This would look pretty
 

3833
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:20,790
look pretty good. This would look pretty
good. So previous week point of control

3834
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:20,800
good. So previous week point of control
 

3835
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,950
good. So previous week point of control
is possible if we stay heavy here based

3836
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:22,960
is possible if we stay heavy here based
 

3837
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,149
is possible if we stay heavy here based
on the IB expansion to the 1618. So we

3838
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:26,159
on the IB expansion to the 1618. So we
 

3839
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:28,470
on the IB expansion to the 1618. So we
have alignment here if we can stay

3840
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:28,480
have alignment here if we can stay
 

3841
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,270
have alignment here if we can stay
heavy.

3842
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:31,280
heavy.
 

3843
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,350
heavy.
So here's 800 test like we talked about.

3844
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:33,360
So here's 800 test like we talked about.
 

3845
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,750
So here's 800 test like we talked about.
We have an imbalance here into sort of

3846
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:35,760
We have an imbalance here into sort of
 

3847
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,830
We have an imbalance here into sort of
812. That was your opening range as well

3848
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:37,840
812. That was your opening range as well
 

3849
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,070
812. That was your opening range as well
by the way. And then 825 there is an

3850
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:40,080
by the way. And then 825 there is an
 

3851
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,750
by the way. And then 825 there is an
imbalance up there which is where my

3852
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:41,760
imbalance up there which is where my
 

3853
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:50,950
imbalance up there which is where my
stop break even is right now.

3854
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:50,960

 

3855
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,030

If we get ES staying heavy versus New

3856
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:53,040
If we get ES staying heavy versus New
 

3857
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,030
If we get ES staying heavy versus New
York open here will really help. So it

3858
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:55,040
York open here will really help. So it
 

3859
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,550
York open here will really help. So it
keeps trading into that New York open

3860
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:56,560
keeps trading into that New York open
 

3861
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,310
keeps trading into that New York open
and 24-hour VW up. We would like to see

3862
01:22:58,310 --> 01:22:58,320
and 24-hour VW up. We would like to see
 

3863
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,790
and 24-hour VW up. We would like to see
it stay heavy. I'm very aware that the

3864
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:00,800
it stay heavy. I'm very aware that the
 

3865
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,629
it stay heavy. I'm very aware that the
indexes right now are stuck between the

3866
01:23:02,629 --> 01:23:02,639
indexes right now are stuck between the
 

3867
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:05,430
indexes right now are stuck between the
5day and 20-day. So here's the lift up

3868
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:05,440
5day and 20-day. So here's the lift up
 

3869
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,990
5day and 20-day. So here's the lift up
out of this now

3870
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:08,000
out of this now
 

3871
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,270
out of this now
because I don't want to get caught in a

3872
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:09,280
because I don't want to get caught in a
 

3873
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,110
because I don't want to get caught in a
squeeze back up. So out on the runner,

3874
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:11,120
squeeze back up. So out on the runner,
 

3875
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,590
squeeze back up. So out on the runner,
we can always get back in. Remember can

3876
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:13,600
we can always get back in. Remember can
 

3877
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,750
we can always get back in. Remember can
always get back in. I don't care giving

3878
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:15,760
always get back in. I don't care giving
 

3879
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,590
always get back in. I don't care giving
out on the run. I can always get back in

3880
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:17,600
out on the run. I can always get back in
 

3881
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,189
out on the run. I can always get back in
or I'm not going to risk as a fail

3882
01:23:19,189 --> 01:23:19,199
or I'm not going to risk as a fail
 

3883
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,110
or I'm not going to risk as a fail
breakout getting caught with no stop and

3884
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:21,120
breakout getting caught with no stop and
 

3885
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,270
breakout getting caught with no stop and
it ripping from like 25 all the way up

3886
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:23,280
it ripping from like 25 all the way up
 

3887
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:27,350
it ripping from like 25 all the way up
to 900 again. Right. So fail break here.

3888
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:27,360
to 900 again. Right. So fail break here.
 

3889
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,790
to 900 again. Right. So fail break here.
Here we go. This is why we stop out on

3890
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:28,800
Here we go. This is why we stop out on
 

3891
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,709
Here we go. This is why we stop out on
the runner and right the way back up it

3892
01:23:30,709 --> 01:23:30,719
the runner and right the way back up it
 

3893
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:32,709
the runner and right the way back up it
comes. This is why we don't stay in.

3894
01:23:32,709 --> 01:23:32,719
comes. This is why we don't stay in.
 

3895
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:33,910
comes. This is why we don't stay in.
This is why I talk about the difference

3896
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:33,920
This is why I talk about the difference
 

3897
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:36,550
This is why I talk about the difference
between me now and me years ago is I

3898
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:36,560
between me now and me years ago is I
 

3899
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:37,910
between me now and me years ago is I
wouldn't have understood that if that

3900
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:37,920
wouldn't have understood that if that
 

3901
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,629
wouldn't have understood that if that
reclaimed it's likely to do this. There

3902
01:23:40,629 --> 01:23:40,639
reclaimed it's likely to do this. There
 

3903
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:42,629
reclaimed it's likely to do this. There
we go. Squeeze back up. So fail break,

3904
01:23:42,629 --> 01:23:42,639
we go. Squeeze back up. So fail break,
 

3905
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:44,870
we go. Squeeze back up. So fail break,
trade down. fail break. Trade up. The

3906
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:44,880
trade down. fail break. Trade up. The
 

3907
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,350
trade down. fail break. Trade up. The
rotation continues.

3908
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:47,360
rotation continues.
 

3909
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,510
rotation continues.
At least we got TP1. And there's your

3910
01:23:49,510 --> 01:23:49,520
At least we got TP1. And there's your
 

3911
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,830
At least we got TP1. And there's your
IB. IB back to VWAP just happened. I

3912
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:51,840
IB. IB back to VWAP just happened. I
 

3913
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,110
IB. IB back to VWAP just happened. I
don't know if you traded that, Tyson.

3914
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:53,120
don't know if you traded that, Tyson.
 

3915
01:23:53,120 --> 01:24:00,550
don't know if you traded that, Tyson.
There's your IP to VWAP.

3916
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:00,560

 

3917
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,950

And previous day value high now tagged

3918
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:02,960
And previous day value high now tagged
 

3919
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,350
And previous day value high now tagged
rotation the other side. And this is

3920
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:05,360
rotation the other side. And this is
 

3921
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,990
rotation the other side. And this is
back into the no man zone. No trade

3922
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:08,000
back into the no man zone. No trade
 

3923
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,629
back into the no man zone. No trade
zone. Not trading in here. Don't care

3924
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:10,639
zone. Not trading in here. Don't care
 

3925
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:12,229

what it does. I'm not trading in here.

3926
01:24:12,229 --> 01:24:12,239
what it does. I'm not trading in here.
 

3927
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:14,470
what it does. I'm not trading in here.
trading outside of it or outside of it.

3928
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:14,480
trading outside of it or outside of it.
 

3929
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:18,149
trading outside of it or outside of it.
I'm not trading in here.

3930
01:24:18,149 --> 01:24:18,159
I'm not trading in here.
 

3931
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:25,270
I'm not trading in here.
It's my leave leave alone zone.

3932
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:25,280

 

3933
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,510

What is that move? It's just a squeeze.

3934
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:27,520
What is that move? It's just a squeeze.
 

3935
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,510
What is that move? It's just a squeeze.
It's a squeeze, right? So, lots of

3936
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:29,520
It's a squeeze, right? So, lots of
 

3937
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,510
It's a squeeze, right? So, lots of
people probably chased down here. This

3938
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:31,520
people probably chased down here. This
 

3939
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,669
people probably chased down here. This
was the target. Remember that's TP1 25

3940
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:33,679
was the target. Remember that's TP1 25
 

3941
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:36,470
was the target. Remember that's TP1 25
break into this node. TP1. The gray box

3942
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:36,480
break into this node. TP1. The gray box
 

3943
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,310
break into this node. TP1. The gray box
held. We couldn't reject the gray box.

3944
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:38,320
held. We couldn't reject the gray box.
 

3945
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,229
held. We couldn't reject the gray box.
We couldn't reject 25 for continuation.

3946
01:24:40,229 --> 01:24:40,239
We couldn't reject 25 for continuation.
 

3947
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:42,310
We couldn't reject 25 for continuation.
So, we reclaimed. when we reclaim

3948
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:42,320
So, we reclaimed. when we reclaim
 

3949
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,310
So, we reclaimed. when we reclaim
everyone stopped out and they cause

3950
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:44,320
everyone stopped out and they cause
 

3951
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,910
everyone stopped out and they cause
this.

3952
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:45,920
this.
 

3953
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,270
this.
All right? So, if you've got short

3954
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:47,280
All right? So, if you've got short
 

3955
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,990
All right? So, if you've got short
sellers stopping out here, they cause

3956
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:50,000
sellers stopping out here, they cause
 

3957
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,750
sellers stopping out here, they cause
this. All right? Because if too many

3958
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:51,760
this. All right? Because if too many
 

3959
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,830
this. All right? Because if too many
shorts get in here, their stop is there.

3960
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:53,840
shorts get in here, their stop is there.
 

3961
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,270
shorts get in here, their stop is there.
They allow this squeeze right the way

3962
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:55,280
They allow this squeeze right the way
 

3963
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:56,629
They allow this squeeze right the way
back up. This is why I saying I don't

3964
01:24:56,629 --> 01:24:56,639
back up. This is why I saying I don't
 

3965
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:58,870
back up. This is why I saying I don't
want to sit through a failed break and a

3966
01:24:58,870 --> 01:24:58,880
want to sit through a failed break and a
 

3967
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,950
want to sit through a failed break and a
squeeze up, which is what we've had.

3968
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:02,960
squeeze up, which is what we've had.
 

3969
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:05,189
squeeze up, which is what we've had.
It's a messy It's a messy chart today.

3970
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:05,199
It's a messy It's a messy chart today.
 

3971
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:12,310
It's a messy It's a messy chart today.
So, you've got to be very disciplined.

3972
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:12,320

 

3973
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,149

No, I'm not getting in on and and

No, I'm not getting in on and and
 

3975
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:15,830
No, I'm not getting in on and and
there's no anticip I'm never

3976
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:15,840
there's no anticip I'm never
 

3977
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,430
there's no anticip I'm never
anticipating the market. No. When we are

3978
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:19,440
anticipating the market. No. When we are
 

3979
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,430
anticipating the market. No. When we are
here, what did I say? I want to see a

3980
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:21,440
here, what did I say? I want to see a
 

3981
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:25,350
here, what did I say? I want to see a
reject of 50 and a breakdown of 25.

3982
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:25,360
reject of 50 and a breakdown of 25.
 

3983
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,229
reject of 50 and a breakdown of 25.
Right? When we were here, I want to see

3984
01:25:28,229 --> 01:25:28,239
Right? When we were here, I want to see
 

3985
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:30,629
Right? When we were here, I want to see
a reject of 50. What's that? That's a

3986
01:25:30,629 --> 01:25:30,639
a reject of 50. What's that? That's a

3989
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,350
reject of 50 and a break of 25. What's
that? A break of 25. That is not an

3990
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:35,360
that? A break of 25. That is not an
 

3991
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,110
that? A break of 25. That is not an
anticipation. That is me telling you

01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:37,120
anticipation. That is me telling you
 

3993
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,510

what I want to see. There's the break.
 

3995
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,430
what I want to see. There's the break.
There's the cover. All right. Stop then

3996
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:41,440
There's the cover. All right. Stop then
 

3997
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:42,870
There's the cover. All right. Stop then
goes to break even because I don't want

01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:42,880
goes to break even because I don't want
 

3999
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,950
goes to break even because I don't want
to get caught on a squeeze back up

4000
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:44,960
to get caught on a squeeze back up
 

4001
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,709
to get caught on a squeeze back up
because everyone else who's smart enough

4002
01:25:46,709 --> 01:25:46,719
because everyone else who's smart enough
 

4003
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:49,350
because everyone else who's smart enough
to take that trade will cut here and

4004
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:49,360
to take that trade will cut here and
 

4005
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:52,390
to take that trade will cut here and
that happens. I'm never anticipating the

4006
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:52,400
that happens. I'm never anticipating the
 

4007
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,070
that happens. I'm never anticipating the
market. I'll tell you what I'm looking

01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,149
market. I'll tell you what I'm looking
for, but I'm not trading in front of

for, but I'm not trading in front of
 

4011
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:58,070
for, but I'm not trading in front of
that happening. That's where you will

4012
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:58,080
that happening. That's where you will
 

4013
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:03,510
that happening. That's where you will
get caught.

4014
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:03,520

 

4015
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,310

I don't know what I'm do doing.

4016
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:06,320
I don't know what I'm do doing.
 

4017
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:12,709
I don't know what I'm do doing.
Yeah. Okay, mate. Okay.

4018
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:12,719

 

4019
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:14,950

Okay, bud. Even though I gave you the

4020
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:14,960
Okay, bud. Even though I gave you the
 

4021
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:18,310
Okay, bud. Even though I gave you the
exact levels and we had like 700 points

4022
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:18,320
exact levels and we had like 700 points
 

4023
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,149
exact levels and we had like 700 points
and we probably had two plus thousand

4024
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:20,159
and we probably had two plus thousand
 

4025
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:23,750
and we probably had two plus thousand
points this week together.

4026
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:23,760
points this week together.
 

4027
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:30,550
points this week together.
What are you? Are you ICT's [\h__\h] kid?

4028
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:30,560

 

4029
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:38,950

[\h__\h] dick.

4030
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:38,960

 

4031
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,990

Man, there are some cretins out there.

4032
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:42,000
Man, there are some cretins out there.
 

4033
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,669
Man, there are some cretins out there.
All right, so rehold a previous week

4034
01:26:43,669 --> 01:26:43,679
All right, so rehold a previous week
 

4035
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:46,310
All right, so rehold a previous week
value. We will trade back up for a back

4036
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:46,320
value. We will trade back up for a back
 

4037
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,310
value. We will trade back up for a back
test of this. Now, this is the liquidity

4038
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:48,320
test of this. Now, this is the liquidity
 

4039
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,310
test of this. Now, this is the liquidity
build out. You can see it here. You can

4040
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:50,320
build out. You can see it here. You can
 

4041
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:51,910
build out. You can see it here. You can
see it between these values. Again, if

4042
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:51,920
see it between these values. Again, if
 

4043
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,229
see it between these values. Again, if
they base above here, the squeeze is on

4044
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:54,239
they base above here, the squeeze is on
 

4045
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:56,790
they base above here, the squeeze is on
to try and fill this gap. Like we talked

4046
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:56,800
to try and fill this gap. Like we talked
 

4047
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,510
to try and fill this gap. Like we talked
about, SPY has already filled that gap

4048
01:26:59,510 --> 01:26:59,520
about, SPY has already filled that gap
 

4049
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,750
about, SPY has already filled that gap
though. Q's have not filled that gap. ES

4050
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:01,760
though. Q's have not filled that gap. ES
 

4051
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:11,430
though. Q's have not filled that gap. ES
has not quite filled that gap.

4052
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:11,440

 

4053
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:17,750

No, NT8 Ninja's fine for me.

4054
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:17,760

 

4055
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,350

It's been the same calls all morning,

4056
01:27:19,350 --> 01:27:19,360
It's been the same calls all morning,
 

4057
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,110
It's been the same calls all morning,
guys. Nothing's changed. This is the

4058
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:21,120
guys. Nothing's changed. This is the
 

4059
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,790
guys. Nothing's changed. This is the
same thing outside of here. And outside

4060
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:22,800
same thing outside of here. And outside
 

4061
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,270
same thing outside of here. And outside
of here, we're willing to trade inside

4062
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:25,280
of here, we're willing to trade inside
 

4063
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:37,030
of here, we're willing to trade inside
of here. I'm not willing to trade.

4064
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:37,040

 

4065
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,310

What indicator that moves from red to

4066
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:38,320
What indicator that moves from red to
 

4067
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:58,149
What indicator that moves from red to
green? Flow zone pro. Flow zone pro.

4068
01:27:58,149 --> 01:27:58,159

 

4069
01:27:58,159 --> 01:28:05,030

It's hilarious, man. It is funny.

4070
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:05,040

 

4071
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,950

That's right, Matt. Matt has absolutely

4072
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:06,960
That's right, Matt. Matt has absolutely
 

4073
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,790
That's right, Matt. Matt has absolutely
nailed that. That is the statement. That

4074
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:08,800
nailed that. That is the statement. That
 

4075
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,870
nailed that. That is the statement. That
is exactly right. The market is the

4076
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:10,880
is exactly right. The market is the
 

4077
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:13,030
is exactly right. The market is the
perfect tool to move money from the

4078
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:13,040
perfect tool to move money from the
 

4079
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,270
perfect tool to move money from the
impatient to the to the patient. That is

4080
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:15,280
impatient to the to the patient. That is
 

4081
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,350
impatient to the to the patient. That is
the most accurate statement. Very, very

4082
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:17,360
the most accurate statement. Very, very
 

4083
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:20,550
the most accurate statement. Very, very
accurate. Think about yesterday,

4084
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:20,560
accurate. Think about yesterday,
 

4085
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,709
accurate. Think about yesterday,
right? What we traded yesterday. We were

4086
01:28:22,709 --> 01:28:22,719
right? What we traded yesterday. We were
 

4087
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:24,550
right? What we traded yesterday. We were
short yesterday

4088
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:24,560
short yesterday
 

4089
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:28,629
short yesterday
for this breakdown under here into here.

4090
01:28:28,629 --> 01:28:28,639
for this breakdown under here into here.
 

4091
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:30,870
for this breakdown under here into here.
And I got this to this and I missed

4092
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:30,880
And I got this to this and I missed
 

4093
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,270
And I got this to this and I missed
this. But then we were long on this trap

4094
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:33,280
this. But then we were long on this trap
 

4095
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,350
this. But then we were long on this trap
here all the way back up, weren't we?

4096
01:28:35,350 --> 01:28:35,360
here all the way back up, weren't we?
 

4097
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,110
here all the way back up, weren't we?
Right? Because we were patient. We knew

4098
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:37,120
Right? Because we were patient. We knew
 

4099
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,390
Right? Because we were patient. We knew
it would be a long down here if we

4100
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:38,400
it would be a long down here if we
 

4101
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,950
it would be a long down here if we
trapped enough and it played out, right?

4102
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:40,960
trapped enough and it played out, right?
 

4103
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,870
trapped enough and it played out, right?
So, it's being patient and we don't

4104
01:28:42,870 --> 01:28:42,880
So, it's being patient and we don't
 

4105
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,709
So, it's being patient and we don't
trade this mess. We don't trade that

4106
01:28:44,709 --> 01:28:44,719
trade this mess. We don't trade that
 

4107
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:46,550
trade this mess. We don't trade that
mess. We wait for everyone else to trade

4108
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:46,560
mess. We wait for everyone else to trade
 

4109
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,629
mess. We wait for everyone else to trade
that mess. We trade outside of that

4110
01:28:48,629 --> 01:28:48,639
that mess. We trade outside of that
 

4111
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:50,629
that mess. We trade outside of that
mess.

4112
01:28:50,629 --> 01:28:50,639
mess.
 

4113
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:55,270
mess.
Very, very accurate statement that

4114
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:55,280

 

4115
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,110

and the 100 point chop continues. Just

4116
01:28:57,110 --> 01:28:57,120
and the 100 point chop continues. Just
 

4117
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:59,990
and the 100 point chop continues. Just
think like Um really here no acceptance

4118
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:00,000
think like Um really here no acceptance
 

4119
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,709
think like Um really here no acceptance
over this. Not too much acceptance below

4120
01:29:02,709 --> 01:29:02,719
over this. Not too much acceptance below
 

4121
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:09,590
over this. Not too much acceptance below
this like 112 point chop.

4122
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:09,600

 

4123
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,510

9005. So, let's see if they hold bids

4188
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:42,560
9005. So, let's see if they hold bids
 

4189
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,470
9005. So, let's see if they hold bids
now. ES getting very close for that IB

4190
01:30:44,470 --> 01:30:44,480
now. ES getting very close for that IB
 

4191
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,629
now. ES getting very close for that IB
high. If we're going to go IB high

4192
01:30:46,629 --> 01:30:46,639
high. If we're going to go IB high
 

4193
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:48,390
high. If we're going to go IB high
rotation day, it would not surprise me

4194
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:48,400
rotation day, it would not surprise me
 

4195
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,790
rotation day, it would not surprise me
to see ES break IB high, fill its gap

4196
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:50,800
to see ES break IB high, fill its gap
 

4197
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:54,229
to see ES break IB high, fill its gap
towards 90. What is that? 93s and then

4198
01:30:54,229 --> 01:30:54,239
towards 90. What is that? 93s and then
 

4199
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:55,990
towards 90. What is that? 93s and then
fade back inside the IB high. So I want

4200
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:56,000
fade back inside the IB high. So I want
 

4201
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,750
fade back inside the IB high. So I want
to be careful when we think about the

4202
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:57,760
to be careful when we think about the
 

4203
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,189
to be careful when we think about the

the the main course you want to do if if
 

4225
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,709
the the main course you want to do if if
if you're looking to learn is the 20our

4226
01:31:28,709 --> 01:31:28,719
if you're looking to learn is the 20our
 

4227

indicators what I use how I use it
 

4231
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,310
indicators what I use how I use it
and with that you get the discord right

4232
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:36,320
and with that you get the discord right
 

4233
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,070
and with that you get the discord right
so if you're want to understand

4234

so if you're want to understand
 

4235
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,750
so if you're want to understand
everything on the screen that's what I

4236
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:39,760
everything on the screen that's what I
 

4237
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,830
everything on the screen that's what I
use if you already understand all that

4238
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:41,840
use if you already understand all that
 

4239
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,350
use if you already understand all that
stuff and you want to use like volume

4240
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:43,360

01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:01,990
that cash gap on the VIX was to what?
1686. It's into a pivot now. Good eyes,

4256
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:02,000
1686. It's into a pivot now. Good eyes,
 

4257
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,470
1686. It's into a pivot now. Good eyes,
mate. Good eyes. So a breakdown now

4258
01:32:04,470 --> 01:32:04,480
mate. Good eyes. So a breakdown now
 

4259
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,430
mate. Good eyes. So a breakdown now
under 1670s. All right. Can allow a

4260
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:07,440
under 1670s. All right. Can allow a
 

4261
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:10,390
under 1670s. All right. Can allow a
flush on the VIX down to 1653s and then

4262
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:10,400
flush on the VIX down to 1653s and then
 

4263
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,070
flush on the VIX down to 1653s and then
we've got some like old gaps that we can

4264
01:32:12,070 --> 01:32:12,080
we've got some like old gaps that we can
 

4265
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:14,629
we've got some like old gaps that we can
fill down to 1634s and lower days down

4266
01:32:14,629 --> 01:32:14,639
fill down to 1634s and lower days down
 

4267
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:16,470
fill down to 1634s and lower days down
to 16. So we'll just see how the VIX

4268
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:16,480
to 16. So we'll just see how the VIX
 

4269
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,629
to 16. So we'll just see how the VIX
act. It's in a pretty key level right

4270
01:32:18,629 --> 01:32:18,639
act. It's in a pretty key level right
 

4271
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:22,470
act. It's in a pretty key level right
now.

4272
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:22,480

 

4273
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,070

We are starting to find bids here. We

4274
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:24,080
We are starting to find bids here. We
 

4275
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,070
We are starting to find bids here. We
are starting to absorb and find some

4276
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:26,080
are starting to absorb and find some
 

4277
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:29,030
are starting to absorb and find some
bids here.

4278
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:29,040
bids here.
 

4279
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,550
bids here.
We're stuck at the value area high of

4280
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:30,560
We're stuck at the value area high of
 

4281
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,070
We're stuck at the value area high of
the day which is starting to lift and

4282
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:32,080
the day which is starting to lift and
 

4283
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,830
the day which is starting to lift and
move higher. ES wants that breakout for

4284
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:33,840
move higher. ES wants that breakout for
 

4285
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,510
move higher. ES wants that breakout for
that gap fill. I would not be surprised

4286
01:32:35,510 --> 01:32:35,520
that gap fill. I would not be surprised
 

4287
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,910
that gap fill. I would not be surprised
if we break out, fill the gap on ES and

4288
01:32:37,910 --> 01:32:37,920
if we break out, fill the gap on ES and
 

4289
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:47,030
if we break out, fill the gap on ES and
then come straight back inside the IB.

4290
01:32:47,030 --> 01:32:47,040

 

4291
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,189

Can't reach my page really. I've seen

4292
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:49,199
Can't reach my page really. I've seen
 

4293
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:50,629
Can't reach my page really. I've seen
someone else say that. I'm wondering if

4294
01:32:50,629 --> 01:32:50,639
someone else say that. I'm wondering if
 

4295
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:54,550
someone else say that. I'm wondering if
I've got someone uh

4296
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:54,560
I've got someone uh
 

4297
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,470
I've got someone uh
let me try it on mine. Wonder if

4298
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:56,480
let me try it on mine. Wonder if
 

4299
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:57,990
let me try it on mine. Wonder if
someone's being a bit of a pain. It's

4300
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:58,000
someone's being a bit of a pain. It's
 

4301
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,790
someone's being a bit of a pain. It's
working on mine. Let me uh post it in

4302
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:00,800
working on mine. Let me uh post it in
 

4303
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:10,310
working on mine. Let me uh post it in
here. Try that link there.

4304
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:10,320

 

4305
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,070

Still rejecting these same levels up

4306
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:12,080
Still rejecting these same levels up
 

4307
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,910
Still rejecting these same levels up
here for now. They are trying to find a

4308
01:33:13,910 --> 01:33:13,920
here for now. They are trying to find a
 

4309
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:23,669
here for now. They are trying to find a
bid here though.

4310
01:33:23,669 --> 01:33:23,679

 

4311
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:25,430

If you purchase multiple Apex accounts,

4312
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:25,440
If you purchase multiple Apex accounts,
 

4313
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,030
If you purchase multiple Apex accounts,
is there a membership fee for multiple

4314
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:27,040
is there a membership fee for multiple
 

4315
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:28,709
is there a membership fee for multiple
accounts or one membership for all the

4316
01:33:28,709 --> 01:33:28,719
accounts or one membership for all the
 

4317
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:30,550
accounts or one membership for all the
accounts? Probably stupid question. Not

4318
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:30,560
accounts? Probably stupid question. Not
 

4319
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,310
accounts? Probably stupid question. Not
sure what you mean by membership fee.

4320
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:32,320
sure what you mean by membership fee.
 

4321
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,149
sure what you mean by membership fee.
You pay for those accounts. All right.

4322
01:33:34,149 --> 01:33:34,159
You pay for those accounts. All right.
 

4323
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:36,070
You pay for those accounts. All right.
For your monthly fee. All right. Once

4324
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:36,080
For your monthly fee. All right. Once
 

4325
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,669
For your monthly fee. All right. Once
you pass those accounts, you have to pay

4326
01:33:37,669 --> 01:33:37,679
you pass those accounts, you have to pay
 

4327
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:41,110
you pass those accounts, you have to pay
for each account um to be activated. If

4328
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:41,120
for each account um to be activated. If
 

4329
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,709
for each account um to be activated. If
you don't pass the accounts in the first

4330
01:33:42,709 --> 01:33:42,719
you don't pass the accounts in the first
 

4331
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,629
you don't pass the accounts in the first
month, you you'll pay whatever the fee

4332
01:33:44,629 --> 01:33:44,639
month, you you'll pay whatever the fee
 

4333
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:46,149
month, you you'll pay whatever the fee
is for the next month for the rollover.

4334
01:33:46,149 --> 01:33:46,159
is for the next month for the rollover.
 

4335
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:48,229
is for the next month for the rollover.
So, I think right now it's 50 it's 90%

4336
01:33:48,229 --> 01:33:48,239
So, I think right now it's 50 it's 90%
 

4337
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:50,950
So, I think right now it's 50 it's 90%
off right now. But if you don't, let's

4338
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:50,960
off right now. But if you don't, let's
 

4339
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,870
off right now. But if you don't, let's
say you buy one today on the 30th of

4340
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:52,880
say you buy one today on the 30th of
 

4341
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,790
say you buy one today on the 30th of
Jan, if you haven't passed it by the

4342
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:54,800
Jan, if you haven't passed it by the
 

4343
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,590
Jan, if you haven't passed it by the
30th of February, they will roll over to

4344
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:57,600
30th of February, they will roll over to
 

4345
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,590
30th of February, they will roll over to
the next month and you'll only get a 50%

4346
01:33:59,590 --> 01:33:59,600
the next month and you'll only get a 50%
 

4347
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,189
the next month and you'll only get a 50%
discount.

4348
01:34:01,189 --> 01:34:01,199
discount.
 

4349
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:03,189
discount.
Hope that makes sense. And I think I

4350
01:34:03,189 --> 01:34:03,199
Hope that makes sense. And I think I
 

4351
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:04,470
Hope that makes sense. And I think I
don't know what activation is right now.

4352
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:04,480
don't know what activation is right now.
 

4353
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:07,669
don't know what activation is right now.
Or is it 70 $70 or something? Right.

4354
01:34:07,669 --> 01:34:07,679
Or is it 70 $70 or something? Right.
 

4355
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:08,950
Or is it 70 $70 or something? Right.
Yes. Looks like wants to get going for

4356
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:08,960
Yes. Looks like wants to get going for
 

4357
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,270
Yes. Looks like wants to get going for
that gap fill.

4358
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:11,280
that gap fill.
 

4359
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,030
that gap fill.
We are starting to build liquidity here.

4360
01:34:13,030 --> 01:34:13,040
We are starting to build liquidity here.
 

4361
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,750
We are starting to build liquidity here.
900 all the way down to 8.90 big level.

4362
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:15,760
900 all the way down to 8.90 big level.
 

4363
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,189
900 all the way down to 8.90 big level.
It looks like they want to lift this at

4364
01:34:17,189 --> 01:34:17,199
It looks like they want to lift this at
 

4365
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:19,270
It looks like they want to lift this at
this point. They are trying to lift it

4366
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:19,280
this point. They are trying to lift it
 

4367
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,750
this point. They are trying to lift it
and run all these stops. And if they do

4368
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:21,760
and run all these stops. And if they do
 

4369
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,390
and run all these stops. And if they do
bust out of this

4370
01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:24,400
bust out of this
 

4371
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,149
bust out of this
this shelf here, I'd say this top side

4372
01:34:26,149 --> 01:34:26,159
this shelf here, I'd say this top side
 

4373
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:27,669
this shelf here, I'd say this top side
of this shelf here. If they can start

4374
01:34:27,669 --> 01:34:27,679
of this shelf here. If they can start
 

4375
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:30,709
of this shelf here. If they can start
busting out of this here, right, this

4376
01:34:30,709 --> 01:34:30,719
busting out of this here, right, this
 

4377
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:32,470
busting out of this here, right, this
shelf here, if they can build liquidity

4378
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:32,480
shelf here, if they can build liquidity
 

4379
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:35,270
shelf here, if they can build liquidity
and bust out and run these stops, we've

4380
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:35,280
and bust out and run these stops, we've
 

4381
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:36,790
and bust out and run these stops, we've
got the potential for this gap fill up

4382
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:36,800
got the potential for this gap fill up
 

4383
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,629
got the potential for this gap fill up
here into 26,000. Same thing we've been

4384
01:34:38,629 --> 01:34:38,639
here into 26,000. Same thing we've been
 

4385
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:40,229
here into 26,000. Same thing we've been
looking at all day. each side of this.

4386
01:34:40,229 --> 01:34:40,239
looking at all day. each side of this.
 

4387
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:41,750
looking at all day. each side of this.
Here we go. They're starting to run it.

4388
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:41,760
Here we go. They're starting to run it.
 

4389
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:44,790
Here we go. They're starting to run it.
Let's see then. Watching ES. I be high

4390
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:44,800
Let's see then. Watching ES. I be high
 

4391
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:48,709
Let's see then. Watching ES. I be high
now on the ES now. Tagged.

4392
01:34:48,709 --> 01:34:48,719
now on the ES now. Tagged.
 

4393
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:57,750
now on the ES now. Tagged.
Let's see. Let's see.

4394
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:57,760

 

4395
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:59,510

Here we go. This is where the sellers

4396
01:34:59,510 --> 01:34:59,520
Here we go. This is where the sellers
 

4397
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:02,229
Here we go. This is where the sellers
came in this morning. Looks good. Buyers

4398
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:02,239
came in this morning. Looks good. Buyers
 

4399
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:03,430
came in this morning. Looks good. Buyers
getting a little caught here, but I

4400
01:35:03,430 --> 01:35:03,440
getting a little caught here, but I
 

4401
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,550
getting a little caught here, but I
think we're going to expand through this

4402
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:04,560
think we're going to expand through this
 

4403
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,550
think we're going to expand through this
high day.

4404
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:06,560
high day.
 

4405
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:07,910
high day.
We want to watch that higher time frame

4406
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:07,920
We want to watch that higher time frame
 

4407
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:10,470
We want to watch that higher time frame
algo as well. ES through that initial

4408
01:35:10,470 --> 01:35:10,480
algo as well. ES through that initial
 

4409
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,629
algo as well. ES through that initial
balance. So watch very very carefully

4410
01:35:12,629 --> 01:35:12,639
balance. So watch very very carefully
 

4411
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:16,550
balance. So watch very very carefully
for ES to trade into 9275s 93s. That

4412
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:16,560
for ES to trade into 9275s 93s. That
 

4413
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,790
for ES to trade into 9275s 93s. That
will be the target for ES. Gap filled

4414
01:35:18,790 --> 01:35:18,800
will be the target for ES. Gap filled
 

4415
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,350
will be the target for ES. Gap filled
again on the SPY. So we're just waiting

4416
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:21,360
again on the SPY. So we're just waiting
 

4417
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,189
again on the SPY. So we're just waiting
for ES to play the catchup. Then the

4418
01:35:23,189 --> 01:35:23,199
for ES to play the catchup. Then the
 

4419
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:25,350
for ES to play the catchup. Then the
question is do we do it? If you are long

4420
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:25,360
question is do we do it? If you are long
 

4421
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,350
question is do we do it? If you are long
in this pullback here, I would be

4422
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:27,360
in this pullback here, I would be
 

4423
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,350
in this pullback here, I would be
starting to trim some on the next break

4424
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:29,360
starting to trim some on the next break
 

4425
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,510
starting to trim some on the next break
above here. All right. Hopefully above

4426
01:35:31,510 --> 01:35:31,520
above here. All right. Hopefully above
 

4427
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,189
above here. All right. Hopefully above
40s you get a squeeze, but I'll be

4428
01:35:33,189 --> 01:35:33,199
40s you get a squeeze, but I'll be
 

4429
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:36,390
40s you get a squeeze, but I'll be
trimming some into that in case they uh

4430
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:36,400
trimming some into that in case they uh
 

4431
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,229
trimming some into that in case they uh
use that little squeeze to sell into

4432
01:35:38,229 --> 01:35:38,239
use that little squeeze to sell into
 

4433
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:40,550
use that little squeeze to sell into
because remember market uh order buy

4434
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:40,560
because remember market uh order buy
 

4435
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,189
because remember market uh order buy
stops will be here. You'll probably get

4436
01:35:43,189 --> 01:35:43,199
stops will be here. You'll probably get
 

4437
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:45,430
stops will be here. You'll probably get
a stop run here and it they could very

4438
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:45,440
a stop run here and it they could very
 

4439
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,350
a stop run here and it they could very
easily do a fail break of the IB and

4440
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:47,360
easily do a fail break of the IB and
 

4441
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,590
easily do a fail break of the IB and
turn back inside because we are in a

4442
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:49,600
turn back inside because we are in a
 

4443
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:52,950
turn back inside because we are in a
balanced day.

4444
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:52,960
balanced day.
 

4445
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,470
balanced day.
But you know, I don't know what I'm

4446
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:54,480
But you know, I don't know what I'm
 

4447
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:56,070
But you know, I don't know what I'm
talking about. Better listen to the guy

4448
01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:56,080
talking about. Better listen to the guy
 

4449
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,310
talking about. Better listen to the guy
on stream who's 15 and follows a

01:35:58,310 --> 01:35:58,320
on stream who's 15 and follows a
 

4451
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,790
on stream who's 15 and follows a
delusional old man that wears a stupid

4452
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:00,800
delusional old man that wears a stupid
 

4453
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:04,310
delusional old man that wears a stupid
cap and has failed every single attempt

4454
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:04,320
cap and has failed every single attempt
 

4455
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:08,390
cap and has failed every single attempt
at every single trading account. Okay,

4456
01:36:08,390 --> 01:36:08,400
at every single trading account. Okay,
 

4457
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:09,510
at every single trading account. Okay,
how am I seeing the buyers getting

4458
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:09,520
how am I seeing the buyers getting
 

4459
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,590
how am I seeing the buyers getting
caught? I'm using orderflow. So bookmap,

4460
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:11,600
caught? I'm using orderflow. So bookmap,
 

4461
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,189
caught? I'm using orderflow. So bookmap,
which you can see above me, and also

4462
01:36:13,189 --> 01:36:13,199
which you can see above me, and also
 

4463
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:15,990
which you can see above me, and also
footprint, right? So this right here,

4464
01:36:15,990 --> 01:36:16,000
footprint, right? So this right here,
 

4465
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,229
footprint, right? So this right here,
right? So buyers caught here, right? So

4466
01:36:18,229 --> 01:36:18,239
right? So buyers caught here, right? So
 

4467
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:19,830
right? So buyers caught here, right? So
we're waiting to see sellers are caught

4468
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:19,840
we're waiting to see sellers are caught
 

4469
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,310
we're waiting to see sellers are caught
under here. This is the rotation. Can

4470
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:22,320
under here. This is the rotation. Can
 

4471
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,070
under here. This is the rotation. Can
these buyers find acceleration at the

4472
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:24,080
these buyers find acceleration at the
 

4473
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:28,709
these buyers find acceleration at the
moment?

4474
01:36:28,709 --> 01:36:28,719

 

4475
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:30,390

It should come and pop those stops. ES

4476
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:30,400
It should come and pop those stops. ES
 

4477
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:31,990
It should come and pop those stops. ES
has already done it though. It has not

4478
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:32,000
has already done it though. It has not
 

4479
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,590
has already done it though. It has not
quite filled its gap. It did run the

4480
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:33,600
quite filled its gap. It did run the
 

4481
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,669
quite filled its gap. It did run the
high. Yes, it did run the high, but we

4482
01:36:35,669 --> 01:36:35,679
high. Yes, it did run the high, but we
 

4483
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:37,669
high. Yes, it did run the high, but we
have not quite filled that gap on ES. We

4484
01:36:37,669 --> 01:36:37,679
have not quite filled that gap on ES. We
 

4485
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:39,110
have not quite filled that gap on ES. We
have done it on the spy like I've talked

4486
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:39,120
have done it on the spy like I've talked
 

4487
01:36:39,120 --> 01:37:04,709
have done it on the spy like I've talked
about. We have done it on spy already.

4488
01:37:04,709 --> 01:37:04,719

 

4489
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:06,709

No worries, Chuck. All right. Failed

4490
01:37:06,709 --> 01:37:06,719
No worries, Chuck. All right. Failed
 

4491
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:08,550
No worries, Chuck. All right. Failed
break of the IB high on ES. still hasn't

4492
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:08,560
break of the IB high on ES. still hasn't
 

4493
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,149
break of the IB high on ES. still hasn't
filled its gap. Like I said, SPY has

4494
01:37:10,149 --> 01:37:10,159
filled its gap. Like I said, SPY has
 

4495
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:11,910
filled its gap. Like I said, SPY has
filled its gap. The one thing I'm aware

4496
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:11,920
filled its gap. The one thing I'm aware
 

4497
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:14,870
filled its gap. The one thing I'm aware
of here is SPY, like I said, has filled

4498
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:14,880
of here is SPY, like I said, has filled
 

4499
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,950
of here is SPY, like I said, has filled
its gap already. This yellow line's been

4500
01:37:16,950 --> 01:37:16,960
its gap already. This yellow line's been
 

4501
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:18,550
its gap already. This yellow line's been
tagged again. So, it's a fail break

4502
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:18,560
tagged again. So, it's a fail break
 

4503
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:21,990
tagged again. So, it's a fail break
above it. And ES has not quite done it.

4504
01:37:21,990 --> 01:37:22,000
above it. And ES has not quite done it.
 

4505
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,510
above it. And ES has not quite done it.
Very, very close. You can see that.

4506
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:23,520
Very, very close. You can see that.
 

4507
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:26,470
Very, very close. You can see that.
Whereas QQQ has a long way to go. We

4508
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:26,480
Whereas QQQ has a long way to go. We
 

4509
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:27,830
Whereas QQQ has a long way to go. We
need to run these stops and use these

4510
01:37:27,830 --> 01:37:27,840
need to run these stops and use these
 

4511
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:28,950
need to run these stops and use these
stops to get up there. If they're going

4512
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:28,960
stops to get up there. If they're going
 

4513
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,229
stops to get up there. If they're going
to do it, they might not do it today.

4514
01:37:30,229 --> 01:37:30,239
to do it, they might not do it today.
 

4515
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:33,189
to do it, they might not do it today.
You might see divergence between the Q's

4516
01:37:33,189 --> 01:37:33,199
You might see divergence between the Q's
 

4517
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:36,070
You might see divergence between the Q's
and the uh ES today on that gap. So, it

4518
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:36,080
and the uh ES today on that gap. So, it
 

4519
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:37,750
and the uh ES today on that gap. So, it
would not surprise me at all to see

4520
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:37,760
would not surprise me at all to see
 

4521
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,510
would not surprise me at all to see
divergence there and then initial

4522
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:39,520
divergence there and then initial
 

4523
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,189
divergence there and then initial
balance rotation. But I would like them

4524
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:41,199
balance rotation. But I would like them
 

4525
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:42,629
balance rotation. But I would like them
to at least come and run these stops. At

4526
01:37:42,629 --> 01:37:42,639
to at least come and run these stops. At
 

4527
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:43,750
to at least come and run these stops. At
the moment, they're unable to do it.

4528
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:43,760
the moment, they're unable to do it.
 

4529
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,189
the moment, they're unable to do it.
We're getting stuck at GlobeEx, the

4530
01:37:45,189 --> 01:37:45,199
We're getting stuck at GlobeEx, the
 

4531
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:48,390
We're getting stuck at GlobeEx, the
orange line. Back down we come down to

4532
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:48,400
orange line. Back down we come down to
 

4533
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,629
orange line. Back down we come down to
this same level. So, can they now trap

4534
01:37:50,629 --> 01:37:50,639
this same level. So, can they now trap
 

4535
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:52,629
this same level. So, can they now trap
sellers down here and do one last

4536
01:37:52,629 --> 01:37:52,639
sellers down here and do one last
 

4537
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:54,470
sellers down here and do one last
squeeze up? They won't do it if they're

4538
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:54,480
squeeze up? They won't do it if they're
 

4539
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,790
squeeze up? They won't do it if they're
unwilling to do it on ES. All right. If

4540
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:56,800
unwilling to do it on ES. All right. If
 

4541
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:57,830
unwilling to do it on ES. All right. If
we're just going to trade the range,

4542
01:37:57,830 --> 01:37:57,840
we're just going to trade the range,
 

4543
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,430
we're just going to trade the range,
remember, if you're a range trader, this

4544
01:37:59,430 --> 01:37:59,440
remember, if you're a range trader, this
 

4545
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,510
remember, if you're a range trader, this
is like your bread and butter. I would

4546
01:38:01,510 --> 01:38:01,520
is like your bread and butter. I would
 

4547
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,350
is like your bread and butter. I would
say buyers stepped in earlier today at

4548
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:03,360
say buyers stepped in earlier today at
 

4549
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,910
say buyers stepped in earlier today at
98.95. They will want to rebid that. If

4550
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:05,920
98.95. They will want to rebid that. If
 

4551
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,229
98.95. They will want to rebid that. If
they cannot rebid that, we will go wash

4552
01:38:08,229 --> 01:38:08,239
they cannot rebid that, we will go wash
 

4553
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:09,750
they cannot rebid that, we will go wash
right back down to the other side of the

4554
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:09,760
right back down to the other side of the
 

4555
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,669
right back down to the other side of the
range again. If they cannot rebid here,

4556
01:38:11,669 --> 01:38:11,679
range again. If they cannot rebid here,
 

4557
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:13,510
range again. If they cannot rebid here,
we will wash right back down to the

4558
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:13,520
we will wash right back down to the
 

4559
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:16,629
we will wash right back down to the
other side of the range again. Sellers

4560
01:38:16,629 --> 01:38:16,639
other side of the range again. Sellers
 

4561
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:18,149
other side of the range again. Sellers
getting caught on that last little shove

4562
01:38:18,149 --> 01:38:18,159
getting caught on that last little shove
 

4563
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:20,709
getting caught on that last little shove
down underneath 905s. So maybe they've

4564
01:38:20,709 --> 01:38:20,719
down underneath 905s. So maybe they've
 

4565
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:21,910
down underneath 905s. So maybe they've
got a chance here. We just filled that

4566
01:38:21,910 --> 01:38:21,920
got a chance here. We just filled that
 

4567
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:25,270
got a chance here. We just filled that
imbalance.

4568
01:38:25,270 --> 01:38:25,280

 

4569
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:28,390

I'd say 900 to

4570
01:38:28,390 --> 01:38:28,400
I'd say 900 to
 

4571
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:31,669
I'd say 900 to
89 is key. 900 to 89 is key for buyers

4572
01:38:31,669 --> 01:38:31,679
89 is key. 900 to 89 is key for buyers
 

4573
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:35,590
89 is key. 900 to 89 is key for buyers
to uh absorb the tape. 900 to 89 is key

4574
01:38:35,590 --> 01:38:35,600
to uh absorb the tape. 900 to 89 is key
 

4575
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:44,310
to uh absorb the tape. 900 to 89 is key
down here.

4576
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:44,320

 

4577
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,070

Since I started trading with you, I've

4578
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:46,080
Since I started trading with you, I've
 

4579
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:50,310
Since I started trading with you, I've
been more profitable. That's great.

4580
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:50,320

 

4581
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,149

Okay, down into that same level we just

4582
01:38:52,149 --> 01:38:52,159
Okay, down into that same level we just
 

4583
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:54,950
Okay, down into that same level we just
talked about it. 900 down to 89. We just

4584
01:38:54,950 --> 01:38:54,960
talked about it. 900 down to 89. We just
 

4585
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,430
talked about it. 900 down to 89. We just
chapped 8925.

4586
01:38:57,430 --> 01:38:57,440
chapped 8925.
 

4587
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:00,149
chapped 8925.
This was the level.

4588
01:39:00,149 --> 01:39:00,159
This was the level.
 

4589
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:01,830
This was the level.
They will need to lift this now. If they

4590
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:01,840
They will need to lift this now. If they
 

4591
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,510
They will need to lift this now. If they
don't lift this, if they get a breakdown

4592
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:03,520
don't lift this, if they get a breakdown
 

4593
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,669
don't lift this, if they get a breakdown
under here, we will wash all the way

4594
01:39:05,669 --> 01:39:05,679
under here, we will wash all the way
 

4595
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:07,910
under here, we will wash all the way
back down. Buyers must hold this area

4596
01:39:07,910 --> 01:39:07,920
back down. Buyers must hold this area
 

4597
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:10,470
back down. Buyers must hold this area
now to complete the rotation. Buyers

4598
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:10,480
now to complete the rotation. Buyers
 

4599
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:13,270
now to complete the rotation. Buyers
must hold this in here to complete this

4600
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:13,280
must hold this in here to complete this
 

4601
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,270
must hold this in here to complete this
rotation. Failing to hold this in here

4602
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:15,280
rotation. Failing to hold this in here
 

4603
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:17,109
rotation. Failing to hold this in here
will collapse this whole thing back down

4604
01:39:17,109 --> 01:39:17,119
will collapse this whole thing back down
 

4605
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:18,790
will collapse this whole thing back down
again. This is your node. I mean, at

4606
01:39:18,790 --> 01:39:18,800
again. This is your node. I mean, at
 

4607
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:21,430
again. This is your node. I mean, at
least down to here, right? This is the

01:39:21,430 --> 01:39:21,440
least down to here, right? This is the
 

4609
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:24,149

node. So, at the moment, we're not

4610
01:39:24,149 --> 01:39:24,159
node. So, at the moment, we're not
 

4611
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:26,470
node. So, at the moment, we're not
seeing what they need to do happen. And

4612
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:26,480
seeing what they need to do happen. And
 

4613
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:27,750
seeing what they need to do happen. And
they're coming into the key level and

4614
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:27,760
they're coming into the key level and
 

4615
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,270
they're coming into the key level and
waiting to see if sellers get trapped.

4616
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:29,280
waiting to see if sellers get trapped.
 

4617
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,870
waiting to see if sellers get trapped.
We're not seeing it. The liquidity looks

4618
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:30,880
We're not seeing it. The liquidity looks
 

4619
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,270
We're not seeing it. The liquidity looks
pretty terrible on the book right now.

4620
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:33,280
pretty terrible on the book right now.
 

4621
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:35,669
pretty terrible on the book right now.
Just stacking both sides. Here they go.

4622
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:35,679
Just stacking both sides. Here they go.
 

4623
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:37,350
Just stacking both sides. Here they go.
They're trying now to lift. Here's the

4624
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:37,360
They're trying now to lift. Here's the
 

4625
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,910
They're trying now to lift. Here's the
910s. Can they lift through this and get

4626
01:39:39,910 --> 01:39:39,920
910s. Can they lift through this and get
 

4627
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:44,709
910s. Can they lift through this and get
going now? So 900 to 890 held well. No

4628
01:39:44,709 --> 01:39:44,719
going now? So 900 to 890 held well. No
 

4629

I'm going to come try and get back to

I'm going to come try and get back to
 

4645
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,390
I'm going to come try and get back to
the 900s. Big seller stepping in at

4646
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:08,400
the 900s. Big seller stepping in at
 

4647
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,790
the 900s. Big seller stepping in at
900s. He just slammed it. He just

4648
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:10,800
900s. He just slammed it. He just
 

4649
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,189
900s. He just slammed it. He just
slammed it. 100 lot. He's chasing it

4650
01:40:13,189 --> 01:40:13,199
slammed it. 100 lot. He's chasing it
 

4651
01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:14,870
slammed it. 100 lot. He's chasing it
down now. He is chasing it down with

4652
01:40:14,870 --> 01:40:14,880
down now. He is chasing it down with
 

4653
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,189
down now. He is chasing it down with
size now. He's had enough. He's been

4654
01:40:17,189 --> 01:40:17,199
size now. He's had enough. He's been
 

4655
01:40:17,199 --> 01:40:19,109
size now. He's had enough. He's been
like, "Piss off. I'm done with you guys.

4656
01:40:19,109 --> 01:40:19,119
like, "Piss off. I'm done with you guys.
 

4657
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:20,550
like, "Piss off. I'm done with you guys.
You're You're annoying me." He came in

4658
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:20,560
You're You're annoying me." He came in
 

4659
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,149
You're You're annoying me." He came in
with some serious size there for the

4660
01:40:22,149 --> 01:40:22,159
with some serious size there for the
 

4661
01:40:22,159 --> 01:40:26,149
with some serious size there for the
chase. So that 900s and 890 is big big

4662
01:40:26,149 --> 01:40:26,159
chase. So that 900s and 890 is big big
 

4663
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:27,830
chase. So that 900s and 890 is big big
level now. All right. He came in, he

4664
01:40:27,830 --> 01:40:27,840
level now. All right. He came in, he
 

4665
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,990
level now. All right. He came in, he
chased it down, followed through down

4666
01:40:29,990 --> 01:40:30,000
chased it down, followed through down
 

4667
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,229
chased it down, followed through down
all the way down into 82s. Low of that

4668
01:40:32,229 --> 01:40:32,239
all the way down into 82s. Low of that
 

4669
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:34,470
all the way down into 82s. Low of that
auction was pretty good. So we'll see

4670
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:34,480
auction was pretty good. So we'll see
 

4671
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:36,229
auction was pretty good. So we'll see
his pain point now will be the 900s.

4672
01:40:36,229 --> 01:40:36,239
his pain point now will be the 900s.
 

4673
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:37,830
his pain point now will be the 900s.
It's where he started chasing in for

4674
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:37,840
It's where he started chasing in for
 

4675
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,830
It's where he started chasing in for
some big follow through. He had big big

4676
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:39,840
some big follow through. He had big big
 

4677
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:51,109
some big follow through. He had big big
size.

4678
01:40:51,109 --> 01:40:51,119

 

4679
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:52,950

900 will be his pain point. It's where

4680
01:40:52,950 --> 01:40:52,960
900 will be his pain point. It's where
 

4681
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:55,430
900 will be his pain point. It's where
he came in. If we live through 900, we

4682
01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:55,440
he came in. If we live through 900, we
 

4683
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:57,590
he came in. If we live through 900, we
test 915s. He's still got a passive

4684
01:40:57,590 --> 01:40:57,600
test 915s. He's still got a passive
 

4685
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,990
test 915s. He's still got a passive
order up there.

4686
01:40:59,990 --> 01:41:00,000
order up there.
 

4687
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,750
order up there.
Oh, the chop and the slop. There's

4688
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:01,760
Oh, the chop and the slop. There's
 

4689
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:05,830
Oh, the chop and the slop. There's
nothing to do

4690
01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:05,840

 

4691
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:07,750

still. He's selling. He's selling hard,

4692
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:07,760
still. He's selling. He's selling hard,
 

4693
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,070
still. He's selling. He's selling hard,
hard, hard, hard, hard, hard. Came in

4694
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:10,080
hard, hard, hard, hard, hard. Came in
 

4695
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:13,109
hard, hard, hard, hard, hard. Came in
very aggressive again. So, back into no

4696
01:41:13,109 --> 01:41:13,119
very aggressive again. So, back into no
 

4697
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:14,870
very aggressive again. So, back into no
man's land, the other side of this node.

4698
01:41:14,870 --> 01:41:14,880
man's land, the other side of this node.
 

4699
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,629
man's land, the other side of this node.
If we lose this node, like I said, is

4700
01:41:16,629 --> 01:41:16,639
If we lose this node, like I said, is
 

4701
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:18,229
If we lose this node, like I said, is
likely that we come down into here. So,

4702
01:41:18,229 --> 01:41:18,239
likely that we come down into here. So,
 

4703
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:19,669
likely that we come down into here. So,
no follow through at the top. We didn't

4704
01:41:19,669 --> 01:41:19,679
no follow through at the top. We didn't
 

4705
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:21,590
no follow through at the top. We didn't
even take this high divergence to ES.

4706
01:41:21,590 --> 01:41:21,600
even take this high divergence to ES.
 

4707
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,189
even take this high divergence to ES.
didn't fill this gap. Even ES didn't

4708
01:41:23,189 --> 01:41:23,199
didn't fill this gap. Even ES didn't
 

4709
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:25,590
didn't fill this gap. Even ES didn't
fill that gap, but the spy did. And we

4710
01:41:25,590 --> 01:41:25,600
fill that gap, but the spy did. And we
 

4711
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,430
fill that gap, but the spy did. And we
are losing this. And we might well wash

4712
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:27,440
are losing this. And we might well wash
 

4713
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:29,830
are losing this. And we might well wash
all the way back down now if they do.

4714
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:29,840
all the way back down now if they do.
 

4715
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:32,229
all the way back down now if they do.
Very possible.

4716
01:41:32,229 --> 01:41:32,239
Very possible.
 

4717
01:41:32,239 --> 01:41:37,830
Very possible.
Here's the wash. There you go.

4718
01:41:37,830 --> 01:41:37,840

 

4719
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:40,390

No. No position. No position for me.

4720
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:40,400
No. No position. No position for me.
 

4721
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:45,430
No. No position. No position for me.
Certainly not

4722
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:45,440

 

4723
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,590

not going to trade inside here. I've

4724
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:47,600
not going to trade inside here. I've
 

4725
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,990
not going to trade inside here. I've
I've made that about as clear as I can.

4726
01:41:49,990 --> 01:41:50,000
I've made that about as clear as I can.
 

4727
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,830
I've made that about as clear as I can.
I'm not going to trade inside any of

4728
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:51,840
I'm not going to trade inside any of
 

4729
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,430
I'm not going to trade inside any of
this

4730
01:41:53,430 --> 01:41:53,440
this
 

4731
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,350
this
for this exact reason. Look what they

4732
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:55,360
for this exact reason. Look what they
 

4733
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:59,189
for this exact reason. Look what they
do. They're telling you what they do,

4734
01:41:59,189 --> 01:41:59,199
do. They're telling you what they do,
 

4735
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:01,350
do. They're telling you what they do,
right? It's not just telling you today.

4736
01:42:01,350 --> 01:42:01,360
right? It's not just telling you today.
 

4737
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:03,750
right? It's not just telling you today.
It's telling you overnight. It's telling

4738
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:03,760
It's telling you overnight. It's telling
 

4739
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:07,109

4741
01:42:07,119 --> 01:42:09,030

We can keep looking at this exact level.

4742
01:42:09,030 --> 01:42:09,040
We can keep looking at this exact level.
 

4743
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,590
We can keep looking at this exact level.
Right?

4744
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:11,600
Right?
 

4745
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:21,510
Right?
This is this level.

4746
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:21,520

 

4747
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,189

We'd have to go back to November and

4748
01:42:23,189 --> 01:42:23,199
We'd have to go back to November and
 

4749
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:26,070
We'd have to go back to November and
October. But this same level

4750
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:26,080
October. But this same level
 

4751
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:28,390
October. But this same level
has been traded so many times and it's

4752
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:28,400
has been traded so many times and it's
 

4753
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:44,550
has been traded so many times and it's
sloppy. There you go. Same level, guys.

Tesla's absolutely screaming right now,
which is probably holding ENQ up pretty

4970
01:50:04,790 --> 01:50:04,800
which is probably holding ENQ up pretty
 

4971
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:09,430
which is probably holding ENQ up pretty
well.

4972
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:09,440

 

4973
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:11,109

Look at that relative strength all the

4974
01:50:11,109 --> 01:50:11,119
Look at that relative strength all the
 

4975
01:50:11,119 --> 01:50:12,550
Look at that relative strength all the
way up into the old highs. It might come

4976
01:50:12,550 --> 01:50:12,560
way up into the old highs. It might come
 

4977
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:14,070
way up into the old highs. It might come
up for one more test and then see if

4978
01:50:14,070 --> 01:50:14,080
up for one more test and then see if
 

4979
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:16,790
up for one more test and then see if
they fade it.

4980
01:50:16,790 --> 01:50:16,800
they fade it.
 

4981
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,709
they fade it.
So, I'd imagine Tesla will at least test

4982
01:50:18,709 --> 01:50:18,719
So, I'd imagine Tesla will at least test
 

4983
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:21,669
So, I'd imagine Tesla will at least test
this. If not, wick that and then see if

4984
01:50:21,669 --> 01:50:21,679
this. If not, wick that and then see if
 

4985
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:23,510
this. If not, wick that and then see if
it rolls over. And then once it does

4986
01:50:23,510 --> 01:50:23,520
it rolls over. And then once it does
 

4987
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:25,350
it rolls over. And then once it does
that, maybe you'll see acceptance lower

4988
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:25,360
that, maybe you'll see acceptance lower
 

4989
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,870
that, maybe you'll see acceptance lower
if the rest of the market wants to join

if the rest of the market wants to join
 

4991
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:33,189

4993
01:50:33,199 --> 01:50:34,870

4997
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:39,990
we've had all days, right? 850 860s up
here is the same level that we talked

4998
01:50:39,990 --> 01:50:40,000
here is the same level that we talked
 

4999
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,669
here is the same level that we talked
about all day where we tested here and

5000
01:50:41,669 --> 01:50:41,679
about all day where we tested here and
 

5001
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:43,750
about all day where we tested here and
failed, right? We're now starting to

5002
01:50:43,750 --> 01:50:43,760
failed, right? We're now starting to
 

5003
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:45,590
failed, right? We're now starting to
just build a ton of liquidity out here.

5004
01:50:45,590 --> 01:50:45,600
just build a ton of liquidity out here.

talked about in Discord, right? We

5028
01:51:25,109 --> 01:51:25,119
talked about in Discord, right? We
 

5029
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:28,629
talked about in Discord, right? We
expect rotation.

5030
01:51:28,629 --> 01:51:28,639
expect rotation.
 

5031
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:31,430
expect rotation.
We expect rotation. It's our expectation

5032
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:31,440
We expect rotation. It's our expectation
 

5033
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:54,790
We expect rotation. It's our expectation
today.

5034
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:54,800

 

5035
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:56,709

Where do you get data about buyers and

5036
01:51:56,709 --> 01:51:56,719
Where do you get data about buyers and
 

5037
01:51:56,719 --> 01:51:58,470
Where do you get data about buyers and
sellers? You would need to use a

5038
01:51:58,470 --> 01:51:58,480
sellers? You would need to use a
 

5039
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:02,229
sellers? You would need to use a
footprint indicator or bookmap,

5040
01:52:02,229 --> 01:52:02,239
footprint indicator or bookmap,
 

5041
01:52:02,239 --> 01:52:03,750
footprint indicator or bookmap,
right? You need footprint charts or

5042
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:03,760
right? You need footprint charts or
 

5043
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:06,070
right? You need footprint charts or
bookmap.

5044
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:06,080
bookmap.
 

5045
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,270
bookmap.
You would need to understand what you're

5046
01:52:07,270 --> 01:52:07,280
You would need to understand what you're
 

5047
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:08,629
You would need to understand what you're
looking at as well. So, we're still

5048
01:52:08,629 --> 01:52:08,639
looking at as well. So, we're still
 

5049
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:10,629
looking at as well. So, we're still
holding for now. Still holding previous

5050
01:52:10,629 --> 01:52:10,639
holding for now. Still holding previous
 

5051
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:13,030
holding for now. Still holding previous
week value area high. I want to see if

5052
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:13,040
week value area high. I want to see if
 

5053
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:14,629
week value area high. I want to see if
we flush under this or if we're going to

5054
01:52:14,629 --> 01:52:14,639
we flush under this or if we're going to
 

5055
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:20,790
we flush under this or if we're going to
rebid and rotate again.

5056
01:52:20,790 --> 01:52:20,800

 

5057
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:23,189

We're just pinned. We are pinned between

5058
01:52:23,189 --> 01:52:23,199
We're just pinned. We are pinned between
 

5059
01:52:23,199 --> 01:52:26,950
We're just pinned. We are pinned between
5day and 20 days right now.

5060
01:52:26,950 --> 01:52:26,960
5day and 20 days right now.
 

5061
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:29,189
5day and 20 days right now.
Willing to play lower. Again, same thing

5062
01:52:29,189 --> 01:52:29,199
Willing to play lower. Again, same thing
 

5063
01:52:29,199 --> 01:52:31,030
Willing to play lower. Again, same thing
if we move outside of range. Otherwise,

5064
01:52:31,030 --> 01:52:31,040
if we move outside of range. Otherwise,
 

5065
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:32,550
if we move outside of range. Otherwise,
not willing to play it. Willing to play

5066
01:52:32,550 --> 01:52:32,560
not willing to play it. Willing to play
 

5067
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:35,189
not willing to play it. Willing to play
higher if we move outside of range. I

5068
01:52:35,189 --> 01:52:35,199
higher if we move outside of range. I
 

5069
01:52:35,199 --> 01:52:37,430
higher if we move outside of range. I
use a 1 minute, a 5 minute, and like

5070
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:37,440
use a 1 minute, a 5 minute, and like
 

5071
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,510
use a 1 minute, a 5 minute, and like
sometimes I'll look at like a 30 or even

5072
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:39,520
sometimes I'll look at like a 30 or even
 

5073
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,350
sometimes I'll look at like a 30 or even
a daily sometimes just to see key levels

5074
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:41,360
a daily sometimes just to see key levels
 

5075
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:43,669
a daily sometimes just to see key levels
from the day before. But one and five

5076
01:52:43,669 --> 01:52:43,679
from the day before. But one and five
 

5077
01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:46,229
from the day before. But one and five
are my main areas like in this current

5078
01:52:46,229 --> 01:52:46,239
are my main areas like in this current
 

5079
01:52:46,239 --> 01:52:48,310
are my main areas like in this current
fiveminute bar, right? Buyers keep

5080
01:52:48,310 --> 01:52:48,320
fiveminute bar, right? Buyers keep
 

5081
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:50,550
fiveminute bar, right? Buyers keep
stepping in over 42s and failing.

5082
01:52:50,550 --> 01:52:50,560
stepping in over 42s and failing.
 

5083
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:52,629
stepping in over 42s and failing.
Sellers keep stepping in under that and

5084
01:52:52,629 --> 01:52:52,639
Sellers keep stepping in under that and
 

5085
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:54,629
Sellers keep stepping in under that and
failing. So that's like the key level

5086
01:52:54,629 --> 01:52:54,639
failing. So that's like the key level
 

5087
01:52:54,639 --> 01:52:56,709
failing. So that's like the key level
right now is that the 42s in this bar.

5088
01:52:56,709 --> 01:52:56,719
right now is that the 42s in this bar.
 

5089
01:52:56,719 --> 01:52:58,709
right now is that the 42s in this bar.
If we look at the previous couple bars,

5090
01:52:58,709 --> 01:52:58,719
If we look at the previous couple bars,
 

5091
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:01,589
If we look at the previous couple bars,
we had buyers step in at 60s

5092
01:53:01,589 --> 01:53:01,599
we had buyers step in at 60s
 

5093
01:53:01,599 --> 01:53:04,229
we had buyers step in at 60s
and no acceptance. So we're just stuck

5094
01:53:04,229 --> 01:53:04,239
and no acceptance. So we're just stuck
 

5095
01:53:04,239 --> 01:53:07,910
and no acceptance. So we're just stuck
right between 60s and basically this low

5096
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:07,920
right between 60s and basically this low
 

5097
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,229
right between 60s and basically this low
here, 30s. We're just completely stuck

5098
01:53:10,229 --> 01:53:10,239
here, 30s. We're just completely stuck
 

5099
01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:15,510
here, 30s. We're just completely stuck
right now.

5100
01:53:15,510 --> 01:53:15,520

 

5101
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,510

footprint on Trading View on Ninja.

5102
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:17,520
footprint on Trading View on Ninja.
 

5103
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:19,030
footprint on Trading View on Ninja.
Probably a little bit better on Ninja,

5104
01:53:19,030 --> 01:53:19,040
Probably a little bit better on Ninja,
 

5105
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:21,109
Probably a little bit better on Ninja,
but I mean

5106
01:53:21,109 --> 01:53:21,119
but I mean
 

5107
01:53:21,119 --> 01:53:23,030
but I mean
the Trading View one I I actually do

5108
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:23,040
the Trading View one I I actually do
 

5109
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:25,350
the Trading View one I I actually do
like I think it looks pretty good. I

5110
01:53:25,350 --> 01:53:25,360
like I think it looks pretty good. I
 

5111
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:28,550
like I think it looks pretty good. I
think it's pretty easy to read. Heavy

5112
01:53:28,550 --> 01:53:28,560
think it's pretty easy to read. Heavy
 

5113
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:30,070
think it's pretty easy to read. Heavy
Delta coming in here. Let's see if they

5114
01:53:30,070 --> 01:53:30,080
Delta coming in here. Let's see if they
 

5115
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:31,910
Delta coming in here. Let's see if they
get follow through. They're trying to

5116
01:53:31,910 --> 01:53:31,920
get follow through. They're trying to
 

5117
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:37,510
get follow through. They're trying to
step on the book here.

5118
01:53:37,510 --> 01:53:37,520

 

5119
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:40,950

These 50s and 60s keep rejecting. We're

5120
01:53:40,950 --> 01:53:40,960
These 50s and 60s keep rejecting. We're
 

5121
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:42,229
These 50s and 60s keep rejecting. We're
starting to get under it. But we have

5122
01:53:42,229 --> 01:53:42,239
starting to get under it. But we have
 

5123
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:43,990
starting to get under it. But we have
now a base that we created this morning

5124
01:53:43,990 --> 01:53:44,000
now a base that we created this morning
 

5125
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,510
now a base that we created this morning
from this little imbalance. So maybe we

5126
01:53:45,510 --> 01:53:45,520
from this little imbalance. So maybe we
 

5127
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:46,950
from this little imbalance. So maybe we
fill the imbalance. Imbalance is all the

5128
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:46,960
fill the imbalance. Imbalance is all the
 

5129
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:49,669
fill the imbalance. Imbalance is all the
way down to 15s. 8:15 is the actual

5130
01:53:49,669 --> 01:53:49,679
way down to 15s. 8:15 is the actual
 

5131
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:51,430
way down to 15s. 8:15 is the actual
imbalance. It's actually here. It's not

5132
01:53:51,430 --> 01:53:51,440
imbalance. It's actually here. It's not
 

5133
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:54,149
imbalance. It's actually here. It's not
this whole thing. Actually 8:15 is the

5134
01:53:54,149 --> 01:53:54,159
this whole thing. Actually 8:15 is the
 

5135
01:53:54,159 --> 01:53:56,229
this whole thing. Actually 8:15 is the
imbalance.

5136
01:53:56,229 --> 01:53:56,239
imbalance.
 

5137
01:53:56,239 --> 01:54:02,310
imbalance.
There's the 20s.

5138
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:02,320

 

5139
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:04,149

Seller came in at 25s there and got

5140
01:54:04,149 --> 01:54:04,159
Seller came in at 25s there and got
 

5141
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:07,030
Seller came in at 25s there and got
himself caught

5142
01:54:07,030 --> 01:54:07,040
himself caught
 

5143
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:12,310
himself caught
as they continue to rotate.

5144
01:54:12,310 --> 01:54:12,320

 

5145
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,229

What is easier to decipher at a glance,

5146
01:54:14,229 --> 01:54:14,239
What is easier to decipher at a glance,
 

5147
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:17,910
What is easier to decipher at a glance,
footprint or bookmap? Um,

5148
01:54:17,910 --> 01:54:17,920
footprint or bookmap? Um,
 

5149
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:19,830
footprint or bookmap? Um,
that's a really good question. They're

5150
01:54:19,830 --> 01:54:19,840
that's a really good question. They're
 

5151
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:22,070
that's a really good question. They're
both the honestly they're both exactly

5152
01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:22,080
both the honestly they're both exactly
 

5153
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:25,109
both the honestly they're both exactly
the same. Um, I'd say bookmap's easier

5154
01:54:25,109 --> 01:54:25,119
the same. Um, I'd say bookmap's easier
 

5155
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:27,589
the same. Um, I'd say bookmap's easier
to see like the current momentum because

5156
01:54:27,589 --> 01:54:27,599
to see like the current momentum because
 

5157
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:30,149
to see like the current momentum because
the bubbles are showing you like the

5158
01:54:30,149 --> 01:54:30,159
the bubbles are showing you like the
 

5159
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:33,030
the bubbles are showing you like the
runs on market liquidity. And the other

5160
01:54:33,030 --> 01:54:33,040
runs on market liquidity. And the other
 

5161
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:34,709
runs on market liquidity. And the other
thing with bookmap that you get that you

5162
01:54:34,709 --> 01:54:34,719
thing with bookmap that you get that you
 

5163
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:37,750
thing with bookmap that you get that you
don't get on uh on footprint charts is

5164
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:37,760
don't get on uh on footprint charts is
 

5165
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:39,270
don't get on uh on footprint charts is
the resting liquidity. On a footprint

5166
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:39,280
the resting liquidity. On a footprint
 

5167
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:40,470
the resting liquidity. On a footprint
chart, you can't see the resting

5168
01:54:40,470 --> 01:54:40,480
chart, you can't see the resting
 

5169
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:52,470
chart, you can't see the resting
liquidity. So maybe maybe bookm

5170
01:54:52,470 --> 01:54:52,480

 

5171
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:54,790

like gaps and liquidity in the market.

5172
01:54:54,790 --> 01:54:54,800
like gaps and liquidity in the market.
 

5173
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:56,550
like gaps and liquidity in the market.
They just held this rotation again back

5174
01:54:56,550 --> 01:54:56,560
They just held this rotation again back
 

5175
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,229
They just held this rotation again back
through the 50s. Now squeeze back up

5176
01:54:58,229 --> 01:54:58,239
through the 50s. Now squeeze back up
 

5177
01:54:58,239 --> 01:54:59,990
through the 50s. Now squeeze back up
into this gray box. Now they have to see

5178
01:54:59,990 --> 01:55:00,000
into this gray box. Now they have to see
 

5179
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,430
into this gray box. Now they have to see
if they reject the gray box and come

5180
01:55:01,430 --> 01:55:01,440
if they reject the gray box and come
 

5181
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:03,350
if they reject the gray box and come
down or if they reclaim the gray box and

5182
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:03,360
down or if they reclaim the gray box and
 

5183
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:05,430
down or if they reclaim the gray box and
go again. It's just getting pretty

5184
01:55:05,430 --> 01:55:05,440
go again. It's just getting pretty
 

5185
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:09,430
go again. It's just getting pretty
shitty in here, guys. Not much to do.

5186
01:55:09,430 --> 01:55:09,440
shitty in here, guys. Not much to do.
 

5187
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,910
shitty in here, guys. Not much to do.
Yes, absolutely. Rotation is absolutely

5188
01:55:11,910 --> 01:55:11,920
Yes, absolutely. Rotation is absolutely
 

5189
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:13,510
Yes, absolutely. Rotation is absolutely
the name of the game today. So, up to

5190
01:55:13,510 --> 01:55:13,520
the name of the game today. So, up to
 

5191
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,030
the name of the game today. So, up to
that gray box. So far, they can't get

5192
01:55:15,030 --> 01:55:15,040
that gray box. So far, they can't get
 

5193
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:17,750
that gray box. So far, they can't get
through the gray box. So, rotation back

5194
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:17,760
through the gray box. So, rotation back
 

5195
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:18,950
through the gray box. So, rotation back
down to where we just came from. There

5196
01:55:18,950 --> 01:55:18,960
down to where we just came from. There
 

5197
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:21,270
down to where we just came from. There
you go. Again, they're just small

5198
01:55:21,270 --> 01:55:21,280
you go. Again, they're just small
 

5199
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:23,350
you go. Again, they're just small
rotations now as well inside a bigger

5200
01:55:23,350 --> 01:55:23,360
rotations now as well inside a bigger
 

5201
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:26,229
rotations now as well inside a bigger
rotation. It's very choppy area like we

5202
01:55:26,229 --> 01:55:26,239
rotation. It's very choppy area like we
 

5203
01:55:26,239 --> 01:55:27,510
rotation. It's very choppy area like we
talked about at the beginning of stream

5204
01:55:27,510 --> 01:55:27,520
talked about at the beginning of stream
 

5205
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:29,669
talked about at the beginning of stream
going back to

right? We're at a thousand yet. We're

5212
01:55:38,709 --> 01:55:38,719
right? We're at a thousand yet. We're
 

5213
01:55:38,719 --> 01:55:41,589
right? We're at a thousand yet. We're
still not a thousand. Come on, guys. We

5214
01:55:41,589 --> 01:55:41,599
still not a thousand. Come on, guys. We
 

5215
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:44,070
still not a thousand. Come on, guys. We
need like 125 of you to hit the like

5216
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:44,080
need like 125 of you to hit the like
 

5217
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:47,910
need like 125 of you to hit the like

No, imbalances are not fair value gaps.

5220
01:55:50,070 --> 01:55:50,080
No, imbalances are not fair value gaps.
 

5221
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:51,510
No, imbalances are not fair value gaps.
It's the same thing, but look, the

5222
01:55:51,510 --> 01:55:51,520
It's the same thing, but look, the
 

5223
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:53,350
It's the same thing, but look, the
difference is is you guys mark the whole

5224
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:53,360
difference is is you guys mark the whole
 

5225
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:56,470
difference is is you guys mark the whole
area. And I'd need to turn it on on here

5226
01:55:56,470 --> 01:55:56,480
area. And I'd need to turn it on on here
 

5227
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:59,830
area. And I'd need to turn it on on here
because I don't have it on. But

5228
01:55:59,830 --> 01:55:59,840
because I don't have it on. But
 

5229
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:03,189
because I don't have it on. But
uh

5230
01:56:03,189 --> 01:56:03,199

 

5231
01:56:03,199 --> 01:56:14,070

5235
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:21,750

Okay, here you see this imbalance. You

5236
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:21,760
Okay, here you see this imbalance. You
 

5237
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:23,350
Okay, here you see this imbalance. You
guys would mark it out as the whole

5238
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:23,360
guys would mark it out as the whole
 

5239
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:25,350
guys would mark it out as the whole
thing. you guys would mark this whole

01:56:25,350 --> 01:56:25,360
thing. you guys would mark this whole
 

5241
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:28,149
thing. you guys would mark this whole
thing out. The imbalance actually isn't

5242
01:56:28,149 --> 01:56:28,159
thing out. The imbalance actually isn't
 

5243
01:56:28,159 --> 01:56:31,270
thing out. The imbalance actually isn't
down until here,

5244
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:31,280
down until here,
 

5245
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:32,629
down until here,
right? That's where they didn't get

5246
01:56:32,629 --> 01:56:32,639
right? That's where they didn't get
 

5247
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:34,629
right? That's where they didn't get
filled.

5248
01:56:34,629 --> 01:56:34,639
filled.
 

5249
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:37,350
filled.
So, the same principle, but accuracy is

5250
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:37,360
So, the same principle, but accuracy is
 

5251
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:39,350
So, the same principle, but accuracy is
different when you actually see the

5252
01:56:39,350 --> 01:56:39,360
different when you actually see the
 

5253
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:40,790
different when you actually see the
order flow. And actually, it's even

5254
01:56:40,790 --> 01:56:40,800
order flow. And actually, it's even
 

5255
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:46,629
order flow. And actually, it's even
better on Ninja if I'm honest.

5256
01:56:46,629 --> 01:56:46,639

 

5257
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:48,149

How do I get that page on Trading View?

5258
01:56:48,149 --> 01:56:48,159
How do I get that page on Trading View?

think I put that out.

5270
01:57:04,470 --> 01:57:04,480

 

5271
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:06,950

Yeah, I know FC Mike. It's crazy. It's

5272
01:57:06,950 --> 01:57:06,960
Yeah, I know FC Mike. It's crazy. It's
 

5273
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:08,709
Yeah, I know FC Mike. It's crazy. It's
been nuts. It has been nuts. All right,

5274
01:57:08,709 --> 01:57:08,719
been nuts. It has been nuts. All right,
 

5275
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:11,910
been nuts. It has been nuts. All right,
so gray box to previous week value area

5276
01:57:11,910 --> 01:57:11,920
so gray box to previous week value area
 

5277
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:15,109
so gray box to previous week value area
high is the rotation right now. Still no

5278
01:57:15,109 --> 01:57:15,119
high is the rotation right now. Still no
 

5279
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:24,070
high is the rotation right now. Still no
follow through either side of this.

5280
01:57:24,070 --> 01:57:24,080

 

5281
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:27,270

VIX reclaiming PDC. Let's see if VIX

5282
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:27,280
VIX reclaiming PDC. Let's see if VIX
 

5283
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:30,149
VIX reclaiming PDC. Let's see if VIX
wants to get back up into the 1750s,

5284
01:57:30,149 --> 01:57:30,159
wants to get back up into the 1750s,
 

5285
01:57:30,159 --> 01:57:31,669
wants to get back up into the 1750s,
which would give downside follow through

5286
01:57:31,669 --> 01:57:31,679
which would give downside follow through
 

5287
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:33,910
which would give downside follow through
if it does.

5288
01:57:33,910 --> 01:57:33,920
if it does.
 

5289
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:35,270
if it does.
Yes, right into that New York open.

5290
01:57:35,270 --> 01:57:35,280
Yes, right into that New York open.
 

5291
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:36,629
Yes, right into that New York open.
Let's see if it loses this New York

5292
01:57:36,629 --> 01:57:36,639
Let's see if it loses this New York
 

5293
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:38,470
Let's see if it loses this New York
open. So, these 50s and 60s, same kind

5294
01:57:38,470 --> 01:57:38,480
open. So, these 50s and 60s, same kind
 

5295
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:40,470
open. So, these 50s and 60s, same kind
of level as we had earlier. Same kind of

5296
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:40,480
of level as we had earlier. Same kind of
 

5297
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,229
of level as we had earlier. Same kind of
level starting to reject. Now, we're

5298
01:57:42,229 --> 01:57:42,239
level starting to reject. Now, we're
 

5299
01:57:42,239 --> 01:57:43,669
level starting to reject. Now, we're
coming down towards this imbalance we

5300
01:57:43,669 --> 01:57:43,679
coming down towards this imbalance we
 

5301
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:45,750
coming down towards this imbalance we
talked about all the way down into 15,

5302
01:57:45,750 --> 01:57:45,760
talked about all the way down into 15,
 

5303
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:47,270
talked about all the way down into 15,
right? And let's see if they bid around

5304
01:57:47,270 --> 01:57:47,280
right? And let's see if they bid around
 

5305
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:50,310
right? And let's see if they bid around
these 15s. As we just talked about it

5306
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:50,320
these 15s. As we just talked about it
 

5307
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:52,550
these 15s. As we just talked about it
here, this is the actual imbalance which

5308
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:52,560
here, this is the actual imbalance which
 

5309
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:53,990
here, this is the actual imbalance which
we're coming down towards all the way

5310
01:57:53,990 --> 01:57:54,000
we're coming down towards all the way
 

5311
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,149
we're coming down towards all the way
down to I actually have it on Ninja is

5312
01:57:56,149 --> 01:57:56,159
down to I actually have it on Ninja is
 

5313
01:57:56,159 --> 01:57:59,430
down to I actually have it on Ninja is
like 17 to 14 is like the big big level

5314
01:57:59,430 --> 01:57:59,440
like 17 to 14 is like the big big level
 

5315
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:08,790
like 17 to 14 is like the big big level
of that. Let's see.

5316
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:08,800

 

5317
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:10,470

For footprints, yeah, for footprints I

5318
01:58:10,470 --> 01:58:10,480
For footprints, yeah, for footprints I
 

5319
01:58:10,480 --> 01:58:12,390
For footprints, yeah, for footprints I
use a one minute and a five minute.

5320
01:58:12,390 --> 01:58:12,400
use a one minute and a five minute.
 

5321
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:14,550
use a one minute and a five minute.
Sometimes I'll just peak the 30.

5322
01:58:14,550 --> 01:58:14,560
Sometimes I'll just peak the 30.
 

5323
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:16,629
Sometimes I'll just peak the 30.
actually that like

5324
01:58:16,629 --> 01:58:16,639
actually that like
 

5325
01:58:16,639 --> 01:58:19,350
actually that like
one and five is enough like this is my

5326
01:58:19,350 --> 01:58:19,360
one and five is enough like this is my
 

5327
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:21,189
one and five is enough like this is my
five over here which I have up all the

5328
01:58:21,189 --> 01:58:21,199
five over here which I have up all the
 

5329
01:58:21,199 --> 01:58:23,589
five over here which I have up all the
time right so it's my delta build out

5330
01:58:23,589 --> 01:58:23,599
time right so it's my delta build out
 

5331
01:58:23,599 --> 01:58:25,270
time right so it's my delta build out
here I can see the key levels of where

5332
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:25,280
here I can see the key levels of where
 

5333
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,669
here I can see the key levels of where
the sellers got stuck or sellers came in

5334
01:58:27,669 --> 01:58:27,679
the sellers got stuck or sellers came in
 

5335
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:30,390
the sellers got stuck or sellers came in
hard at 60 imbalances here you can see

5336
01:58:30,390 --> 01:58:30,400

02:02:42,159 --> 02:02:44,950
it also matters where we open up. All
right, so yesterday was a big B shape,

5494
02:02:44,950 --> 02:02:44,960
right, so yesterday was a big B shape,
 

5495
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:46,470
right, so yesterday was a big B shape,
right? If you go from the open, it was a

5496
02:02:46,470 --> 02:02:46,480
right? If you go from the open, it was a
 

5497
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:48,870
right? If you go from the open, it was a
B-shape, but we were we are still

5498
02:02:48,870 --> 02:02:48,880
B-shape, but we were we are still
 

5499
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:50,870
B-shape, but we were we are still
basically trading inside of yesterday,

5500
02:02:50,870 --> 02:02:50,880
basically trading inside of yesterday,
 

5501
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:53,510
basically trading inside of yesterday,
aren't we? Right. So if we think about

5502
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:53,520
aren't we? Right. So if we think about
 

5503
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:55,669
aren't we? Right. So if we think about
yesterday,

5504
02:02:55,669 --> 02:02:55,679
yesterday,
 

5505
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:59,510
yesterday,
yesterday's value was here.

5506
02:02:59,510 --> 02:02:59,520
yesterday's value was here.
 

5507
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:01,990
yesterday's value was here.
We are not moving value up, are we?

5508
02:03:01,990 --> 02:03:02,000
We are not moving value up, are we?
 

5509
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,550
We are not moving value up, are we?
We're not moving value higher, right?

5510
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:04,560
We're not moving value higher, right?
 

5511
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:06,310
We're not moving value higher, right?
We're trading in the same level. In

5512
02:03:06,310 --> 02:03:06,320
We're trading in the same level. In
 

5513
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:07,430
We're trading in the same level. In
fact, we're trading right around

5514
02:03:07,430 --> 02:03:07,440
fact, we're trading right around
 

5515
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:08,870
fact, we're trading right around
previous days value area high and point

5516
02:03:08,870 --> 02:03:08,880
previous days value area high and point
 

5517
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:11,109
previous days value area high and point
of control. Right? This was fair value

5518
02:03:11,109 --> 02:03:11,119
of control. Right? This was fair value
 

5519
02:03:11,119 --> 02:03:13,350
of control. Right? This was fair value
yesterday. If we decide yesterday's fair

5520
02:03:13,350 --> 02:03:13,360
yesterday. If we decide yesterday's fair
 

5521
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:15,350
yesterday. If we decide yesterday's fair
value is too expensive, then we can

5522
02:03:15,350 --> 02:03:15,360
value is too expensive, then we can
 

5523
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:17,430
value is too expensive, then we can
think about these rotations down here,

5524
02:03:17,430 --> 02:03:17,440
think about these rotations down here,
 

5525
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:18,629
think about these rotations down here,
which is what I'm willing to play

5526
02:03:18,629 --> 02:03:18,639
which is what I'm willing to play
 

5527
02:03:18,639 --> 02:03:20,790
which is what I'm willing to play
outside of here. At the moment, we're

5528
02:03:20,790 --> 02:03:20,800
outside of here. At the moment, we're
 

5529
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:22,950
outside of here. At the moment, we're
not able to do that. All right. And

5530
02:03:22,950 --> 02:03:22,960
not able to do that. All right. And
 

5531
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:24,310
not able to do that. All right. And
we're not able to decide that

5532
02:03:24,310 --> 02:03:24,320
we're not able to decide that
 

5533
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:26,229
we're not able to decide that
yesterday's value was too cheap and move

5534
02:03:26,229 --> 02:03:26,239
yesterday's value was too cheap and move
 

5535
02:03:26,239 --> 02:03:27,589
yesterday's value was too cheap and move
it up. So, we're just creating more

5536
02:03:27,589 --> 02:03:27,599
it up. So, we're just creating more
 

5537
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:30,470
it up. So, we're just creating more
liquidity out.

5538
02:03:30,470 --> 02:03:30,480
liquidity out.
 

5539
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:32,950
liquidity out.
Watching this now, zooming in now to see

5540
02:03:32,950 --> 02:03:32,960
Watching this now, zooming in now to see
 

5541
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:34,470
Watching this now, zooming in now to see
if we're going to find acceptance lower

5542
02:03:34,470 --> 02:03:34,480
if we're going to find acceptance lower
 

5543
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:36,950
if we're going to find acceptance lower
at this point back to that old

5544
02:03:36,950 --> 02:03:36,960
at this point back to that old
 

5545
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:38,709
at this point back to that old
imbalance. Can we come and flush down

5546
02:03:38,709 --> 02:03:38,719
imbalance. Can we come and flush down
 

5547
02:03:38,719 --> 02:03:40,229
imbalance. Can we come and flush down
underneath all of this now? Are we going

5548
02:03:40,229 --> 02:03:40,239
underneath all of this now? Are we going
 

5549
02:03:40,239 --> 02:03:42,070
underneath all of this now? Are we going
to get acceptance underneath this gray

5550
02:03:42,070 --> 02:03:42,080
to get acceptance underneath this gray
 

5551
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:44,709
to get acceptance underneath this gray
box and really start working our way

5552
02:03:44,709 --> 02:03:44,719
box and really start working our way
 

5553
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:48,870
box and really start working our way
into 39s and 700s, 690s, and maybe even

5554
02:03:48,870 --> 02:03:48,880
into 39s and 700s, 690s, and maybe even
 

5555
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:51,510
into 39s and 700s, 690s, and maybe even
650s if we got very lucky? Big big ask

5556
02:03:51,510 --> 02:03:51,520
650s if we got very lucky? Big big ask
 

5557
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:53,350
650s if we got very lucky? Big big ask
for the day because we've not been able

5558
02:03:53,350 --> 02:03:53,360
for the day because we've not been able
 

5559
02:03:53,360 --> 02:04:03,750
for the day because we've not been able
to move outside of anything yet.

5560
02:04:03,750 --> 02:04:03,760

 

5561
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:05,669

Alex, can I ask what website you use to

5562
02:04:05,669 --> 02:04:05,679
Alex, can I ask what website you use to
 

5563
02:04:05,679 --> 02:04:08,229
Alex, can I ask what website you use to
see the sectors like uh healthcare, tech

5564
02:04:08,229 --> 02:04:08,239
see the sectors like uh healthcare, tech
 

5565
02:04:08,239 --> 02:04:12,310
see the sectors like uh healthcare, tech
stocks? Uh, yes. I I use Finn Viz. All

5566
02:04:12,310 --> 02:04:12,320
stocks? Uh, yes. I I use Finn Viz. All
 

5567
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:15,270
stocks? Uh, yes. I I use Finn Viz. All
right. So, I use it for my scans as well

5568
02:04:15,270 --> 02:04:15,280
right. So, I use it for my scans as well
 

5569
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:18,070
right. So, I use it for my scans as well
for swings. It's free. You can just log

5570
02:04:18,070 --> 02:04:18,080
for swings. It's free. You can just log
 

5571
02:04:18,080 --> 02:04:21,430
for swings. It's free. You can just log
in. So, it will probably freeze. It

5572
02:04:21,430 --> 02:04:21,440
in. So, it will probably freeze. It
 

5573
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:23,350
in. So, it will probably freeze. It
always freezes when I seem to do it on

5574
02:04:23,350 --> 02:04:23,360
always freezes when I seem to do it on
 

5575
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:32,070
always freezes when I seem to do it on
stream up here. Right. So, Finn Viz,

5576
02:04:32,070 --> 02:04:32,080

 

5577
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:33,750

it's already frozen. It's such a dodgy

5578
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:33,760
it's already frozen. It's such a dodgy
 

5579
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:36,310
it's already frozen. It's such a dodgy
website. Come on. It really does not

5580
02:04:36,310 --> 02:04:36,320
website. Come on. It really does not
 

5581
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:38,390
website. Come on. It really does not
like this site for some reason. Give it

5582
02:04:38,390 --> 02:04:38,400
like this site for some reason. Give it
 

5583
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:47,189
like this site for some reason. Give it
a second.

5584
02:04:47,189 --> 02:04:47,199

 

5585
02:04:47,199 --> 02:04:49,109

Give that a second to load. There we go.

5586
02:04:49,109 --> 02:04:49,119
Give that a second to load. There we go.
 

5587
02:04:49,119 --> 02:04:51,189
Give that a second to load. There we go.
All right. So, if you come down. All

5588
02:04:51,189 --> 02:04:51,199
All right. So, if you come down. All
 

5589
02:04:51,199 --> 02:04:53,109
All right. So, if you come down. All
right. That shows you the breadth. As

5590
02:04:53,109 --> 02:04:53,119
right. That shows you the breadth. As
 

5591
02:04:53,119 --> 02:04:54,229
right. That shows you the breadth. As
you can see, healthcare is starting to

5592
02:04:54,229 --> 02:04:54,239
you can see, healthcare is starting to
 

5593
02:04:54,239 --> 02:04:55,669
you can see, healthcare is starting to
go red. It was very green this morning.

5594
02:04:55,669 --> 02:04:55,679
go red. It was very green this morning.
 

5595
02:04:55,679 --> 02:04:57,669
go red. It was very green this morning.
So, ES starting to sell off now. You can

5596
02:04:57,669 --> 02:04:57,679
So, ES starting to sell off now. You can
 

5597
02:04:57,679 --> 02:05:00,149
So, ES starting to sell off now. You can
see the sectors. And if you go here,

5598
02:05:00,149 --> 02:05:00,159
see the sectors. And if you go here,
 

5599
02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:02,229
see the sectors. And if you go here,
you'll see like all the top gainers and

5600
02:05:02,229 --> 02:05:02,239
you'll see like all the top gainers and
 

5601
02:05:02,239 --> 02:05:04,229
you'll see like all the top gainers and
the top losers. And you can actually

5602
02:05:04,229 --> 02:05:04,239
the top losers. And you can actually
 

5603
02:05:04,239 --> 02:05:05,750
the top losers. And you can actually
create some scans, right? So, if you go

5604
02:05:05,750 --> 02:05:05,760
create some scans, right? So, if you go
 

5605
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:07,270
create some scans, right? So, if you go
to screener, if you're looking for

5606
02:05:07,270 --> 02:05:07,280
to screener, if you're looking for
 

5607
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:08,870
to screener, if you're looking for
stocks, you can scan things like over

5608
02:05:08,870 --> 02:05:08,880
stocks, you can scan things like over
 

5609
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:12,390
stocks, you can scan things like over
the 50-day or x amount of days up or PE

5610
02:05:12,390 --> 02:05:12,400
the 50-day or x amount of days up or PE
 

5611
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:14,310
the 50-day or x amount of days up or PE
ratio, all lots lots of things. I go

5612
02:05:14,310 --> 02:05:14,320
ratio, all lots lots of things. I go
 

5613
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:20,229
ratio, all lots lots of things. I go
through it all in the course.

5614
02:05:20,229 --> 02:05:20,239

 

5615
02:05:20,239 --> 02:05:21,830

Okay, back to the gray box. So, we're

5616
02:05:21,830 --> 02:05:21,840
Okay, back to the gray box. So, we're
 

5617
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:24,390
Okay, back to the gray box. So, we're
starting to see potential acceptance of

5618
02:05:24,390 --> 02:05:24,400
starting to see potential acceptance of
 

5619
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:28,070
starting to see potential acceptance of
lower prices here

5620
02:05:28,070 --> 02:05:28,080

 

5621
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:29,830

back into that key area, initial balance

5622
02:05:29,830 --> 02:05:29,840
back into that key area, initial balance
 

5623
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:31,350
back into that key area, initial balance
low. We're starting to see potential

5624
02:05:31,350 --> 02:05:31,360
low. We're starting to see potential
 

5625
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:33,030
low. We're starting to see potential
acceptance of lower prices here. If we

5626
02:05:33,030 --> 02:05:33,040
acceptance of lower prices here. If we
 

5627
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:34,950
acceptance of lower prices here. If we
start breaking down away from these

5628
02:05:34,950 --> 02:05:34,960
start breaking down away from these
 

5629
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:37,350
start breaking down away from these
levels now, back down towards this gray

5630
02:05:37,350 --> 02:05:37,360
levels now, back down towards this gray
 

5631
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:38,709
levels now, back down towards this gray
box where we found a bid earlier.

5632
02:05:38,709 --> 02:05:38,719
box where we found a bid earlier.
 

5633
02:05:38,719 --> 02:05:41,109
box where we found a bid earlier.
Remember, this is off previous days

5634
02:05:41,109 --> 02:05:41,119
Remember, this is off previous days
 

5635
02:05:41,119 --> 02:05:44,709
Remember, this is off previous days
profile. Right? When we look left or the

5636
02:05:44,709 --> 02:05:44,719
profile. Right? When we look left or the
 

5637
02:05:44,719 --> 02:05:46,390
profile. Right? When we look left or the
current week profile, we know that there

5638
02:05:46,390 --> 02:05:46,400
current week profile, we know that there
 

5639
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:48,950
current week profile, we know that there
is a node here from 808, let's call it

5640
02:05:48,950 --> 02:05:48,960
is a node here from 808, let's call it
 

5641
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:50,870
is a node here from 808, let's call it
down to 878.

5642
02:05:50,870 --> 02:05:50,880
down to 878.
 

5643
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:52,790
down to 878.
Don't move that, Alex. If we find

5644
02:05:52,790 --> 02:05:52,800
Don't move that, Alex. If we find
 

5645
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:55,109
Don't move that, Alex. If we find
acceptance under the gray box, we have

5646
02:05:55,109 --> 02:05:55,119
acceptance under the gray box, we have
 

5647
02:05:55,119 --> 02:05:57,990
acceptance under the gray box, we have
the 20-day at 750. So, we could target

5648
02:05:57,990 --> 02:05:58,000
the 20-day at 750. So, we could target
 

5649
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,950
the 20-day at 750. So, we could target
750 and then we could really target 700.

5650
02:06:00,950 --> 02:06:00,960
750 and then we could really target 700.
 

5651
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,550
750 and then we could really target 700.
So, watching this now to see if we find

5652
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:02,560
So, watching this now to see if we find
 

5653
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:04,149
So, watching this now to see if we find
acceptance lower for the short and we're

5654
02:06:04,149 --> 02:06:04,159
acceptance lower for the short and we're
 

5655
02:06:04,159 --> 02:06:05,830
acceptance lower for the short and we're
starting to come into the IV. Starting

5656
02:06:05,830 --> 02:06:05,840
starting to come into the IV. Starting
 

5657
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:07,830
starting to come into the IV. Starting
to see aggressive selling here in this

5658
02:06:07,830 --> 02:06:07,840
to see aggressive selling here in this
 

5659
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:10,149
to see aggressive selling here in this
now for a continuation. Second attempt

5660
02:06:10,149 --> 02:06:10,159
now for a continuation. Second attempt
 

5661
02:06:10,159 --> 02:06:12,229
now for a continuation. Second attempt
down here. Stop already moving down.

5662
02:06:12,229 --> 02:06:12,239
down here. Stop already moving down.
 

5663
02:06:12,239 --> 02:06:14,470
down here. Stop already moving down.
Let's see if how far we can move. Can we

5664
02:06:14,470 --> 02:06:14,480
Let's see if how far we can move. Can we
 

5665
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:15,990
Let's see if how far we can move. Can we
break the low of day and get out of this

5666
02:06:15,990 --> 02:06:16,000
break the low of day and get out of this
 

5667
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,390
break the low of day and get out of this
gray box?

5668
02:06:18,390 --> 02:06:18,400
gray box?
 

5669
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:20,390
gray box?
Can we get out of this gray box? Come on

5670
02:06:20,390 --> 02:06:20,400
Can we get out of this gray box? Come on
 

5671
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:22,950
Can we get out of this gray box? Come on
then. Nice ES starting to lose a bid as

5672
02:06:22,950 --> 02:06:22,960
then. Nice ES starting to lose a bid as
 

5673
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:25,589
then. Nice ES starting to lose a bid as
well. I see ES sweep this low. Taking a

5674
02:06:25,589 --> 02:06:25,599
well. I see ES sweep this low. Taking a
 

5675
02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:28,070
well. I see ES sweep this low. Taking a
partial here towards this bottom end of

5676
02:06:28,070 --> 02:06:28,080
partial here towards this bottom end of
 

5677
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:29,589
partial here towards this bottom end of
this wick where sellers got stuck this

5678
02:06:29,589 --> 02:06:29,599
this wick where sellers got stuck this
 

5679
02:06:29,599 --> 02:06:31,669
this wick where sellers got stuck this
morning.

5680
02:06:31,669 --> 02:06:31,679
morning.
 

5681
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:33,270
morning.
And let's see if we reject this gray box

5682
02:06:33,270 --> 02:06:33,280
And let's see if we reject this gray box
 

5683
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:35,030
And let's see if we reject this gray box
and a pull back inside. So now what I'm

5684
02:06:35,030 --> 02:06:35,040
and a pull back inside. So now what I'm
 

5685
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:36,709
and a pull back inside. So now what I'm
now watching is to see if we're going to

5686
02:06:36,709 --> 02:06:36,719
now watching is to see if we're going to
 

5687
02:06:36,719 --> 02:06:39,669
now watching is to see if we're going to
do this to here and here, which would be

5688
02:06:39,669 --> 02:06:39,679
do this to here and here, which would be
 

5689
02:06:39,679 --> 02:06:41,109
do this to here and here, which would be
a nice way to end the stream. And we're

5690
02:06:41,109 --> 02:06:41,119
a nice way to end the stream. And we're
 

5691
02:06:41,119 --> 02:06:42,790
a nice way to end the stream. And we're
very aware that this can be a fail

5692
02:06:42,790 --> 02:06:42,800
very aware that this can be a fail
 

5693
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:44,310
very aware that this can be a fail
break, a reclaim, and a go upside,

5694
02:06:44,310 --> 02:06:44,320
break, a reclaim, and a go upside,
 

5695
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:46,229
break, a reclaim, and a go upside,
especially if ES sweeps this or one of

5696
02:06:46,229 --> 02:06:46,239
especially if ES sweeps this or one of
 

5697
02:06:46,239 --> 02:06:47,990
especially if ES sweeps this or one of
them sweeps this. So we don't see a

5698
02:06:47,990 --> 02:06:48,000
them sweeps this. So we don't see a
 

5699
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,910
them sweeps this. So we don't see a
reaction here soon. And I'll cut the

5700
02:06:49,910 --> 02:06:49,920
reaction here soon. And I'll cut the
 

5701
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:52,229
reaction here soon. And I'll cut the
runner again. And then I'll consider

5702
02:06:52,229 --> 02:06:52,239
runner again. And then I'll consider
 

5703
02:06:52,239 --> 02:06:55,109
runner again. And then I'll consider
readding if we stay Nope. If we stay

5704
02:06:55,109 --> 02:06:55,119
readding if we stay Nope. If we stay
 

5705
02:06:55,119 --> 02:06:57,750
readding if we stay Nope. If we stay
heavy at 820.

5706
02:06:57,750 --> 02:06:57,760
heavy at 820.
 

5707
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:59,830
heavy at 820.
All right. Consider a read. If we stay

5708
02:06:59,830 --> 02:06:59,840
All right. Consider a read. If we stay
 

5709
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:03,189
All right. Consider a read. If we stay
heavy up here. If we reclaim this. I

5710
02:07:03,189 --> 02:07:03,199
heavy up here. If we reclaim this. I
 

5711
02:07:03,199 --> 02:07:05,350
heavy up here. If we reclaim this. I
won't add.

5712
02:07:05,350 --> 02:07:05,360
won't add.
 

5713
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:18,310
won't add.
So far so good.

5714
02:07:18,310 --> 02:07:18,320

 

5715
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:23,830

Yes. Doesn't sweat, does it?

5716
02:07:23,830 --> 02:07:23,840

 

5717
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:25,990

Spy is literally doing 5day 20-day

5718
02:07:25,990 --> 02:07:26,000
Spy is literally doing 5day 20-day
 

5719
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,830
Spy is literally doing 5day 20-day
rotation.

5720
02:07:27,830 --> 02:07:27,840
rotation.
 

5721
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:30,069
rotation.
Literally exactly what it's doing.

5722
02:07:30,069 --> 02:07:30,079
Literally exactly what it's doing.
 

5723
02:07:30,079 --> 02:07:31,589
Literally exactly what it's doing.
Right. Let's see if they start watching

5724
02:07:31,589 --> 02:07:31,599
Right. Let's see if they start watching
 

5725
02:07:31,599 --> 02:07:33,830
Right. Let's see if they start watching
this. Have we got any bids lower today?

5726
02:07:33,830 --> 02:07:33,840
this. Have we got any bids lower today?
 

5727
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:36,629
this. Have we got any bids lower today?
Nothing under 780. Ah, 7:30. Okay. Where

5728
02:07:36,629 --> 02:07:36,639
Nothing under 780. Ah, 7:30. Okay. Where
 

5729
02:07:36,639 --> 02:07:39,189
Nothing under 780. Ah, 7:30. Okay. Where
what is 7:30? That is what I want. All

5730
02:07:39,189 --> 02:07:39,199
what is 7:30? That is what I want. All
 

5731
02:07:39,199 --> 02:07:41,030
what is 7:30? That is what I want. All
right. That might help if we can get

5732
02:07:41,030 --> 02:07:41,040
right. That might help if we can get
 

5733
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:43,189
right. That might help if we can get
heavy here.

5734
02:07:43,189 --> 02:07:43,199
heavy here.
 

5735
02:07:43,199 --> 02:07:49,030
heavy here.
He's just come on the book down there.

5736
02:07:49,030 --> 02:07:49,040

 

5737
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:51,350

Come on guys, just step on it. At least

5738
02:07:51,350 --> 02:07:51,360
Come on guys, just step on it. At least
 

5739
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:53,990
Come on guys, just step on it. At least
wash. Watching ES for the wash here. I

5740
02:07:53,990 --> 02:07:54,000
wash. Watching ES for the wash here. I
 

5741
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,350
wash. Watching ES for the wash here. I
want to be very careful if one of us

5742
02:07:55,350 --> 02:07:55,360
want to be very careful if one of us
 

5743
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:56,870
want to be very careful if one of us
breaks the low and turns inside. I want

5744
02:07:56,870 --> 02:07:56,880
breaks the low and turns inside. I want
 

5745
02:07:56,880 --> 02:07:59,350
breaks the low and turns inside. I want
to be careful. Sellers keep getting

5746
02:07:59,350 --> 02:07:59,360
to be careful. Sellers keep getting
 

5747
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:01,910
to be careful. Sellers keep getting
stuck around the sort of 79 area. So we

5748
02:08:01,910 --> 02:08:01,920
stuck around the sort of 79 area. So we
 

5749
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:03,750
stuck around the sort of 79 area. So we
need to see follow through underneath 79

5750
02:08:03,750 --> 02:08:03,760
need to see follow through underneath 79
 

5751
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:06,229
need to see follow through underneath 79
to continue to hold this. Here we go. Is

5752
02:08:06,229 --> 02:08:06,239
to continue to hold this. Here we go. Is
 

5753
02:08:06,239 --> 02:08:10,390
to continue to hold this. Here we go. Is
80 test.

5754
02:08:10,390 --> 02:08:10,400

Look.
There's that outlier. 90s.

5766
02:08:36,790 --> 02:08:36,800
There's that outlier. 90s.
 

5767
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:39,350
There's that outlier. 90s.
83 is big level.

5768
02:08:39,350 --> 02:08:39,360
83 is big level.
 

5769
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:43,189
83 is big level.
Big level. Come on. [\h__\h] do it. All

5770
02:08:43,189 --> 02:08:43,199
Big level. Come on. [\h__\h] do it. All
 

5771
02:08:43,199 --> 02:08:45,430
Big level. Come on. [\h__\h] do it. All
right. ES now sweeping. want to be

5772
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:45,440
right. ES now sweeping. want to be
 

5773
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:47,270
right. ES now sweeping. want to be
careful if ES reclaims IB here because

5774
02:08:47,270 --> 02:08:47,280
careful if ES reclaims IB here because
 

5775
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:48,629
careful if ES reclaims IB here because
we just took the liquidity that we're

5776
02:08:48,629 --> 02:08:48,639
we just took the liquidity that we're
 

5777
02:08:48,639 --> 02:08:50,629
we just took the liquidity that we're
trying to attack here on ENQ. So ES has

5778
02:08:50,629 --> 02:08:50,639
trying to attack here on ENQ. So ES has
 

5779
02:08:50,639 --> 02:08:57,750
trying to attack here on ENQ. So ES has
already just taken this out.

5780
02:08:57,750 --> 02:08:57,760

 

5781
02:08:57,760 --> 02:08:59,030

Do not want to hold this all the way

5782
02:08:59,030 --> 02:08:59,040
Do not want to hold this all the way
 

5783
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:01,030
Do not want to hold this all the way
back up to 820. Not going to give back

5784
02:09:01,030 --> 02:09:01,040
back up to 820. Not going to give back
 

5785
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:02,950
back up to 820. Not going to give back
30 points in a rotation in case it

5786
02:09:02,950 --> 02:09:02,960
30 points in a rotation in case it
 

5787
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:05,910
30 points in a rotation in case it
squeezes and read there. Willing to cut

5788
02:09:05,910 --> 02:09:05,920
squeezes and read there. Willing to cut
 

5789
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:07,669
squeezes and read there. Willing to cut
and read there if we don't get this wash

5790
02:09:07,669 --> 02:09:07,679
and read there if we don't get this wash
 

5791
02:09:07,679 --> 02:09:08,790
and read there if we don't get this wash
down. I think we're going to get this

5792
02:09:08,790 --> 02:09:08,800
down. I think we're going to get this
 

5793
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:12,470
down. I think we're going to get this
wash down. Come on.

5794
02:09:12,470 --> 02:09:12,480
wash down. Come on.
 

5795
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:14,390
wash down. Come on.
Thank you. Right. Let's see if we get

5796
02:09:14,390 --> 02:09:14,400
Thank you. Right. Let's see if we get
 

5797
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:16,229
Thank you. Right. Let's see if we get
previous week close now. Let's see if we

5798
02:09:16,229 --> 02:09:16,239

5819
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:41,270

We should break lower at this point.

5820
02:09:41,270 --> 02:09:41,280
We should break lower at this point.
 

5821
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:43,510
We should break lower at this point.
We're into the 20-day here. 20-day is

basically right here into 53s where

5824
02:09:45,430 --> 02:09:45,440
basically right here into 53s where
 

5825
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:47,589
basically right here into 53s where
where you can see my mouse can move you

5826
02:09:47,589 --> 02:09:47,599
where you can see my mouse can move you
 

5827
02:09:47,599 --> 02:09:48,870
where you can see my mouse can move you
to show you what I'm looking at higher

5828
02:09:48,870 --> 02:09:48,880
to show you what I'm looking at higher
 

5829
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:50,470
to show you what I'm looking at higher
time frame. All right, here's my 20-day

5830
02:09:50,470 --> 02:09:50,480
time frame. All right, here's my 20-day
 

5831
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:52,790
time frame. All right, here's my 20-day
this purple line. If we find acceptance

5832
02:09:52,790 --> 02:09:52,800
this purple line. If we find acceptance
 

5833
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:54,870
this purple line. If we find acceptance
under this 20-day, right, this is mean

5834
02:09:54,870 --> 02:09:54,880
under this 20-day, right, this is mean
 

5835
02:09:54,880 --> 02:09:56,470
under this 20-day, right, this is mean
based on the Ballinger bands. If we find

5836
02:09:56,470 --> 02:09:56,480
based on the Ballinger bands. If we find
 

5837
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:58,550
based on the Ballinger bands. If we find
acceptance under this, I'm watching this

5838
02:09:58,550 --> 02:09:58,560
acceptance under this, I'm watching this
 

5839
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:01,109
acceptance under this, I'm watching this
node. Right, my expectation is for us to

5840
02:10:01,109 --> 02:10:01,119
node. Right, my expectation is for us to
 

5841
02:10:01,119 --> 02:10:03,830
node. Right, my expectation is for us to
come down here if we can wash under 50,

5842
02:10:03,830 --> 02:10:03,840
come down here if we can wash under 50,
 

5843
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:05,350
come down here if we can wash under 50,
right? So, I'm trying to hold a runner

5844
02:10:05,350 --> 02:10:05,360
right? So, I'm trying to hold a runner
 

5845
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:07,750
right? So, I'm trying to hold a runner
for this move here. And we also have

5846
02:10:07,750 --> 02:10:07,760
for this move here. And we also have
 

5847
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:11,750
for this move here. And we also have
previous week close at 38. So 40 50 and

5848
02:10:11,750 --> 02:10:11,760
previous week close at 38. So 40 50 and
 

5849
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:13,910
previous week close at 38. So 40 50 and
40s. We need acceptance under 50 and 40s

5850
02:10:13,910 --> 02:10:13,920
40s. We need acceptance under 50 and 40s
 

5851
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:17,109
40s. We need acceptance under 50 and 40s
and then we will get 700 or 692s. All

5852
02:10:17,109 --> 02:10:17,119
and then we will get 700 or 692s. All
 

5853
02:10:17,119 --> 02:10:18,870
and then we will get 700 or 692s. All
right. So we built liquidity all day.

5854
02:10:18,870 --> 02:10:18,880
right. So we built liquidity all day.
 

5855
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:20,470
right. So we built liquidity all day.
We're starting to use this liquidity

5856
02:10:20,470 --> 02:10:20,480
We're starting to use this liquidity
 

5857
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:22,790
We're starting to use this liquidity
now. All right. Watching this little

5858
02:10:22,790 --> 02:10:22,800
now. All right. Watching this little
 

5859
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:25,109
now. All right. Watching this little
level here and this gray box, this gray

5860
02:10:25,109 --> 02:10:25,119
level here and this gray box, this gray
 

5861
02:10:25,119 --> 02:10:27,750
level here and this gray box, this gray
level here. So if we can get under this,

5862
02:10:27,750 --> 02:10:27,760
level here. So if we can get under this,
 

5863
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:30,310
level here. So if we can get under this,
then I'm looking for this and this.

02:10:37,109 --> 02:10:37,119
this based on volume soon.
 

5871

just out based on Oh, what's going on
 

6013
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:04,870
just out based on Oh, what's going on
there? Based on where they're uh where

6014
02:14:04,870 --> 02:14:04,880
there? Based on where they're uh where
 

6015
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:08,790
there? Based on where they're uh where
they positioned. So, out on this can

6016
02:14:08,790 --> 02:14:08,800
they positioned. So, out on this can
 

6017
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:10,629
they positioned. So, out on this can
read. I will read if we start losing

6018
02:14:10,629 --> 02:14:10,639
read. I will read if we start losing
 

6019
02:14:10,639 --> 02:14:12,149
read. I will read if we start losing
this bid. But this comes a bit of a

6020
02:14:12,149 --> 02:14:12,159
this bid. But this comes a bit of a
 

6021
02:14:12,159 --> 02:14:14,069
this bid. But this comes a bit of a
squeeze above 80. If they if they pull

6022
02:14:14,069 --> 02:14:14,079
squeeze above 80. If they if they pull
 

6023
02:14:14,079 --> 02:14:15,830
squeeze above 80. If they if they pull
back and hold 80 now, they can resqueeze

6024
02:14:15,830 --> 02:14:15,840
back and hold 80 now, they can resqueeze
 

6025
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:19,030
back and hold 80 now, they can resqueeze
up. So out on this just based on what

VIX into a pivot as well. So we're

6092

VIX into a pivot as well. So we're
 

6093
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:50,229
VIX into a pivot as well. So we're
looking for VIX to get back above 1760s.

02:15:50,229 --> 02:15:50,239

 

6095
02:15:50,239 --> 02:15:52,790

6097
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:57,189
Yeah, 1760s. Above 1760s we have a gap
filter 1780s on possible.

See if I left this 800

6100
02:16:29,189 --> 02:16:29,199

 

6101
02:16:29,199 --> 02:16:31,030

They're trying to squeeze 800 now. ES

6102
02:16:31,030 --> 02:16:31,040
They're trying to squeeze 800 now. ES
 

6103
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:32,549
They're trying to squeeze 800 now. ES
still under its IB. They're trying to

6104
02:16:32,549 --> 02:16:32,559
still under its IB. They're trying to
 

6105
02:16:32,559 --> 02:16:34,709
still under its IB. They're trying to
squeeze through 800 to see if they lift.

6106
02:16:34,709 --> 02:16:34,719
squeeze through 800 to see if they lift.
 

6107
02:16:34,719 --> 02:16:36,629
squeeze through 800 to see if they lift.
They are offering all the way up to 25s

6108
02:16:36,629 --> 02:16:36,639
They are offering all the way up to 25s
 

6109
02:16:36,639 --> 02:16:38,950
They are offering all the way up to 25s
now. So, I' got to be careful on any

6110
02:16:38,950 --> 02:16:38,960
now. So, I' got to be careful on any
 

6111
02:16:38,960 --> 02:16:41,110
now. So, I' got to be careful on any
re-entry thought here. If we reclaim

6112
02:16:41,110 --> 02:16:41,120
re-entry thought here. If we reclaim
 

6113
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:42,389
re-entry thought here. If we reclaim
initial balance, it would be a failed

6114
02:16:42,389 --> 02:16:42,399
initial balance, it would be a failed
 

6115
02:16:42,399 --> 02:16:44,070
initial balance, it would be a failed
auction. But this gray box is a big

6116
02:16:44,070 --> 02:16:44,080
auction. But this gray box is a big
 

6117
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:45,750
auction. But this gray box is a big
level off the developing week like we

6118
02:16:45,750 --> 02:16:45,760
level off the developing week like we
 

6119
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:49,830
level off the developing week like we
talked about.

6120
02:16:49,830 --> 02:16:49,840

 

6121
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:54,389

Do we see some follow through?

6122
02:16:54,389 --> 02:16:54,399

 

6123
02:16:54,399 --> 02:16:57,030

Value area low on the day up at 820 for

Value area low on the day up at 820 for
 

6125
02:16:57,040 --> 02:17:00,309

6126

6129
02:17:02,639 --> 02:17:03,830
on Ninja. Buyers trying to step in for
this squeeze now. Like I said, they're

6130
02:17:03,830 --> 02:17:03,840
this squeeze now. Like I said, they're
 

6131
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:07,990
this squeeze now. Like I said, they're
offering all the way up to 820 here.

6132
02:17:07,990 --> 02:17:08,000
offering all the way up to 820 here.
 

6133
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,150

So, reclaiming IB. ES still has not

6134
02:17:10,150 --> 02:17:10,160
So, reclaiming IB. ES still has not
 

6135
02:17:10,160 --> 02:17:12,389
So, reclaiming IB. ES still has not
reclaimed its IB, but ENQ is reclaiming

6136
02:17:12,389 --> 02:17:12,399
reclaimed its IB, but ENQ is reclaiming
 

6137
02:17:12,399 --> 02:17:13,750
reclaimed its IB, but ENQ is reclaiming
the initial balance and it's going to

6138
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:13,760
the initial balance and it's going to
 

6139
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:15,589
the initial balance and it's going to
lift up towards these 820s like we

6140
02:17:15,589 --> 02:17:15,599
lift up towards these 820s like we
 

6141
02:17:15,599 --> 02:17:16,709
lift up towards these 820s like we
talked about. That's why I didn't want

6142
02:17:16,709 --> 02:17:16,719
talked about. That's why I didn't want
 

6143
02:17:16,719 --> 02:17:18,950
talked about. That's why I didn't want
to sit in this for the squeeze. And

6144
02:17:18,950 --> 02:17:18,960
to sit in this for the squeeze. And
 

6145
02:17:18,960 --> 02:17:20,790
to sit in this for the squeeze. And
let's see if they resell this or not.

6146
02:17:20,790 --> 02:17:20,800
let's see if they resell this or not.
 

6147
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:23,190
let's see if they resell this or not.
Otherwise, we go straight back inside

6148
02:17:23,190 --> 02:17:23,200
Otherwise, we go straight back inside
 

6149
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:25,110
Otherwise, we go straight back inside
the range. So, it really depends if they

6150
02:17:25,110 --> 02:17:25,120
the range. So, it really depends if they
 

6151
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:26,629
the range. So, it really depends if they
trap enough buyers up here and then

6152
02:17:26,629 --> 02:17:26,639
trap enough buyers up here and then
 

6153
02:17:26,639 --> 02:17:28,950
trap enough buyers up here and then
close back under 800. Certainly, if they

6154
02:17:28,950 --> 02:17:28,960
close back under 800. Certainly, if they
 

6155
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:30,709
close back under 800. Certainly, if they
close under 790, there's another selling

6156
02:17:30,709 --> 02:17:30,719
close under 790, there's another selling
 

6157
02:17:30,719 --> 02:17:32,309
close under 790, there's another selling
opportunity. So, if this is a squeeze to

6158
02:17:32,309 --> 02:17:32,319
opportunity. So, if this is a squeeze to
 

6159
02:17:32,319 --> 02:17:36,070
opportunity. So, if this is a squeeze to
be resold, it could be fun.

6160
02:17:36,070 --> 02:17:36,080
be resold, it could be fun.
 

6161
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:43,349
be resold, it could be fun.
This 800's key now

6162
02:17:43,349 --> 02:17:43,359

 

6163
02:17:43,359 --> 02:17:44,870

trying to bid the 800s. If we start

6164
02:17:44,870 --> 02:17:44,880
trying to bid the 800s. If we start
 

6165
02:17:44,880 --> 02:17:47,589
trying to bid the 800s. If we start
closing under 8790, I'll be reinterested

6166
02:17:47,589 --> 02:17:47,599
closing under 8790, I'll be reinterested
 

6167
02:17:47,599 --> 02:17:55,110
closing under 8790, I'll be reinterested
in a short again, but not before that.

6168
02:17:55,110 --> 02:17:55,120

 

6169
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:58,070

It's good selling here. Nice. Let's see

6170
02:17:58,070 --> 02:17:58,080
It's good selling here. Nice. Let's see
 

6171
02:17:58,080 --> 02:18:01,030
It's good selling here. Nice. Let's see
if we can get under these 790s now. Big

6172
02:18:01,030 --> 02:18:01,040
if we can get under these 790s now. Big
 

6173
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:03,509
if we can get under these 790s now. Big
pivot here. Back to that IB. Now, if

6174
02:18:03,509 --> 02:18:03,519
pivot here. Back to that IB. Now, if
 

6175
02:18:03,519 --> 02:18:04,870
pivot here. Back to that IB. Now, if
we've trapped enough buyers here, which

6176
02:18:04,870 --> 02:18:04,880
we've trapped enough buyers here, which
 

6177
02:18:04,880 --> 02:18:06,230
we've trapped enough buyers here, which
it looks like we have, we need to close

6178
02:18:06,230 --> 02:18:06,240
it looks like we have, we need to close
 

6179
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:11,750
it looks like we have, we need to close
under 790 and we will get heavy.

6180
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:11,760

 

6181
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:16,549

We got to get back under the IB.

6182
02:18:16,549 --> 02:18:16,559

 

6183
02:18:16,559 --> 02:18:18,469

back under this gray box under the IB.

6184
02:18:18,469 --> 02:18:18,479
back under this gray box under the IB.
 

6185
02:18:18,479 --> 02:18:19,589
back under this gray box under the IB.
If we're going to wash, we're going to

6186
02:18:19,589 --> 02:18:19,599
If we're going to wash, we're going to
 

6187
02:18:19,599 --> 02:18:21,110
If we're going to wash, we're going to
have to do that. Not going to enter

6188
02:18:21,110 --> 02:18:21,120
have to do that. Not going to enter
 

6189
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:23,270
have to do that. Not going to enter
before that

6190
02:18:23,270 --> 02:18:23,280
before that
 

6191
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:26,629
before that
battle here. Big battle here. 800

6192
02:18:26,629 --> 02:18:26,639
battle here. Big battle here. 800
 

6193
02:18:26,639 --> 02:18:28,870
battle here. Big battle here. 800
reclaim. Still no entry for me. Not

6194
02:18:28,870 --> 02:18:28,880
reclaim. Still no entry for me. Not
 

6195
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:30,950
reclaim. Still no entry for me. Not
underneath initial balance yet. So, they

6196
02:18:30,950 --> 02:18:30,960
underneath initial balance yet. So, they
 

6197
02:18:30,960 --> 02:18:33,030
underneath initial balance yet. So, they
can come up and test value again. So I

6198
02:18:33,030 --> 02:18:33,040
can come up and test value again. So I
 

6199
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:36,230
can come up and test value again. So I
am willing to play short side if we trap

6200
02:18:36,230 --> 02:18:36,240
am willing to play short side if we trap
 

6201
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:38,709
am willing to play short side if we trap
enough buyers in a push up which is sold

6202
02:18:38,709 --> 02:18:38,719
enough buyers in a push up which is sold
 

6203
02:18:38,719 --> 02:18:40,629
enough buyers in a push up which is sold
into

6204
02:18:40,629 --> 02:18:40,639
into
 

6205
02:18:40,639 --> 02:18:43,190
into
which is sold into if we close back

6206
02:18:43,190 --> 02:18:43,200
which is sold into if we close back
 

6207
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:45,509
which is sold into if we close back
under here. Right. I'm willing to sell

6208
02:18:45,509 --> 02:18:45,519
under here. Right. I'm willing to sell
 

6209
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:47,669
under here. Right. I'm willing to sell
that. I'm not willing to sell in this

6210
02:18:47,669 --> 02:18:47,679
that. I'm not willing to sell in this
 

6211
02:18:47,679 --> 02:18:49,750
that. I'm not willing to sell in this
shove up into here. Not yet. Not unless

6212
02:18:49,750 --> 02:18:49,760
shove up into here. Not yet. Not unless
 

6213
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:52,230
shove up into here. Not yet. Not unless
not unless I really see buyers really

6214
02:18:52,230 --> 02:18:52,240
not unless I really see buyers really
 

6215
02:18:52,240 --> 02:19:01,990
not unless I really see buyers really
get caught offside.

6216
02:19:01,990 --> 02:19:02,000

 

6217
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:03,509

ES reclaiming now as well. It's coming

6218
02:19:03,509 --> 02:19:03,519
ES reclaiming now as well. It's coming
 

6219
02:19:03,519 --> 02:19:05,990
ES reclaiming now as well. It's coming
back up to its New York open. So, here's

6220
02:19:05,990 --> 02:19:06,000
back up to its New York open. So, here's
 

6221
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,030
back up to its New York open. So, here's
the squeeze. So, 20s is the level. 20s

6222
02:19:09,030 --> 02:19:09,040
the squeeze. So, 20s is the level. 20s
 

6223
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:10,709
the squeeze. So, 20s is the level. 20s
to 25. Same levels we talked about

6224
02:19:10,709 --> 02:19:10,719
to 25. Same levels we talked about
 

6225
02:19:10,719 --> 02:19:12,309
to 25. Same levels we talked about
earlier. If they reclaim that, it's 50s

6226
02:19:12,309 --> 02:19:12,319
earlier. If they reclaim that, it's 50s
 

6227
02:19:12,319 --> 02:19:13,990
earlier. If they reclaim that, it's 50s
and 60s. Same levels we've talked about

6228
02:19:13,990 --> 02:19:14,000
and 60s. Same levels we've talked about
 

6229
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,830
and 60s. Same levels we've talked about
all day, right? Same levels we talked

6230
02:19:15,830 --> 02:19:15,840
all day, right? Same levels we talked
 

6231
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:18,389
all day, right? Same levels we talked
about in here, right? So, I need to see

6232
02:19:18,389 --> 02:19:18,399
about in here, right? So, I need to see
 

6233
02:19:18,399 --> 02:19:20,150
about in here, right? So, I need to see
buyers start to get trapped here and

6234
02:19:20,150 --> 02:19:20,160
buyers start to get trapped here and
 

6235
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:22,150
buyers start to get trapped here and
closing underneath all of this to be

6236
02:19:22,150 --> 02:19:22,160
closing underneath all of this to be
 

6237
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:27,669
closing underneath all of this to be
confident about new lows.

6238
02:19:27,669 --> 02:19:27,679

 

6239
02:19:27,679 --> 02:19:29,830

You guys saying

6240
02:19:29,830 --> 02:19:29,840
You guys saying

You guys saying
people

6243
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:56,070

just made 4K from the range top the gray

6244
02:19:56,070 --> 02:19:56,080
just made 4K from the range top the gray
 

6245
02:19:56,080 --> 02:19:58,150
just made 4K from the range top the gray
box. Thanks, Alex. Give me confidence

6246
02:19:58,150 --> 02:19:58,160
box. Thanks, Alex. Give me confidence
 

6247
02:19:58,160 --> 02:20:00,150
box. Thanks, Alex. Give me confidence
for that. Nice. Yeah. So, you're a range

6248
02:20:00,150 --> 02:20:00,160
for that. Nice. Yeah. So, you're a range
 

6249
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:02,070
for that. Nice. Yeah. So, you're a range
trader, which is perfect. So, you traded

6250
02:20:02,070 --> 02:20:02,080

02:23:51,190 --> 02:23:51,200
Do I enter big and immediately size down
 

6407
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:53,190
Do I enter big and immediately size down
for TP2 and TP3? I mean, it wouldn't say

6408
02:23:53,190 --> 02:23:53,200
for TP2 and TP3? I mean, it wouldn't say
 

6409
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:55,429
for TP2 and TP3? I mean, it wouldn't say
I enter big in a range day. It's not an

6410
02:23:55,429 --> 02:23:55,439
I enter big in a range day. It's not an
 

6411
02:23:55,439 --> 02:23:58,710
I enter big in a range day. It's not an
A+ trade for me. Um, but yes, I

6412
02:23:58,710 --> 02:23:58,720
A+ trade for me. Um, but yes, I
 

6413
02:23:58,720 --> 02:24:01,590
A+ trade for me. Um, but yes, I
obviously if we get to TP1, TP2, I'm

6414
02:24:01,590 --> 02:24:01,600
obviously if we get to TP1, TP2, I'm
 

6415
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:03,429
obviously if we get to TP1, TP2, I'm
taking positions off. I'm not adding I'm

6416
02:24:03,429 --> 02:24:03,439
taking positions off. I'm not adding I'm
 

6417
02:24:03,439 --> 02:24:05,030
taking positions off. I'm not adding I'm
taking positions off. We're not in a

6418
02:24:05,030 --> 02:24:05,040
taking positions off. We're not in a
 

6419
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:07,270
taking positions off. We're not in a
we're not in a trend, right? So, I'm not

6420
02:24:07,270 --> 02:24:07,280
we're not in a trend, right? So, I'm not
 

6421
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:09,030
we're not in a trend, right? So, I'm not
adding to my winners in a market like

6422
02:24:09,030 --> 02:24:09,040
adding to my winners in a market like
 

6423
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:11,190
adding to my winners in a market like
this. I'm just peeling off and moving

6424
02:24:11,190 --> 02:24:11,200
this. I'm just peeling off and moving
 

6425
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:14,950
this. I'm just peeling off and moving
stops.

6426
02:24:14,950 --> 02:24:14,960

 

6427
02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:16,389

Which prop firms allows me to

6428
02:24:16,389 --> 02:24:16,399
Which prop firms allows me to
 

6429
02:24:16,399 --> 02:24:20,309
Which prop firms allows me to
immediately pass evals? Um,

6430
02:24:20,309 --> 02:24:20,319
immediately pass evals? Um,
 

6431
02:24:20,319 --> 02:24:23,030
immediately pass evals? Um,
Apex, you mean on the same day? Apex

6432
02:24:23,030 --> 02:24:23,040
Apex, you mean on the same day? Apex
 

6433
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:24,550
Apex, you mean on the same day? Apex
maybe funded next bolt. I'm not sure.

6434
02:24:24,550 --> 02:24:24,560
maybe funded next bolt. I'm not sure.
 

6435
02:24:24,560 --> 02:24:28,710
maybe funded next bolt. I'm not sure.
I'd have to check.

6436
02:24:28,710 --> 02:24:28,720

 

6437
02:24:28,720 --> 02:24:31,750

Okay, back down to this same level.

6438
02:24:31,750 --> 02:24:31,760
Okay, back down to this same level.
 

6439
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:33,349
Okay, back down to this same level.
Still waiting to see if we close under

6440
02:24:33,349 --> 02:24:33,359
Still waiting to see if we close under
 

6441
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:35,510
Still waiting to see if we close under
this and stay heavy. If we can build

6442
02:24:35,510 --> 02:24:35,520
this and stay heavy. If we can build
 

6443
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:37,030
this and stay heavy. If we can build
enough buyers trapped in here and we

6444
02:24:37,030 --> 02:24:37,040
enough buyers trapped in here and we
 

6445
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:38,550
enough buyers trapped in here and we
close under this, I will look for a

6446
02:24:38,550 --> 02:24:38,560
close under this, I will look for a
 

6447
02:24:38,560 --> 02:24:44,389
close under this, I will look for a
wash. Otherwise, there's no play.

6448
02:24:44,389 --> 02:24:44,399

 

6449
02:24:44,399 --> 02:24:45,990

Lucid. Yeah. Do Lucid have one that

6450
02:24:45,990 --> 02:24:46,000
Lucid. Yeah. Do Lucid have one that
 

6451
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,670
Lucid. Yeah. Do Lucid have one that
doesn't? No, I think Lucid is 50 and

6452
02:24:47,670 --> 02:24:47,680
doesn't? No, I think Lucid is 50 and
 

6453
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:50,630
doesn't? No, I think Lucid is 50 and
60%. So, I think two days or or three

6454
02:24:50,630 --> 02:24:50,640
60%. So, I think two days or or three
 

6455
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:53,110
60%. So, I think two days or or three
days on Two days is the is the quickest

6456
02:24:53,110 --> 02:24:53,120
days on Two days is the is the quickest
 

6457
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:58,070
days on Two days is the is the quickest
you can do on Lucid, I think.

6458
02:24:58,070 --> 02:24:58,080

 

6459
02:24:58,080 --> 02:25:00,230

I think there's a wash down here. Are

6460
02:25:00,230 --> 02:25:00,240
I think there's a wash down here. Are
 

6461
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:06,469
I think there's a wash down here. Are
they adding 17?

6462
02:25:06,469 --> 02:25:06,479

 

6463
02:25:06,479 --> 02:25:11,030

So choppy.

6464
02:25:11,030 --> 02:25:11,040

 

6465
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:13,349

What would be my buy price? Probably

6466
02:25:13,349 --> 02:25:13,359
What would be my buy price? Probably
 

6467
02:25:13,359 --> 02:25:14,870
What would be my buy price? Probably
like I'm not going to buy it today, but

6468
02:25:14,870 --> 02:25:14,880
like I'm not going to buy it today, but
 

6469
02:25:14,880 --> 02:25:17,110
like I'm not going to buy it today, but
probably a reclaim of this kind of area

6470
02:25:17,110 --> 02:25:17,120
probably a reclaim of this kind of area
 

6471
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:19,990
probably a reclaim of this kind of area
here. If they do that, then I would

6472
02:25:19,990 --> 02:25:20,000
here. If they do that, then I would
 

6473
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,389
here. If they do that, then I would
expect we'd complete the rotation from

6474
02:25:22,389 --> 02:25:22,399
expect we'd complete the rotation from
 

6475
02:25:22,399 --> 02:25:23,830
expect we'd complete the rotation from
one side of value to the other because

6476
02:25:23,830 --> 02:25:23,840
one side of value to the other because
 

6477
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:25,429
one side of value to the other because
that would be a failed auction under

6478
02:25:25,429 --> 02:25:25,439
that would be a failed auction under
 

6479
02:25:25,439 --> 02:25:27,830
that would be a failed auction under
value. We reclaim this, then I'd expect

6480
02:25:27,830 --> 02:25:27,840
value. We reclaim this, then I'd expect
 

6481
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:29,510
value. We reclaim this, then I'd expect
we'd come back to the other side of

6482
02:25:29,510 --> 02:25:29,520
we'd come back to the other side of
 

6483
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:34,150
we'd come back to the other side of
value, I guess. Again,

6484
02:25:34,150 --> 02:25:34,160
value, I guess. Again,
 

6485
02:25:34,160 --> 02:25:35,429
value, I guess. Again,
I'm not looking for that. It's not a

6486
02:25:35,429 --> 02:25:35,439
I'm not looking for that. It's not a
 

6487
02:25:35,439 --> 02:25:37,590
I'm not looking for that. It's not a
trade that I'm looking for. Same way as

6488
02:25:37,590 --> 02:25:37,600
trade that I'm looking for. Same way as
 

6489
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:39,750
trade that I'm looking for. Same way as
I'm not looking to fade the top. I'm

6490
02:25:39,750 --> 02:25:39,760
I'm not looking to fade the top. I'm
 

6491
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:41,590
I'm not looking to fade the top. I'm
just not looking to do that and wait and

6492
02:25:41,590 --> 02:25:41,600
just not looking to do that and wait and
 

6493
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:43,110
just not looking to do that and wait and
see if there's continuation. If there's

6494
02:25:43,110 --> 02:25:43,120
see if there's continuation. If there's
 

6495
02:25:43,120 --> 02:25:45,030
see if there's continuation. If there's
not, I'm not going to play it. It's just

6496
02:25:45,030 --> 02:25:45,040
not, I'm not going to play it. It's just
 

6497
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:48,710
not, I'm not going to play it. It's just
rules that I have.

6498
02:25:48,710 --> 02:25:48,720
rules that I have.
 

6499
02:25:48,720 --> 02:25:50,070
rules that I have.
What would the short entry look like? I

6500
02:25:50,070 --> 02:25:50,080
What would the short entry look like? I
 

6501
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:50,950
What would the short entry look like? I
think we've talked about quite a few

6502
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:50,960
think we've talked about quite a few
 

6503
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:53,990
think we've talked about quite a few
times. It would have to be like this

6504
02:25:53,990 --> 02:25:54,000
times. It would have to be like this
 

6505
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,309
times. It would have to be like this
right under here. Need to be a heavy

6506
02:25:56,309 --> 02:25:56,319
right under here. Need to be a heavy
 

6507
02:25:56,319 --> 02:25:58,150
right under here. Need to be a heavy
close and a rejection with buyers stuck.

6508
02:25:58,150 --> 02:25:58,160
close and a rejection with buyers stuck.
 

6509
02:25:58,160 --> 02:25:59,750
close and a rejection with buyers stuck.
If you don't get that, there's no short

6510
02:25:59,750 --> 02:25:59,760
If you don't get that, there's no short
 

6511
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:08,710
If you don't get that, there's no short
for me anyway. what I'm looking for.

6512
02:26:08,710 --> 02:26:08,720

 

6513
02:26:08,720 --> 02:26:10,309

Now, I pin it every day. I pin the

6514
02:26:10,309 --> 02:26:10,319
Now, I pin it every day. I pin the
 

6515
02:26:10,319 --> 02:26:12,630
Now, I pin it every day. I pin the
anchored uh profile every day. So,

6516
02:26:12,630 --> 02:26:12,640
anchored uh profile every day. So,
 

6517
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:14,230
anchored uh profile every day. So,
starting to reclaim or potentially

6518
02:26:14,230 --> 02:26:14,240
starting to reclaim or potentially
 

6519
02:26:14,240 --> 02:26:16,710
starting to reclaim or potentially
reclaim that previous week value high

6520
02:26:16,710 --> 02:26:16,720
reclaim that previous week value high
 

6521
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:19,270
reclaim that previous week value high
right into that same node. ES back to

6522
02:26:19,270 --> 02:26:19,280
right into that same node. ES back to
 

6523
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:37,190
right into that same node. ES back to
VWAP and the New York open again.

6524
02:26:37,190 --> 02:26:37,200

 

6525
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:38,950

Yeah, for educational purposes. I've

6526
02:26:38,950 --> 02:26:38,960
Yeah, for educational purposes. I've
 

6527
02:26:38,960 --> 02:26:40,870
Yeah, for educational purposes. I've
just told you what I'm looking for. I

6528
02:26:40,870 --> 02:26:40,880
just told you what I'm looking for. I
 

6529
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:42,389
just told you what I'm looking for. I
don't understand you guys who want a

6530
02:26:42,389 --> 02:26:42,399
don't understand you guys who want a
 

6531
02:26:42,399 --> 02:26:45,030
don't understand you guys who want a
signal. I've literally told you what I'm

6532
02:26:45,030 --> 02:26:45,040
signal. I've literally told you what I'm
 

6533
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:46,389
signal. I've literally told you what I'm
looking for. So, where do you think my

6534
02:26:46,389 --> 02:26:46,399
looking for. So, where do you think my
 

6535
02:26:46,399 --> 02:26:49,270
looking for. So, where do you think my
entry would be? Like, I told you here,

6536
02:26:49,270 --> 02:26:49,280
entry would be? Like, I told you here,
 

6537
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:51,349
entry would be? Like, I told you here,
I'm looking for reject of 50 and a break

6538
02:26:51,349 --> 02:26:51,359
I'm looking for reject of 50 and a break
 

6539
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:53,190
I'm looking for reject of 50 and a break
of 25. Where do you think my entry would

6540
02:26:53,190 --> 02:26:53,200
of 25. Where do you think my entry would
 

6541
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:58,150
of 25. Where do you think my entry would
be? It'd be here, wouldn't it?

6542
02:26:58,150 --> 02:26:58,160

 

6543
02:26:58,160 --> 02:27:02,309

It's [\h__\h] It's unbelievable.

6544
02:27:02,309 --> 02:27:02,319
It's [\h__\h] It's unbelievable.
 

6545
02:27:02,319 --> 02:27:06,870
It's [\h__\h] It's unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

6546
02:27:06,870 --> 02:27:06,880

 

6547
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:09,190

You act like I don't tell you. I don't

6548
02:27:09,190 --> 02:27:09,200
You act like I don't tell you. I don't
 

6549
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:10,790
You act like I don't tell you. I don't
understand. I tell you what I'm looking

6550
02:27:10,790 --> 02:27:10,800
understand. I tell you what I'm looking
 

6551
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:13,270
understand. I tell you what I'm looking
for. It's not like it's like mystical.

6552
02:27:13,270 --> 02:27:13,280
for. It's not like it's like mystical.
 

6553
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:15,590
for. It's not like it's like mystical.
I'm literally telling you. I draw it. I

6554
02:27:15,590 --> 02:27:15,600
I'm literally telling you. I draw it. I
 

6555
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:20,950
I'm literally telling you. I draw it. I
even draw it out. I even draw it out.

6556
02:27:20,950 --> 02:27:20,960
even draw it out. I even draw it out.
 

6557
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:22,710
even draw it out. I even draw it out.
Do I see value in back testing? Yeah,

6558
02:27:22,710 --> 02:27:22,720
Do I see value in back testing? Yeah,
 

6559
02:27:22,720 --> 02:27:24,150
Do I see value in back testing? Yeah,
I'm sure there's a lot of value in back

6560
02:27:24,150 --> 02:27:24,160
I'm sure there's a lot of value in back
 

6561
02:27:24,160 --> 02:27:33,349
I'm sure there's a lot of value in back
testing for sure.

6562
02:27:33,349 --> 02:27:33,359

 

6563
02:27:33,359 --> 02:27:39,510

Oh,

6564
02:27:39,510 --> 02:27:39,520

6567
02:27:46,960 --> 02:27:52,790

Can I put a traffic light behind you?

6568
02:27:52,790 --> 02:27:52,800

 

6569
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:54,550

What? Green. What would it be? Like

6570
02:27:54,550 --> 02:27:54,560
What? Green. What would it be? Like
 

6571
02:27:54,560 --> 02:27:57,110
What? Green. What would it be? Like
green for buy, red for short, yellow for

6572
02:27:57,110 --> 02:27:57,120
green for buy, red for short, yellow for
 

6573

green for buy, red for short, yellow for
do nothing. All right, let's see. Let's

6574
02:27:58,870 --> 02:27:58,880
do nothing. All right, let's see. Let's
 

6575
02:27:58,880 --> 02:28:01,030
do nothing. All right, let's see. Let's
see if we close heavy again here. So,

6576
02:28:01,030 --> 02:28:01,040
see if we close heavy again here. So,
 

6577
02:28:01,040 --> 02:28:02,870
see if we close heavy again here. So,
rejection of previous week value high.

6578
02:28:02,870 --> 02:28:02,880
rejection of previous week value high.
 

6579

rejection of previous week value high.
We're still not underneath the initial

We're still not underneath the initial
 

6581
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:08,950
We're still not underneath the initial

All you got to do is like look at a five

6606
02:28:42,790 --> 02:28:42,800
All you got to do is like look at a five
 

6607
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:44,150
All you got to do is like look at a five
minute right now. Have we got a five

6608
02:28:44,150 --> 02:28:44,160
minute right now. Have we got a five
 

6609
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:47,349
minute right now. Have we got a five
minute here?

6610
02:28:47,349 --> 02:28:47,359
minute here?
 

6611
02:28:47,359 --> 02:28:50,790
minute here?
What is that? What is that? That is

6612
02:28:50,790 --> 02:28:50,800
What is that? What is that? That is
 

6613
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:52,550
What is that? What is that? That is
dreadful.

6614
02:28:52,550 --> 02:28:52,560
dreadful.
 

6615
02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:56,070
dreadful.
That is about as bad as you get, guys.

6616
02:28:56,070 --> 02:28:56,080
That is about as bad as you get, guys.
 

6617
02:28:56,080 --> 02:29:00,309
That is about as bad as you get, guys.
That's dreadful.

6618
02:29:00,309 --> 02:29:00,319

 

6619
02:29:00,319 --> 02:29:02,230

Okay, back inside. So, if they hold

6620
02:29:02,230 --> 02:29:02,240
Okay, back inside. So, if they hold
 

6621
02:29:02,240 --> 02:29:04,950
Okay, back inside. So, if they hold
their rotation now, if they hold 23s, I

6622
02:29:04,950 --> 02:29:04,960
their rotation now, if they hold 23s, I
 

6623
02:29:04,960 --> 02:29:06,150
their rotation now, if they hold 23s, I
would expect that they drift all the way

6624
02:29:06,150 --> 02:29:06,160
would expect that they drift all the way
 

6625
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:16,870
would expect that they drift all the way
up to 900s.

6626
02:29:16,870 --> 02:29:16,880

 

6627
02:29:16,880 --> 02:29:18,469

I would still be more interested in the

6628
02:29:18,469 --> 02:29:18,479
I would still be more interested in the
 

6629
02:29:18,479 --> 02:29:22,389
I would still be more interested in the
short underneath IB

6630
02:29:22,389 --> 02:29:22,399
short underneath IB
 

6631
02:29:22,399 --> 02:29:43,270
short underneath IB
at the moment. We've reclaimed it.

6632
02:29:43,270 --> 02:29:43,280

 

6633
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:45,110

to value area low. This is the move that

6634
02:29:45,110 --> 02:29:45,120
to value area low. This is the move that
 

6635
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:46,790
to value area low. This is the move that
we just talked about. Do they absorb

6636
02:29:46,790 --> 02:29:46,800
we just talked about. Do they absorb
 

6637
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:49,910
we just talked about. Do they absorb
here? Do they now absorb here and then

6638
02:29:49,910 --> 02:29:49,920
here? Do they now absorb here and then
 

6639
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:52,710
here? Do they now absorb here and then
go right back to the top side? I will

6640
02:29:52,710 --> 02:29:52,720
go right back to the top side? I will
 

6641
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:54,870
go right back to the top side? I will
not be playing this long, but if you

6642
02:29:54,870 --> 02:29:54,880
not be playing this long, but if you
 

6643
02:29:54,880 --> 02:29:56,230
not be playing this long, but if you
were looking long, that's what you would

6644
02:29:56,230 --> 02:29:56,240
were looking long, that's what you would
 

6645
02:29:56,240 --> 02:29:57,590
were looking long, that's what you would
want to see. You'd want to see them

6646
02:29:57,590 --> 02:29:57,600
want to see. You'd want to see them
 

6647
02:29:57,600 --> 02:30:01,510
want to see. You'd want to see them
absorb 23s and start to lift to 8 880s

6648
02:30:01,510 --> 02:30:01,520
absorb 23s and start to lift to 8 880s
 

6649
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:03,510
absorb 23s and start to lift to 8 880s
and then 900, which is what you're

6650
02:30:03,510 --> 02:30:03,520
and then 900, which is what you're
 

6651
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:06,950
and then 900, which is what you're
starting to see. This is value.

6652
02:30:06,950 --> 02:30:06,960
starting to see. This is value.
 

6653
02:30:06,960 --> 02:30:10,870
starting to see. This is value.
If they can hold a bid here, big if,

to look for this move here. That's what

6658
02:30:15,510 --> 02:30:15,520
to look for this move here. That's what
 

6659
02:30:15,520 --> 02:30:32,469
to look for this move here. That's what
I'm going to look for personally.

6660
02:30:32,469 --> 02:30:32,479

 

6661
02:30:32,479 --> 02:30:36,469

What is the Discord membership for?

6662
02:30:36,469 --> 02:30:36,479
What is the Discord membership for?
 

6663
02:30:36,479 --> 02:30:37,910
What is the Discord membership for?
I'm not really sure what that question

6664
02:30:37,910 --> 02:30:37,920
I'm not really sure what that question
 

6665

I'm not really sure what that question
is.

6666
02:30:40,070 --> 02:30:40,080
is.
 

6667
02:30:40,080 --> 02:30:41,910
is.
The market's being a wally. It is. It's

6668

making its mind up, isn't it's building
a lot of a lot of liquidity.

6672

02:31:36,630 --> 02:31:36,640
made before the market opened. I will
 

6713
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:44,309
made before the market opened. I will
not be trading this.

6714
02:31:44,309 --> 02:31:44,319

 

6715
02:31:44,319 --> 02:31:47,030

Like I said, it's h holding value. I

6716
02:31:47,030 --> 02:31:47,040
Like I said, it's h holding value. I
 

6717
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:49,110
Like I said, it's h holding value. I
would imagine a break of 50s now is

6718
02:31:49,110 --> 02:31:49,120
would imagine a break of 50s now is
 

6719
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:50,950
would imagine a break of 50s now is
going to lift you to 80s and then up to

6720
02:31:50,950 --> 02:31:50,960
going to lift you to 80s and then up to
 

6721
02:31:50,960 --> 02:31:53,510
going to lift you to 80s and then up to
the 900s.

6722
02:31:53,510 --> 02:31:53,520
the 900s.
 

6723
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:55,190
the 900s.
So, if you are a range trader, it's

6724
02:31:55,190 --> 02:31:55,200
So, if you are a range trader, it's
 

6725
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:57,030
So, if you are a range trader, it's
going to pay you pretty well by the

6726
02:31:57,030 --> 02:31:57,040
going to pay you pretty well by the

especially if they reject value area low
 

6891
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:15,349

6932
02:37:02,309 --> 02:37:02,319
you're in." We got to get under this,
 

6933
02:37:02,319 --> 02:37:04,230
you're in." We got to get under this,
right? We got to get under this pivot

6934
02:37:04,230 --> 02:37:04,240
right? We got to get under this pivot
 

6935
02:37:04,240 --> 02:37:05,990
right? We got to get under this pivot
for me to be interested. Until we get

6936
02:37:05,990 --> 02:37:06,000
for me to be interested. Until we get
 

6937
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:07,670
for me to be interested. Until we get
under that pivot, I am not interested.

6938
02:37:07,670 --> 02:37:07,680
under that pivot, I am not interested.
 

6939
02:37:07,680 --> 02:37:10,070
under that pivot, I am not interested.
Once we get under it, I will consider it

6940
02:37:10,070 --> 02:37:10,080
Once we get under it, I will consider it
 

6941
02:37:10,080 --> 02:37:13,190
Once we get under it, I will consider it
and I will be covering some of my uh

6942
02:37:13,190 --> 02:37:13,200
and I will be covering some of my uh
 

6943
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:15,270
and I will be covering some of my uh
play down into low of day because we

6944
02:37:15,270 --> 02:37:15,280
play down into low of day because we
 

6945
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:17,030
play down into low of day because we
have some sellers caught from 60 and

6946
02:37:17,030 --> 02:37:17,040
have some sellers caught from 60 and
 

6947
02:37:17,040 --> 02:37:18,630
have some sellers caught from 60 and
under. And then I will be trying to get

6948
02:37:18,630 --> 02:37:18,640
under. And then I will be trying to get
 

6949
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:21,110
under. And then I will be trying to get
into previous week close which is at 40.

6950
02:37:21,110 --> 02:37:21,120
into previous week close which is at 40.
 

6951
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:22,389
into previous week close which is at 40.
And then I'll be trying to get into

6952
02:37:22,389 --> 02:37:22,399
And then I'll be trying to get into
 

6953
02:37:22,399 --> 02:37:24,469
And then I'll be trying to get into
previous week point of control which is

6954
02:37:24,469 --> 02:37:24,479
previous week point of control which is
 

6955
02:37:24,479 --> 02:37:27,349
previous week point of control which is
basically just under 690. All right. So

6956
02:37:27,349 --> 02:37:27,359
basically just under 690. All right. So
 

6957
02:37:27,359 --> 02:37:29,270
basically just under 690. All right. So
we're coming down into this IB now. I'm

6958
02:37:29,270 --> 02:37:29,280
we're coming down into this IB now. I'm
 

6959
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:31,270

02:37:31,270 --> 02:37:31,280
getting very interested now in how we
 

6961
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:33,990
getting very interested now in how we
react. All right. So I'm watching this

6962
02:37:33,990 --> 02:37:34,000

6963
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,389

6965
02:37:36,399 --> 02:37:38,230

going to sell through this and if they

6966
02:37:38,230 --> 02:37:38,240
going to sell through this and if they
 

6967
02:37:38,240 --> 02:37:39,830
going to sell through this and if they
offer me a trade or not. At the moment,

offer me a trade or not. At the moment,
 

6969
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:42,150
offer me a trade or not. At the moment,
buyers are still protecting this node

6970

6977
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:55,429

Come on, baby.

6978
02:37:55,429 --> 02:37:55,439

 

6979

It's looking good. There's a buy at

These are all levels.

7044
02:39:25,670 --> 02:39:25,680
These are all levels.
 

7045
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:28,309

02:39:30,230 --> 02:39:30,240
this delta up in here. I'm watching
 

7049
02:39:30,240 --> 02:39:33,750
this delta up in here. I'm watching
these levels, right? So 80, 70, and then

7050
02:39:33,750 --> 02:39:33,760
these levels, right? So 80, 70, and then
 

7051
02:39:33,760 --> 02:39:36,150
these levels, right? So 80, 70, and then
60. And then if we get acceptance, then

7052
02:39:36,150 --> 02:39:36,160
60. And then if we get acceptance, then
 

7053
02:39:36,160 --> 02:39:37,670
60. And then if we get acceptance, then
we can really get heavy. At the moment,

7054
02:39:37,670 --> 02:39:37,680
we can really get heavy. At the moment,
 

7055
02:39:37,680 --> 02:39:38,870
we can really get heavy. At the moment,
we're not seeing it, right? Already

7056
02:39:38,870 --> 02:39:38,880
we're not seeing it, right? Already
 

7057
02:39:38,880 --> 02:39:42,230
we're not seeing it, right? Already

7059
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:44,070

So gray box key, can we stay heavy

7060
02:39:44,070 --> 02:39:44,080
So gray box key, can we stay heavy
 

7061
02:39:44,080 --> 02:39:48,630
So gray box key, can we stay heavy
versus this box? Definitely versus 801s.

7062
02:39:48,630 --> 02:39:48,640
versus this box? Definitely versus 801s.
 

7063
02:39:48,640 --> 02:39:54,309
versus this box? Definitely versus 801s.
Right. Want to stay heavy versus 801s.

They're trying to protect it. It's that

7074
02:40:12,389 --> 02:40:12,399
They're trying to protect it. It's that
 

7075
02:40:12,399 --> 02:40:14,150
They're trying to protect it. It's that
big level we just just talked about.

7076
02:40:14,150 --> 02:40:14,160
big level we just just talked about.
 

7077
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:15,590
big level we just just talked about.
Just showed you it on stream. Right.

7078
02:40:15,590 --> 02:40:15,600
Just showed you it on stream. Right.
 

7079
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:17,429
Just showed you it on stream. Right.
Just this guy here. See this? It's where

7080
02:40:17,429 --> 02:40:17,439
Just this guy here. See this? It's where
 

7081
02:40:17,439 --> 02:40:18,950
Just this guy here. See this? It's where
that big seller is. We need to get under

7082
02:40:18,950 --> 02:40:18,960
that big seller is. We need to get under
 

7083
02:40:18,960 --> 02:40:20,630
that big seller is. We need to get under
that for continuation. If we fail to get

7084
02:40:20,630 --> 02:40:20,640
that for continuation. If we fail to get
 

7085
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:22,870
that for continuation. If we fail to get
under that, we can squeeze, right? So,

7086
02:40:22,870 --> 02:40:22,880
under that, we can squeeze, right? So,
 

7087
02:40:22,880 --> 02:40:24,389
under that, we can squeeze, right? So,
be protective of profits. Make sure

7088
02:40:24,389 --> 02:40:24,399
be protective of profits. Make sure
 

7089
02:40:24,399 --> 02:40:31,349
be protective of profits. Make sure
you're paying yourself today, please.

7090
02:40:31,349 --> 02:40:31,359

 

7091
02:40:31,359 --> 02:40:36,710

back to IB, back to gray box. Probably

7092
02:40:36,710 --> 02:40:36,720

 

7093
02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:38,550

if we fail to break lower, this will be

7094
02:40:38,550 --> 02:40:38,560
if we fail to break lower, this will be
 

7095
02:40:38,560 --> 02:40:40,309
if we fail to break lower, this will be
fail a failure to make a new low. Shorts

7096
02:40:40,309 --> 02:40:40,319
fail a failure to make a new low. Shorts
 

7097
02:40:40,319 --> 02:40:41,590
fail a failure to make a new low. Shorts
will get caught. So, this is why we got

7098
02:40:41,590 --> 02:40:41,600
will get caught. So, this is why we got
 

7099
02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:44,389
will get caught. So, this is why we got
to be very careful here. We do not hold

7100
02:40:44,389 --> 02:40:44,399
to be very careful here. We do not hold
 

7101
02:40:44,399 --> 02:40:48,230
to be very careful here. We do not hold
on reclaims of 800. Certainly not.

7102
02:40:48,230 --> 02:40:48,240
on reclaims of 800. Certainly not.
 

7103
02:40:48,240 --> 02:40:52,469
on reclaims of 800. Certainly not.
Certainly not.

7104

7105
02:40:52,479 --> 02:41:02,550

There's

7106
02:41:02,550 --> 02:41:02,560

 

7107
02:41:02,560 --> 02:41:04,230

IB test. They're going to come up for

7108
02:41:04,230 --> 02:41:04,240
IB test. They're going to come up for
 

7109
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:06,950
IB test. They're going to come up for
800 by the looks of it. Any break of

7110
02:41:06,950 --> 02:41:06,960
800 by the looks of it. Any break of
 

7111
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:13,750
800 by the looks of it. Any break of
800, I will be gonzo.

7112
02:41:13,750 --> 02:41:13,760

 

7113
02:41:13,760 --> 02:41:16,550

There's the 800. I'm out now and can

There's the 800. I'm out now and can
 

7115
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:18,070
There's the 800. I'm out now and can
always enter back in later, but probably

7116
02:41:18,070 --> 02:41:18,080
always enter back in later, but probably
 

7117
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:19,590
always enter back in later, but probably
going to call it a day there with seven

7118
02:41:19,590 --> 02:41:19,600
going to call it a day there with seven
 

7119
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:21,429
going to call it a day there with seven
minutes left. Right. I owe you guys

7120
02:41:21,429 --> 02:41:21,439
minutes left. Right. I owe you guys
 

7121
02:41:21,439 --> 02:41:23,830
minutes left. Right. I owe you guys
another course. Right. How many have we

7122
02:41:23,830 --> 02:41:23,840
another course. Right. How many have we
 

7123
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:33,030
another course. Right. How many have we
done? Yes, we do one more.

7124
02:41:33,030 --> 02:41:33,040

 

7125
02:41:33,040 --> 02:41:35,270

How did I win? I literally just entered.

7126
02:41:35,270 --> 02:41:35,280
How did I win? I literally just entered.
 

7127
02:41:35,280 --> 02:41:37,910
How did I win? I literally just entered.
I entered on the break here and I moved

7128
02:41:37,910 --> 02:41:37,920
I entered on the break here and I moved
 

7129
02:41:37,920 --> 02:41:41,270
I entered on the break here and I moved
stop. Right. And I take profit. I manage

7130
02:41:41,270 --> 02:41:41,280
stop. Right. And I take profit. I manage
 

7131
02:41:41,280 --> 02:41:44,630

my expectations, don't I? Right. That's

7132
02:41:44,630 --> 02:41:44,640
my expectations, don't I? Right. That's
 

7133
02:41:44,640 --> 02:41:48,870
my expectations, don't I? Right. That's
still 90 down to 60. Right. Still 25

7134
02:41:48,870 --> 02:41:48,880
still 90 down to 60. Right. Still 25
 

7135
02:41:48,880 --> 02:41:57,670
still 90 down to 60. Right. Still 25
points. All

7136
02:41:57,670 --> 02:41:57,680

 

7137
02:41:57,680 --> 02:41:59,510

right, let me set this up. We're going

7138
02:41:59,510 --> 02:41:59,520
right, let me set this up. We're going
 

7139
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:11,190
right, let me set this up. We're going
to give away. Where is it gone?

7140
02:42:11,190 --> 02:42:11,200

 

7141
02:42:11,200 --> 02:42:12,950

All right, giving away one more course

7142
02:42:12,950 --> 02:42:12,960
All right, giving away one more course
 

7143
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:17,190
All right, giving away one more course
here. So, just type course in.

7144
02:42:17,190 --> 02:42:17,200
here. So, just type course in.
 

7145
02:42:17,200 --> 02:42:19,190
here. So, just type course in.
They might still set this up and they'll

7146
02:42:19,190 --> 02:42:19,200
They might still set this up and they'll
 

7147
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:20,550
They might still set this up and they'll
probably set it up without me if they do

7148
02:42:20,550 --> 02:42:20,560
probably set it up without me if they do
 

7149
02:42:20,560 --> 02:42:23,429
probably set it up without me if they do
it. Now, we just type course into chat.

7150
02:42:23,429 --> 02:42:23,439
it. Now, we just type course into chat.
 

7151
02:42:23,439 --> 02:42:25,030
it. Now, we just type course into chat.
We'll give one more introduction course

7152
02:42:25,030 --> 02:42:25,040
We'll give one more introduction course
 

7153
02:42:25,040 --> 02:42:28,150
We'll give one more introduction course
away

7154
02:42:28,150 --> 02:42:28,160

 

7155
02:42:28,160 --> 02:42:30,070

over 800. There's potentially a squeeze.

7156
02:42:30,070 --> 02:42:30,080
over 800. There's potentially a squeeze.
 

7157
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:32,469
over 800. There's potentially a squeeze.
Certainly, if they go back inside the uh

7158
02:42:32,469 --> 02:42:32,479
Certainly, if they go back inside the uh
 

7159
02:42:32,479 --> 02:42:35,670
Certainly, if they go back inside the uh
value area, it's just messy right now.

7160
02:42:35,670 --> 02:42:35,680
value area, it's just messy right now.
 

7161
02:42:35,680 --> 02:42:37,030
value area, it's just messy right now.
That's probably me done for the day.

7162
02:42:37,030 --> 02:42:37,040
That's probably me done for the day.
 

7163
02:42:37,040 --> 02:42:38,389
That's probably me done for the day.
I've I've had a few attempts at that.

7164
02:42:38,389 --> 02:42:38,399
I've I've had a few attempts at that.
 

7165
02:42:38,399 --> 02:42:39,910
I've I've had a few attempts at that.
Made a little bit of money today, but

7166
02:42:39,910 --> 02:42:39,920
Made a little bit of money today, but
 

7167
02:42:39,920 --> 02:42:42,710
Made a little bit of money today, but
not a lot. Not great money today, but we

7168
02:42:42,710 --> 02:42:42,720
not a lot. Not great money today, but we
 

7169
02:42:42,720 --> 02:42:45,349
not a lot. Not great money today, but we
haven't had a lot to play with. No

7170
02:42:45,349 --> 02:42:45,359
haven't had a lot to play with. No
 

7171
02:42:45,359 --> 02:42:47,750
haven't had a lot to play with. No
continuation.

7172
02:42:47,750 --> 02:42:47,760
continuation.
 

7173
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:50,389
continuation.
So, just type course once.

7174
02:42:50,389 --> 02:42:50,399
So, just type course once.
 

7175
02:42:50,399 --> 02:42:52,309
So, just type course once.

Okay, it's going to do it now, isn't it?
 

7239
02:44:49,760 --> 02:44:52,710
Okay, it's going to do it now, isn't it?
Now that it's now that I'm out is going

7240
02:44:52,710 --> 02:44:52,720
Now that it's now that I'm out is going
 

7241
02:44:52,720 --> 02:44:54,870
Now that it's now that I'm out is going

7242
02:44:54,870 --> 02:44:54,880
to do it, isn't it? It's just sods sods
 

7243
02:44:54,880 --> 02:44:56,389
to do it, isn't it? It's just sods sods
law. It has to [\h__\h] around in this gray

7244
02:44:56,389 --> 02:44:56,399
law. It has to [\h__\h] around in this gray
 

7245
02:44:56,399 --> 02:44:59,269
law. It has to [\h__\h] around in this gray
box so much that it drives me insane.

7246
02:44:59,269 --> 02:44:59,279
box so much that it drives me insane.
 

7247
02:44:59,279 --> 02:45:01,269
box so much that it drives me insane.
Um, we have built sufficient liquidity

7248
02:45:01,269 --> 02:45:01,279
Um, we have built sufficient liquidity
 

7249
02:45:01,279 --> 02:45:03,190
Um, we have built sufficient liquidity
now. I tell you what, we we've done the

7250
02:45:03,190 --> 02:45:03,200
now. I tell you what, we we've done the
 

7251
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:05,510
now. I tell you what, we we've done the
move. We have built sufficient

7252
02:45:05,510 --> 02:45:05,520
move. We have built sufficient
 

7253
02:45:05,520 --> 02:45:08,469
move. We have built sufficient
liquidity. Now, uh I think that is very

7254
02:45:08,469 --> 02:45:08,479
liquidity. Now, uh I think that is very
 

7255
02:45:08,479 --> 02:45:10,230
liquidity. Now, uh I think that is very
possible. Now, if you're still in this,

7256
02:45:10,230 --> 02:45:10,240
possible. Now, if you're still in this,
 

7257
02:45:10,240 --> 02:45:11,910
possible. Now, if you're still in this,
you need a break under 70. That's where

7258
02:45:11,910 --> 02:45:11,920
you need a break under 70. That's where
 

7259
02:45:11,920 --> 02:45:13,269
you need a break under 70. That's where
the seller keeps getting stuck. I've

7260
02:45:13,269 --> 02:45:13,279
the seller keeps getting stuck. I've
 

7261
02:45:13,279 --> 02:45:15,670
the seller keeps getting stuck. I've
said it so many times. This guy here,

7262
02:45:15,670 --> 02:45:15,680
said it so many times. This guy here,
 

7263
02:45:15,680 --> 02:45:17,750
said it so many times. This guy here,
this delta here, you need a break under

7264
02:45:17,750 --> 02:45:17,760
this delta here, you need a break under
 

7265
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:19,750
this delta here, you need a break under
70. It is a good auction at the lows,

7266
02:45:19,750 --> 02:45:19,760
70. It is a good auction at the lows,
 

7267
02:45:19,760 --> 02:45:21,190
70. It is a good auction at the lows,
but there is an imbalance underneath.

7268
02:45:21,190 --> 02:45:21,200
but there is an imbalance underneath.
 

7269
02:45:21,200 --> 02:45:23,670
but there is an imbalance underneath.
So, if you get 70s, you might get 60s

7270
02:45:23,670 --> 02:45:23,680
So, if you get 70s, you might get 60s
 

7271
02:45:23,680 --> 02:45:25,510
So, if you get 70s, you might get 60s
and 50s quick. And if you snap that,

7272
02:45:25,510 --> 02:45:25,520
and 50s quick. And if you snap that,
 

7273
02:45:25,520 --> 02:45:27,510
and 50s quick. And if you snap that,
then we're looking for 690. All right?

7274
02:45:27,510 --> 02:45:27,520
then we're looking for 690. All right?
 

7275
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:30,309
then we're looking for 690. All right?
You're looking 690 if you can snap it

7276
02:45:30,309 --> 02:45:30,319
You're looking 690 if you can snap it
 

7277
02:45:30,319 --> 02:45:32,630
You're looking 690 if you can snap it
all. big if butts and maybe, but that's

7278
02:45:32,630 --> 02:45:32,640
all. big if butts and maybe, but that's
 

7279
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:37,510
all. big if butts and maybe, but that's
what you're looking at.

7280
02:45:37,510 --> 02:45:37,520

 

7281
02:45:37,520 --> 02:45:39,190

Hopefully, it does it for you. It' be

7282
02:45:39,190 --> 02:45:39,200
Hopefully, it does it for you. It' be
 

7283
02:45:39,200 --> 02:45:41,030
Hopefully, it does it for you. It' be
really nice if it gives you if you get

7284
02:45:41,030 --> 02:45:41,040
really nice if it gives you if you get
 

7285
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:43,670
really nice if it gives you if you get
from 790 to 690, that's a 100 point

7286
02:45:43,670 --> 02:45:43,680
from 790 to 690, that's a 100 point
 

7287
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:46,389
from 790 to 690, that's a 100 point
trade to end the week with. So, you

7288
02:45:46,389 --> 02:45:46,399

7290
02:45:48,630 --> 02:45:48,640
never know.
 

7291
02:45:48,640 --> 02:45:53,030
never know.
Feel like you deserve it.

7292
02:45:53,030 --> 02:45:53,040

 

7293

7303
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:07,030
a liquid and envy or something. I think
that was Abedine.

7304
02:46:07,030 --> 02:46:07,040
that was Abedine.

hit TP, knockout runner, and we traded
 

7483
02:49:58,960 --> 02:50:02,950
hit TP, knockout runner, and we traded
maybe this one here. Took a little TP,

7484
02:50:02,950 --> 02:50:02,960
maybe this one here. Took a little TP,
 

7485
02:50:02,960 --> 02:50:04,469
maybe this one here. Took a little TP,
knock out on the rest. And then I had

7486
02:50:04,469 --> 02:50:04,479
knock out on the rest. And then I had
 

7487
02:50:04,479 --> 02:50:07,030
knock out on the rest. And then I had
another go here. Took the break a little

7488
02:50:07,030 --> 02:50:07,040
another go here. Took the break a little
 

7489
02:50:07,040 --> 02:50:09,830
another go here. Took the break a little
bit earlier. Came down. I didn't want it

7490
02:50:09,830 --> 02:50:09,840
bit earlier. Came down. I didn't want it
 

7491
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:11,830
bit earlier. Came down. I didn't want it
to reclaim this shelf, right? Stop was

7492
02:50:11,830 --> 02:50:11,840
to reclaim this shelf, right? Stop was
 

7493
02:50:11,840 --> 02:50:13,750
to reclaim this shelf, right? Stop was
protecting this shelf. Knocked me out

7494
02:50:13,750 --> 02:50:13,760
protecting this shelf. Knocked me out
 

7495
02:50:13,760 --> 02:50:16,150
protecting this shelf. Knocked me out
and then went. It's just like three

7496
02:50:16,150 --> 02:50:16,160
and then went. It's just like three
 

7497
02:50:16,160 --> 02:50:19,510
and then went. It's just like three
three goes, mate, is is enough. Do you

7498
02:50:19,510 --> 02:50:19,520
three goes, mate, is is enough. Do you
 

7499
02:50:19,520 --> 02:50:21,670
three goes, mate, is is enough. Do you
know what I mean? Like sometimes the

7500
02:50:21,670 --> 02:50:21,680
know what I mean? Like sometimes the
 

7501
02:50:21,680 --> 02:50:23,190
know what I mean? Like sometimes the
market doesn't give me what I want. It's

7502
02:50:23,190 --> 02:50:23,200
market doesn't give me what I want. It's
 

7503
02:50:23,200 --> 02:50:35,750
market doesn't give me what I want. It's
just it is what it is. It is what it is.

7504
02:50:35,750 --> 02:50:35,760

 

7505
02:50:35,760 --> 02:50:37,750

Yeah. Well done everyone. And lot lots

Yeah. Well done everyone. And lot lots
of you should have had a big week. I

7508
02:50:39,030 --> 02:50:39,040
of you should have had a big week. I
 

7509
02:50:39,040 --> 02:50:41,190
of you should have had a big week. I
mean this this is going to go for you

7510
02:50:41,190 --> 02:50:41,200
mean this this is going to go for you
 

7511
02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:44,230
mean this this is going to go for you
now. This looks good. This looks good.

7512
02:50:44,230 --> 02:50:44,240
now. This looks good. This looks good.
 

7513
02:50:44,240 --> 02:50:46,550
now. This looks good. This looks good.
Now think about this now what we're

7514
02:50:46,550 --> 02:50:46,560
Now think about this now what we're
 

7515
02:50:46,560 --> 02:50:47,990
Now think about this now what we're
doing. All right. This is why it's

7516
02:50:47,990 --> 02:50:48,000
doing. All right. This is why it's
 

7517
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:49,349
doing. All right. This is why it's
important to try and be patient and

7518
02:50:49,349 --> 02:50:49,359
important to try and be patient and
 

7519
02:50:49,359 --> 02:50:51,429
important to try and be patient and
position yourself for the moves. It

7520
02:50:51,429 --> 02:50:51,439
position yourself for the moves. It
 

7521
02:50:51,439 --> 02:50:53,590
position yourself for the moves. It
doesn't always work, but if we zoom out

7522
02:50:53,590 --> 02:50:53,600
doesn't always work, but if we zoom out
 

7523
02:50:53,600 --> 02:50:57,590
doesn't always work, but if we zoom out
now, right, if we zoom out,

7524
02:50:57,590 --> 02:50:57,600
now, right, if we zoom out,
 

7525
02:50:57,600 --> 02:50:59,590
now, right, if we zoom out,
we have a chance. Remember, someone said

7526
02:50:59,590 --> 02:50:59,600
we have a chance. Remember, someone said
 

7527
02:50:59,600 --> 02:51:00,870
we have a chance. Remember, someone said
we're really bullish today. I was like,

7528
02:51:00,870 --> 02:51:00,880
we're really bullish today. I was like,
 

7529
02:51:00,880 --> 02:51:03,510
we're really bullish today. I was like,
we're definitely not. We've left trapped

7530
02:51:03,510 --> 02:51:03,520
we're definitely not. We've left trapped
 

7531
02:51:03,520 --> 02:51:06,550
we're definitely not. We've left trapped
buyers. We sold yesterday. We have the

7532
02:51:06,550 --> 02:51:06,560
buyers. We sold yesterday. We have the
 

7533
02:51:06,560 --> 02:51:08,389
buyers. We sold yesterday. We have the
first pullback. They've resold this.

7534
02:51:08,389 --> 02:51:08,399
first pullback. They've resold this.
 

7535
02:51:08,399 --> 02:51:10,550
first pullback. They've resold this.
They failed to make a new high. They're

7536
02:51:10,550 --> 02:51:10,560
They failed to make a new high. They're
 

7537
02:51:10,560 --> 02:51:12,630
They failed to make a new high. They're
reselling this. If you break this low,

7538
02:51:12,630 --> 02:51:12,640
reselling this. If you break this low,
 

7539
02:51:12,640 --> 02:51:14,469
reselling this. If you break this low,
probability is you come down into here,

7540
02:51:14,469 --> 02:51:14,479
probability is you come down into here,
 

7541
02:51:14,479 --> 02:51:16,950
probability is you come down into here,
right? This is bearish

7542
02:51:16,950 --> 02:51:16,960
right? This is bearish
 

7543
02:51:16,960 --> 02:51:18,870
right? This is bearish
volume being built out. All right,

7544
02:51:18,870 --> 02:51:18,880
volume being built out. All right,
 

7545
02:51:18,880 --> 02:51:20,469
volume being built out. All right,
especially if we do this next week,

7546
02:51:20,469 --> 02:51:20,479
especially if we do this next week,
 

7547
02:51:20,479 --> 02:51:22,070
especially if we do this next week,
which would be fun. The bullish move

7548
02:51:22,070 --> 02:51:22,080
which would be fun. The bullish move
 

7549
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:24,070
which would be fun. The bullish move
would be coming in a reclaim of that.

7550
02:51:24,070 --> 02:51:24,080
would be coming in a reclaim of that.
 

7551
02:51:24,080 --> 02:51:25,990
would be coming in a reclaim of that.
But that's when it gets uber bullish for

7552
02:51:25,990 --> 02:51:26,000
But that's when it gets uber bullish for
 

7553
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:27,910
But that's when it gets uber bullish for
the market. Not until it's just

7554
02:51:27,910 --> 02:51:27,920
the market. Not until it's just
 

7555
02:51:27,920 --> 02:51:30,389
the market. Not until it's just
liquidity build out today. And it can

7556
02:51:30,389 --> 02:51:30,399
liquidity build out today. And it can
 

7557
02:51:30,399 --> 02:51:32,469
liquidity build out today. And it can
very easily be a bearish continuation

7558
02:51:32,469 --> 02:51:32,479
very easily be a bearish continuation
 

7559
02:51:32,479 --> 02:51:36,309
very easily be a bearish continuation
because we expect this point here to be

7560
02:51:36,309 --> 02:51:36,319
because we expect this point here to be
 

7561
02:51:36,319 --> 02:51:39,269
because we expect this point here to be
sold. And if anyone's like, "Oh, it's

7562
02:51:39,269 --> 02:51:39,279
sold. And if anyone's like, "Oh, it's
 

7563
02:51:39,279 --> 02:51:41,750
sold. And if anyone's like, "Oh, it's
hindsight." It [\h__\h] is not, mate.

7564
02:51:41,750 --> 02:51:41,760
hindsight." It [\h__\h] is not, mate.
 

7565
02:51:41,760 --> 02:51:44,550
hindsight." It [\h__\h] is not, mate.
Like

7566
02:51:44,550 --> 02:51:44,560
Like
 

7567
02:51:44,560 --> 02:51:48,389
Like
We talked about this here. Here we go.

7568
02:51:48,389 --> 02:51:48,399
We talked about this here. Here we go.
 

7569

There's the resell back down. That would

7570
02:51:50,469 --> 02:51:50,479
There's the resell back down. That would
 

7571
02:51:50,479 --> 02:51:52,469
There's the resell back down. That would
be the reclaim for the bullish move. All

7572
02:51:52,469 --> 02:51:52,479
be the reclaim for the bullish move. All
 

7573
02:51:52,479 --> 02:51:54,070
be the reclaim for the bullish move. All
right. We talked about it all. We talked

7574
02:51:54,070 --> 02:51:54,080
right. We talked about it all. We talked
 

7575
02:51:54,080 --> 02:51:56,630
right. We talked about it all. We talked
about it even on stream yesterday. We

7576
02:51:56,630 --> 02:51:56,640
about it even on stream yesterday. We
 

7577
02:51:56,640 --> 02:51:58,870
about it even on stream yesterday. We
talked about all of this. All of this

7581
02:52:04,640 --> 02:52:11,590

65 649 for runners. Uh I would say

7582
02:52:11,590 --> 02:52:11,600
65 649 for runners. Uh I would say
 

7583
02:52:11,600 --> 02:52:14,950
65 649 for runners. Uh I would say
6590. So you can just call it 700 and

7584
02:52:14,950 --> 02:52:14,960
6590. So you can just call it 700 and
 

7585
02:52:14,960 --> 02:52:19,349
6590. So you can just call it 700 and
then yes uh 50. So 650. So 700 650 if

7586
02:52:19,349 --> 02:52:19,359
then yes uh 50. So 650. So 700 650 if
 

7587
02:52:19,359 --> 02:52:21,429
then yes uh 50. So 650. So 700 650 if
you want to make it easy for yourself.

7588
02:52:21,429 --> 02:52:21,439
you want to make it easy for yourself.
 

7589
02:52:21,439 --> 02:52:24,150
you want to make it easy for yourself.
580 and if you got very very very lucky

7590
02:52:24,150 --> 02:52:24,160
580 and if you got very very very lucky
 

7591

7593
02:52:30,560 --> 02:52:33,429

This is going to kill me. This is one of

7594
02:52:33,429 --> 02:52:33,439
This is going to kill me. This is one of
 

7595
02:52:33,439 --> 02:52:34,790
This is going to kill me. This is one of
the hardest things with trading, right?

7596
02:52:34,790 --> 02:52:34,800
the hardest things with trading, right?
 

7597
02:52:34,800 --> 02:52:36,309
the hardest things with trading, right?
When you have three goes at something

7598
02:52:36,309 --> 02:52:36,319
When you have three goes at something
 

7599
02:52:36,319 --> 02:52:38,070
When you have three goes at something
and it goes on the last time when you're

not in it.

7602
02:52:40,070 --> 02:52:40,080
not in it.
 

7603

not in it.
I'm only human.

7607
02:52:47,200 --> 02:52:49,349

How do I place stop losses, Alex? I try

7608
02:52:49,349 --> 02:52:49,359
How do I place stop losses, Alex? I try
 

7609
02:52:49,359 --> 02:52:50,870
How do I place stop losses, Alex? I try
and place them the other side of the

7610
02:52:50,870 --> 02:52:50,880
and place them the other side of the
 

7611
02:52:50,880 --> 02:52:52,630
and place them the other side of the
node, right? Which is why I got stopped

7612
02:52:52,630 --> 02:52:52,640
node, right? Which is why I got stopped
 

7613
02:52:52,640 --> 02:52:55,349
node, right? Which is why I got stopped
out here. See this node being developed?

7614
02:52:55,349 --> 02:52:55,359
out here. See this node being developed?
 

7615
02:52:55,359 --> 02:52:57,110
out here. See this node being developed?
I decided that instead of using the

7616
02:52:57,110 --> 02:52:57,120
I decided that instead of using the
 

7617
02:52:57,120 --> 02:52:58,950
I decided that instead of using the
whole gray box, I was going to use this

7618
02:52:58,950 --> 02:52:58,960
whole gray box, I was going to use this
 

7619
02:52:58,960 --> 02:53:00,550
whole gray box, I was going to use this
node which had been developed, right?

7620
02:53:00,550 --> 02:53:00,560
node which had been developed, right?
 

7621
02:53:00,560 --> 02:53:02,230
node which had been developed, right?
So, I placed my stop the other side of

7622
02:53:02,230 --> 02:53:02,240
So, I placed my stop the other side of
 

7623
02:53:02,240 --> 02:53:05,670
So, I placed my stop the other side of
this node and I got stopped out.

7624
02:53:05,670 --> 02:53:05,680
this node and I got stopped out.
 

7625
02:53:05,680 --> 02:53:08,230
this node and I got stopped out.
If id done it right based on this gray

7626
02:53:08,230 --> 02:53:08,240
If id done it right based on this gray
 

7627
02:53:08,240 --> 02:53:11,670
If id done it right based on this gray
box, which if we zoom out was based on

7628
02:53:11,670 --> 02:53:11,680
box, which if we zoom out was based on
 

7629
02:53:11,680 --> 02:53:13,830
box, which if we zoom out was based on
this node here from the developing week,

7630
02:53:13,830 --> 02:53:13,840
this node here from the developing week,
 

7631
02:53:13,840 --> 02:53:17,990
this node here from the developing week,
I probably would have been okay,

7632
02:53:17,990 --> 02:53:18,000

 

7633
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,950

you know. [\h__\h] man. Like, here you go,

7634
