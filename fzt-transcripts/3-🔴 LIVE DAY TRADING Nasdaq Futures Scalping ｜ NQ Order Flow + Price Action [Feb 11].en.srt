shelf we talked about early week. Same
 

61
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,469
shelf we talked about early week. Same
shelf in the newsletter. We can look

62
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
shelf in the newsletter. We can look
 

63
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,870
shelf in the newsletter. We can look
left and look at the yearly kind of

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
left and look at the yearly kind of
 

65
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,790
left and look at the yearly kind of
spikes. And we have some nodes up here

66
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
spikes. And we have some nodes up here
 

67
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,550
spikes. And we have some nodes up here
into 600 and into towards 700. Both of

68
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
into 600 and into towards 700. Both of
 

69
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,430
into 600 and into towards 700. Both of
those are big big gamma exposure levels

70
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
those are big big gamma exposure levels
 

71
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,870
those are big big gamma exposure levels
today which I will go through. All

72
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:50,880
today which I will go through. All
 

73
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,790
today which I will go through. All
right. Big gam gamma exposure levels

74
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
right. Big gam gamma exposure levels
 

75
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,150
right. Big gam gamma exposure levels
both intraday. 600 intraday and 700 for

76
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
both intraday. 600 intraday and 700 for
 

77
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,830
both intraday. 600 intraday and 700 for
the week.

78
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:57,840
the week.
 

79
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,629
the week.
Okay. So I am still considering whether

80
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
Okay. So I am still considering whether
 

81
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,550
Okay. So I am still considering whether
they do it today or later in the week. A

82
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
they do it today or later in the week. A
 

83
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,110
they do it today or later in the week. A
big old bull trap in here which is then

84
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
big old bull trap in here which is then
 

85
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,350
big old bull trap in here which is then
sold into. All right. But how we act in

86
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
sold into. All right. But how we act in
 

87
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,189
sold into. All right. But how we act in
here is what is going to determine that

88
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
here is what is going to determine that
 

89
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,629
here is what is going to determine that
we've already just swept the high of

90
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
we've already just swept the high of
 

91
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,309
we've already just swept the high of
yesterday by a tick or two. I don't

92
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
yesterday by a tick or two. I don't
 

93
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,230
yesterday by a tick or two. I don't
think it's enough excess. And we will go

94
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,240
think it's enough excess. And we will go
 

95
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,790
think it's enough excess. And we will go
through that now

96
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
through that now
 

97
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,710
through that now
in the hourlys. All right. This is what

98
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
in the hourlys. All right. This is what
 

99
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,390
in the hourlys. All right. This is what
we were looking for yesterday. We talked

100
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
we were looking for yesterday. We talked
 

101
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,070
we were looking for yesterday. We talked
about the controlled selling. The

102
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
about the controlled selling. The
 

103
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,270
about the controlled selling. The
controlled selling yesterday. Controlled

104
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
controlled selling yesterday. Controlled
 

105
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,270
controlled selling yesterday. Controlled
selling push. Controlled selling. And

106
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
selling push. Controlled selling. And
 

107
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,550
selling push. Controlled selling. And
they caught them on NFP into this old

108
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
they caught them on NFP into this old
 

109
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,630
they caught them on NFP into this old
pivot in just in front of this node

110
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
pivot in just in front of this node
 

111
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,829
pivot in just in front of this node
here. All right. They didn't quite get

112
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
here. All right. They didn't quite get
 

113
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,110
here. All right. They didn't quite get
there. This node here we were looking

114
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,120
there. This node here we were looking
 

115
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,829
there. This node here we were looking
for to buy the 100s. We talked about

116
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:37,839
for to buy the 100s. We talked about
 

117
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,750
for to buy the 100s. We talked about
this wash if it hasn't cleared all out

118
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
this wash if it hasn't cleared all out
 

119
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,230
this wash if it hasn't cleared all out
to the 100s holding and then probably a

120
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
to the 100s holding and then probably a
 

121
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,470
to the 100s holding and then probably a
rip to clear out these stops here if not

122
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
rip to clear out these stops here if not
 

123
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,230
rip to clear out these stops here if not
these stops here. Right. So, we've done

124
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
these stops here. Right. So, we've done
 

125
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,470
these stops here. Right. So, we've done
the first level. We're looking at this

126
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
the first level. We're looking at this
 

127
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,030
the first level. We're looking at this
above 500. There is a very good chance

128
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
above 500. There is a very good chance
 

129
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,870
above 500. There is a very good chance
that they will set a bull trap. Now, you

130
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
that they will set a bull trap. Now, you
 

131
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,389
that they will set a bull trap. Now, you
can see I've put this on today. It's the

132
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:54,399
can see I've put this on today. It's the
 

133
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,230
can see I've put this on today. It's the
first time I've done it, but I'm going

134
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
first time I've done it, but I'm going
 

135
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,990
first time I've done it, but I'm going
to pay attention to it. It lines up

136
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
to pay attention to it. It lines up
 

137
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,070
to pay attention to it. It lines up
pretty well. So if we look at that 600,

138
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
pretty well. So if we look at that 600,
 

139
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,829
pretty well. So if we look at that 600,
look at the edge of the previous week up

140
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
look at the edge of the previous week up
 

141
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,949
look at the edge of the previous week up
here from the week starting the 26th of

142
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:04,959
here from the week starting the 26th of
 

143
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,670
here from the week starting the 26th of
Jan, right? It's back to the old value

144
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
Jan, right? It's back to the old value
 

145
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,430
Jan, right? It's back to the old value
area low if we get there. So a squeeze

146
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
area low if we get there. So a squeeze
 

147
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,030
area low if we get there. So a squeeze
can happen if we base and hold here. All

148
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
can happen if we base and hold here. All
 

149
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,949
can happen if we base and hold here. All
right, so where we are now, if we build

150
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
right, so where we are now, if we build
 

151
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,269
right, so where we are now, if we build
liquidity here, they can look for this

152
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
liquidity here, they can look for this
 

153
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,030
liquidity here, they can look for this
squeeze to take out 515s up to 600.

154
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
squeeze to take out 515s up to 600.
 

155
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,030
squeeze to take out 515s up to 600.
That's your intraday gex level through

156
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
That's your intraday gex level through
 

157
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,750
That's your intraday gex level through
that 700. My feeling is that in here,

158
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
that 700. My feeling is that in here,
 

159
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,750
that 700. My feeling is that in here,
probably in front of 800 because we

160
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:31,760
probably in front of 800 because we
 

161
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,030
probably in front of 800 because we
haven't got really a level to get up

162
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
haven't got really a level to get up
 

163
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,110
haven't got really a level to get up
there that if they protect this, it is

164
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
there that if they protect this, it is
 

165
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,070
there that if they protect this, it is
likely to be a big bull trap. I would

166
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
likely to be a big bull trap. I would
 

167
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,470
likely to be a big bull trap. I would
like to see a squeeze out into here. I

168
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
like to see a squeeze out into here. I
 

169
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,750
like to see a squeeze out into here. I
don't know if I'll play the long. I

170
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
don't know if I'll play the long. I
 

171
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,150
don't know if I'll play the long. I
might well wait for the short and see if

172
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
might well wait for the short and see if
 

173
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,430
might well wait for the short and see if
they trap bulls anywhere above 500 into

174
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
they trap bulls anywhere above 500 into
 

175
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,509
they trap bulls anywhere above 500 into
six, maybe into seven, but right ideally

176
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
six, maybe into seven, but right ideally
 

177
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,590
six, maybe into seven, but right ideally
into six. If they track bulls buying

178
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
into six. If they track bulls buying
 

179
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,070
into six. If they track bulls buying
high for a complete collapse back down

180
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
high for a complete collapse back down
 

181
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,710
high for a complete collapse back down
to repric this NFP candle, I will be

182
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
to repric this NFP candle, I will be
 

183
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,190
to repric this NFP candle, I will be
watching 360s. I'll be watching previous

184
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
watching 360s. I'll be watching previous
 

185
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,509
watching 360s. I'll be watching previous
day value area high and I'll be watching

186
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
day value area high and I'll be watching
 

187
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,910
day value area high and I'll be watching
the previous day point of control down

188
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:05,920
the previous day point of control down
 

189
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,590
the previous day point of control down
here. All right, this is what I would

190
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
here. All right, this is what I would
 

191
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,269
here. All right, this is what I would
like to see. I don't know if we get it

192
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
like to see. I don't know if we get it
 

193
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,590
like to see. I don't know if we get it
today. They might save that or tomorrow.

194
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
today. They might save that or tomorrow.
 

195
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,829
today. They might save that or tomorrow.
I don't know. But I would like to see

196
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
I don't know. But I would like to see
 

197
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,550
I don't know. But I would like to see
bullsh and a collapse back down inside.

198
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
bullsh and a collapse back down inside.
 

199
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,990
bullsh and a collapse back down inside.
And if they stay heavy for the rest of

200
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
And if they stay heavy for the rest of
 

201
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,670
And if they stay heavy for the rest of
the week, then I'm going to be watching

202
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
the week, then I'm going to be watching
 

203
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,509
the week, then I'm going to be watching
this naked point of control down here.

204
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
this naked point of control down here.
 

205
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,069
this naked point of control down here.
All right, that is definitely doable.

206
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
All right, that is definitely doable.
 

207
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,990
All right, that is definitely doable.
That would be a fantastic trap if they

208
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
That would be a fantastic trap if they
 

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,310
That would be a fantastic trap if they
do it. If they don't do that, if they

210
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
do it. If they don't do that, if they
 

211
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,470
do it. If they don't do that, if they
decide, hey, do you know what? We've

212
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
decide, hey, do you know what? We've
 

213
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,069
decide, hey, do you know what? We've
sold tech enough. We're going to go full

214
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
sold tech enough. We're going to go full
 

215
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,310
sold tech enough. We're going to go full
bullish, then they'll base here and look

216
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
bullish, then they'll base here and look
 

217
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,990
bullish, then they'll base here and look
for this. And we'd have to wait for them

218
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
for this. And we'd have to wait for them
 

219
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,389
for this. And we'd have to wait for them
to rehold a similar level and go again

220
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:38,399
to rehold a similar level and go again
 

221
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,110
to rehold a similar level and go again
and stair step very much like this,

222
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,120
and stair step very much like this,
 

223
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,470
and stair step very much like this,
right? We'd be looking for the same

224
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,480
right? We'd be looking for the same
 

225
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,470
right? We'd be looking for the same
thing again. All right, so I will

226
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
thing again. All right, so I will
 

227
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,150
thing again. All right, so I will
consider that. It's not my preference,

228
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
consider that. It's not my preference,
 

229
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,150
consider that. It's not my preference,
but I will consider it. My preference is

230
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
but I will consider it. My preference is
 

231
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,910
but I will consider it. My preference is
to look for the fade on a big bull trap.

232
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
to look for the fade on a big bull trap.
 

233
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,030
to look for the fade on a big bull trap.
Lower time frame. Um, you can see we

234
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
Lower time frame. Um, you can see we
 

235
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,470
Lower time frame. Um, you can see we
have just taken out the previous day

236
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
have just taken out the previous day
 

237
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,069
have just taken out the previous day
high and previous week B area high. This

238
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079
high and previous week B area high. This
 

239
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,590
high and previous week B area high. This
is the same level as yesterday. That

240
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
is the same level as yesterday. That
 

241
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,269
is the same level as yesterday. That
gray box where we trapped those balls

242
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
gray box where we trapped those balls
 

243
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,269
gray box where we trapped those balls
yesterday. We just cleared them out and

244
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279
yesterday. We just cleared them out and
 

245
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,870
yesterday. We just cleared them out and
we're trading back inside right now. So,

246
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
we're trading back inside right now. So,
 

247
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,430
we're trading back inside right now. So,
we're going to watch I'd say

248
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
we're going to watch I'd say
 

249
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,870
we're going to watch I'd say
if they're going to dip and rip this

250
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
if they're going to dip and rip this
 

251
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,949
if they're going to dip and rip this
morning, we can watch this level into

252
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,959
morning, we can watch this level into
 

253
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,949
morning, we can watch this level into
here to see if they hold that to do

254
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
here to see if they hold that to do
 

255
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,630
here to see if they hold that to do
that. And then you're looking for five

256
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
that. And then you're looking for five
 

257
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,949
that. And then you're looking for five
and sixes. Remember five and sixes. If

258
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:16,959
and sixes. Remember five and sixes. If
 

259
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,430
and sixes. Remember five and sixes. If
they completely collapse it and 300s and

260
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
they completely collapse it and 300s and
 

261
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,670
they completely collapse it and 300s and
we see how they act at 300s, I will buy

262
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
we see how they act at 300s, I will buy
 

263
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,150
we see how they act at 300s, I will buy
the 300s. If we don't clear out and we

264
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
the 300s. If we don't clear out and we
 

265
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,470
the 300s. If we don't clear out and we
just drop down and we trap bears down

266
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:26,480
just drop down and we trap bears down
 

267
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,870
just drop down and we trap bears down
here, I'm happy to buy the 300s for this

268
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
here, I'm happy to buy the 300s for this
 

269
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,829
here, I'm happy to buy the 300s for this
rotation back to fours. Um, but we will

270
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
rotation back to fours. Um, but we will
 

271
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,829
rotation back to fours. Um, but we will
see. We will just have to see how we go.

272
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
see. We will just have to see how we go.
 

273
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,269
see. We will just have to see how we go.
I'm not convinced that that's what

274
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
I'm not convinced that that's what
 

275
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,350
I'm not convinced that that's what
they're going to do, but let's just go

276
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
they're going to do, but let's just go
 

277
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,870
they're going to do, but let's just go
step by step. Yes, we're going to go

278
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
step by step. Yes, we're going to go
 

279
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,750
step by step. Yes, we're going to go
through everything now.

280
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760

 

281
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,670

Okay, same push on ES. Hasn't quite

282
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:45,680
Okay, same push on ES. Hasn't quite
 

283
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,590
Okay, same push on ES. Hasn't quite
cleared out previous day high. Very,

284
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600
cleared out previous day high. Very,
 

285
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,509
cleared out previous day high. Very,
very close. Same kind of thing. Okay,

286
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
very close. Same kind of thing. Okay,
 

287
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,750
very close. Same kind of thing. Okay,
you'll see this controlled selling.

288
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
you'll see this controlled selling.
 

289
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,790
you'll see this controlled selling.
Controlled selling. There's your trap.

290
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
Controlled selling. There's your trap.
 

291
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,710
Controlled selling. There's your trap.
There's the dip and the rip. All right,

292
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
There's the dip and the rip. All right,
 

293
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,790
There's the dip and the rip. All right,
you will see this time and time again

294
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:58,800
you will see this time and time again
 

295
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,750
you will see this time and time again
when we don't run any stops. It is being

296
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
when we don't run any stops. It is being
 

297
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,470
when we don't run any stops. It is being
manufactured in controlled selling, run

298
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
manufactured in controlled selling, run
 

299
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,430
manufactured in controlled selling, run
the stops, run down. Controlled selling,

300
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,440
the stops, run down. Controlled selling,
 

301
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,949
the stops, run down. Controlled selling,
run the stops, right? when they don't

302
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
run the stops, right? when they don't
 

303
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,110
run the stops, right? when they don't
get run out that is very controlled.

304
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
get run out that is very controlled.
 

305
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,670
get run out that is very controlled.
It's uh done very purposefully let's

306
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
It's uh done very purposefully let's
 

307
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,910
It's uh done very purposefully let's
just call it that way. So ES same kind

308
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:15,920
just call it that way. So ES same kind
 

309
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,910
just call it that way. So ES same kind
of idea and then you're looking for

310
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
of idea and then you're looking for
 

311
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,629
of idea and then you're looking for
726es if it goes going I assume is that

312
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
726es if it goes going I assume is that
 

313
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,430
726es if it goes going I assume is that
alltime high or is that a high close

314
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,440
alltime high or is that a high close
 

315
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,750
alltime high or is that a high close
just have a little look on this not an

316
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
just have a little look on this not an
 

317
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,790
just have a little look on this not an
alltime high.

318
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:28,800
alltime high.
 

319
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,750
alltime high.
Okay.

320
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
Okay.
 

321
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,069
Okay.
So everything above this right now above

322
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:34,079
So everything above this right now above
 

323
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,030
So everything above this right now above
7,000 keeps getting sold. uh edge of

324
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
7,000 keeps getting sold. uh edge of
 

325
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,710
7,000 keeps getting sold. uh edge of
here 716. So be watching 716 and then

326
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
here 716. So be watching 716 and then
 

327
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,750
here 716. So be watching 716 and then
yeah 728s and then 743s

328
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760

 

329
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,750

spiders.

330
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760

 

331
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,310

Same story as your NFP.

332
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
Same story as your NFP.
 

333
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,470
Same story as your NFP.
All right, closed the gap taken out the

334
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
All right, closed the gap taken out the
 

335
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,069
All right, closed the gap taken out the
highs. You can see this level up here

336
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
highs. You can see this level up here
 

337
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,829
highs. You can see this level up here
that I've been watching. That is your

338
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
that I've been watching. That is your
 

339
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,509
that I've been watching. That is your
high. That is your pivot high on the

340
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
high. That is your pivot high on the
 

341
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,990
high. That is your pivot high on the
spiders that they're trying to pin

342
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
spiders that they're trying to pin
 

343
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,829
spiders that they're trying to pin
through. pull that down. It's a little

344
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:03,839
through. pull that down. It's a little
 

345
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,829
through. pull that down. It's a little
bit out.

346
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
bit out.
 

347
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,670
bit out.
Here we go. There's your pin high, your

348
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
Here we go. There's your pin high, your
 

349
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,030
Here we go. There's your pin high, your
alltime high. That's what they're trying

350
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,040
alltime high. That's what they're trying
 

351
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,069
alltime high. That's what they're trying
to get through right now. So 97.84

352
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
to get through right now. So 97.84
 

353
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,750
to get through right now. So 97.84
or somewhere around that. All right.

354
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,760
or somewhere around that. All right.
 

355
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,710
or somewhere around that. All right.
They're trying to come and clear out

356
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
They're trying to come and clear out
 

357
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,150
They're trying to come and clear out
this liquidity. Same kind of story as

358
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160
this liquidity. Same kind of story as
 

359
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,150
this liquidity. Same kind of story as
the 7,000s. Everything above there keeps

360
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
the 7,000s. Everything above there keeps
 

361
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,710
the 7,000s. Everything above there keeps
failing. It's getting dangerous though,

362
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
failing. It's getting dangerous though,
 

363
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,069
failing. It's getting dangerous though,
I will tell you. They've had a lot of

364
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
I will tell you. They've had a lot of
 

365
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,150
I will tell you. They've had a lot of
attempts I would say above here. They

366
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,160
attempts I would say above here. They
 

367
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,550
attempts I would say above here. They
need to hold above here to do that move.

368
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
need to hold above here to do that move.
 

369
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,470
need to hold above here to do that move.
And I'll be looking be very careful

370
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:28,480
And I'll be looking be very careful
 

371
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,990
And I'll be looking be very careful
about a clear out once they do it. But

372
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
about a clear out once they do it. But
 

373
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,710
about a clear out once they do it. But
we'll see. again broader market rotation

374
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
we'll see. again broader market rotation
 

375
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,350
we'll see. again broader market rotation
into broader market uh QQQ you'll see

376
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360
into broader market uh QQQ you'll see
 

377
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,190
into broader market uh QQQ you'll see
the relative weakness versus spy on the

378
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
the relative weakness versus spy on the
 

379
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,430
the relative weakness versus spy on the
daily right way off way off these levels

380
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
daily right way off way off these levels
 

381
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,670
daily right way off way off these levels
up here that we're watching and we have

382
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
up here that we're watching and we have
 

383
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,230
up here that we're watching and we have
build this gap technically so really

384
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
build this gap technically so really
 

385
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,590
build this gap technically so really
we're watching to see if we find

386
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
we're watching to see if we find
 

387
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,389
we're watching to see if we find
acceptance through the 16s right now

388
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:52,399
acceptance through the 16s right now
 

389
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,829
acceptance through the 16s right now
yeah we have to see if we can find

390
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
yeah we have to see if we can find
 

391
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,310
yeah we have to see if we can find
acceptance through 16s and 17s for that

392
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
acceptance through 16s and 17s for that
 

393
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,910
acceptance through 16s and 17s for that
gap and base over it same kind of story

394
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
gap and base over it same kind of story
 

395
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,750
gap and base over it same kind of story
as we've just gone through on ENQ,

396
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:01,760
as we've just gone through on ENQ,
 

397
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,670
as we've just gone through on ENQ,
right? I'm thinking about the trap play.

398
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
right? I'm thinking about the trap play.
 

399
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,350
right? I'm thinking about the trap play.
That's what I'm really thinking about

400
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
That's what I'm really thinking about
 

401
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,829
That's what I'm really thinking about
today. I want to see maybe I get it

402
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
today. I want to see maybe I get it
 

403
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:08,949
today. I want to see maybe I get it
wrong and I don't get a play for the

404
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:08,959
wrong and I don't get a play for the
 

405
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,470
wrong and I don't get a play for the
day. That's also okay. Okay, Dixie

406
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,480
day. That's also okay. Okay, Dixie
 

407
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,829
day. That's also okay. Okay, Dixie
starting to find a bid. You can see

408
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839
starting to find a bid. You can see
 

409
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,230
starting to find a bid. You can see
there you go off Dixie

410
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
there you go off Dixie
 

411
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,670
there you go off Dixie
bid, but already fading back inside.

412
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
bid, but already fading back inside.
 

413
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,990
bid, but already fading back inside.
Uh so did gold sell? Gold did sell and

414
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,000
Uh so did gold sell? Gold did sell and
 

415
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,629
Uh so did gold sell? Gold did sell and
then rebid off close. Okay, VIX still

416
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
then rebid off close. Okay, VIX still
 

417
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,710
then rebid off close. Okay, VIX still
trading downside off that. Okay, so big

418
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,720
trading downside off that. Okay, so big
 

419
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,910
trading downside off that. Okay, so big
buy side pressure coming in. Zoom VIX

420
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:27,920
buy side pressure coming in. Zoom VIX
 

421
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,990
buy side pressure coming in. Zoom VIX
out. Undercutting this here. I'll be

422
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
out. Undercutting this here. I'll be
 

423
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,590
out. Undercutting this here. I'll be
watching this block into here.

424
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
watching this block into here.
 

425
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,310
watching this block into here.
I'll pivot here now. I'll be watching

426
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
I'll pivot here now. I'll be watching
 

427
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,990
I'll pivot here now. I'll be watching
Vicks into there to see if it finds a

428
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
Vicks into there to see if it finds a
 

429
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,389
Vicks into there to see if it finds a
bid into there or not. So, if we do the

430
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
bid into there or not. So, if we do the
 

431
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,189
bid into there or not. So, if we do the
trap, right, if we do the trap and VIX

432
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
trap, right, if we do the trap and VIX
 

433
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,910
trap, right, if we do the trap and VIX
fades down into this and finds a bid,

434
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
fades down into this and finds a bid,
 

435
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,430
fades down into this and finds a bid,
that's going to help my thesis. So, if

436
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:47,440
that's going to help my thesis. So, if
 

437
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,430
that's going to help my thesis. So, if
I'm looking for the trap long on uh trap

438
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:49,440
I'm looking for the trap long on uh trap
 

439
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,150
I'm looking for the trap long on uh trap
to reshort ENQ, if we come into this and

440
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160
to reshort ENQ, if we come into this and
 

441
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,990
to reshort ENQ, if we come into this and
find a bid on VIX and start doing this

442
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,000
find a bid on VIX and start doing this
 

443
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,230
find a bid on VIX and start doing this
and that times out with the ENQ in the

444
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
and that times out with the ENQ in the
 

445
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,150
and that times out with the ENQ in the
market, fantastic.

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,829
All right. Uh same kind of story. Big
wash. Probably retraced 50% of that

462
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839
wash. Probably retraced 50% of that
 

463
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,910
wash. Probably retraced 50% of that
wash. All right. If you did that, that's

464
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
wash. All right. If you did that, that's
 

465
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,350
wash. All right. If you did that, that's
50% basing out in a box. Nothing to

466
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,360
50% basing out in a box. Nothing to
 

467
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,949
50% basing out in a box. Nothing to
really do with it. All right. Nothing to

468
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
really do with it. All right. Nothing to
 

469
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,750
really do with it. All right. Nothing to
really do with it. Goo.

470
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:29,760

 

471
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,430

No undercut there. Wash held these lows.

472
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
No undercut there. Wash held these lows.
 

473
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,230
No undercut there. Wash held these lows.
Hasn't come down into it. Bit of a

474
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
Hasn't come down into it. Bit of a
 

475
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,910
Hasn't come down into it. Bit of a
basketball here and it's not breaking

476
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
basketball here and it's not breaking
 

477
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,710
basketball here and it's not breaking
lower. So maybe Goo can look for relief

478
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
lower. So maybe Goo can look for relief
 

479
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,350
lower. So maybe Goo can look for relief
up here sooner rather than later. But

480
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,360
up here sooner rather than later. But
 

481
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,590
up here sooner rather than later. But
again, not something I'd want to trade.

482
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,600
again, not something I'd want to trade.
 

483
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,069
again, not something I'd want to trade.
Nothing there. Looking great. Uh Meta is

484
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
Nothing there. Looking great. Uh Meta is
 

485
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,470
Nothing there. Looking great. Uh Meta is
a bit more interesting. That's perked up

486
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,480
a bit more interesting. That's perked up
 

487
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,749
a bit more interesting. That's perked up
a little bit. So you can see the failure

488
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
a little bit. So you can see the failure
 

489
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,509
a little bit. So you can see the failure
to break down and make a new low.

490
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
to break down and make a new low.
 

491
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,670
to break down and make a new low.
There's the rip up. Okay. And coming

492
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
There's the rip up. Okay. And coming
 

493
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,069
There's the rip up. Okay. And coming
back into these boxes here where they're

494
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:00,079
back into these boxes here where they're
 

495
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,910
back into these boxes here where they're
rebidding at. So, this thing wants to

496
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
rebidding at. So, this thing wants to
 

497
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,389
rebidding at. So, this thing wants to
try and get going. So, we look good. I'm

498
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399
try and get going. So, we look good. I'm
 

499
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,710
try and get going. So, we look good. I'm
still long meta. I want to see a rebre

500
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
still long meta. I want to see a rebre
 

501
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,790
still long meta. I want to see a rebre
out of 83s and see if we can get back up

502
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
out of 83s and see if we can get back up
 

503
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,230
out of 83s and see if we can get back up
here. It would be great to get all the

504
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,240
here. It would be great to get all the
 

505
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,389
here. It would be great to get all the
way back up there.

506
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:12,399
way back up there.
 

507
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,990
way back up there.
Uh D

508
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,000
Uh D
 

509
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,310
Uh D
Microsoft.

Microsoft.
 

511
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,110
Microsoft.
That looks that looks good. That's a

512
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
That looks that looks good. That's a
 

513
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,790
That looks that looks good. That's a
better look. All right. Better look.

514
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
better look. All right. Better look.

521
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,790
retest, caught a bid, come back down to
the same level. This is the pin, right?

522
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
the same level. This is the pin, right?
 

523
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,550
the same level. This is the pin, right?
They got to hold sort of tens. They hold

524
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
They got to hold sort of tens. They hold
 

525
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,990
They got to hold sort of tens. They hold
tens, they've got a shot. Microsoft

526
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,000
tens, they've got a shot. Microsoft
 

527
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,069
tens, they've got a shot. Microsoft
looking a bit better there. Uh let's

528
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
looking a bit better there. Uh let's
 

529
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,470
looking a bit better there. Uh let's
have a look at Nvidia. That thing much

530
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
have a look at Nvidia. That thing much
 

531
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,470
have a look at Nvidia. That thing much
better now than last week. All right, so

532
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
better now than last week. All right, so
 

533
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,910
better now than last week. All right, so
we can talk again about the same thing

534
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:43,920
we can talk again about the same thing
 

535
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,189
we can talk again about the same thing
even on the higher time frame.

536
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:45,199
even on the higher time frame.
 

537
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,269
even on the higher time frame.
Controlled selling down pivot fails to

538
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
Controlled selling down pivot fails to
 

539
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,790
Controlled selling down pivot fails to
make a new low. There's your long

540
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:50,800
make a new low. There's your long
 

541
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,110
make a new low. There's your long
trigger. Look at the EMA supporting it.

542
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,120
trigger. Look at the EMA supporting it.
 

543
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,509
trigger. Look at the EMA supporting it.
And we're upside now into like sort of

544
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:55,519
And we're upside now into like sort of
 

545
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,030
And we're upside now into like sort of
an inverse head and shoulder kind of

546
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,040
an inverse head and shoulder kind of
 

547
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,150
an inverse head and shoulder kind of
thing. And this thing can really hurt

548
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,160
thing. And this thing can really hurt
 

549
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,150
thing. And this thing can really hurt
some people soon. There will be stops

550
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
some people soon. There will be stops
 

551
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,069
some people soon. There will be stops
here. We can set price alerts up there

552
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,079
here. We can set price alerts up there
 

553
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,789
here. We can set price alerts up there
right now. Is that the high

554
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
right now. Is that the high
 

555
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,750
right now. Is that the high
of this? It is. Okay. So, we'll be

556
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:09,760
of this? It is. Okay. So, we'll be
 

557
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,870
of this? It is. Okay. So, we'll be
watching for breaks and fail breaks

558
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:12,880
watching for breaks and fail breaks
 

559
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,549
watching for breaks and fail breaks
above

560
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:14,559
above
 

561
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,029
above

9450s.
Stick that in there so I know it's

564
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:18,799
Stick that in there so I know it's
 

565
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,710
Stick that in there so I know it's
there.

566
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720

 

567
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,630

Which will mark out well with the cues

568
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:24,640
Which will mark out well with the cues
 

569
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,069
Which will mark out well with the cues
if they do the fail break. If they're

570
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,079
if they do the fail break. If they're
 

571
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,510
if they do the fail break. If they're
just going to break out upside, I'll

572
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,520
just going to break out upside, I'll
 

573
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,870
just going to break out upside, I'll
have to find a way of joining. We'll

574
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:28,880
have to find a way of joining. We'll
 

575
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,350
have to find a way of joining. We'll
see. Tesla, same kind of stories.

576
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,360
see. Tesla, same kind of stories.
 

577
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,510
see. Tesla, same kind of stories.
Nvidia. All right. Same kind of story.

578
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:33,520
Nvidia. All right. Same kind of story.
 

579
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,870
Nvidia. All right. Same kind of story.
You can see this coming right back to

580
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:34,880
You can see this coming right back to
 

581
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,870
You can see this coming right back to
the upside. You'd be watching Tesla for

582
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
the upside. You'd be watching Tesla for
 

583
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,950
the upside. You'd be watching Tesla for
a break and hold over 30 and then you'd

584
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:38,960
a break and hold over 30 and then you'd
 

585
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,350
a break and hold over 30 and then you'd
be looking to take partial out into 40,

586
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360
be looking to take partial out into 40,
 

587
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,909
be looking to take partial out into 40,
44, and then 50 if it can get going.

588
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919
44, and then 50 if it can get going.
 

589
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,150
44, and then 50 if it can get going.
might be due a little bit of a washdown.

590
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,160
might be due a little bit of a washdown.
 

591
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,070
might be due a little bit of a washdown.
You know, it wouldn't be surprised if

592
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
You know, it wouldn't be surprised if
 

593
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,750
You know, it wouldn't be surprised if
they want to do one of these before they

594
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
they want to do one of these before they
 

595
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,590
they want to do one of these before they
get going. Wouldn't be surprised at all.

596
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
get going. Wouldn't be surprised at all.
 

597
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,830
get going. Wouldn't be surprised at all.
Equally weighted.

598

Wakey wakey. There we go. That's your
mag for the day. So, gapping up. Equally

603
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,669
mag for the day. So, gapping up. Equally
weighted. Is in a gap up. So, we do have

604
00:17:59,669 --> 00:17:59,679
weighted. Is in a gap up. So, we do have
 

605
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,470
weighted. Is in a gap up. So, we do have
strength so far. Uh Hood got sold off in

606
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:02,480
strength so far. Uh Hood got sold off in
 

607
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,590
strength so far. Uh Hood got sold off in
earnings like we talked about. It's why

608
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600
earnings like we talked about. It's why
 

609
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,750
earnings like we talked about. It's why
we took some profits up here. I will be

610
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
we took some profits up here. I will be
 

611
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,350
we took some profits up here. I will be
looking to see if they hold this dip

612
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,360
looking to see if they hold this dip
 

613
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,270
looking to see if they hold this dip
though. All right. They did have a miss,

614
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
though. All right. They did have a miss,
 

615
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,029
though. All right. They did have a miss,
but actually the amount of cash on hand

616
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,039
but actually the amount of cash on hand
 

617
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,510
but actually the amount of cash on hand
is pretty good. We just see if they want

618
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:13,520
is pretty good. We just see if they want
 

619
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,270
is pretty good. We just see if they want
to rebid this up over the next few days.

620
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,280
to rebid this up over the next few days.
 

621
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,789
to rebid this up over the next few days.
If this is a giant trap, but we will

622
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:16,799
If this is a giant trap, but we will
 

623
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,950
If this is a giant trap, but we will
see. We've paid oursel either way. Uh

624
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:18,960
see. We've paid oursel either way. Uh
 

625
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,430
see. We've paid oursel either way. Uh
Netflix as well. Big push yesterday

626
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
Netflix as well. Big push yesterday
 

627
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,029
Netflix as well. Big push yesterday
coming back into range. Needs to hold

628
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
coming back into range. Needs to hold
 

629
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,230
coming back into range. Needs to hold
this then I feel positive about it. And

630
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,240
this then I feel positive about it. And
 

631
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,590
this then I feel positive about it. And
that's the story of the tape guys.

632
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600
that's the story of the tape guys.
 

633
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,190
that's the story of the tape guys.
That's what we're looking at. So main

634
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,200
That's what we're looking at. So main
 

635
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,190
That's what we're looking at. So main
thing I'll be looking at today ideally

636
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
thing I'll be looking at today ideally
 

637
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,350
thing I'll be looking at today ideally
is a big old bull trap like I've talked

638
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:33,360
is a big old bull trap like I've talked
 

639
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,909
is a big old bull trap like I've talked
about would be my preference.

640
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:39,919

 

641
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,630

If not, if they're going to dip before

642
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:42,640
If not, if they're going to dip before
 

643
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,710
If not, if they're going to dip before
taking out all the highs, I will

644
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
taking out all the highs, I will
 

645
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,430
taking out all the highs, I will
consider joining long. It is not ideal.

646
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:49,440
consider joining long. It is not ideal.
 

647
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,270
consider joining long. It is not ideal.
It is not ideal. Oracle. Yeah, Oracle

highs. ES now trading 707s.
 

657
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,630
highs. ES now trading 707s.
707s, I should say. Um,

658
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:10,640
707s, I should say. Um,
 

659
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,470
707s, I should say. Um,
yeah, Oracle looks good. Nice push up.

660
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:12,480
yeah, Oracle looks good. Nice push up.
 

661
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,909

Just needs to hold. We want it to base

662
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:13,919
Just needs to hold. We want it to base
 

663
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,909
Just needs to hold. We want it to base
out at sort of 60. Just needs to base

664
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:15,919
out at sort of 60. Just needs to base
 

665
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,510
out at sort of 60. Just needs to base
out at 60. We don't want it to give back

666
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
out at 60. We don't want it to give back
 

667
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,950
out at 60. We don't want it to give back
that big squeeze move all the way back

668
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960
that big squeeze move all the way back
 

669
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,710
that big squeeze move all the way back
to 50.

670
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,720

 

671
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,510

Uh, where's my QQQ?

672
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,520
Uh, where's my QQQ?
 

673
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,789
Uh, where's my QQQ?
Sorry, guys. Just get my charts ready.

674
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:30,799

 

675
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,870

All right, let's see how we go then,

676
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
All right, let's see how we go then,
 

677
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,669
All right, let's see how we go then,
folks. Good luck, everyone. Um, I will

678
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:35,679
folks. Good luck, everyone. Um, I will
 

679
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,549
folks. Good luck, everyone. Um, I will
be patiently waiting. So ideally, we

680
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
be patiently waiting. So ideally, we
 

681
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,990
be patiently waiting. So ideally, we
come and clear out some of these levels

682
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,000
come and clear out some of these levels
 

683
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,669
come and clear out some of these levels
and I get a short up here somewhere.

684
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
and I get a short up here somewhere.
 

685
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,110
and I get a short up here somewhere.
Otherwise, if they don't take it and

686
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,120
Otherwise, if they don't take it and
 

687
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,630
Otherwise, if they don't take it and
they just drop down, I'll think about a

688
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640
they just drop down, I'll think about a
 

689
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,990
they just drop down, I'll think about a
rebid down here into 300s, maybe here,

690
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000
rebid down here into 300s, maybe here,
 

691
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,830
rebid down here into 300s, maybe here,
but I don't really like that bid there.

692
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
but I don't really like that bid there.
 

693
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,070
but I don't really like that bid there.
I would rather ignore previous day value

694
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
I would rather ignore previous day value
 

695
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,270
I would rather ignore previous day value
high today. But we will see.

696
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,280
high today. But we will see.
 

697
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,830
high today. But we will see.
We are trading right at the high of uh

698
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
We are trading right at the high of uh
 

699
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,909
We are trading right at the high of uh
the current week.

700
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:03,919

 

701
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,909

All right, here we go, folks. Let's get

702
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:05,919
All right, here we go, folks. Let's get
 

703
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,590
All right, here we go, folks. Let's get
some volume on it nice and early before

704
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:07,600
some volume on it nice and early before
 

705
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,390
some volume on it nice and early before
Alex forgets. Mentally fatigued right

706
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,400
Alex forgets. Mentally fatigued right
 

707
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,510
Alex forgets. Mentally fatigued right
now.

708
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:15,520

 

709
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,110

All right, previous day value area high

710
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120
All right, previous day value area high
 

711
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,870
All right, previous day value area high
coming up here. There's the wash through

712
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:18,880
coming up here. There's the wash through
 

713
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,150
coming up here. There's the wash through
it. And we next be watching 63s if

714
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:22,160
it. And we next be watching 63s if
 

715
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,750
it. And we next be watching 63s if
they're going to come all the way down

716
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:23,760
they're going to come all the way down
 

717
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,430
they're going to come all the way down
to previous day point control. Why is

718
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
to previous day point control. Why is
 

719
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,110
to previous day point control. Why is
that not matching up

720
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,120
that not matching up
 

721
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,669
that not matching up
360?

722
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
360?
 

723
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,230
360?
That's way off, isn't it? Wow.

724
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,240

 

725
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,750

Measure this out real quick.

726
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:39,760
Measure this out real quick.
 

727
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:46,470
Measure this out real quick.
We can do big discrepancy again.

728
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480

 

729
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,710

Well, maybe it's Ninja Trader off.

730
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
Well, maybe it's Ninja Trader off.
 

731
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,789
Well, maybe it's Ninja Trader off.
Right, there's the dip and rip. So,

732
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:50,799
Right, there's the dip and rip. So,
 

733
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,310
Right, there's the dip and rip. So,
let's see if they can clear out some of

734
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,320
let's see if they can clear out some of
 

735
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,789
let's see if they can clear out some of
these highs

736
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:56,799

 

737
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,230

into this gray box. Remember, there are

into this gray box. Remember, there are
stops at that gray box, the top side of

next lot at the top of the gray box.
 

747
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,470
next lot at the top of the gray box.
That's what I'd like to see cleared out.

748
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,480
That's what I'd like to see cleared out.
 

749
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,390
That's what I'd like to see cleared out.
I'd love it if they clear all this out

750
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400
I'd love it if they clear all this out
 

751
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,750
I'd love it if they clear all this out
even if they want to shove all the way

752
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:09,760
even if they want to shove all the way

00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:52,799
1930 1940.
 

773
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,630
1930 1940.
All right. Come on market. So, we're not

774
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:54,640
All right. Come on market. So, we're not
 

775
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,830
All right. Come on market. So, we're not
too far from the 20-day on ENQ as well.

776
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:57,840
too far from the 20-day on ENQ as well.
 

777
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,070
too far from the 20-day on ENQ as well.
Somewhere around 550, 560. Let me just

778
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,080
Somewhere around 550, 560. Let me just
 

779
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:07,029
Somewhere around 550, 560. Let me just
check that on that shell. 550 20-day.

780
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039

 

781
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,310

Okay. Sellers keep getting caught at

782
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,320
Okay. Sellers keep getting caught at
 

783
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,590
Okay. Sellers keep getting caught at
these lows. So, so far into 35 was very

784
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:11,600
these lows. So, so far into 35 was very
 

785
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:19,350
these lows. So, so far into 35 was very
early and it's very jumpy and it's NFB.

786
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,360

 

787
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,870

Back to these 30s where these sellers

788
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:20,880
Back to these 30s where these sellers
 

789
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,750
Back to these 30s where these sellers
keep getting caught.

790
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
keep getting caught.
 

791
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,990
keep getting caught.
Yet again, they got caught there.

792
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,000
Yet again, they got caught there.
 

793
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,549
Yet again, they got caught there.
They're looking for a resqueeze here.

794
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:28,559
They're looking for a resqueeze here.
 

795
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,149
They're looking for a resqueeze here.
I'm not long in any of this. I'm just

796
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:30,159
I'm not long in any of this. I'm just
 

797
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,350
I'm not long in any of this. I'm just
telling you what I'm seeing on the tape.

798
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:31,360
telling you what I'm seeing on the tape.
 

799
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,630
telling you what I'm seeing on the tape.
I'm not longing any of this. But you can

800
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:32,640
I'm not longing any of this. But you can
 

801
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,710
I'm not longing any of this. But you can
see right here, these sellers down here,

802
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:34,720
see right here, these sellers down here,
 

803
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,430
see right here, these sellers down here,
I'm at 40 and under, especially down 34

804
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
I'm at 40 and under, especially down 34
 

805
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,110
I'm at 40 and under, especially down 34
so far. Cannot get a follow through

806
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,120
so far. Cannot get a follow through
 

807
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,549
so far. Cannot get a follow through
downside. All right, so they keep piling

808
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:40,559
downside. All right, so they keep piling
 

809
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,990
downside. All right, so they keep piling
in there. They're not getting their way.

810
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,000
in there. They're not getting their way.
 

811
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,310
in there. They're not getting their way.
They're getting tested again now. Same

812
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,320
They're getting tested again now. Same
 

813
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,830
They're getting tested again now. Same
level. Do they get follow through here

814
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840
level. Do they get follow through here
 

815
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,230
level. Do they get follow through here
is the question.

816
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,240
is the question.
 

817
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,590
is the question.
Maybe the first time they see follow

818
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:49,600
Maybe the first time they see follow
 

819
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,470
Maybe the first time they see follow
through today. to that New York open

820
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
through today. to that New York open
 

821
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,390
through today. to that New York open
and previous day value area high which

822
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
and previous day value area high which
 

823
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,070
and previous day value area high which
is also different on here to Ninja

824
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,080
is also different on here to Ninja
 

825
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,909
is also different on here to Ninja
Trader. It's not very useful. I got 410

826
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:01,919
Trader. It's not very useful. I got 410
 

827
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,470
Trader. It's not very useful. I got 410
on Ninja Trader as value high right into

828
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,480
on Ninja Trader as value high right into
 

829
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,950
on Ninja Trader as value high right into
here. So they dip that again. Have to

830
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:06,960
here. So they dip that again. Have to
 

831
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,430
here. So they dip that again. Have to
watch these 30s and 40s now. Right.

832
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,440
watch these 30s and 40s now. Right.
 

833
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,789
watch these 30s and 40s now. Right.
That's where the sellers came in. If we

834
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:10,799
That's where the sellers came in. If we
 

835
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,789
That's where the sellers came in. If we
reclaim 30s and 40s, this thing should

836
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
reclaim 30s and 40s, this thing should
 

837
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,590
reclaim 30s and 40s, this thing should
technically squeeze.

838
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:15,600
technically squeeze.
 

839
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,750
technically squeeze.
We will we will wait. I'm not buying up

840
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:17,760
We will we will wait. I'm not buying up
 

841
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,110
We will we will wait. I'm not buying up
here. There's just no way. I'd much

842
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,120
here. There's just no way. I'd much
 

843
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,310
here. There's just no way. I'd much
rather they come and clear out this

844
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:20,320
rather they come and clear out this
 

845
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:33,350
rather they come and clear out this
level and offer me to short.

846
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,360

 

847
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,710

What's the gray zone? 480 to 515. Uh it

848
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:36,720
What's the gray zone? 480 to 515. Uh it
 

849
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,230
What's the gray zone? 480 to 515. Uh it
is there's a node and a pivot. If you go

850
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:40,240
is there's a node and a pivot. If you go
 

851
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,909
is there's a node and a pivot. If you go
back to the 4th of Feb,

852
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:43,919
back to the 4th of Feb,
 

853
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,909
back to the 4th of Feb,
4th of Feb in here, if you go on an

854
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:45,919
4th of Feb in here, if you go on an
 

855
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,430
4th of Feb in here, if you go on an
hourly chart, look at the 4th of Feb,

856
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:47,440
hourly chart, look at the 4th of Feb,
 

857
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,950
hourly chart, look at the 4th of Feb,
you'll see it.

858
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:52,960

 

859
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,630

Okay, these sellers starting to win now.

860
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
Okay, these sellers starting to win now.
 

861
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,870
Okay, these sellers starting to win now.
So maybe previous day point control is

862
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:56,880
So maybe previous day point control is
 

863
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,149
So maybe previous day point control is
going to get tagged here if they get

864
00:23:58,149 --> 00:23:58,159
going to get tagged here if they get
 

865
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,470
going to get tagged here if they get
follow through. That is going to be

866
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:00,480
follow through. That is going to be
 

867
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,909
follow through. That is going to be
really shite if they're just going to

868
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919
really shite if they're just going to
 

869
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,350
really shite if they're just going to
clear out this high and leave all of

870
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,360
clear out this high and leave all of
 

871
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,390
clear out this high and leave all of
these. It's very dangerous to play

872
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:08,400
these. It's very dangerous to play
 

873
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,310
these. It's very dangerous to play
much rather they go higher first. It's

874
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
much rather they go higher first. It's
 

875
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,070
much rather they go higher first. It's
going to make the short much much better

876
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,080
going to make the short much much better
 

877
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,070
going to make the short much much better
if they can go higher first, but we need

878
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,080
if they can go higher first, but we need
 

879
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:29,909
if they can go higher first, but we need
to be aware of it.

880
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:29,919

 

881
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,029

11th

882
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:33,039

 

883
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:45,510

one when they talking 10. Okay.

884
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,520

 

885
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,950

Watching this down here. If they rebid

886
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:46,960
Watching this down here. If they rebid
 

887
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,549
Watching this down here. If they rebid
it into 300s,

888
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:52,559

 

889
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,070

man, if they just do that tiny clear

890
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
man, if they just do that tiny clear
 

891
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,990
man, if they just do that tiny clear
out, that is so lame.

892
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,000
out, that is so lame.
 

893
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,789
out, that is so lame.
Watching this level down here into 300s.

894
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:06,799

 

895
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,190

So, into current week, this red level is

896
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,200
So, into current week, this red level is
 

897
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,110
So, into current week, this red level is
current week

898
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,120
current week
 

899
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,870
current week
point of control. The developing weak

900
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:12,880
point of control. The developing weak
 

901
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,149
point of control. The developing weak
point of control is what they're bidding

902
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:14,159
point of control is what they're bidding
 

903
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,750
point of control is what they're bidding
on at the moment down here at sort of

904
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:15,760
on at the moment down here at sort of
 

905
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,110
on at the moment down here at sort of
70s and 60s. If we lose that, it's

906
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,120
70s and 60s. If we lose that, it's
 

907
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,630
70s and 60s. If we lose that, it's
possible we go all the way down to 300.

908
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:20,640
possible we go all the way down to 300.
 

909
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,310
possible we go all the way down to 300.
This short would be paying now. That's

910
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,320
This short would be paying now. That's
 

911
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,750
This short would be paying now. That's
just didn't go high enough for me to

912
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:23,760
just didn't go high enough for me to
 

913
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,310
just didn't go high enough for me to
want it. Do not like that we didn't

914
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,320
want it. Do not like that we didn't
 

915
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,350
want it. Do not like that we didn't
clear out that gray box above. Naughty,

916
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,360
clear out that gray box above. Naughty,
 

917
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,350
clear out that gray box above. Naughty,
naughty, naughty, naughty.

918
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360

 

919
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,430

So, previous day value area low

920
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:35,440
So, previous day value area low
 

921
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,590
So, previous day value area low
possible. This is current uh weak point

922
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:37,600
possible. This is current uh weak point
 

923
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,029
possible. This is current uh weak point
of control. It's possible that they wash

924
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:39,039
of control. It's possible that they wash
 

925
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,870
of control. It's possible that they wash
down into here. But there is lots of

926
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:40,880
down into here. But there is lots of
 

927
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,029
down into here. But there is lots of

See, see, can we get down into here?
 

1081
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,909
See, see, can we get down into here?
It's too late for me to short now. Maybe

1082
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:15,919
It's too late for me to short now. Maybe
 

1083
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,190
It's too late for me to short now. Maybe
I could have taken that, but I'm just

1084
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,200
I could have taken that, but I'm just
 

1085
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,470
I could have taken that, but I'm just
going to wait to see if we can get into

1086
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
going to wait to see if we can get into
 

1087
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,789
going to wait to see if we can get into
here and how we operate when we get down

1088
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:20,799
here and how we operate when we get down
 

1089
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,789
here and how we operate when we get down
there.

1090
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:22,799
there.
 

1091
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:32,789

1093
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,389

looking for that breakdown. There is

1094
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:34,399
looking for that breakdown. There is
 

1095
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,110
looking for that breakdown. There is
liquidity lower into 25s and then 300.

1096
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,120
liquidity lower into 25s and then 300.
 

1097

liquidity lower into 25s and then 300.
So shorts sellers are trying to sell

1098
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:39,039
So shorts sellers are trying to sell
 

1099
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,750
So shorts sellers are trying to sell
this down to get that move. Got 24hour

VWAP there. We can time it with ES as

1102
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:43,760
VWAP there. We can time it with ES as
 

1103
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,909
VWAP there. We can time it with ES as
well into Globe X and VWOP which is

00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:45,919
well into Globe X and VWOP which is
 

1105

So, we'll see. Do they come into those

1110
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:54,799
So, we'll see. Do they come into those
 

1111
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:04,950
So, we'll see. Do they come into those
levels and find a bid?

1112
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:04,960

 

1113
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,950

they're trying to get this squeeze back

1128
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:20,880
they're trying to get this squeeze back
 

1129
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,630
they're trying to get this squeeze back
up to point of control, which is 70s

1130
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:22,640
up to point of control, which is 70s
 

1131
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,470
up to point of control, which is 70s
right now. Here's the tap through 70s.

1132

I'm not going to retake this. I've

1134
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:25,679
I'm not going to retake this. I've
 

1135
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:26,950
I'm not going to retake this. I've
already had one attempt of this. If they

1136
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:26,960
already had one attempt of this. If they
 

1137
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,789
already had one attempt of this. If they
lift this, then you're looking at 400s

1138
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:28,799
lift this, then you're looking at 400s
 

1139
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,430
lift this, then you're looking at 400s
again. I still want to wait now to see

1140
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:31,440
again. I still want to wait now to see
 

1141
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,149
again. I still want to wait now to see
if we can come down to 300s.

1142
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:34,159
if we can come down to 300s.
 

1143
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,470
if we can come down to 300s.
Trying to be patient.

1144
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:36,480
Trying to be patient.
 

1145
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,389
Trying to be patient.
But if we look at the hourly, right,

1146
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:38,399
But if we look at the hourly, right,
 

1147
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,310
But if we look at the hourly, right,
remember this is what I call God chart.

1148
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,320
remember this is what I call God chart.
 

1149

remember this is what I call God chart.
We go back to the hourly. You can see

1150
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,240
We go back to the hourly. You can see
 

1151
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,909
We go back to the hourly. You can see
the developing profile. We're coming

1152
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:43,919
the developing profile. We're coming
 

1153
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,669
the developing profile. We're coming
right into the middle of this current

right into fair value for the week. If

1158

right into fair value for the week. If
 

1159
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,870
right into fair value for the week. If
they lose this, all right, then maybe

1160
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:52,880
they lose this, all right, then maybe
 

1161
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,350
they lose this, all right, then maybe
there is a bid off here from three from

1162
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,360
there is a bid off here from three from
 

1163
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,590
there is a bid off here from three from
300 back to 350. And if they squeeze

300 back to 350. And if they squeeze
 

1165
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,149
300 back to 350. And if they squeeze
back to fours, maybe they just bid off

1166
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:00,159
back to fours, maybe they just bid off
 

1167
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,750
back to fours, maybe they just bid off
here in into uh

1168
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:03,760
here in into uh
 

1169
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,590

1171
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,750
in this uh point of control level 350s.
We'll see.

1172
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:09,760
We'll see.
 

1173
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,510
We'll see.
Much rather they come down into this

1174
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:11,520
Much rather they come down into this
 

1175
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,830
Much rather they come down into this
right now. Much much rather they come

1176
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:13,840
right now. Much much rather they come
 

1177
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,630
right now. Much much rather they come
down lower.

1178
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:16,640
down lower.
 

1179
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,789
down lower.
Am I long? No, nothing. I'm nothing

1180
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:18,799
Am I long? No, nothing. I'm nothing
 

1181
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,870
Am I long? No, nothing. I'm nothing
right now. I'm waiting to see if we come

1182
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:20,880
right now. I'm waiting to see if we come
 

1183
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,470
right now. I'm waiting to see if we come
to three. What I'm waiting for to make

1184
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:22,480
to three. What I'm waiting for to make
 

1185
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,310
to three. What I'm waiting for to make
this clear, I need need to make this

1186
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:24,320
this clear, I need need to make this
 

1187
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,310
this clear, I need need to make this
clear. When we come into this zone here,

1188
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:26,320
clear. When we come into this zone here,
 

1189
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,990
clear. When we come into this zone here,
I'm waiting to see if sellers get

1190
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm waiting to see if sellers get
 

1191
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,830
I'm waiting to see if sellers get
trapped. All right. If sellers get

1192
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:29,840
trapped. All right. If sellers get
 

1193
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,590
trapped. All right. If sellers get
trapped, I will consider a long back up.

1194
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:31,600
trapped, I will consider a long back up.
 

1195
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,029
trapped, I will consider a long back up.
If they don't get trapped, they might

1196
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:33,039
If they don't get trapped, they might
 

1197
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,110
If they don't get trapped, they might
well want to go to gap fill for 220. So,

1198
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,120
well want to go to gap fill for 220. So,
 

1199
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,110
well want to go to gap fill for 220. So,
I'm not just going to bid on this. I

1200
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,120
I'm not just going to bid on this. I
 

1201
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,269
I'm not just going to bid on this. I
need to see someone stuck. Currently,

1202
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:39,279
need to see someone stuck. Currently,
 

1203
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,950
need to see someone stuck. Currently,
they are bidding off the developing weak

1204
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:40,960
they are bidding off the developing weak
 

1205
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,710
they are bidding off the developing weak
point of control. They keep bidding off

1206
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:42,720
point of control. They keep bidding off
 

1207
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,389
point of control. They keep bidding off
it.

1208
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:44,399
it.
 

1209
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,789
it.
O. So, we're going to go and test those

1210
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:46,799
O. So, we're going to go and test those
 

1211
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,830
O. So, we're going to go and test those
trap players at 400 again.

1212
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:51,840

 

1213
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,830

Kind of ugly there on the book up at

1214
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:53,840
Kind of ugly there on the book up at
 

1215
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,070
Kind of ugly there on the book up at
400. We've got a delta both sides. We've

1216
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,080
400. We've got a delta both sides. We've
 

1217
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,149
400. We've got a delta both sides. We've
got 127 lot trapped at 400 as a seller.

1218
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:00,159
got 127 lot trapped at 400 as a seller.
 

1219
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,509
got 127 lot trapped at 400 as a seller.
Just tap back into him again.

1220
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:03,519
Just tap back into him again.
 

1221
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:09,830
Just tap back into him again.
Messy, messy, messy.

1222
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:09,840

 

1223
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,509

When you look at ENQ on Trading View,

1224
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:11,519
When you look at ENQ on Trading View,
 

1225
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,029
When you look at ENQ on Trading View,
your price numbers don't match. So, you

1226
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:13,039
your price numbers don't match. So, you
 

1227
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,470
your price numbers don't match. So, you
probably got delayed data then because

1228
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:14,480
probably got delayed data then because
 

1229
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:23,269
probably got delayed data then because
these are the correct numbers,

1230
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:23,279

 

1231
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,190

right? They're testing these 400s again.

1232
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,200
right? They're testing these 400s again.
 

1233
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,029
right? They're testing these 400s again.
Man, if that's the dip and they don't

1234
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:29,039
Man, if that's the dip and they don't
 

1235
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,950
Man, if that's the dip and they don't
come down here, it's going to be very

1236
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:30,960
come down here, it's going to be very
 

1237
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,470
come down here, it's going to be very
hard to trade. It means we haven't run

1238
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:32,480
hard to trade. It means we haven't run
 

1239
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,070
hard to trade. It means we haven't run
the top side and we haven't come down to

1240
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,080
the top side and we haven't come down to
 

1241
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,509
the top side and we haven't come down to
the bottom side where we need to go. I

1242
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:35,519
the bottom side where we need to go. I
 

1243
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,990
the bottom side where we need to go. I
really need this to come lower. Okay,

1244
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,000
really need this to come lower. Okay,
 

1245
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,990
really need this to come lower. Okay,
they're selling 400. So, that seller up

1246
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,000
they're selling 400. So, that seller up
 

1247
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,870
they're selling 400. So, that seller up
there still present.

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,549
still present in the 400s.
Keep talking about this guy right here.

1252
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:50,559
Keep talking about this guy right here.
 

1253
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,990
Keep talking about this guy right here.
All right, he's still present. He's

1254
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,000
All right, he's still present. He's
 

1255
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,070
All right, he's still present. He's
still absorbing the tape right now.

1256
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,080
still absorbing the tape right now.
 

1257
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,830
still absorbing the tape right now.
They are going to want to want they are

1258
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:57,840
They are going to want to want they are
 

1259
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,430
They are going to want to want they are
going to want sort of 300s. And if they

1260
00:32:59,430 --> 00:32:59,440
going to want sort of 300s. And if they
 

1261
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,950
going to want sort of 300s. And if they
snap that, it's rule out the twos.

1262
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:02,960
snap that, it's rule out the twos.
 

1263
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,230
snap that, it's rule out the twos.
Wanted to be short today above all this.

1264
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:08,240

 

1265
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,029

The weekly model is starting to play

1266
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:11,039
The weekly model is starting to play
 

1267
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,870
The weekly model is starting to play
out. It's one thing, but we are still

1268
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:12,880
out. It's one thing, but we are still
 

1269
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:38,470
out. It's one thing, but we are still
just inside the previous days range.

1270
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:38,480

 

1271
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,830

and come back for those fours again.

1272
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:41,840
and come back for those fours again.
 

1273
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,990
and come back for those fours again.
ES can't get through its new view yet

1274
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,000
ES can't get through its new view yet
 

1275
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,630
ES can't get through its new view yet
either. So, just rotating here a little

1276
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:46,640
either. So, just rotating here a little
 

1277
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,870
either. So, just rotating here a little
bit. Building out this big node down

1278
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:48,880
bit. Building out this big node down
 

1279
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,549
bit. Building out this big node down
here. It's a big node down here. You can

1280
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:50,559
here. It's a big node down here. You can
 

1281
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,110
here. It's a big node down here. You can
see a spike here. This is where the sort

1282
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,120
see a spike here. This is where the sort
 

1283
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,630
see a spike here. This is where the sort
of control is right now. It's where they

1284
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:54,640
of control is right now. It's where they
 

1285
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,870
of control is right now. It's where they
keep reselling into this this node here.

1286
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:56,880
keep reselling into this this node here.
 

1287
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,549
keep reselling into this this node here.
This spike. I'm going to remove this

1288
00:33:58,549 --> 00:33:58,559
This spike. I'm going to remove this
 

1289
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,549
This spike. I'm going to remove this
gray box because we've been here a lot.

1290
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:00,559
gray box because we've been here a lot.
 

1291
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,909
gray box because we've been here a lot.
And I'm going to remove this red box

1292
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:01,919
And I'm going to remove this red box
 

1293
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,590
And I'm going to remove this red box
because we'd also been here a lot. And

1294
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:03,600
because we'd also been here a lot. And
 

1295
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,029
because we'd also been here a lot. And
I'm going to remove this node from

1296
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:05,039
I'm going to remove this node from
 

1297
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,509
I'm going to remove this node from
yesterday as well. Clean this chart up a

1298
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:07,519
yesterday as well. Clean this chart up a
 

1299
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:29,829
yesterday as well. Clean this chart up a
little bit.

1300
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:29,839

 

1301
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,990

surprised. I'm somewhat surprised that

1302
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:32,000
surprised. I'm somewhat surprised that
 

1303
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,589
surprised. I'm somewhat surprised that
this is their morning play. They are

1304
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:33,599
this is their morning play. They are
 

1305
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,990
this is their morning play. They are
holding their hourly pivot. They are

1306
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,000
holding their hourly pivot. They are
 

1307
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,990
holding their hourly pivot. They are
holding this hourly pivot here right

1308
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:38,000
holding this hourly pivot here right
 

1309
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,909
holding this hourly pivot here right
now.

1310
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:39,919
now.
 

1311
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:46,149
now.
right here.

1312
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:46,159

 

1313
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,869

They are trying to absorb high on here

1314
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:48,879
They are trying to absorb high on here
 

1315
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,510
They are trying to absorb high on here
to complete this move at the moment. I

1316
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:51,520
to complete this move at the moment. I
 

1317
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,109
to complete this move at the moment. I
am somewhat surprised they haven't come

1318
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:53,119
am somewhat surprised they haven't come
 

1319
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,390
am somewhat surprised they haven't come
deeper before looking at it.

1320
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:58,400

 

1321
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:05,589

All right, back to these fours again.

1322
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:05,599

 

1323
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,030

Shall we look belong? I mean, it's up to

1324
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,040
Shall we look belong? I mean, it's up to
 

1325
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,950
Shall we look belong? I mean, it's up to
you. I just you got to understand zoom

1326
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:08,960
you. I just you got to understand zoom
 

1327
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,870
you. I just you got to understand zoom
out where you're looking for long. Like

1328
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:10,880
out where you're looking for long. Like
 

1329
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,630
out where you're looking for long. Like
I if I'm going to get long, I want it

1330
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:12,640
I if I'm going to get long, I want it
 

1331
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,030
I if I'm going to get long, I want it
down here. I really don't really want to

1332
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,040
down here. I really don't really want to
 

1333
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,109
down here. I really don't really want to
get long here unless we push and base

1334
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:17,119
get long here unless we push and base
 

1335
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,950
get long here unless we push and base
and hold. I'd much rather look at longs

1336
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:18,960
and hold. I'd much rather look at longs
 

1337
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,589
and hold. I'd much rather look at longs
down here if they trap.

1338
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:21,599
down here if they trap.
 

1339
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,589
down here if they trap.
It's just how they're moving it today.

1340
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:23,599
It's just how they're moving it today.
 

1341
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,550
It's just how they're moving it today.
They're not coming into key levels.

1342
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:28,560

 

1343
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,270

I'd rather be patient and trade in an

1344
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:31,280
I'd rather be patient and trade in an
 

1345
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,270
I'd rather be patient and trade in an
area I don't want to trade in. Here

1346
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:33,280
area I don't want to trade in. Here
 

1347
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,870
area I don't want to trade in. Here
comes the squeeze back towards that New

1348
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:34,880
comes the squeeze back towards that New
 

1349
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,270
comes the squeeze back towards that New
York open.

1350
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:37,280
York open.
 

1351
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,109
York open.
Yes, still not through New York VW. This

1352
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:39,119
Yes, still not through New York VW. This
 

1353
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,990
Yes, still not through New York VW. This
squeeze can be sold into. Honestly,

1354
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,000
squeeze can be sold into. Honestly,
 

1355
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,670
squeeze can be sold into. Honestly,
it's very iffy here, folks, because we

1356
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:43,680
it's very iffy here, folks, because we
 

1357
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,030
it's very iffy here, folks, because we
haven't reached. You have to understand

1358
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,040
haven't reached. You have to understand
 

1359
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,310
haven't reached. You have to understand
what I'm saying. We haven't reached this

1360
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:48,320
what I'm saying. We haven't reached this
 

1361
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,390
what I'm saying. We haven't reached this
and we haven't reached this. All right?

1362
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:50,400
and we haven't reached this. All right?
 

1363
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,550
and we haven't reached this. All right?
So, your positioning right now is in the

1364
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:52,560
So, your positioning right now is in the
 

1365
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,150
So, your positioning right now is in the
middle of this. These are the edges I

1366
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:54,160
middle of this. These are the edges I
 

1367
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,270
middle of this. These are the edges I
want to play here and above to sell here

1368
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:57,280
want to play here and above to sell here
 

1369
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,230
want to play here and above to sell here
and below to buy. Only if they trap,

1370
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,240
and below to buy. Only if they trap,
 

1371
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,750
and below to buy. Only if they trap,
right? Only if they trap. I don't want

1372
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:01,760
right? Only if they trap. I don't want
 

1373
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,030
right? Only if they trap. I don't want
to enter here. My location is so poor. I

1374
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,040
to enter here. My location is so poor. I
 

1375
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,190
to enter here. My location is so poor. I
really don't want to enter there.

1376
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:09,200

 

1377
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,670

We need another 40 plus points to get a

1378
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:11,680
We need another 40 plus points to get a
 

1379
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:24,470
We need another 40 plus points to get a
long entry.

1380
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:24,480

 

1381
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,550

I wouldn't trust trading because you

1382
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:26,560
I wouldn't trust trading because you
 

1383
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,630
I wouldn't trust trading because you
think news is negative, right? Most

1384
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:28,640
think news is negative, right? Most
 

1385
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,510
think news is negative, right? Most
stuff is priced in before it happens.

1386
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:33,520

 

1387
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,990

All right. Yes. Back to New York open.

1388
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,000
All right. Yes. Back to New York open.
 

1389
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,829
All right. Yes. Back to New York open.
We are back to previous weak value area

1390
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:37,839
We are back to previous weak value area
 

1391
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,310
We are back to previous weak value area
high here.

1392
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:40,320
high here.
 

1393
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,910
high here.
This node balls will need to hold this

1394
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:41,920
This node balls will need to hold this
 

1395
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,190
This node balls will need to hold this
node now. If they don't, we're going to

1396
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,200
node now. If they don't, we're going to
 

1397
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,190
node now. If they don't, we're going to
trade down to the 90s. And if they lose

1398
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:45,200
trade down to the 90s. And if they lose
 

1399
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,550
trade down to the 90s. And if they lose
90s, we're going to trade all the way

1400
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:46,560
90s, we're going to trade all the way
 

1401
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,310
90s, we're going to trade all the way
back down again. Here we go. It's just

1402
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:48,320
back down again. Here we go. It's just
 

1403
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,990
back down again. Here we go. It's just
washy, guys. This is why I'm trying not

1404
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:50,000
washy, guys. This is why I'm trying not
 

1405
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,069
washy, guys. This is why I'm trying not
to enter in here. It's far too dangerous

1406
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:52,079
to enter in here. It's far too dangerous
 

1407
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:59,829
to enter in here. It's far too dangerous
in my mind. Far far far too dangerous.

1408
00:36:59,829 --> 00:36:59,839

 

1409
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,030

Here comes the wash back down.

1410
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,040
Here comes the wash back down.
 

1411
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,630
Here comes the wash back down.
I still think this is the target. But

1412
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:04,640
I still think this is the target. But
 

1413
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,150
I still think this is the target. But
here's point control for the day now.

1414
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,160
here's point control for the day now.
 

1415
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,829
here's point control for the day now.
This is fair value. This is aggressive

1416
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:07,839
This is fair value. This is aggressive
 

1417
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,030
This is fair value. This is aggressive
here, folks. Here you go. They want

1418
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,040
here, folks. Here you go. They want
 

1419
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,270
here, folks. Here you go. They want
those 300s. What I'm saying? They've got

1420
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:11,280
those 300s. What I'm saying? They've got
 

1421
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,750
those 300s. What I'm saying? They've got
to come to 300s first. This is

1422
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:13,760
to come to 300s first. This is
 

1423
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,030
to come to 300s first. This is
aggressive. All the way back down. Do

1424
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,040
aggressive. All the way back down. Do
 

1425
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,950
aggressive. All the way back down. Do
they pop and sell this then? So 400 is

1426
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:18,960
they pop and sell this then? So 400 is
 

1427
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,790
they pop and sell this then? So 400 is
going to be key. If they lose 400s, you

1428
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:20,800
going to be key. If they lose 400s, you
 

1429
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,910
going to be key. If they lose 400s, you
might look for a follow through

1430
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:21,920
might look for a follow through
 

1431
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,870
might look for a follow through
downside. Now, if they lose 400s, if

1432
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:24,880
downside. Now, if they lose 400s, if
 

1433
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,630
downside. Now, if they lose 400s, if
they can't reclaim 400s, they might try

1434
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:26,640
they can't reclaim 400s, they might try
 

1435
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,470
they can't reclaim 400s, they might try
and resell it all the way back down. If

1436
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:28,480
and resell it all the way back down. If
 

1437
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,470
and resell it all the way back down. If
they reclaim 400s, then they're going to

1438
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:30,480
they reclaim 400s, then they're going to
 

1439
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,670
they reclaim 400s, then they're going to
go and fill these imbalances up to 26s.

1440
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:33,680
go and fill these imbalances up to 26s.
 

1441
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,589
go and fill these imbalances up to 26s.
It's washy, guys. I cannot say enough.

1442
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:35,599
It's washy, guys. I cannot say enough.
 

1443
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:49,589
It's washy, guys. I cannot say enough.
It's very washy.

1444
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:49,599

 

1445
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:59,910

Not getting through the fours.

1446
00:37:59,910 --> 00:37:59,920

 

1447
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,670

They keep protecting the fours here.

1448
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:01,680
They keep protecting the fours here.
 

1449
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,750
They keep protecting the fours here.
There is a chance for this move here

1450
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:03,760
There is a chance for this move here
 

1451
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,270
There is a chance for this move here
that I just talked about. They are

1452
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:05,280
that I just talked about. They are
 

1453
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,870
that I just talked about. They are
selling fours. There is a chance

1454
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:08,880
selling fours. There is a chance
 

1455
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,870
selling fours. There is a chance
to come down here right now if they sell

1456
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:10,880
to come down here right now if they sell
 

1457
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:24,470
to come down here right now if they sell
paws.

1458
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:24,480

 

1459
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,790

Back to fours. They go.

1460
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:30,800

 

1461
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,310

Watch these fours. They're imbalances

1462
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:32,320
Watch these fours. They're imbalances
 

1463
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,790
Watch these fours. They're imbalances
above fours all the way up to 26. But if

1464
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:34,800
above fours all the way up to 26. But if
 

1465
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,310
above fours all the way up to 26. But if
they keep selling falls, there's they

1466
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:36,320
they keep selling falls, there's they
 

1467
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,310
they keep selling falls, there's they
are going to look for that breakdown.

1468
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:38,320
are going to look for that breakdown.
 

1469
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,150
are going to look for that breakdown.
Fair like I'm not going to enter a trade

1470
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,160
Fair like I'm not going to enter a trade
 

1471
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,950
Fair like I'm not going to enter a trade
here. This is a no trade zone. But I

1472
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:42,960
here. This is a no trade zone. But I
 

1473
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,270
here. This is a no trade zone. But I
would say I would be watching this,

1474
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:45,280
would say I would be watching this,
 

1475
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,109
would say I would be watching this,
right? Because we have this guy that

1476
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:47,119
right? Because we have this guy that
 

1477
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,589
right? Because we have this guy that
keeps selling up here into fours. All

1478
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:49,599
keeps selling up here into fours. All
 

1479
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,150
keeps selling up here into fours. All
right. And an imbalance here.

1480
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,160
right. And an imbalance here.
 

1481
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,990
right. And an imbalance here.
Here's the push to four. So what they do

1482
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,000
Here's the push to four. So what they do
 

1483
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,349
Here's the push to four. So what they do
now is absolutely key.

1484
00:38:57,349 --> 00:38:57,359
now is absolutely key.
 

1485
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,870
now is absolutely key.
If they reclaim it, then there's a

1486
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:58,880
If they reclaim it, then there's a
 

1487
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,790
If they reclaim it, then there's a
squeeze up to 25s.

1488
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:02,800

 

1489
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,190

Trader bait down again. Are you joking?

1490
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,200
Trader bait down again. Are you joking?
 

1491
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,349
Trader bait down again. Are you joking?
Oh man, you put me off trading. Really?

1492
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:07,359
Oh man, you put me off trading. Really?
 

1493
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:12,710
Oh man, you put me off trading. Really?
Is that Is that actually true?

1494
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:12,720

 

1495
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,310

I will not enter if that's actually

1496
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:14,320
I will not enter if that's actually
 

1497
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:21,910
I will not enter if that's actually
true. Not on an NFP day.

1498
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:21,920

 

1499
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,230

Okay. Rejecting 410s. Previous day value

1500
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,240
Okay. Rejecting 410s. Previous day value
 

1501
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,990
Okay. Rejecting 410s. Previous day value
high. They don't bid fours. They're

1502
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,000
high. They don't bid fours. They're
 

1503
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,349
high. They don't bid fours. They're
going to look for the wash here. If they

1504
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:27,359
going to look for the wash here. If they
 

1505
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,069
going to look for the wash here. If they
can't hold the fours,

1506
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:30,079
can't hold the fours,
 

1507
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,190
can't hold the fours,
it is messy, messy, messy. ES cannot get

1508
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200
it is messy, messy, messy. ES cannot get
 

1509
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,990
it is messy, messy, messy. ES cannot get
through that New York open.

1510
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,000

 

1511
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,829

Okay, trade of eight down. Guys, be very

1520
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:50,880
eight's down. You are asking for it.
 

1521
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,390
eight's down. You are asking for it.
I didn't know that cuz I haven't entered

1522
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:52,400
I didn't know that cuz I haven't entered
 

1523
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,950
I didn't know that cuz I haven't entered
since that first trade. But uh yeah,

1524
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
since that first trade. But uh yeah,
 

1525
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:01,589
since that first trade. But uh yeah,
just be careful.

1526
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:01,599

 

1527
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,190

Yeah, some of you saying it's bad, some

1528
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,200
Yeah, some of you saying it's bad, some
 

1529
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,270
Yeah, some of you saying it's bad, some
of you saying it's fine. They're

1530
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:05,280
of you saying it's fine. They're
 

1531
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,510
of you saying it's fine. They're
probably not a global outage yet.

1532
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:09,520

 

1533
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,349

Order delayed on execution. A lot of you

1534
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:11,359
Order delayed on execution. A lot of you
 

1535
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,230
Order delayed on execution. A lot of you
saying

1536
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:16,240

 

1537
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,190

CVD looks weird. Um, it's kind of

1538
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,200
CVD looks weird. Um, it's kind of
 

1539
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,790
CVD looks weird. Um, it's kind of
matching up on the 5m minute with what

1540
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:20,800
matching up on the 5m minute with what
 

1541
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,710
matching up on the 5m minute with what
we've had so far. All right, they're

1542
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:22,720
we've had so far. All right, they're
 

1543
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,589
we've had so far. All right, they're
going to try and lift for 25s now. They

1544
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:25,599
going to try and lift for 25s now. They
 

1545
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,190
going to try and lift for 25s now. They
don't know what to do here. This is the

1546
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:27,200
don't know what to do here. This is the
 

1547
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,270
don't know what to do here. This is the
problem. Everyone who's smart wants to

1548
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:29,280
problem. Everyone who's smart wants to
 

1549
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,030
problem. Everyone who's smart wants to
trade in extreme and now they're just

1550
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,040
trade in extreme and now they're just
 

1551
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,190
trade in extreme and now they're just
building out liquidity. I think we need

1552
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:33,200
building out liquidity. I think we need
 

1553
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:47,510
building out liquidity. I think we need
to come down here.

1554
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:47,520

 

1555
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,589

Might get follow through here folks
 

1559
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,430
Might get follow through here folks
watching this.

1560
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:55,440

So they keep testing that previous day

1562
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:57,119
So they keep testing that previous day
 

1563
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,230
So they keep testing that previous day
point of control for me. I have this on

1564
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:00,240
point of control for me. I have this on
 

1565
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,910
point of control for me. I have this on
Ninja Trader. I have a previous day

1566
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:01,920
Ninja Trader. I have a previous day
 

1567
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,589
Ninja Trader. I have a previous day
point of control is 62s. I don't know if

1568
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:03,599
point of control is 62s. I don't know if
 

1569
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,790
point of control is 62s. I don't know if
anyone else has the same. I'm going to

1570
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:04,800
anyone else has the same. I'm going to
 

1571
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,470
anyone else has the same. I'm going to
double check that now. Yeah, it's right.

1572
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:08,480
double check that now. Yeah, it's right.
 

1573
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,150
double check that now. Yeah, it's right.
You might see follow here through here,

1574
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,160
You might see follow here through here,
 

1575
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,270
You might see follow here through here,
folks. I think they're going to go for

1576
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:11,280
folks. I think they're going to go for
 

1577
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,270
folks. I think they're going to go for
those 300s. They've trapped enough times

1578
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:13,280
those 300s. They've trapped enough times
 

1579
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,790
those 300s. They've trapped enough times
up there now. So 70s is where the

1580
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:16,800
up there now. So 70s is where the
 

1581
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,109
up there now. So 70s is where the
sellers keep getting stuck. So they need

1582
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:19,119
sellers keep getting stuck. So they need
 

1583
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,309
sellers keep getting stuck. So they need
to follow through under 70s.

1584
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:24,319

 

1585
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,710

Rotation. Rotation rotation here is

1586
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:26,720
Rotation. Rotation rotation here is
 

1587
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,150
Rotation. Rotation rotation here is
stuck between New York view up and

00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:28,160
stuck between New York view up and
 

1589
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,710
stuck between New York view up and
24-hour view up. So back to PC which is

1590
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:30,720
24-hour view up. So back to PC which is
 

1591
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,150
24-hour view up. So back to PC which is
88s here and 92s and if they fail that

1592
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,160
88s here and 92s and if they fail that
 

1593
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:43,510
88s here and 92s and if they fail that
they will look for follow through

1594
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:43,520

 

1595
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,790

P. Do they fail this? They're going to

1596
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:46,800
P. Do they fail this? They're going to
 

1597
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,390
P. Do they fail this? They're going to
squeeze right the way back upside.

1598
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:48,400
squeeze right the way back upside.
 

1599

Big seller coming in here
trying to force lower. If he doesn't do

trying to force lower. If he doesn't do
 

1607
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,670
trying to force lower. If he doesn't do
it, he's going to get caught. He's

So, we haven't completed a rotation
 

1613
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,390
So, we haven't completed a rotation
either side today. That's the problem.

Tra more shorts there again. Someone's

Tra more shorts there again. Someone's
absorbing here under 60s. They need to

absorbing here under 60s. They need to
 

1665
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,349
absorbing here under 60s. They need to
snap hard and then they'll get a run to

1666
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:35,359
snap hard and then they'll get a run to
 

1667
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,309
snap hard and then they'll get a run to
25s. There they go. They need to snap

1671
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,510
here hard and you'll get a run to 25s
and maybe you'll get those 300s.

1672
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:43,520
and maybe you'll get those 300s.
 

1673

1695
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,270
All right. They've either got to get
above here and try and complete this or

1696
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:15,280
above here and try and complete this or
 

1697
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,190
above here and try and complete this or
below here and try and complete this. We

1698
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:17,200
below here and try and complete this. We
 

1699
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,870
below here and try and complete this. We
just don't want to trade in here. This

1700
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:18,880
just don't want to trade in here. This
 

1701
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,950
just don't want to trade in here. This
is the wash zone from the last few

1702
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:20,960
is the wash zone from the last few
 

1703
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,470
is the wash zone from the last few
sessions.

1704
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:24,480

 

1705
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,069

It is the wash zone from the last few

1706
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:26,079
It is the wash zone from the last few
 

1707
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,150
It is the wash zone from the last few
sessions. I'll move that up here,

1708
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:28,160
sessions. I'll move that up here,
 

1709
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:34,069
sessions. I'll move that up here,
haven't I? There we go. That's better.

1710
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:34,079

 

1711
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:48,790

Chop city. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

1712
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:48,800

 

1713
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,550

It's amazing the amount of volume that

1714
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:50,560
It's amazing the amount of volume that
 

1715
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,510
It's amazing the amount of volume that
he can build out.

1716
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:53,520
he can build out.
 

1717
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,109
he can build out.
Okay, look at ES as well doing the same

1718
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:55,119
Okay, look at ES as well doing the same
 

1719
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,630
Okay, look at ES as well doing the same
dance. So, we can see New York VW

1720
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:56,640
dance. So, we can see New York VW
 

1721
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,710
dance. So, we can see New York VW
24-hour VW up. ES the same stuck between

1722
00:44:58,710 --> 00:44:58,720
24-hour VW up. ES the same stuck between
 

1723
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,470
24-hour VW up. ES the same stuck between
these two and it's stuck in this. I

1724
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:00,480
these two and it's stuck in this. I
 

1725
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,990
these two and it's stuck in this. I
think they want to come down into this

1726
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:02,000
think they want to come down into this
 

1727
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,390
think they want to come down into this
honestly, but they keep saving it here.

1728
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:04,400
honestly, but they keep saving it here.
 

1729
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,630
honestly, but they keep saving it here.
You cannot deny that. If too many people

1730
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:06,640
You cannot deny that. If too many people
 

1731
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,670
You cannot deny that. If too many people
get stuck one side, it will be so nasty

1732
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:09,680
get stuck one side, it will be so nasty
 

1733
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:15,270
get stuck one side, it will be so nasty
to move back the other way.

1734
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:15,280

 

1735
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:21,430

There's no edge here right now.

1736
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:21,440

 

1737
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,109

So here they go. Trying to lift back up

1738
00:45:23,109 --> 00:45:23,119
So here they go. Trying to lift back up
 

1739
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,430
So here they go. Trying to lift back up
to fours.

1740
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:27,440

 

1741
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,510

So 350 to fours is your range right now.

1742
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:29,520
So 350 to fours is your range right now.
 

1743
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,829
So 350 to fours is your range right now.
50 points range.

1744
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:31,839
50 points range.
 

1745
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,270
50 points range.
There's nothing outside of that yet.

1746
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:35,280
There's nothing outside of that yet.
 

1747
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,950
There's nothing outside of that yet.
Time for coffee. I am actually thinking

1748
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:36,960
Time for coffee. I am actually thinking
 

1749
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,109
Time for coffee. I am actually thinking
about that already.

1750
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:39,119
about that already.
 

1751
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,950
about that already.
Why did I place the gray box in the

1752
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:40,960
Why did I place the gray box in the
 

1753
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,190
Why did I place the gray box in the
300s? Because there is a node down

1754
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:43,200
300s? Because there is a node down
 

1755
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,750
300s? Because there is a node down
there. There is volume down there that I

1756
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:45,760
there. There is volume down there that I
 

1757
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,630
there. There is volume down there that I
am watching

1758
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:50,640

 

1759
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,950

on the developing week. There is a node

1760
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:52,960
on the developing week. There is a node
 

1761
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,829
on the developing week. There is a node
down into that. I'm actually playing the

1762
00:45:55,829 --> 00:45:55,839
down into that. I'm actually playing the
 

1763
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,190
down into that. I'm actually playing the
underside of that node. It actually

1764
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:57,200
underside of that node. It actually
 

1765
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,390
underside of that node. It actually
starts at 22s, right? It starts at 322s.

1766
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:00,400
starts at 22s, right? It starts at 322s.
 

1767
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,069
starts at 22s, right? It starts at 322s.
There is a node that starts on the

1768
00:46:02,069 --> 00:46:02,079
There is a node that starts on the
 

1769
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,990
There is a node that starts on the
developing week profile. How many

1770
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:04,000
developing week profile. How many
 

1771
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,349
developing week profile. How many
attempts are these guys going to have to

1772
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:05,359
attempts are these guys going to have to
 

1773
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:12,870
attempts are these guys going to have to
break lower? Honestly,

1774
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:12,880

 

1775
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,390

70s again.

1776
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:16,400
70s again.
 

1777
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,790
70s again.
Come on. Just go and do it for God's

1778
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:18,800
Come on. Just go and do it for God's
 

1779
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,349
Come on. Just go and do it for God's
sake. There they go. Jesus Christ.

1780
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:23,359
sake. There they go. Jesus Christ.
 

1781
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,230
sake. There they go. Jesus Christ.
Go and get to 20s and 30s and then 300s.

1782
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:26,240
Go and get to 20s and 30s and then 300s.
 

1783
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,069
Go and get to 20s and 30s and then 300s.
Come on.

1784
00:46:28,069 --> 00:46:28,079
Come on.
 

1785
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,230
Come on.
[\h__\h] are you lot playing at? It's so

1786
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:30,240
[\h__\h] are you lot playing at? It's so
 

1787
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:36,069
[\h__\h] are you lot playing at? It's so
pathetic.

1788
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:36,079

 

1789
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,950

There they go.

1790
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:40,960

 

1791
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,430

Okay. Inter 50s. Can they find

1792
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:43,440
Okay. Inter 50s. Can they find
 

1793
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,589
Okay. Inter 50s. Can they find
acceptance outside of this node now and

1794
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:45,599
acceptance outside of this node now and
 

1795
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,270
acceptance outside of this node now and
come down into here? I'm wait I'm trying

1796
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:47,280
come down into here? I'm wait I'm trying
 

1797
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,870
come down into here? I'm wait I'm trying
to wait for price to get down into here.

1798
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:48,880
to wait for price to get down into here.
 

1799
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,470
to wait for price to get down into here.
It's arguable that you might want to

1800
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:50,480
It's arguable that you might want to
 

1801
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,750
It's arguable that you might want to
take a short here. I'm not looking for

1802
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:51,760
take a short here. I'm not looking for
 

1803
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,270
take a short here. I'm not looking for
it. I want to see how we react down

1804
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:53,280
it. I want to see how we react down
 

1805
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,870
it. I want to see how we react down
here. I'm trying to wait for price to

1806
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:54,880
here. I'm trying to wait for price to
 

1807
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,190
here. I'm trying to wait for price to
get here or here. That's where my edge

1808
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:57,200
get here or here. That's where my edge
 

1809
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,190
get here or here. That's where my edge
is as a trader. All right. It's to trade

1810
00:46:59,190 --> 00:46:59,200
is as a trader. All right. It's to trade
 

1811
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,109
is as a trader. All right. It's to trade
at the key levels, not in between them.

1812
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:01,119
at the key levels, not in between them.
 

1813
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,750
at the key levels, not in between them.
I think we're going to get to here.

1814
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:03,760
I think we're going to get to here.
 

1815
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,910
I think we're going to get to here.
Okay, VW up there. Nice. Come on. Come

1816
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:05,920
Okay, VW up there. Nice. Come on. Come
 

1817
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,190
Okay, VW up there. Nice. Come on. Come
lower. Please come lower. Please come

1818
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:09,200
lower. Please come lower. Please come
 

1819
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:17,829
lower. Please come lower. Please come
lower.

1820
00:47:17,829 --> 00:47:17,839

 

1821
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:19,910

Please come lower. Let's be up. They

1822
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:19,920
Please come lower. Let's be up. They
 

1823
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,790
Please come lower. Let's be up. They
keep protecting V up here.

1824
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:22,800
keep protecting V up here.
 

1825
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,030
keep protecting V up here.
There they come. Okay, great. Finally.

1826
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:25,040
There they come. Okay, great. Finally.
 

1827
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,630
There they come. Okay, great. Finally.
All right, let's see what we do down

1828
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:26,640
All right, let's see what we do down
 

1829
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,309
All right, let's see what we do down
here into this level. Do they bid or do

1830
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:28,319
here into this level. Do they bid or do
 

1831
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,390
here into this level. Do they bid or do
they just let go of the whole thing? Do

1832
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:30,400
they just let go of the whole thing? Do
 

1833
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,990
they just let go of the whole thing? Do
they bid this or do they let go of the

1834
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:32,000
they bid this or do they let go of the
 

1835
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,630
they bid this or do they let go of the
whole thing? Currently bidding off that

1836
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:34,640
whole thing? Currently bidding off that
 

1837
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,630
whole thing? Currently bidding off that
level, aren't they? Look at this rip

1838
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:36,640
level, aren't they? Look at this rip
 

1839
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,790
level, aren't they? Look at this rip
back up. So far, so watching this now

1840
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:38,800
back up. So far, so watching this now
 

1841
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,589
back up. So far, so watching this now
very, very carefully. We knew it was a

1842
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:41,599
very, very carefully. We knew it was a
 

1843
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,270
very, very carefully. We knew it was a
key level. We're watching now to see if

1844
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,280
key level. We're watching now to see if
 

1845
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,670
key level. We're watching now to see if
we trap bears down here, which we have

1846
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:45,680
we trap bears down here, which we have
 

1847
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,430
we trap bears down here, which we have
so far in this count's very quick. We

1848
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:47,440
so far in this count's very quick. We
 

1849
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,829
so far in this count's very quick. We
have trapped at tens. So if they defend

1850
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:49,839
have trapped at tens. So if they defend
 

1851
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,510
have trapped at tens. So if they defend
10, we have bears trapped down there.

1852
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:51,520
10, we have bears trapped down there.
 

1853
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,870
10, we have bears trapped down there.
But we want to see a bit of structure

1854
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:52,880
But we want to see a bit of structure
 

1855
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,190
But we want to see a bit of structure
develop.

1856
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:55,200
develop.
 

1857
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:03,589
develop.
Want to see a bit of structure develop.

1858
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:03,599

 

1859
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,990

Waiting to see if they trap these bears

1860
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:06,000
Waiting to see if they trap these bears
 

1861
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,670
Waiting to see if they trap these bears
at 10 or not. Do we put in a higher low

1862
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:09,680
at 10 or not. Do we put in a higher low
 

1863
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,270
at 10 or not. Do we put in a higher low
here so I can uh get involved with some

1864
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:13,280
here so I can uh get involved with some
 

1865
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,550
here so I can uh get involved with some
decent risk? More bears come in here at

1866
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:16,560
decent risk? More bears come in here at
 

1867
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,390
decent risk? More bears come in here at
30. I want to see it flush to tens and

1868
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:18,400
30. I want to see it flush to tens and
 

1869
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,309
30. I want to see it flush to tens and
get absorbed. If we break down under

1870
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:20,319
get absorbed. If we break down under
 

1871
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,549
get absorbed. If we break down under
that, then obviously there's no play.

1872
00:48:22,549 --> 00:48:22,559
that, then obviously there's no play.
 

1873
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,230
that, then obviously there's no play.
They're protecting 10 so far. Still

1874
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:24,240
They're protecting 10 so far. Still
 

1875
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,510
They're protecting 10 so far. Still
watching these tens. Can we come and

1876
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:25,520
watching these tens. Can we come and
 

1877
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,950
watching these tens. Can we come and
revisit them? And can I see a buyer

1878
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:26,960
revisit them? And can I see a buyer
 

1879
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,230
revisit them? And can I see a buyer
stepping on the bid here? They are

1880
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:28,240
stepping on the bid here? They are
 

1881
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,670
stepping on the bid here? They are
bidding below it though, which is a bit

1882
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:29,680
bidding below it though, which is a bit
 

1883
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,710
bidding below it though, which is a bit
iffy. And there's a selling out 35s. I'm

1884
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:32,720
iffy. And there's a selling out 35s. I'm
 

1885
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,150
iffy. And there's a selling out 35s. I'm
interested, but I don't like what I see

1886
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:34,160
interested, but I don't like what I see
 

1887
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,549
interested, but I don't like what I see
yet.

1888
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:36,559
yet.
 

1889
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,230
yet.
So, this is the 10's revisit. You can

1890
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:38,240
So, this is the 10's revisit. You can
 

1891
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,990
So, this is the 10's revisit. You can
see 310's being revisited because that's

1892
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:40,000
see 310's being revisited because that's
 

1893
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,870
see 310's being revisited because that's
where the sellers got stuck.

1894
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:42,880
where the sellers got stuck.
 

1895
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,710
where the sellers got stuck.
They need to buy this now and rip it

1896
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:44,720
They need to buy this now and rip it
 

1897
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,950
They need to buy this now and rip it
higher. If they don't do that, we will

1898
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:46,960
higher. If they don't do that, we will
 

1899
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,990
higher. If they don't do that, we will
break lower and we will keep washing.

1900
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:50,000
break lower and we will keep washing.
 

1901
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,829
break lower and we will keep washing.
Breaking lower. Okay. So, no bull no

1902
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:51,839
Breaking lower. Okay. So, no bull no
 

1903
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,670
Breaking lower. Okay. So, no bull no
bullish play here yet for me. Let this

1904
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:53,680
bullish play here yet for me. Let this
 

1905
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,670
bullish play here yet for me. Let this
break lower.

1906
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:55,680
break lower.
 

1907
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,510
break lower.
It's possible they do gap fill here if

1908
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:57,520
It's possible they do gap fill here if
 

1909
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,069
It's possible they do gap fill here if
they really let go.

1910
00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:00,079
they really let go.
 

1911
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:05,109
they really let go.
300s.

1912
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:05,119

 

1913
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,470

Am I really just going to get that one

1914
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:06,480
Am I really just going to get that one
 

1915
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,190
Am I really just going to get that one
play for the day?

1916
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:11,200

 

1917
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,790

Big Bull stepping in down here. That's

1918
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:12,800
Big Bull stepping in down here. That's
 

1919
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,390
Big Bull stepping in down here. That's
not a good sign. This will break lower.

1920
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:14,400
not a good sign. This will break lower.
 

1921
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,390
not a good sign. This will break lower.
Big Bull just stepped in at 300. Huge

1922
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:16,400
Big Bull just stepped in at 300. Huge
 

1923
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,390
Big Bull just stepped in at 300. Huge
lot. He's going to get caught. You

1924
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:18,400
lot. He's going to get caught. You
 

1925
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,150
lot. He's going to get caught. You
idiot. You idiot.

1926
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:24,160

 

1927
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:31,349

H

1928
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:31,359

 

1929
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,190

so hard to position that short. I know.

1930
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:33,200
so hard to position that short. I know.
 

1931
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,510
so hard to position that short. I know.
I I agree with you. I wanted to position

1932
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:35,520
I I agree with you. I wanted to position
 

1933
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,750
I I agree with you. I wanted to position
for that short up here. All right. All I

1934
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:37,760
for that short up here. All right. All I
 

1935
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,349
for that short up here. All right. All I
wanted was any move up here to then fade

1936
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:41,359
wanted was any move up here to then fade
 

1937
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,910
wanted was any move up here to then fade
for this move. That was my plan today. I

1938
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:43,920
for this move. That was my plan today. I
 

1939
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,670
for this move. That was my plan today. I
know sometimes market doesn't give you

1940
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:45,680
know sometimes market doesn't give you
 

1941
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,829
know sometimes market doesn't give you
what you want. We know this is a

1942
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:47,839
what you want. We know this is a
 

1943
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,190
what you want. We know this is a
potential level they can hold. If they

1944
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:49,200
potential level they can hold. If they
 

1945
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,030
potential level they can hold. If they
fail this level, previous day value low,

1946
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,040
fail this level, previous day value low,
 

1947
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,470
fail this level, previous day value low,
previous day close, previous day low,

1948
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:52,480
previous day close, previous day low,
 

1949
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,390
previous day close, previous day low,
all all on check. But this is a big

1950
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:54,400
all all on check. But this is a big
 

1951
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,710
all all on check. But this is a big
level even for the options market,

1952
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:56,720
level even for the options market,
 

1953
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,030
level even for the options market,
right? It's a big big level. We haven't

1954
00:49:59,030 --> 00:49:59,040
right? It's a big big level. We haven't
 

1955
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,109
right? It's a big big level. We haven't
retested up here yet. So they might lift

1956
00:50:01,109 --> 00:50:01,119
retested up here yet. So they might lift
 

1957
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,589
retested up here yet. So they might lift
and retest 50s and we can see if they

1958
00:50:03,589 --> 00:50:03,599
and retest 50s and we can see if they
 

1959
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,069
and retest 50s and we can see if they
stay heavy. So if they lift Oh, don't do

1960
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:06,079
stay heavy. So if they lift Oh, don't do
 

1961
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,510
stay heavy. So if they lift Oh, don't do
that. If we lift and test 50s and stay

1962
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:09,520
that. If we lift and test 50s and stay
 

1963
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,790
that. If we lift and test 50s and stay
heavy, there will be a reshort

1964
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:10,800
heavy, there will be a reshort
 

1965
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,790
heavy, there will be a reshort
opportunity into here and then maybe

1966
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:12,800
opportunity into here and then maybe
 

1967
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,630
opportunity into here and then maybe
down if they get follow through. If they

1968
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:14,640
down if they get follow through. If they
 

1969
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,549
down if they get follow through. If they
lift and reclaim, we go back and chop

1970
00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:16,559
lift and reclaim, we go back and chop
 

1971
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,030
lift and reclaim, we go back and chop
here before they make decision of what

1972
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:19,040
here before they make decision of what
 

1973
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,750
here before they make decision of what
next.

1974
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:21,760
next.
 

1975
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,069
next.
That buyer is currently comfortable at

1976
00:50:24,069 --> 00:50:24,079
That buyer is currently comfortable at
 

1977
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,349
That buyer is currently comfortable at
300. I'm somewhat surprised. We might

1978
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:27,359
300. I'm somewhat surprised. We might
 

1979
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:32,710
300. I'm somewhat surprised. We might
lift here to 50s.

1980
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:32,720

 

1981
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,390

I don't know if I want to do that.

1982
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:36,400
I don't know if I want to do that.
 

1983
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:47,990
I don't know if I want to do that.
I don't think I want to bid that.

1984
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:48,000

 

1985
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,710

I don't like this guy here, guys. This

1986
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:50,720
I don't like this guy here, guys. This
 

1987
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,030
I don't like this guy here, guys. This
guy here with big size at 300. He's

1988
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:53,040
guy here with big size at 300. He's
 

1989
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,349
guy here with big size at 300. He's
currently comfortable though. We've got

1990
00:50:55,349 --> 00:50:55,359
currently comfortable though. We've got
 

1991
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,670
currently comfortable though. We've got
guy trapped at 317. I don't like these

1992
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:57,680
guy trapped at 317. I don't like these
 

1993
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,430
guy trapped at 317. I don't like these
guys piling in long at the lows. That's

1994
00:50:59,430 --> 00:50:59,440
guys piling in long at the lows. That's
 

1995
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,870
guys piling in long at the lows. That's
not what I want to see. Not aggressive

1996
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:00,880
not what I want to see. Not aggressive
 

1997
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,109
not what I want to see. Not aggressive
buyers at the lows. It's the opposite of

1998
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:03,119
buyers at the lows. It's the opposite of
 

1999
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:10,870
buyers at the lows. It's the opposite of
what I would want to see.

2000
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:10,880

 

2001
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,470

We're at a level of interest. It's just

2002
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:12,480
We're at a level of interest. It's just
 

2003
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,630
We're at a level of interest. It's just
I'm not seeing what I like yet. Seeing

2004
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:14,640
I'm not seeing what I like yet. Seeing
 

2005
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,710
I'm not seeing what I like yet. Seeing
the opposite of what I would like.

2006
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:18,720

 

2007
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,190

We might still break lower here. Revisit

2008
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:21,200
We might still break lower here. Revisit
 

2009
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,870
We might still break lower here. Revisit
up here would be really good. A revisit

2010
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:22,880
up here would be really good. A revisit
 

2011
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,549
up here would be really good. A revisit
of this shelf here would be good for us

2012
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:24,559
of this shelf here would be good for us
 

2013
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,870
of this shelf here would be good for us
to make a decision

2014
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:28,880

 

2015
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,870

up here.

2016
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:30,880
up here.
 

2017
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,950
up here.
Any revisit here and see how we act

2018
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:32,960
Any revisit here and see how we act
 

2019
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,710
Any revisit here and see how we act
would be good to potentially sell. They

2020
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:34,720
would be good to potentially sell. They
 

2021
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,790
would be good to potentially sell. They
are bidding off this now. So that level

2022
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:36,800
are bidding off this now. So that level
 

2023
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,109
are bidding off this now. So that level
is holding up well. So we have to see do

2024
00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:39,119
is holding up well. So we have to see do
 

2025
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,309
is holding up well. So we have to see do
we resell up into here either 50s or

2026
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:42,319
we resell up into here either 50s or
 

2027
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,950
we resell up into here either 50s or
64s. Do they resell it or are they just

2028
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:44,960
64s. Do they resell it or are they just
 

2029
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,309
64s. Do they resell it or are they just
going to bid all the way back up to the

2030
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:46,319
going to bid all the way back up to the
 

2031
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,470
going to bid all the way back up to the
high of day now? So here we go. Is the

2032
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:48,480
high of day now? So here we go. Is the
 

2033
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,910
high of day now? So here we go. Is the
drive in 250s?

2034
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:51,920

 

2035
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:59,349

Is that it?

2036
00:51:59,349 --> 00:51:59,359

 

2037
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,670

And reselling it.

2038
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:01,680
And reselling it.
 

2039
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,270
And reselling it.
Buyer got a little bit caught there at

Didn't get to where I wanted. Let's see.
 

2045

2049
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,549

flush under 20s because that's where the

2050
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:14,559
flush under 20s because that's where the
 

2051
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:17,030
flush under 20s because that's where the
buyers came. Here we come. Got to get

Peeling some off here. You can hear me

2056
00:52:22,549 --> 00:52:22,559
Peeling some off here. You can hear me
 

2057
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,630
Peeling some off here. You can hear me
on my hot keys as we come into 20s. They

2058
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:24,640
on my hot keys as we come into 20s. They
 

2059
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,630
on my hot keys as we come into 20s. They
can hold this here and re-rip. Don't

2060
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:26,640
can hold this here and re-rip. Don't
 

2061
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,230
can hold this here and re-rip. Don't
want them to rerip. Want to let go of

2062
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:28,240
want them to rerip. Want to let go of
 

2063
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,549
want them to rerip. Want to let go of
20s and revisit 300. And then I want to

2064
00:52:30,549 --> 00:52:30,559
20s and revisit 300. And then I want to
 

2065
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,230
20s and revisit 300. And then I want to
use that buyer down there as pain to go

2066
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:34,240
use that buyer down there as pain to go
 

2067
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,390
use that buyer down there as pain to go
lower. Get under that 300.

2068
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:38,400
lower. Get under that 300.
 

2069
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,270
lower. Get under that 300.
Get under that 300 now.

2070
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:43,280

 

2071
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:50,790

Thank you very [\h__\h] much. That'll do.

2072
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:50,800

 

2073
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,589

Here we go, baby. Runners on deck. And

2074
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:53,599
Here we go, baby. Runners on deck. And
 

2075
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,150
Here we go, baby. Runners on deck. And
let's see how low can we go. Right now,

2076
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:56,160
let's see how low can we go. Right now,
 

2077
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,549
let's see how low can we go. Right now,
we're flipping this. So, failed to

2078
00:52:58,549 --> 00:52:58,559
we're flipping this. So, failed to
 

2079
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,230
we're flipping this. So, failed to
reclaim. Like I said, there were buyers

2080
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:00,240
reclaim. Like I said, there were buyers
 

2081
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,750
reclaim. Like I said, there were buyers
piling in down here. It's why I didn't

2082
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:01,760
piling in down here. It's why I didn't
 

2083
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,270
piling in down here. It's why I didn't
want to bid it. I didn't like seeing the

2084
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:03,280
want to bid it. I didn't like seeing the
 

2085
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,950
want to bid it. I didn't like seeing the
buyers be aggressive here. We came back

2086
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:04,960
buyers be aggressive here. We came back
 

2087
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,750
buyers be aggressive here. We came back
up. We sold this. I sold this. Covered

2088
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:07,760
up. We sold this. I sold this. Covered
 

2089
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,670
up. We sold this. I sold this. Covered
some 20. Covered some 300. And now

2090
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:09,680
some 20. Covered some 300. And now
 

2091
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,430
some 20. Covered some 300. And now
holding to see how low can we go. So,

2092
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:11,440
holding to see how low can we go. So,
 

2093
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,510
holding to see how low can we go. So,
value area low from yesterday coming up.

2094
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:13,520
value area low from yesterday coming up.
 

2095
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,589
value area low from yesterday coming up.
Then we're looking for gap fills. Here

2096
00:53:15,589 --> 00:53:15,599
Then we're looking for gap fills. Here
 

2097
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,150
Then we're looking for gap fills. Here
we [\h__\h] go, baby.

2098
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:18,160
we [\h__\h] go, baby.
 

2099
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,150
we [\h__\h] go, baby.
Don't tell me. I don't tell you what I'm

2100
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:20,160
Don't tell me. I don't tell you what I'm
 

2101
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,910
Don't tell me. I don't tell you what I'm
looking at. I don't want to hear it

2102
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:21,920
looking at. I don't want to hear it
 

2103
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:31,990
looking at. I don't want to hear it
today.

2104
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:32,000

 

2105
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,630

Okay, here we go, baby. If we get lucky,

2106
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:34,640
Okay, here we go, baby. If we get lucky,
 

2107
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,990
Okay, here we go, baby. If we get lucky,
we get down here. You must pay yourself

2108
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:36,000
we get down here. You must pay yourself
 

2109
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,349
we get down here. You must pay yourself
a bit into valued area low from

2110
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:37,359
a bit into valued area low from
 

2111
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,790
a bit into valued area low from
yesterday. If we get acceptance

2112
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:38,800
yesterday. If we get acceptance
 

2113
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,549
yesterday. If we get acceptance
undervalued area low than from

2114
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:40,559
undervalued area low than from
 

2115
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,510
undervalued area low than from
yesterday, it means all the buyers will

2116
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:43,520
yesterday, it means all the buyers will
 

2117
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,349
yesterday, it means all the buyers will
become trapped and we can come down into

2118
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:45,359
become trapped and we can come down into
 

2119
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:46,870
become trapped and we can come down into
some of these levels. But uh we are

2120
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:46,880
some of these levels. But uh we are
 

2121
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,390
some of these levels. But uh we are
paying ourselves no matter what. I do

2122
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:48,400
paying ourselves no matter what. I do
 

2123
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,549
paying ourselves no matter what. I do
not want to see reclaims of 300 here. I

2124
00:53:50,549 --> 00:53:50,559
not want to see reclaims of 300 here. I
 

2125
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,589
not want to see reclaims of 300 here. I
will cut on a reclaim of 300. So we're

2126
00:53:53,589 --> 00:53:53,599
will cut on a reclaim of 300. So we're
 

2127
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,670
will cut on a reclaim of 300. So we're
tapping 300. It's where a buyer is

2128
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:55,680
tapping 300. It's where a buyer is
 

2129
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,069
tapping 300. It's where a buyer is
currently caught. Right? We do not want

2130
00:53:58,069 --> 00:53:58,079
currently caught. Right? We do not want
 

2131
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,829
currently caught. Right? We do not want
him to be let out. If he gets let out,

2132
00:53:59,829 --> 00:53:59,839
him to be let out. If he gets let out,
 

2133
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,470
him to be let out. If he gets let out,
we will push to to 20 probably very very

2134
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:02,480
we will push to to 20 probably very very
 

2135
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,109
we will push to to 20 probably very very
quickly. So we do not want 300 to be

2136
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:05,119
quickly. So we do not want 300 to be
 

2137
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:11,349
quickly. So we do not want 300 to be
reclaimed.

2138
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:11,359

 

2139
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,470

So far so good.

2140
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:14,480
So far so good.
 

2141
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,150
So far so good.
They've been in at 40s now, which is

2142
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:16,160
They've been in at 40s now, which is
 

2143
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,510
They've been in at 40s now, which is
good. They're adding liquidity lower

2144
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:17,520
good. They're adding liquidity lower
 

2145
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,990
good. They're adding liquidity lower
than us at 40s. Come on, come down. Come

2146
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:20,000
than us at 40s. Come on, come down. Come
 

2147
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,430
than us at 40s. Come on, come down. Come

Come down. Wash them. Wash them. We need
 

2151
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,230
Come down. Wash them. Wash them. We need
to snap this here in the 80s where we

2152
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:26,240
to snap this here in the 80s where we
 

2153
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,910

look good. So, high time frame algo
 

2197
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,349
look good. So, high time frame algo
here. Uh, this is developing profile.

2198
00:56:01,349 --> 00:56:01,359
here. Uh, this is developing profile.
 

2199
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,430
here. Uh, this is developing profile.
This is discount on the week. All right.

2200
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:03,440
This is discount on the week. All right.
 

2201
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,630
This is discount on the week. All right.
So on the current week that's

2202
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:04,640
So on the current week that's
 

2203
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,990
So on the current week that's
developing. This this area here is

2204
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:06,000
developing. This this area here is
 

2205
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,349
developing. This this area here is
discount. Everything under that deep

2206
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:07,359
discount. Everything under that deep
 

2207
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,589
discount. Everything under that deep
discount. This is your gap fill. This is

2208
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:09,599
discount. This is your gap fill. This is
 

2209
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,589
discount. This is your gap fill. This is
previous days low. So these are like

2210
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:11,599
previous days low. So these are like
 

2211
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,470
previous days low. So these are like
sort of runner scenarios here.

2212
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:14,480
sort of runner scenarios here.
 

2213
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,549
sort of runner scenarios here.
I want this back above 303s just so I

2214
00:56:16,549 --> 00:56:16,559
I want this back above 303s just so I
 

2215
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:21,349
I want this back above 303s just so I
don't feel so [\h__\h]

00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:31,430

I was trapped at where are you saying at

2222
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:31,440
I was trapped at where are you saying at
 

2223
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,470
I was trapped at where are you saying at
34? No, 30 300 is currently the level

2224
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:34,480
34? No, 30 300 is currently the level
 

2225
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,109
34? No, 30 300 is currently the level
and then above that I would say 16 and

2226
00:56:37,109 --> 00:56:37,119
and then above that I would say 16 and
 

2227
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,870
and then above that I would say 16 and
20. Uh 34. No, not really. Nothing up

2228
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:40,880
20. Uh 34. No, not really. Nothing up
 

2229
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:46,470
20. Uh 34. No, not really. Nothing up
there. 300 and then 317 and 319 or 320

2230
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:46,480
there. 300 and then 317 and 319 or 320
 

2231
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,390
there. 300 and then 317 and 319 or 320
is what I'd be watching. Like this guy

2232
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:48,400
is what I'd be watching. Like this guy
 

2233
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,910
is what I'd be watching. Like this guy
here is the big guy that's stuck.

2234
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:49,920
here is the big guy that's stuck.
 

2235
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,349
here is the big guy that's stuck.
Remember when down here I said they're

2236
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:51,359
Remember when down here I said they're
 

2237
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,510
Remember when down here I said they're
piling in. And I piled in. Look who got

2238
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:53,520
piling in. And I piled in. Look who got
 

2239
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,349
piling in. And I piled in. Look who got
long up the up there. Some idiot that we

2240
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:55,359
long up the up there. Some idiot that we
 

2241
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,190
long up the up there. Some idiot that we
shorted into once we started leaving

2242
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:57,200
shorted into once we started leaving
 

2243
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,069
shorted into once we started leaving
30s. There's the short back down. We

2244
00:57:00,069 --> 00:57:00,079
30s. There's the short back down. We
 

2245
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:01,829
30s. There's the short back down. We
pushed through this by a couple of ticks

2246
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:01,839
pushed through this by a couple of ticks
 

2247
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:03,670
pushed through this by a couple of ticks
and take Alex out. And there's a chance

2248
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:03,680
and take Alex out. And there's a chance
 

2249
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,950
and take Alex out. And there's a chance
to expand lower now. Really good.

2250
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:06,960
to expand lower now. Really good.
 

2251
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,589
to expand lower now. Really good.
Looks really good.

2252
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:09,599
Looks really good.
 

2253
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,510
Looks really good.
Oh well, I would have way preferred the

2254
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:11,520
Oh well, I would have way preferred the
 

2255
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,589
Oh well, I would have way preferred the
higher day short. But you know what we

2256
00:57:13,589 --> 00:57:13,599
higher day short. But you know what we
 

2257
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,349
higher day short. But you know what we
did well there, folks? We ignored the

2258
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:15,359
did well there, folks? We ignored the
 

2259
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:17,589
did well there, folks? We ignored the
chop. All right, so thesis didn't come

2260
00:57:17,589 --> 00:57:17,599
chop. All right, so thesis didn't come
 

2261
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,670
chop. All right, so thesis didn't come
in. We wanted the short today above

2262
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:19,680
in. We wanted the short today above
 

2263
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,549
in. We wanted the short today above
here. All right, and we considered a

2264
00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:22,559
here. All right, and we considered a
 

2265
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,870
here. All right, and we considered a
long here if we didn't get that short,

2266
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:24,880
long here if we didn't get that short,
 

2267
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,190
long here if we didn't get that short,
but we did not set up the long here.

2268
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:27,200
but we did not set up the long here.
 

2269
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,990
but we did not set up the long here.
What we set up is liquidity being built

2270
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:30,000
What we set up is liquidity being built
 

2271
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,750
What we set up is liquidity being built
here. Everyone who bought this today

2272
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:31,760
here. Everyone who bought this today
 

2273
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,270
here. Everyone who bought this today
looking for that move got trapped. We

2274
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:33,280
looking for that move got trapped. We
 

2275
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,510
looking for that move got trapped. We
broke down. We don't let them out. Then

2276
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:35,520
broke down. We don't let them out. Then
 

2277
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,349
broke down. We don't let them out. Then
we play trend for continuation. All

2278
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:37,359
we play trend for continuation. All
 

2279
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:42,710
we play trend for continuation. All
right. So,

2280
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:42,720

 

2281
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,789

it requires patience, guys. Like it's

2282
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:44,799
it requires patience, guys. Like it's
 

2283
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:47,190
it requires patience, guys. Like it's
all this all the market requires is

2284
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:47,200
all this all the market requires is
 

2285
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,190
all this all the market requires is
patience and understanding. Let it do

2286
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:49,200
patience and understanding. Let it do
 

2287
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,589
patience and understanding. Let it do
this [\h__\h] Let it leave the area and

2288
00:57:51,589 --> 00:57:51,599
this [\h__\h] Let it leave the area and
 

2289
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,309
this [\h__\h] Let it leave the area and
then let it fail to reclaim for a

2290
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:54,319
then let it fail to reclaim for a
 

2291
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,150
then let it fail to reclaim for a
continuation.

2292
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:56,160
continuation.
 

2293
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,230
continuation.
Go short now. No, I wouldn't be going

you're you definitely in and around

2306
00:58:13,349 --> 00:58:13,359
you're you definitely in and around
 

2307
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,109
you're you definitely in and around
here. So, previous day value area low is

2308
00:58:15,109 --> 00:58:15,119
here. So, previous day value area low is
 

2309
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,990
here. So, previous day value area low is
one. I would say current week low 50s is

2310
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:18,000
one. I would say current week low 50s is
 

2311
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,270
one. I would say current week low 50s is
one. I would say 218s for previous day

2312
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:21,280
one. I would say 218s for previous day
 

2313
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,109
one. I would say 218s for previous day
close is one. I'd say previous day low

2314
00:58:23,109 --> 00:58:23,119
close is one. I'd say previous day low
 

2315
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:29,030
close is one. I'd say previous day low
at 200s is one. um underneath that

2316
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:29,040

 

2317
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,910

150 for that overnight swing point. You

2318
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:31,920
150 for that overnight swing point. You
 

2319
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,910
150 for that overnight swing point. You
know what? We get pretty thin as we

2320
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:33,920
know what? We get pretty thin as we
 

2321
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,710
know what? We get pretty thin as we
start getting under these 250s, guys.

2322
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:36,720
start getting under these 250s, guys.
 

2323
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,630
start getting under these 250s, guys.
I'll be honest with you,

2324
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:40,640

 

2325
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,270

underneath these 250s for this current

2326
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:43,280
underneath these 250s for this current
 

2327
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,150
underneath these 250s for this current
week, we actually get pretty thin. Look

2328
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:46,160
week, we actually get pretty thin. Look
 

2329
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,789
week, we actually get pretty thin. Look
at this Pshape.

2330
00:58:48,789 --> 00:58:48,799
at this Pshape.
 

2331
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,230
at this Pshape.
This is the current developing week

2332
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:50,240
This is the current developing week
 

2333
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,069
This is the current developing week
since Sunday open. If we get under this,

2334
00:58:52,069 --> 00:58:52,079
since Sunday open. If we get under this,
 

2335
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,150
since Sunday open. If we get under this,
we're pretty thin. I would be watching

2336
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:54,160
we're pretty thin. I would be watching
 

2337
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,789
we're pretty thin. I would be watching
this move here to 100 110s. I think this

2338
00:58:56,789 --> 00:58:56,799
this move here to 100 110s. I think this
 

2339
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:59,030
this move here to 100 110s. I think this
is possible here guys. I think that's

2340
00:58:59,030 --> 00:58:59,040
is possible here guys. I think that's
 

2341
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,549
is possible here guys. I think that's
possible right now. If you get under

2342
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:00,559
possible right now. If you get under
 

2343
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:03,910
possible right now. If you get under
250s you might get a runner to 110s

2344
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:03,920
250s you might get a runner to 110s
 

2345
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,789
250s you might get a runner to 110s
which means what? You would have got a

2346
00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:06,799
which means what? You would have got a
 

2347
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:16,150
which means what? You would have got a
huge winner up

2348
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:16,160

 

2349
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,910

watching 250s.

2350
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:19,920

 

2351
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,270

So, what's that? That's 80 points. And

2352
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:21,280
So, what's that? That's 80 points. And
 

2353
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,750
So, what's that? That's 80 points. And
if you lose this, I'd watch 110s.

2354
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:23,760
if you lose this, I'd watch 110s.
 

2355
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,910
if you lose this, I'd watch 110s.
Honestly, I think you can get down into

2356
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:25,920
Honestly, I think you can get down into

Honestly, I think you can get down into
somewhere down here.

2358
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:30,400

 

2359
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,789

[\h__\h] hell, mate.

do something stupid, right? When I

2414
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:48,000
do something stupid, right? When I
 

2415
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,309
do something stupid, right? When I
position well, if I know I'm not really

2416
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:50,319
position well, if I know I'm not really
 

2417
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:52,069
position well, if I know I'm not really
sharp right now, I can't be doing

2418
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:52,079
sharp right now, I can't be doing
 

2419
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,069
sharp right now, I can't be doing
something stupid like entering late,

2420
01:00:54,069 --> 01:00:54,079
something stupid like entering late,
 

2421
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,150
something stupid like entering late,
which there's more of a chance I do if I

2422
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:56,160
which there's more of a chance I do if I
 

2423
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:00,150
which there's more of a chance I do if I
don't feel like really on the money.

2424
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:00,160
don't feel like really on the money.
 

2425
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,470
don't feel like really on the money.
Nice info risk.

2426
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:04,480

 

2427
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,750

No, it's all good, guys. I'm not going

2428
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:05,760
No, it's all good, guys. I'm not going
 

2429
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,870
No, it's all good, guys. I'm not going
to end the stream now. I'll stay with

2430
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:06,880
to end the stream now. I'll stay with
 

2431
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,069
to end the stream now. I'll stay with
you for a bit. All right, gap now

2432
01:01:08,069 --> 01:01:08,079
you for a bit. All right, gap now
 

2433
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,390
you for a bit. All right, gap now
filled. Same on ES. That yellow line is

2434
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:10,400
filled. Same on ES. That yellow line is
 

2435
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,870
filled. Same on ES. That yellow line is
your cash gap. Same on ES. ES coming to

2436
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:12,880
your cash gap. Same on ES. ES coming to
 

2437
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,430
your cash gap. Same on ES. ES coming to
cash gap. So this is a big TP. Same on

2438
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:15,440
cash gap. So this is a big TP. Same on
 

2439
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,670
cash gap. So this is a big TP. Same on
SPY. Same on QQQ. So you're coming into

2440
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:17,680
SPY. Same on QQQ. So you're coming into
 

2441
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,190
SPY. Same on QQQ. So you're coming into
cash gap. The yellow line on your chart

2442
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:19,200
cash gap. The yellow line on your chart
 

2443
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,630
cash gap. The yellow line on your chart
is cash gap. If we get under there,

2444
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:20,640
is cash gap. If we get under there,
 

2445
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,150
is cash gap. If we get under there,
that's under the previous day close. So

2446
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:22,160
that's under the previous day close. So
 

2447
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,990
that's under the previous day close. So
cash gap now filled. You're now looking

2448
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:24,000
cash gap now filled. You're now looking
 

2449
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,910
cash gap now filled. You're now looking
at previous day low. And I would hold

2450
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:25,920
at previous day low. And I would hold
 

2451
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,510
at previous day low. And I would hold
runners for 110. I would take a big

2452
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:27,520
runners for 110. I would take a big
 

2453
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,670
runners for 110. I would take a big
chunk out here for the cash gap fill.

2454
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:29,680
chunk out here for the cash gap fill.
 

2455
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:41,190
chunk out here for the cash gap fill.
And I'd be looking for 110 now.

2456
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:41,200

 

2457

a bid there, where we think we might get

2466
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:51,760
a bid there, where we think we might get
 

2467
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,069
a bid there, where we think we might get
short? Remember at the start of the

2468
01:01:54,069 --> 01:01:54,079
short? Remember at the start of the
 

2469
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:59,589

2471
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,270

right above the blue level. And we said

2472
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:01,280
right above the blue level. And we said
 

2473
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,109
right above the blue level. And we said
if it comes into here and holds and

2474
01:02:03,109 --> 01:02:03,119
if it comes into here and holds and
 

2475
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,030
if it comes into here and holds and
rips, that will give good confluence for

2476
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:05,040
rips, that will give good confluence for
 

2477
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,390
rips, that will give good confluence for
the short. Well, there's the hold. It

2478
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:06,400
the short. Well, there's the hold. It
 

2479
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,829
the short. Well, there's the hold. It
didn't even get there. They were so

2480
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:07,839
didn't even get there. They were so
 

2481
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,069
didn't even get there. They were so
aggressive, which it would have been

2482
01:02:10,069 --> 01:02:10,079
aggressive, which it would have been
 

2483
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:12,789
aggressive, which it would have been
better if if we'd got to here, right?

2484
01:02:12,789 --> 01:02:12,799

2485
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:14,150
better if if we'd got to here, right?
Then the VIX would have got to the blue

2486
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:14,160
Then the VIX would have got to the blue
 

2487
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,829
Then the VIX would have got to the blue
box and we could have got short really

2488
01:02:15,829 --> 01:02:15,839
box and we could have got short really
 

2489
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,150
box and we could have got short really
really high on the day. It's just is

week. If you go to the previous week um
 

2529
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,990
week. If you go to the previous week um
volume profile, you will see a shelf

2530
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:06,000
volume profile, you will see a shelf
 

2531
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,710
volume profile, you will see a shelf
develop into that area. All right. If we

2532
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:08,720
develop into that area. All right. If we
 

2533
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,309

2537
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,230
said if we lose current week, remember
this is current week. We're very thin

2538
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:14,240
this is current week. We're very thin
 

2539
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,910
this is current week. We're very thin
under here. We can repric to here,

2540
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:17,920
under here. We can repric to here,
 

2541
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,750
under here. We can repric to here,
right? So we have overnight low there as

2542
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:19,760
right? So we have overnight low there as
 

2543
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,390
right? So we have overnight low there as
well. So 140 to 110's big level. But

2544
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:22,400
well. So 140 to 110's big level. But
 

2545
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,549
well. So 140 to 110's big level. But
this level here is what I'm looking at

2546
01:03:24,549 --> 01:03:24,559
this level here is what I'm looking at
 

2547
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:27,109
this level here is what I'm looking at
whether they find a bid on this shelf

2548
01:03:27,109 --> 01:03:27,119
whether they find a bid on this shelf
 

2549
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:28,390
whether they find a bid on this shelf
from the previous week. So if we think

2550
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:28,400
from the previous week. So if we think
 

2551
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:32,230
from the previous week. So if we think
about this pivot d pivot hold d we're

Like I said, you don't want this to rip

2626
01:04:50,789 --> 01:04:50,799
Like I said, you don't want this to rip
 

2627
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,630
Like I said, you don't want this to rip
your face all the way back up. Now, you

2628
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:52,640
your face all the way back up. Now, you
 

2629
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,910
your face all the way back up. Now, you
do not want this to rip your face all

2630
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:53,920
do not want this to rip your face all
 

2631
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:54,950
do not want this to rip your face all
the way back up. Now, they're going to

2632
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:54,960
the way back up. Now, they're going to
 

2633
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,789
the way back up. Now, they're going to
try and sell 190s at the moment. There's

2634
01:04:56,789 --> 01:04:56,799
try and sell 190s at the moment. There's
 

2635
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:58,870

a seller up there. 300 lot. He might

2636
01:04:58,870 --> 01:04:58,880
a seller up there. 300 lot. He might
 

2637
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,789
a seller up there. 300 lot. He might
spoof and lift. So, you got very close

2638
01:05:00,789 --> 01:05:00,799
spoof and lift. So, you got very close
 

2639

2677
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,230

01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,349
YouTube and see if anyone else does.
What happens if it was a long and you

2682
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:47,359
What happens if it was a long and you
 

2683
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,430
What happens if it was a long and you
thought it was a short and you went on I

2684
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:49,440
thought it was a short and you went on I
 

2685
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,870
thought it was a short and you went on I
don't know

2686
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:52,880

 

2687
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,549

you went on top [\h__\h] and they told you

2688
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:54,559
you went on top [\h__\h] and they told you
 

2689
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:59,670
you went on top [\h__\h] and they told you
full full port longs here.

2690
01:05:59,670 --> 01:05:59,680

 

2691
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,829

Can I please explain the cash gap? Uh

2692
01:06:01,829 --> 01:06:01,839
Can I please explain the cash gap? Uh
 

2693
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:04,549
Can I please explain the cash gap? Uh
yeah, it's the close of 4:00. So it's

2694
01:06:04,549 --> 01:06:04,559
yeah, it's the close of 4:00. So it's
 

2695
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:05,829
yeah, it's the close of 4:00. So it's
not the close that you would have in the

2696
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:05,839
not the close that you would have in the
 

2697
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:07,910
not the close that you would have in the
futures market at 5:00. It's the close

2698
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:07,920
futures market at 5:00. It's the close
 

2699
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,710
futures market at 5:00. It's the close
of 4:00. Why 4:00? 4:00 is when cash

2700
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:10,720
of 4:00. Why 4:00? 4:00 is when cash
 

2701
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,870
of 4:00. Why 4:00? 4:00 is when cash
finishes trading. All right. So we think

2702
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:12,880
finishes trading. All right. So we think
 

2703
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,270
finishes trading. All right. So we think
about 9:30 to 4:00. That is your New

2704
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:15,280
about 9:30 to 4:00. That is your New
 

2705
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,029
about 9:30 to 4:00. That is your New
York hours. So I care about those New

2706
01:06:17,029 --> 01:06:17,039
York hours. So I care about those New
 

2707
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,630
York hours. So I care about those New
York hours because that is when cash

2708
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:18,640
York hours because that is when cash
 

2709
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,829
York hours because that is when cash
trades. Same reason why I do my profile

2710
01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:21,839
trades. Same reason why I do my profile
 

2711
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:23,589
trades. Same reason why I do my profile
based on 9:30 to 4:00. For me,

2712
01:06:23,589 --> 01:06:23,599
based on 9:30 to 4:00. For me,
 

2713
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,190
based on 9:30 to 4:00. For me,
everything is based on cash where volume

2714
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:25,200
everything is based on cash where volume
 

2715
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:30,390
everything is based on cash where volume
is.

2716
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:30,400

 

2717
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,549

My initial plan was to buy 300 before I

My initial plan was to buy 300 before I
 

2723

2728
01:06:43,109 --> 01:06:43,119
was considering it, but like I said, the
 

2729
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:44,789
was considering it, but like I said, the
tape was really bad here. This is what

2730
01:06:44,789 --> 01:06:44,799
tape was really bad here. This is what
 

2731
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:47,750
tape was really bad here. This is what
this is an important lesson for you guys

2732
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:47,760
this is an important lesson for you guys
 

2733
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,990
this is an important lesson for you guys
is I was considering the buy here. I

2734
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:50,000
is I was considering the buy here. I
 

2735
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,990
is I was considering the buy here. I
said I'll be interested in a buy here if

2736
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:52,000
said I'll be interested in a buy here if
 

2737
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,029
said I'll be interested in a buy here if
I see what I like in here. I didn't see

2738
01:06:55,029 --> 01:06:55,039
I see what I like in here. I didn't see
 

2739
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:56,789
I see what I like in here. I didn't see
what I liked. I saw the opposite of what

2740
01:06:56,789 --> 01:06:56,799
what I liked. I saw the opposite of what
 

2741
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:59,190
what I liked. I saw the opposite of what
I like. I saw big buyers trying to buy

2742
01:06:59,190 --> 01:06:59,200
I like. I saw big buyers trying to buy
 

2743
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,470
I like. I saw big buyers trying to buy
it. You might think, well, why isn't

2744
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:00,480
it. You might think, well, why isn't
 

2745
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,309
it. You might think, well, why isn't
that what you like? What I want to see

2746
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:02,319
that what you like? What I want to see
 

2747
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:05,430
that what you like? What I want to see
is big sellers being absorbed by big

2748
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:05,440
is big sellers being absorbed by big
 

2749
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,190
is big sellers being absorbed by big
buyers. I want big aggressive sellers,

2750
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:07,200
buyers. I want big aggressive sellers,
 

2751
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,270
buyers. I want big aggressive sellers,
big passive buyers to try and do this

2752
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:09,280
big passive buyers to try and do this
 

2753
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,190
big passive buyers to try and do this
move. I do not want big market buyers

2754
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:11,200
move. I do not want big market buyers
 

2755
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,870
move. I do not want big market buyers
there. That is not a good sign. That is

2756
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:12,880
there. That is not a good sign. That is
 

2757
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,190
there. That is not a good sign. That is
a sign that we might well do this. All

2758
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:15,200
a sign that we might well do this. All
 

2759
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:20,069
a sign that we might well do this. All
right, 110s are on deck here, folks.

2760
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:20,079

 

2761
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,309

140 to 110s. So, I would pay yourself

2762
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:22,319
140 to 110s. So, I would pay yourself
 

2763
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:23,829
140 to 110s. So, I would pay yourself
here. You're developing a bit of a range

2764
01:07:23,829 --> 01:07:23,839
here. You're developing a bit of a range
 

2765
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:29,990
here. You're developing a bit of a range
here now.

2766
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:30,000

 

2767
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,309

You're so goated. Keep streaming. You're

2768
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:32,319
You're so goated. Keep streaming. You're
 

2769
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:34,789
You're so goated. Keep streaming. You're
paying my bills. That's nice. Good to

2770
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:34,799
paying my bills. That's nice. Good to
 

2771
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:37,430
paying my bills. That's nice. Good to
know. How would I classify the setup

2772
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:37,440
know. How would I classify the setup
 

2773
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,109
know. How would I classify the setup
based on what riskreward or what do you

2774
01:07:41,109 --> 01:07:41,119
based on what riskreward or what do you
 

2775
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:44,309
based on what riskreward or what do you
mean with VP? How would you classify a

2776
01:07:44,309 --> 01:07:44,319
mean with VP? How would you classify a
 

2777
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:45,990
mean with VP? How would you classify a
setup based on I'm not sure what you're

2778
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:46,000
setup based on I'm not sure what you're
 

2779
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,710
setup based on I'm not sure what you're
asking there. Um maybe just maybe I'm

2780
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:48,720
asking there. Um maybe just maybe I'm
 

2781
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,270
asking there. Um maybe just maybe I'm
just not understanding. I'm sorry. Feel

2782
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:51,280
just not understanding. I'm sorry. Feel
 

2783
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:57,190
just not understanding. I'm sorry. Feel
feel free to rewrite it for me.

2784
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:57,200

 

2785
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,270

I can't say how much I've learned from

2786
01:07:59,270 --> 01:07:59,280
I can't say how much I've learned from
 

2787
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,470

Here's the tens. We're going to get

2814
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:33,120
Here's the tens. We're going to get
 

2815
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,590
Here's the tens. We're going to get
these tens hopefully. Do not want a fail

2816
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:35,600
these tens hopefully. Do not want a fail
 

2817
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,789
these tens hopefully. Do not want a fail
breakdown here. There's a big seller

2818
01:08:36,789 --> 01:08:36,799
breakdown here. There's a big seller
 

2819
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:38,309
breakdown here. There's a big seller
stepping in these lows. Uh they are

2820
01:08:38,309 --> 01:08:38,319
stepping in these lows. Uh they are
 

2821
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:41,030
stepping in these lows. Uh they are
bidding at 25. We have an old node at

2822
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:41,040
bidding at 25. We have an old node at
 

2823
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,669
bidding at 25. We have an old node at
20. We should get tens. But just like

2824
01:08:43,669 --> 01:08:43,679
20. We should get tens. But just like
 

2825
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:45,669
20. We should get tens. But just like
the gray box is a big cover point for

2826
01:08:45,669 --> 01:08:45,679
the gray box is a big cover point for
 

2827
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:47,910
the gray box is a big cover point for
me. So I'd be paying yourself a lot into

2828
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:47,920
me. So I'd be paying yourself a lot into
 

2829
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,749
me. So I'd be paying yourself a lot into
here. If you get lucky, you could look

2830
01:08:49,749 --> 01:08:49,759
here. If you get lucky, you could look
 

2831
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:52,470
here. If you get lucky, you could look
for this. But I would really I'm not

2832
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:52,480
for this. But I would really I'm not
 

2833
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,229
for this. But I would really I'm not
convinced we go too much lower than

2834
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:54,239
convinced we go too much lower than
 

2835
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:57,030
convinced we go too much lower than
this. If we do go a lot lower than this,

2836
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:57,040
this. If we do go a lot lower than this,
 

2837
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,709
this. If we do go a lot lower than this,
then it's possible if they want to do a

2838
01:08:58,709 --> 01:08:58,719
then it's possible if they want to do a
 

2839
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,229
then it's possible if they want to do a
big shakeout, we're going to go to

2840
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:00,239
big shakeout, we're going to go to
 

2841
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:02,070
big shakeout, we're going to go to
24,800.

2842
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:02,080
24,800.
 

2843
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,829
24,800.
I would rather they save that for

2844
01:09:03,829 --> 01:09:03,839
I would rather they save that for
 

2845
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,829
I would rather they save that for
tomorrow for me when I hopefully feel a

2846
01:09:05,829 --> 01:09:05,839
tomorrow for me when I hopefully feel a
 

2847
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:15,110
tomorrow for me when I hopefully feel a
little bit better.

2848
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:15,120

 

2849
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,269

Plus 4K. I could hug you, Alex. Nice,

2850

Yeah, tricky start of market today.
 

2855
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,590
Yeah, tricky start of market today.

Yeah, it was. It was very tricky. Thank
 

2857
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,269
Yeah, it was. It was very tricky. Thank
you for your daily analysis, Alex. Can

2858
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:25,279
you for your daily analysis, Alex. Can
 

2859
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:29,510
you for your daily analysis, Alex. Can
we catch another move on the way?

2860
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:29,520
we catch another move on the way?
 

2861
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,550
we catch another move on the way?
Can we catch another move? Uh may look

2862
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:32,560
Can we catch another move? Uh may look
 

2863
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,470
Can we catch another move? Uh may look
maybe there's a bid back up but we have

2864
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:34,480
maybe there's a bid back up but we have
 

2865
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,349
maybe there's a bid back up but we have
to be aware we are now leaving volume.

2866
01:09:37,349 --> 01:09:37,359
to be aware we are now leaving volume.
 

2867
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:38,950
to be aware we are now leaving volume.
All right this is the kind of play that

2868
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:38,960
All right this is the kind of play that
 

2869
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,709
All right this is the kind of play that
we talk about when we leave volume it

2870
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:40,719
we talk about when we leave volume it
 

2871
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:41,990
we talk about when we leave volume it
can get aggressive. We're going to be

2872
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:42,000
can get aggressive. We're going to be
 

2873
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,829
can get aggressive. We're going to be
stuck between two areas. So current

2874
01:09:43,829 --> 01:09:43,839
stuck between two areas. So current
 

2875
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:45,749
stuck between two areas. So current
week's volume right we're leaving

2876
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:45,759
week's volume right we're leaving
 

2877
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:47,189
week's volume right we're leaving
current week's volume. All right if

2878
01:09:47,189 --> 01:09:47,199
current week's volume. All right if
 

2879
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:48,149
current week's volume. All right if
we're leaving this we can get

2880
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:48,159
we're leaving this we can get
 

2881
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,470
we're leaving this we can get
aggressive. We have to respect this guy

2882
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:50,480
aggressive. We have to respect this guy
 

2883
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,470
aggressive. We have to respect this guy
and this guy here. So our cover points

2884
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:52,480
and this guy here. So our cover points
 

2885
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:56,070
and this guy here. So our cover points
are this guy and this guy here. Maybe we

2886
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:56,080
are this guy and this guy here. Maybe we
 

2887
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,270
are this guy and this guy here. Maybe we
get follow through. We're going to have

2888
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:57,280
get follow through. We're going to have
 

2889
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,950
get follow through. We're going to have
to wait and see if that we're going to

2890
01:09:58,950 --> 01:09:58,960
to wait and see if that we're going to
 

2891
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,270
to wait and see if that we're going to
do this move now. or if they're going to

2892
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:01,280
do this move now. or if they're going to
 

2893
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,990
do this move now. or if they're going to
save it for later in the week. But I

2894
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:04,000
save it for later in the week. But I
 

2895
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,229
save it for later in the week. But I
would say your edge has gone now unless

2896
01:10:06,229 --> 01:10:06,239
would say your edge has gone now unless
 

2897
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:08,310
would say your edge has gone now unless
we start rejecting all this. If we start

2898
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:08,320
we start rejecting all this. If we start
 

2899
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,229
we start rejecting all this. If we start
rejecting these nodes, we can look for a

2900
01:10:10,229 --> 01:10:10,239
rejecting these nodes, we can look for a
 

2901
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,310
rejecting these nodes, we can look for a
new trade down. I wouldn't be looking

2902
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:12,320
new trade down. I wouldn't be looking
 

2903
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,630
new trade down. I wouldn't be looking
for a new trade down unless we like take

2904
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:14,640
for a new trade down unless we like take
 

2905
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,470
for a new trade down unless we like take
out liquidity, develop liquidity, and

2906
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:16,480

Alex, genuine question. Is order flow
and footprint equally effective for

3194
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:40,960
and footprint equally effective for
 

3195
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,030
and footprint equally effective for
London session also. Yeah, it's the same

3196
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:43,040
London session also. Yeah, it's the same
 

3197
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,310
London session also. Yeah, it's the same
thing for all the sessions. Obviously,

3198
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:44,320
thing for all the sessions. Obviously,
 

3199
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,149
thing for all the sessions. Obviously,
you have less volume, but you'd be

3200
01:16:46,149 --> 01:16:46,159
you have less volume, but you'd be
 

3201
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:47,350
you have less volume, but you'd be
looking at the same kind of things,

3202
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:47,360
looking at the same kind of things,
 

3203
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,510
looking at the same kind of things,
right? So, be looking at if I was

3204
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:49,520
right? So, be looking at if I was
 

3205
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,870
right? So, be looking at if I was
trading London, I would have be looking

3206
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:50,880
trading London, I would have be looking
 

3207
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,870
trading London, I would have be looking
at the previous day and the current day.

3208
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:52,880
at the previous day and the current day.
 

3209
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,630
at the previous day and the current day.
So the current day if I was trading

3210
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:54,640
So the current day if I was trading
 

3211
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,790
So the current day if I was trading
London is I'll be looking at Asia. Where

3212
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:56,800
London is I'll be looking at Asia. Where
 

3213
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,870
London is I'll be looking at Asia. Where

01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:19,430
No, I put him on timeout. Don't worry,
guys. What do I think about ICT if I

3368
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:19,440
guys. What do I think about ICT if I
 

3369
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,270
guys. What do I think about ICT if I
pass test? What do you mean if you pass

3370
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:21,280
pass test? What do you mean if you pass
 

3371
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,270
pass test? What do you mean if you pass
test?

3372
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:23,280
test?
 

3373
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,709
test?
Look, I will say this and I say it

3374
01:20:24,709 --> 01:20:24,719
Look, I will say this and I say it
 

3375
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,110
Look, I will say this and I say it
clearly. Some of ICT's teachings are

3376
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:27,120
clearly. Some of ICT's teachings are
 

3377
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,550
clearly. Some of ICT's teachings are
very good. They are not all his own.

3378
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:28,560
very good. They are not all his own.
 

3379
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,310
very good. They are not all his own.
They are regurgitated of others

3380
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:30,320
They are regurgitated of others
 

3381
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:33,430
They are regurgitated of others
teachings. But I do think he has made

3382
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:33,440
teachings. But I do think he has made
 

3383
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,470
teachings. But I do think he has made
models, let's say, which people can

3384
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:36,480
models, let's say, which people can
 

3385
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,310
models, let's say, which people can
understand and digest. Do I think

3386
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:38,320
understand and digest. Do I think
 

3387
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,149
understand and digest. Do I think
everything he says is truthful? No,

3388
01:20:40,149 --> 01:20:40,159
everything he says is truthful? No,
 

3389
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:41,910
everything he says is truthful? No,
absolutely not. Does he make the

3390
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:41,920
absolutely not. Does he make the
 

3391
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,070
absolutely not. Does he make the
algorithm? No. Is there one centralized

3392
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:44,080
algorithm? No. Is there one centralized
 

3393
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:45,990
algorithm? No. Is there one centralized
algorithm? No. Other than liquidity

3394
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:46,000
algorithm? No. Other than liquidity
 

3395
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,229
algorithm? No. Other than liquidity
provider, there isn't. Does he lie about

3396
01:20:48,229 --> 01:20:48,239
provider, there isn't. Does he lie about
 

3397
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,070
provider, there isn't. Does he lie about
a lot of things? Yes. Is he a compulsive

3398
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:50,080
a lot of things? Yes. Is he a compulsive
 

3399
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,310
a lot of things? Yes. Is he a compulsive
liar? Yes. Did he speak to God? I doubt

3400
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:52,320
liar? Yes. Did he speak to God? I doubt
 

3401
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,390
liar? Yes. Did he speak to God? I doubt
it. Did he get kidnapped in a white van?

3402
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:54,400
it. Did he get kidnapped in a white van?
 

3403
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,590
it. Did he get kidnapped in a white van?
I doubt it. But can it help you be a

3404
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:57,600
I doubt it. But can it help you be a
 

3405
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:02,790
I doubt it. But can it help you be a
better trader? Yeah, probably.

3406
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:02,800

 

3407
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,310

You claim you're a trader yet you can't

3408
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:04,320
You claim you're a trader yet you can't
 

3409
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,070
You claim you're a trader yet you can't
make a single profitable trade for me.

3410
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:06,080
make a single profitable trade for me.
 

3411
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,630
make a single profitable trade for me.
I'm down 1,700.

3412
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:08,640
I'm down 1,700.
 

3413
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,830
I'm down 1,700.
What are you talking about?

3414
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:11,840
What are you talking about?
 

3415
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,470
What are you talking about?
Sorry. If you've lost money, that is on

Sorry. If you've lost money, that is on
 

3417
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,189
Sorry. If you've lost money, that is on
you. I have not called one trade which

3418
01:21:17,189 --> 01:21:17,199
you. I have not called one trade which
 

3419
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:20,149
you. I have not called one trade which
hasn't worked on stream today.

3420
01:21:20,149 --> 01:21:20,159
hasn't worked on stream today.
 

3421
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:22,630
hasn't worked on stream today.
That is on you, mate. That is literally

3422
01:21:22,630 --> 01:21:22,640
That is on you, mate. That is literally
 

3423
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:25,510
That is on you, mate. That is literally
on you. you and you will never be

3424
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:25,520
on you. you and you will never be
 

3425
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,030
on you. you and you will never be
successful until you change that

3426
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:27,040
successful until you change that
 

3427
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,470
successful until you change that
attitude because you will look for

3428
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:28,480
attitude because you will look for
 

3429
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:31,110
attitude because you will look for
excuses of why everyone else is making

3430
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:31,120
excuses of why everyone else is making
 

3431
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,350
excuses of why everyone else is making
you lose money instead of realizing that

3432
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:33,360
you lose money instead of realizing that
 

3433
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:37,750
you lose money instead of realizing that
it's you who can't trade. That's a fact.

3434
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:37,760
it's you who can't trade. That's a fact.
 

3435
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,229
it's you who can't trade. That's a fact.
So the best thing about trading is it

3436
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:40,239
So the best thing about trading is it
 

3437
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:41,830
So the best thing about trading is it
will show you the worst parts of

3438
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:41,840

yourself as an individual. It will show

3440
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:43,520
yourself as an individual. It will show
 

3441
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:47,030
yourself as an individual. It will show
you your greed, your fear, your ego and

3442
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:47,040
you your greed, your fear, your ego and
 

3443
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,149
you your greed, your fear, your ego and
you my friend have all three of those by

3444
01:21:50,149 --> 01:21:50,159
you my friend have all three of those by
 

3445
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:52,149
you my friend have all three of those by
writing something like that. And that is

3446
01:21:52,149 --> 01:21:52,159
writing something like that. And that is
 

3447
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:53,990
writing something like that. And that is
a fact. And until you can look at

3448
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:54,000
a fact. And until you can look at
 

3449
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,070
a fact. And until you can look at
yourself in the mirror and journal and

3450
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:56,080
yourself in the mirror and journal and
 

3451
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,390
yourself in the mirror and journal and
get rid of those things, you will never

3452
01:21:58,390 --> 01:21:58,400
get rid of those things, you will never
 

3453
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,709
get rid of those things, you will never
ever have success trading. If you're

3454
01:22:00,709 --> 01:22:00,719
ever have success trading. If you're
 

3455
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:02,629
ever have success trading. If you're
going to blame everyone else, it won't

3456
01:22:02,629 --> 01:22:02,639
going to blame everyone else, it won't
 

3457
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:05,590
going to blame everyone else, it won't
happen. And that's not me being harsh.

3458
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:05,600
happen. And that's not me being harsh.
 

3459
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,310
happen. And that's not me being harsh.
I've been you, mate. I've been in rooms

3460
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:08,320
I've been you, mate. I've been in rooms

I didn't get the 200 point winner. I got
 

3473

01:22:44,229 --> 01:22:44,239

 

3481
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:53,669

My goodness. My goodness.

3482
01:22:53,669 --> 01:22:53,679

 

3483

Ah, it's wild, man. I ask for some peace

3484
01:22:56,629 --> 01:22:56,639
Ah, it's wild, man. I ask for some peace
 

3485

in chat today after what I'm going

3486
01:22:57,990 --> 01:22:58,000
in chat today after what I'm going
 

3487
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:12,790
in chat today after what I'm going
through and this is what I get.

3488
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:12,800

 

3489
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,149

Time to leave the trade. Yeah, I would

3490
01:23:14,149 --> 01:23:14,159
Time to leave the trade. Yeah, I would
 

3491
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:15,510
Time to leave the trade. Yeah, I would
say so. Unless you're short from down

3492
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:15,520
say so. Unless you're short from down
 

3493
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,790
say so. Unless you're short from down
here and you're going to look for the

3494
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:16,800
here and you're going to look for the
 

3495
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,830
here and you're going to look for the
whole swing. If you're if if you're

3496
01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:19,840
whole swing. If you're if if you're
 

3497
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,270
whole swing. If you're if if you're
short from up here and you're looking

3498
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:21,280
short from up here and you're looking
 

3499
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,590
short from up here and you're looking
for the whole swing, but like we have

3500
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:23,600
for the whole swing, but like we have
 

3501
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,709
for the whole swing, but like we have
now developed we are developing here,

3502
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:26,719
now developed we are developing here,
 

3503
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:28,790
now developed we are developing here,
right? So they will build liquidity out

3504
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:28,800
right? So they will build liquidity out
 

3505
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:29,910
right? So they will build liquidity out
here. I don't think they're done with

3506
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:29,920
here. I don't think they're done with
 

3507
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,350
here. I don't think they're done with
it, but they will build out here. It

3508
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:31,360
it, but they will build out here. It
 

3509
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,790
it, but they will build out here. It
really depends how much you're willing

3510
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:32,800
really depends how much you're willing
 

3511
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,790
really depends how much you're willing
to give back. Are you willing to sit in

3512
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:34,800
to give back. Are you willing to sit in
 

3513
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,030
to give back. Are you willing to sit in
100 points giving back? All right. And

3514
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:37,040
100 points giving back? All right. And
 

3515
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,350
100 points giving back? All right. And
then look for the bigger swipe down into

3516
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:39,360
then look for the bigger swipe down into
 

3517
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,910
then look for the bigger swipe down into
here. It's that's the question. That is

3518
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:41,920
here. It's that's the question. That is
 

3519
01:23:41,920 --> 01:24:00,629
here. It's that's the question. That is
up to you to manage.

3520
01:24:00,629 --> 01:24:00,639

 

3521
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:02,390

Yeah, I know. Someone emailed me that

3522
01:24:02,390 --> 01:24:02,400
Yeah, I know. Someone emailed me that
 

3523
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,709
Yeah, I know. Someone emailed me that
yesterday. I might go members only. I do

3524
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:04,719
yesterday. I might go members only. I do
 

3525
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:06,470
yesterday. I might go members only. I do
subs only. I might have to start doing

3526
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:06,480
subs only. I might have to start doing
 

3527
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,229
subs only. I might have to start doing
members only in chat because it is

3528
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:08,239
members only in chat because it is
 

3529
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:23,669
members only in chat because it is
getting ridiculous.

3530
01:24:23,669 --> 01:24:23,679

 

3531
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:25,990

VIX catching a

3532
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:26,000
VIX catching a
 

3533
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,910
VIX catching a
VIX is trading between two blocks. So

3534
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:27,920
VIX is trading between two blocks. So
 

3535
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:29,990
VIX is trading between two blocks. So
VIX just failed that 19 test. All right.

3536
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:30,000
VIX just failed that 19 test. All right.
 

3537
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,110
VIX just failed that 19 test. All right.
And it's going to come back and test

3538
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:31,120
And it's going to come back and test
 

3539
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,910
And it's going to come back and test
towards 1836s. Uh and it will need to

3540
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:33,920
towards 1836s. Uh and it will need to
 

3541
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,870
towards 1836s. Uh and it will need to
catch a bid between 1836s and 1813. If

3542
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:36,880
catch a bid between 1836s and 1813. If
 

3543
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,550
catch a bid between 1836s and 1813. If
it does that, we have a huge inverse

3544
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:38,560
it does that, we have a huge inverse
 

3545
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,070
it does that, we have a huge inverse
head and shoulders developing on VIX

3546
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:40,080
head and shoulders developing on VIX
 

3547
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,310
head and shoulders developing on VIX
with a fail break lower. a very very

3548
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:42,320
with a fail break lower. a very very
 

3549
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,470
with a fail break lower. a very very
good bear trap on Vicks and if they

3550
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:44,480
good bear trap on Vicks and if they
 

3551
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,229
good bear trap on Vicks and if they
catch this bid they can run it higher on

3552
01:24:46,229 --> 01:24:46,239
catch this bid they can run it higher on
 

3553
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:51,030
catch this bid they can run it higher on
Vicks.

3554
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:51,040

 

3555
01:24:51,040 --> 01:25:04,550

Welcome to the team Frosty.

3557
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:05,750

Where can they get volume node

3558
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:05,760
Where can they get volume node
 

3559
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,830
Where can they get volume node
indicator? This is okay. I'll do it the

3560
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:07,840
indicator? This is okay. I'll do it the
 

3561
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:08,870
indicator? This is okay. I'll do it the
one time today. It's the only time I'm

3591
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:55,990

Yeah, I know, James. That's why I

3592
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:56,000
Yeah, I know, James. That's why I
 

3593
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,629
Yeah, I know, James. That's why I
haven't done it yet. But it's um it is

3594
01:25:58,629 --> 01:25:58,639
haven't done it yet. But it's um it is
 

3595
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:02,149
haven't done it yet. But it's um it is
uh it is tough. Anton, bro, you're the

3596
01:26:02,149 --> 01:26:02,159
uh it is tough. Anton, bro, you're the
 

3597
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:04,950
uh it is tough. Anton, bro, you're the
best. I went over my 53,000, my apex

3598
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:04,960
best. I went over my 53,000, my apex
 

3599
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,790
best. I went over my 53,000, my apex
with your help today. Thank you, bro.

3600
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:08,800
with your help today. Thank you, bro.
 

3601
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,629
with your help today. Thank you, bro.
Yes. Okay. Go. You asked for gold and

3602
01:26:10,629 --> 01:26:10,639
Yes. Okay. Go. You asked for gold and
 

3603
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:13,030
Yes. Okay. Go. You asked for gold and
silver. All right. Let's have a look at

3604
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:13,040
silver. All right. Let's have a look at
 

3605
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:18,550
silver. All right. Let's have a look at
gold and silver for you guys.

3606
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:18,560

 

3607
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,470

All right. Nice bid on gold off this key

3608
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:20,480
All right. Nice bid on gold off this key
 

3609
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,270
All right. Nice bid on gold off this key
level. I would be very careful. Failed

3610
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:23,280
level. I would be very careful. Failed
 

3611
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,590
level. I would be very careful. Failed
follow through still. Let me just clean

3612
01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:25,600
follow through still. Let me just clean
 

3613
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,870
follow through still. Let me just clean
this up so I can see the high.

3614
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:28,880
this up so I can see the high.
 

3615
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,590
this up so I can see the high.
But it is a hedge to dollar.

3616
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:31,600
But it is a hedge to dollar.
 

3617
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,950
But it is a hedge to dollar.
I wouldn't be trading silver the same

3618
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:32,960
I wouldn't be trading silver the same
 

3619
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,470
I wouldn't be trading silver the same
way as gold. If one's got a chance of

3620
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:34,480
way as gold. If one's got a chance of
 

3621
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,229
way as gold. If one's got a chance of
going, it's going to be gold. All right.

3622
01:26:36,229 --> 01:26:36,239
going, it's going to be gold. All right.
 

3623
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,870
going, it's going to be gold. All right.
So we're failing 61 fib. All right. So

3624
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:38,880
So we're failing 61 fib. All right. So
 

3625
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,950
So we're failing 61 fib. All right. So
your pullback was very clearly into this

3626
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:40,960
your pullback was very clearly into this
 

3627
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,870
your pullback was very clearly into this
key level. If we think about very very

3628
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:42,880
key level. If we think about very very
 

3629
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,030
key level. If we think about very very
basic principles, right? We're breaking

3630
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:45,040
basic principles, right? We're breaking
 

3631
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:48,149
basic principles, right? We're breaking
out, pull back, build liquidity, build

3632
01:26:48,149 --> 01:26:48,159
out, pull back, build liquidity, build
 

3633
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:52,310
out, pull back, build liquidity, build
liquidity, break out, retest,

3634
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:52,320
liquidity, break out, retest,
 

3635
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:55,189
liquidity, break out, retest,
and go. Massive wash into what? This

3636
01:26:55,189 --> 01:26:55,199
and go. Massive wash into what? This
 

3637
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:56,950
and go. Massive wash into what? This
area here where we broke out from. All

3638
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:56,960
area here where we broke out from. All
 

3639
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,790
area here where we broke out from. All
right. So we expect a first bounce from

3640
01:26:58,790 --> 01:26:58,800
right. So we expect a first bounce from
 

3641
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,030
right. So we expect a first bounce from
there. Where have we come up to? 61. All

3642
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:01,040
there. Where have we come up to? 61. All
 

3643
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:05,750
there. Where have we come up to? 61. All
right. If we fail 61 fib or anywhere

3644
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:05,760
right. If we fail 61 fib or anywhere
 

3645
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,430
right. If we fail 61 fib or anywhere
around here and I will put some volume

3646
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:07,440
around here and I will put some volume
 

3647
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,510
around here and I will put some volume
on shortly, we will start doing moves

3648
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:09,520
on shortly, we will start doing moves
 

3649
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,950
on shortly, we will start doing moves
like this for a bit while it builds

3650
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:10,960
like this for a bit while it builds
 

3651
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,110
like this for a bit while it builds
liquidity. If we fail this shelf, then

3652
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:13,120
liquidity. If we fail this shelf, then
 

3653
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,189
liquidity. If we fail this shelf, then
that's when you'll get extension down.

3654
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:15,199
that's when you'll get extension down.
 

3655
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:17,030
that's when you'll get extension down.
Until that point, we don't need to be

3656
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:17,040
Until that point, we don't need to be
 

3657
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,870
Until that point, we don't need to be
uber bearish because it might be that it

3658
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:18,880
uber bearish because it might be that it
 

3659
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,390
uber bearish because it might be that it
wants to reclaim and hold. Let's just

3660
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:20,400
wants to reclaim and hold. Let's just
 

3661
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:26,310
wants to reclaim and hold. Let's just
have a quick look.

3662
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:26,320

 

3663
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,070

Okay, so you can see even here, look at

3664
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:28,080
Okay, so you can see even here, look at
 

3665
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:29,430
Okay, so you can see even here, look at
the node that held. That's why I had the

3666
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:29,440
the node that held. That's why I had the
 

3667
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,950
the node that held. That's why I had the
gray box there. So, we dipped in front

3668
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:30,960
gray box there. So, we dipped in front
 

3669
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,270
gray box there. So, we dipped in front
of that node. We've reclaimed we're

3670
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:33,280
of that node. We've reclaimed we're
 

3671
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:37,030
of that node. We've reclaimed we're
very, very thin here above 27s, aren't

3672
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:37,040
very, very thin here above 27s, aren't
 

3673
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,390
very, very thin here above 27s, aren't
we? All right. So, bears will want to

3674
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:40,400
we? All right. So, bears will want to
 

3675
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,270
we? All right. So, bears will want to
protect this because that means bulls

3676
01:27:43,270 --> 01:27:43,280
protect this because that means bulls
 

3677
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,750
protect this because that means bulls
are all caught up here. All right. So,

3678
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:45,760
are all caught up here. All right. So,
 

3679
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:48,310
are all caught up here. All right. So,
it's a 61 and it's volume. All right.

3680
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:48,320
it's a 61 and it's volume. All right.
 

3681
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,750
it's a 61 and it's volume. All right.
So, I would be sure I would be

3682
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:49,760
So, I would be sure I would be
 

3683
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,830
So, I would be sure I would be
positioning short against that. All

3684
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:51,840
positioning short against that. All
 

3685
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,189
positioning short against that. All
right. I'd be looking for a short

3686
01:27:53,189 --> 01:27:53,199
right. I'd be looking for a short
 

3687
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:55,350
right. I'd be looking for a short
against that for a rotation, taking

3688
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:55,360
against that for a rotation, taking
 

3689
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,510
against that for a rotation, taking
profits on the way down and waiting to

3690
01:27:57,510 --> 01:27:57,520
profits on the way down and waiting to
 

3691
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,390
profits on the way down and waiting to
see is this failed follow-through. All

3692
01:28:00,390 --> 01:28:00,400
see is this failed follow-through. All
 

3693
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,910
see is this failed follow-through. All
right, but I would be paying myself

3694
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:01,920
right, but I would be paying myself
 

3695
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,990
right, but I would be paying myself
here. What I would not be doing is

3696
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:04,000
here. What I would not be doing is
 

3697
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,550
here. What I would not be doing is
positioning myself long into it. If

3698
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:06,560
positioning myself long into it. If
 

3699
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,149
positioning myself long into it. If
you're going to get long now and you

3700
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:08,159
you're going to get long now and you
 

3701
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:09,430
you're going to get long now and you
haven't got a pullback, you are going to

3702
01:28:09,430 --> 01:28:09,440
haven't got a pullback, you are going to
 

3703
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,430
haven't got a pullback, you are going to
need to wait for it to base and hold

3704
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:11,440
need to wait for it to base and hold
 

3705
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,149
need to wait for it to base and hold
above this shelf to offer that back up.

3706
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:14,159
above this shelf to offer that back up.
 

3707
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:17,590
above this shelf to offer that back up.
All right, hopefully that helps. And I

3708
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:17,600
All right, hopefully that helps. And I
 

3709
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,629
All right, hopefully that helps. And I
will look at silver as well. Silver will

3710
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:20,639
will look at silver as well. Silver will
 

3711
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:22,950
will look at silver as well. Silver will
not be as good, I'm telling you, because

3712
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:22,960
not be as good, I'm telling you, because
 

3713
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:24,790
not be as good, I'm telling you, because
it is not a hedge. It's way

3714
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:24,800
it is not a hedge. It's way
 

3715
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,950
it is not a hedge. It's way
overextended.

3716
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:26,960
overextended.
 

3717
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,910
overextended.
There you go. So, silver, same kind of

3718
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:29,920
There you go. So, silver, same kind of
 

3719
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:34,870
There you go. So, silver, same kind of
story.

3720
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:34,880

 

3721
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,030

Failing to reclaim shelf. All right, if

3722
01:28:37,030 --> 01:28:37,040
Failing to reclaim shelf. All right, if
 

3723
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:45,510
Failing to reclaim shelf. All right, if
we just put shelf on,

3724
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:45,520

 

3725
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,430

first bounce was sold into, which is

3726
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:47,440
first bounce was sold into, which is
 

3727
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,990
first bounce was sold into, which is
your typical failed followrough. So high

3728
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:50,000
your typical failed followrough. So high
 

3729
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,790
your typical failed followrough. So high
to low. We came into shelf. They sold

3730
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:52,800
to low. We came into shelf. They sold
 

3731
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,390
to low. We came into shelf. They sold
the shelf. Same thing as I just talked

3732
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:54,400
the shelf. Same thing as I just talked
 

3733
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,750
the shelf. Same thing as I just talked
about on gold. What they might do in

3734
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:55,760
about on gold. What they might do in
 

3735
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,910
about on gold. What they might do in
gold. They've resold this shelf. We've

3736
01:28:57,910 --> 01:28:57,920
gold. They've resold this shelf. We've
 

3737
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,149
gold. They've resold this shelf. We've
broken down for a new low here. All

3738
01:29:00,149 --> 01:29:00,159
broken down for a new low here. All
 

3739
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:02,790
broken down for a new low here. All
right. And we found a bid right into

3740
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:02,800
right. And we found a bid right into
 

3741
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,750
right. And we found a bid right into
here, this node here. If they fail again

3742
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:05,760
here, this node here. If they fail again
 

3743
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,350
here, this node here. If they fail again
up here, then there might be follow

3744
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:07,360
up here, then there might be follow
 

3745
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,950
up here, then there might be follow
through and a collapse down into the

3746
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:08,960
through and a collapse down into the
 

3747
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,790
through and a collapse down into the
next nodes. All right. If they reclaim

3748
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:10,800
next nodes. All right. If they reclaim
 

3749
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,870
next nodes. All right. If they reclaim
this shelf, then there's a chance of a

3750
01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:12,880
this shelf, then there's a chance of a
 

3751
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,390
this shelf, then there's a chance of a
squeeze.

3752
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:14,400
squeeze.
 

3753
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,629
squeeze.
Same story. It's exactly the same setup,

3754
01:29:16,629 --> 01:29:16,639
Same story. It's exactly the same setup,
 

3755
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:19,990
Same story. It's exactly the same setup,
but silver is not a good hedge in the

3756
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:20,000
but silver is not a good hedge in the
 

3757
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,149
but silver is not a good hedge in the
market to dollar. And this move is

3758
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:22,159
market to dollar. And this move is
 

3759
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:25,590
market to dollar. And this move is
[\h__\h] stupid. All right, this move is

3760
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:25,600
[\h__\h] stupid. All right, this move is
 

3761
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:41,270
[\h__\h] stupid. All right, this move is
not the same. This is ridiculous.

3762
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:41,280

 

3763
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:44,229

310% ripper

3764
01:29:44,229 --> 01:29:44,239
310% ripper
 

3765
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:47,830
310% ripper
since March. No, mate. Unsustainable.

3766
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:47,840
since March. No, mate. Unsustainable.
 

3767
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:51,110
since March. No, mate. Unsustainable.
Parabolic. It's like a small cap.

3768
01:29:51,110 --> 01:29:51,120
Parabolic. It's like a small cap.
 

3769
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:54,709
Parabolic. It's like a small cap.
Parabolic.

3770
01:29:54,709 --> 01:29:54,719

 

3771
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:56,470

The moment you saw your grand and your

3772
01:29:56,470 --> 01:29:56,480
The moment you saw your grand and your
 

3773
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,390
The moment you saw your grand and your
granddad trying to buy it and adverts

3774
01:29:58,390 --> 01:29:58,400
granddad trying to buy it and adverts
 

3775
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,390
granddad trying to buy it and adverts
coming on TV and radio, you knew it was

3776
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:00,400
coming on TV and radio, you knew it was
 

3777
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:08,790
coming on TV and radio, you knew it was
game over.

3778
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:08,800

 

3779
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,149

All right. So, right into the edge of

3780
01:30:10,149 --> 01:30:10,159
All right. So, right into the edge of
 

3781
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:12,550
All right. So, right into the edge of
this. If they start reclaiming this,

3782
01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:12,560
this. If they start reclaiming this,
 

3783
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:13,750
this. If they start reclaiming this,
then they're going to start squeezing

3784
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:13,760
then they're going to start squeezing
 

3785
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,830
then they're going to start squeezing
and they're going to go and back test

3786
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:15,840
and they're going to go and back test
 

3787
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,590
and they're going to go and back test
previous day low, previous day close.

3788
01:30:17,590 --> 01:30:17,600
previous day low, previous day close.
 

3789
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,590
previous day low, previous day close.
So, longs now are starting to try and

3790
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:19,600
So, longs now are starting to try and
 

3791
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,510
So, longs now are starting to try and
bid this up. It is a question of if and

3792
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:21,520
bid this up. It is a question of if and
 

3793
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,750
bid this up. It is a question of if and
where shorts come in. Like I said, you

3794
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:23,760
where shorts come in. Like I said, you
 

3795
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,110
where shorts come in. Like I said, you
should be done with it. Unless you're

3796
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:25,120
should be done with it. Unless you're
 

3797
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:26,310
should be done with it. Unless you're
trying to hold for the whole swing,

3798
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:26,320
trying to hold for the whole swing,
 

3799
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,870
trying to hold for the whole swing,
which I said I'd be looking for this by

3800
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:28,880
which I said I'd be looking for this by
 

3801
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,310
which I said I'd be looking for this by
Friday. I'm not necessarily looking for

3802
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:30,320
Friday. I'm not necessarily looking for
 

3803
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:41,750
Friday. I'm not necessarily looking for
it today.

3804
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:41,760

 

3805
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,590

Which chart do I look at for gold and

3806
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:43,600
Which chart do I look at for gold and
 

3807
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,070
Which chart do I look at for gold and
silver? Uh the futures market or

3808
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:46,080
silver? Uh the futures market or
 

3809
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:50,629
silver? Uh the futures market or
whatever is on Comx.

3810
01:30:50,629 --> 01:30:50,639

 

3811
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:53,350

You're in spy calls off where like their

3812
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:53,360
You're in spy calls off where like their
 

3813
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,070
You're in spy calls off where like their
90s then I'm guessing on spy.

3814
01:30:56,070 --> 01:30:56,080
90s then I'm guessing on spy.
 

3815
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:57,590
90s then I'm guessing on spy.
You're back to previous day low here on

3816
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:57,600
You're back to previous day low here on
 

3817
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,550
You're back to previous day low here on
spy. This is a big big big level on spy.

3818
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:00,560
spy. This is a big big big level on spy.
 

3819
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,310
spy. This is a big big big level on spy.
I will tell you there is a buyer still

3820
01:31:02,310 --> 01:31:02,320
I will tell you there is a buyer still
 

3821
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:07,830
I will tell you there is a buyer still
stuck at 190. All right, so we now have

3822
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:07,840
stuck at 190. All right, so we now have
 

3823
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,669
stuck at 190. All right, so we now have
we're trading back into these levels,

3824
01:31:09,669 --> 01:31:09,679
we're trading back into these levels,
 

3825
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:11,110
we're trading back into these levels,
right? We've had some big buyers step

3826
01:31:11,110 --> 01:31:11,120
right? We've had some big buyers step
 

3827
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,510
right? We've had some big buyers step
in. There is still a buy stuck at 190s.

3828
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:13,520
in. There is still a buy stuck at 190s.
 

3829
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,110
in. There is still a buy stuck at 190s.
We have some imbalances to fill if they

3830
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:15,120
We have some imbalances to fill if they
 

3831
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:17,270
We have some imbalances to fill if they
want to go rippy rippy. So 190 big level

3832
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:17,280
want to go rippy rippy. So 190 big level
 

3833
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:29,110
want to go rippy rippy. So 190 big level
here while they make a decision now.

3834
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:29,120

 

3835
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:31,350

tapped into him. No acceptance above him

3836
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:31,360
tapped into him. No acceptance above him
 

3837
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,510
tapped into him. No acceptance above him
yet.

3838
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:33,520
yet.
 

3839
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:34,870
yet.
There is an imbalance here. They're

3840
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:34,880
There is an imbalance here. They're
 

3841
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:35,990
There is an imbalance here. They're
going to get tight here. They have to

3842
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:36,000
going to get tight here. They have to
 

3843
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,430
going to get tight here. They have to
make a decision. If they sell him, we

3844
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:37,440
make a decision. If they sell him, we
 

3845
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,110
make a decision. If they sell him, we
will wash back down. If they get above

3846
01:31:39,110 --> 01:31:39,120
will wash back down. If they get above
 

3847
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:48,550
will wash back down. If they get above
him, there is a squeeze out.

3848
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:48,560

 

3849
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,390

Still can't get through this buyer. He's

3850
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:50,400
Still can't get through this buyer. He's
 

3851
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,310
Still can't get through this buyer. He's
a big boy.

3852

3854
01:31:54,229 --> 01:31:54,239

3855
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:55,590
200 that he got caught. Here you go. So
they're selling against him right now.

3856
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:55,600
they're selling against him right now.
 

3857

And we're going to come back down to VPO
 

3859
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,510
And we're going to come back down to VPO
probably into 50. So 90 to 50 a possible

3860
01:31:59,510 --> 01:31:59,520
probably into 50. So 90 to 50 a possible
 

3861
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:04,709
probably into 50. So 90 to 50 a possible
rotation here. So 90 to 50

3862
01:32:04,709 --> 01:32:04,719
rotation here. So 90 to 50
 

3863
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:06,629
rotation here. So 90 to 50
possible rotation. If they rebid 50,

3864
01:32:06,629 --> 01:32:06,639
possible rotation. If they rebid 50,
 

3865
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:12,629
possible rotation. If they rebid 50,
they will try and take out that 90.

we will be giving the Apex account to
 

3983
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:51,430
we will be giving the Apex account to
someone else.

3985
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,189

lost the 190s and 150s and now I have to

3990
01:39:59,189 --> 01:39:59,199
lost the 190s and 150s and now I have to
 

3991
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:01,910
lost the 190s and 150s and now I have to
see if they put in a higher low.

3992
01:40:01,910 --> 01:40:01,920
see if they put in a higher low.
 

3993
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:04,470
see if they put in a higher low.
Um, we can have a look on orderflow to

3994
01:40:04,470 --> 01:40:04,480
Um, we can have a look on orderflow to
 

3995
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,910
Um, we can have a look on orderflow to
see who's trapped down here. Like we

3996
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:05,920
see who's trapped down here. Like we
 

3997
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:08,149
see who's trapped down here. Like we
said, buyer caught here there. Another

3998
01:40:08,149 --> 01:40:08,159
said, buyer caught here there. Another
 

3999
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:09,990
said, buyer caught here there. Another
huge buyer came in. You can see these

4000
01:40:09,990 --> 01:40:10,000
huge buyer came in. You can see these
 

4001
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,910
huge buyer came in. You can see these
buyers keep getting caught. They are

4002
01:40:11,910 --> 01:40:11,920
buyers keep getting caught. They are
 

4003
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:15,750
buyers keep getting caught. They are
piling in here. 290, 163, 235. You see

4004
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:15,760
piling in here. 290, 163, 235. You see
 

4005
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,070
piling in here. 290, 163, 235. You see
the delta, they are too aggressive here.

4006
01:40:18,070 --> 01:40:18,080
the delta, they are too aggressive here.
 

4007
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,910
the delta, they are too aggressive here.
If they do not break out, they will

4008
01:40:19,910 --> 01:40:19,920
If they do not break out, they will
 

4009
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:21,830
If they do not break out, they will
cause a new low. All right? Or at least

4010
01:40:21,830 --> 01:40:21,840
cause a new low. All right? Or at least
 

4011
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:25,510
cause a new low. All right? Or at least
a retest towards these guys. 100 and and

4012
01:40:25,510 --> 01:40:25,520
a retest towards these guys. 100 and and
 

4013
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,910
a retest towards these guys. 100 and and
then 90s really. So, they need to get

4014
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:27,920
then 90s really. So, they need to get
 

4015
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,590
then 90s really. So, they need to get
above their average price here.

4016
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:29,600
above their average price here.
 

4017
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:30,790
above their average price here.
Otherwise, they're going to be in big

4018
01:40:30,790 --> 01:40:30,800
Otherwise, they're going to be in big
 

4019
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:33,669
Otherwise, they're going to be in big
big trouble. Big big trouble because

4020
01:40:33,669 --> 01:40:33,679
big trouble. Big big trouble because
 

4021
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:35,430
big trouble. Big big trouble because
they keep piling in here with some

4022
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:35,440
they keep piling in here with some
 

4023
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:38,950
they keep piling in here with some
serious size. Okay, we haven't had him

4024

serious size. Okay, we haven't had him
 

4025
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,790
serious size. Okay, we haven't had him
turn up, so we're going to reroll. I'm

4026
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:40,800

PC lifted now to shifted to here. This

4038
01:41:13,669 --> 01:41:13,679
PC lifted now to shifted to here. This
 

4039
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:15,590
PC lifted now to shifted to here. This
is a big level now for the nice work,

4040
01:41:15,590 --> 01:41:15,600
is a big level now for the nice work,
 

4041
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,350
is a big level now for the nice work,
dude. This is our level for the day. All

4042
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:17,360
dude. This is our level for the day. All
 

4043
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:19,189
dude. This is our level for the day. All
right. Under here, they're looking for a

4044
01:41:19,189 --> 01:41:19,199
right. Under here, they're looking for a
 

4045
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:20,790
right. Under here, they're looking for a
rotation. You need to be very careful.

4046
01:41:20,790 --> 01:41:20,800
rotation. You need to be very careful.
 

4047
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,229
rotation. You need to be very careful.
If you are going to take this short, you

4048
01:41:22,229 --> 01:41:22,239
If you are going to take this short, you
 

4049
01:41:22,239 --> 01:41:23,510
If you are going to take this short, you
must be covering some down here because

4050
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:23,520
must be covering some down here because
 

4051
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:26,470
must be covering some down here because
you're shorting very very very very low,

4052
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:26,480
you're shorting very very very very low,
 

4053
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:28,470
you're shorting very very very very low,
which is not what I would be doing. Uh

4054
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:28,480
which is not what I would be doing. Uh
 

4055
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:30,390
which is not what I would be doing. Uh
if they reclaim this, we will get a

4056
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:30,400
if they reclaim this, we will get a
 

4057
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,149
if they reclaim this, we will get a
resqueeze up into this. All right. So,

4058
01:41:32,149 --> 01:41:32,159
resqueeze up into this. All right. So,
 

4059
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:33,590
resqueeze up into this. All right. So,
they're trying to reclaim. They're going

4060
01:41:33,590 --> 01:41:33,600
they're trying to reclaim. They're going
 

4061
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,510
they're trying to reclaim. They're going
to look for the reclaim and squeeze. So,

4062
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:35,520
to look for the reclaim and squeeze. So,
 

4063
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,590
to look for the reclaim and squeeze. So,
look for a second leg up and then maybe

4064
01:41:37,590 --> 01:41:37,600
look for a second leg up and then maybe
 

4065
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,910
look for a second leg up and then maybe
they refade that down into this thin

4066
01:41:39,910 --> 01:41:39,920
they refade that down into this thin
 

4067
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:42,629
they refade that down into this thin
vault. Right, these are your overunders,

VIX into this key level now. needs to

4120
01:42:51,590 --> 01:42:51,600
VIX into this key level now. needs to
 

4121
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,750
VIX into this key level now. needs to
find a bid here in the 18s on the VIX.

01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:53,760
find a bid here in the 18s on the VIX.
 

4123
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,669
find a bid here in the 18s on the VIX.
If and when the VIX finds a bid here, I

think we will have a shot at a reshort

4126

think we will have a shot at a reshort
 

4127
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:01,270
think we will have a shot at a reshort
down. Uh last time sellers came in was

4128
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:01,280
down. Uh last time sellers came in was
 

4129
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,830
down. Uh last time sellers came in was
at 39 and 50. All right, so we're going

4130
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:03,840
at 39 and 50. All right, so we're going
 

4131
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,189
at 39 and 50. All right, so we're going
to watch those levels. We have an

4132
01:43:05,189 --> 01:43:05,199
to watch those levels. We have an
 

4133
01:43:05,199 --> 01:43:09,910
to watch those levels. We have an
imbalance at uh 56 up to 64 and

4134
01:43:09,910 --> 01:43:09,920
imbalance at uh 56 up to 64 and
 

4135
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:11,590
imbalance at uh 56 up to 64 and
obviously previous day value area low up

4136
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:11,600
obviously previous day value area low up
 

4137
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,590
obviously previous day value area low up
at 300 again, which was the big level

4138
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:13,600
at 300 again, which was the big level
 

4139
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,270
at 300 again, which was the big level
that we traded away from. So we're

4140
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:15,280
that we traded away from. So we're
 

4141
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:17,189
that we traded away from. So we're
lifting up into these levels right now.

4142
01:43:17,189 --> 01:43:17,199
lifting up into these levels right now.
 

4143
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:19,430
lifting up into these levels right now.
It's a little bit squeezy. How high can

4144
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:19,440
It's a little bit squeezy. How high can
 

4145
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,350
It's a little bit squeezy. How high can
they go for this lift? They are bidding

4146
01:43:21,350 --> 01:43:21,360
they go for this lift? They are bidding
 

4147
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:25,109
they go for this lift? They are bidding
or offering sorry at 260 right now.

4148
01:43:25,109 --> 01:43:25,119
or offering sorry at 260 right now.
 

4149
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:26,870
or offering sorry at 260 right now.
We've just left a huge imbalance in that

4150
01:43:26,870 --> 01:43:26,880
We've just left a huge imbalance in that
 

4151
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:29,189
We've just left a huge imbalance in that
last candle. If they trap enough buyers

4152
01:43:29,189 --> 01:43:29,199
last candle. If they trap enough buyers
 

4153
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:30,950
last candle. If they trap enough buyers
up here, there will be a decent wash

4154
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:30,960
up here, there will be a decent wash
 

4155
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:33,590
up here, there will be a decent wash
back down on a second leg. But let's see

4156
01:43:33,590 --> 01:43:33,600
back down on a second leg. But let's see
 

4157
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:36,629
back down on a second leg. But let's see
see what we do. We know Dex level today

4158
01:43:36,629 --> 01:43:36,639
see what we do. We know Dex level today
 

4159
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:38,629
see what we do. We know Dex level today
was at 300 and we lost that. So that's a

4160
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:38,639
was at 300 and we lost that. So that's a
 

4161
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:41,350
was at 300 and we lost that. So that's a
big level to watch.

4162
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:41,360
big level to watch.
 

4163
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:43,189
big level to watch.
Here we go into the VWOX like we talked

4164
01:43:43,189 --> 01:43:43,199
Here we go into the VWOX like we talked
 

4165
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:45,030
Here we go into the VWOX like we talked
about. So a big imbalance here into

4166
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:45,040
about. So a big imbalance here into
 

4167
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:47,430
about. So a big imbalance here into
where these sellers are. Big DEX level

4168
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:47,440
where these sellers are. Big DEX level
 

4169
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:49,830
where these sellers are. Big DEX level
above into 300. How do we operate here?

4170
01:43:49,830 --> 01:43:49,840
above into 300. How do we operate here?
 

4171
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,430
above into 300. How do we operate here?
Do they resqueeze higher and higher and

4172
01:43:51,430 --> 01:43:51,440
Do they resqueeze higher and higher and
 

4173
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:54,950
Do they resqueeze higher and higher and
higher or we game over here? How much

4174
01:43:54,950 --> 01:43:54,960
higher or we game over here? How much
 

4175
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,709
higher or we game over here? How much
how much further can they squeeze this?

4176
01:43:56,709 --> 01:43:56,719
how much further can they squeeze this?
 

4177
01:43:56,719 --> 01:43:58,229
how much further can they squeeze this?
Basically, can they get back to threes

4178
01:43:58,229 --> 01:43:58,239
Basically, can they get back to threes
 

4179
01:43:58,239 --> 01:44:04,629
Basically, can they get back to threes
or not?

4180
01:44:04,629 --> 01:44:04,639

 

4181
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:06,310

A huge imbalance on the way up there.

4182
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:06,320
A huge imbalance on the way up there.
 

4183
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:07,910
A huge imbalance on the way up there.
Big old squeeze after leaving this

4184
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:07,920
Big old squeeze after leaving this
 

4185
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:10,229
Big old squeeze after leaving this
volume.

4186
01:44:10,229 --> 01:44:10,239
volume.
 

4187
01:44:10,239 --> 01:44:12,149
volume.
See how high we can go and if they offer

4188
01:44:12,149 --> 01:44:12,159
See how high we can go and if they offer
 

4189
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:15,350
See how high we can go and if they offer
a short once they trap enough.

4190
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:15,360
a short once they trap enough.
 

4191
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:18,950
a short once they trap enough.
So at 350 same or 250 sorry 350 250 same

4192
01:44:18,950 --> 01:44:18,960
So at 350 same or 250 sorry 350 250 same
 

4193
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:20,950
So at 350 same or 250 sorry 350 250 same
level as before. Wonder if they can lift

4194
01:44:20,950 --> 01:44:20,960
level as before. Wonder if they can lift
 

4195
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:27,910
level as before. Wonder if they can lift
higher here

4196
01:44:27,910 --> 01:44:27,920

 

4197
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:34,229

this into 80s 80s.

4198
01:44:34,229 --> 01:44:34,239

 

4199
01:44:34,239 --> 01:44:35,830

It's starting to get a little bit stuck

4200
01:44:35,830 --> 01:44:35,840
It's starting to get a little bit stuck
 

4201
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:41,510
It's starting to get a little bit stuck
here.

4202
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:41,520

 

4203
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,510

Not a lot of buyers trapped in that.

4204
01:44:43,510 --> 01:44:43,520
Not a lot of buyers trapped in that.
 

4205
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,350
Not a lot of buyers trapped in that.
Just some selling into 60. Not a huge

4206
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:45,360
Just some selling into 60. Not a huge
 

4207
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:47,510
Just some selling into 60. Not a huge
amount of buyers trapped in that. I

4208
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:47,520
amount of buyers trapped in that. I
 

4209
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:50,229
amount of buyers trapped in that. I
think this is done. Yeah.

4210
01:44:50,229 --> 01:44:50,239
think this is done. Yeah.
 

4211
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:51,910
think this is done. Yeah.
Yes. Probably wants to be up as well,

4212
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:51,920
Yes. Probably wants to be up as well,
 

4213
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:56,870
Yes. Probably wants to be up as well,
I'd imagine.

4214
01:44:56,870 --> 01:44:56,880

 

4215
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:04,470

Here's the imbalances

4216
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:04,480

 

4217
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:06,470

in towards the VWAP. Remember 300's the

4218
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:06,480
in towards the VWAP. Remember 300's the
 

4219
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:12,790
in towards the VWAP. Remember 300's the
massive level.

4220
01:45:12,790 --> 01:45:12,800

 

4221
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,310

Big old squeeze. Once they're done with

4222
01:45:14,310 --> 01:45:14,320
Big old squeeze. Once they're done with
 

4223
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:15,430
Big old squeeze. Once they're done with
the squeeze, they probably let it go

4224
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:15,440
the squeeze, they probably let it go
 

4225
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:16,709
the squeeze, they probably let it go
back down the other way. Probably just

4226
01:45:16,709 --> 01:45:16,719
back down the other way. Probably just
 

4227
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:18,229
back down the other way. Probably just
trap enough buys in at the highs and

4228
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:18,239
trap enough buys in at the highs and
 

4229
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:19,990
trap enough buys in at the highs and
then they'd be done. It's just do they

4230
01:45:19,990 --> 01:45:20,000
then they'd be done. It's just do they
 

4231
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,310
then they'd be done. It's just do they
do it here or do they do it up into 300.

4232
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:22,320
do it here or do they do it up into 300.
 

4233
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,709
do it here or do they do it up into 300.
If they came three reclaim 300, it's a

4234
01:45:24,709 --> 01:45:24,719
If they came three reclaim 300, it's a
 

4235
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:27,350
If they came three reclaim 300, it's a
huge recovery.

4236
01:45:27,350 --> 01:45:27,360
huge recovery.
 

4237
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,189
huge recovery.
But I'm interested in how we operate

4238
01:45:29,189 --> 01:45:29,199
But I'm interested in how we operate
 

4239
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:31,590
But I'm interested in how we operate
around here now. Do we offer a sell back

4240
01:45:31,590 --> 01:45:31,600
around here now. Do we offer a sell back
 

4241
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,830
around here now. Do we offer a sell back
down from here? Do they trap enough

4242
01:45:33,830 --> 01:45:33,840
down from here? Do they trap enough
 

4243
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:35,830
down from here? Do they trap enough
buyers? Here's the start. Still

4244
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:35,840
buyers? Here's the start. Still
 

4245
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:38,310
buyers? Here's the start. Still
absorbing. So sellers got stuck at 50s

4246
01:45:38,310 --> 01:45:38,320
absorbing. So sellers got stuck at 50s
 

4247
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,070
absorbing. So sellers got stuck at 50s
before. So, we're watching those 50s for

4248
01:45:40,070 --> 01:45:40,080
before. So, we're watching those 50s for
 

4249
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,629
before. So, we're watching those 50s for
acceptance underneath for a drastic snap

4250
01:45:42,629 --> 01:45:42,639
acceptance underneath for a drastic snap
 

4251
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:44,229
acceptance underneath for a drastic snap
right the way back down after a squeeze

4252
01:45:44,229 --> 01:45:44,239
right the way back down after a squeeze
 

4253
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:46,229
right the way back down after a squeeze
out. We haven't tapped VWAP yet on the

4254
01:45:46,229 --> 01:45:46,239
out. We haven't tapped VWAP yet on the
 

4255
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:53,510
out. We haven't tapped VWAP yet on the
indexes. Worth noting.

4256
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:53,520

 

4257
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,990

Watching this very very very carefully

4258
01:45:55,990 --> 01:45:56,000
Watching this very very very carefully
 

4259
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,229
Watching this very very very carefully
here. Still bidding in front of the 50s

4260
01:45:58,229 --> 01:45:58,239
here. Still bidding in front of the 50s
 

4261
01:45:58,239 --> 01:45:59,510
here. Still bidding in front of the 50s
right now. They're looking to trade

4262
01:45:59,510 --> 01:45:59,520
right now. They're looking to trade
 

4263
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,189
right now. They're looking to trade
higher still. Once we lose 50, there

4264
01:46:01,189 --> 01:46:01,199
higher still. Once we lose 50, there
 

4265
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:05,910
higher still. Once we lose 50, there
might be a play.

4266
01:46:05,910 --> 01:46:05,920

 

4267
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:07,669

W this bit up pretty aggressively.

4268
01:46:07,669 --> 01:46:07,679
W this bit up pretty aggressively.
 

4269
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:09,990
W this bit up pretty aggressively.
Here's the 50 tap again. Still absorbing

4270
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:10,000
Here's the 50 tap again. Still absorbing
 

4271
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,390
Here's the 50 tap again. Still absorbing
it.

4272
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:12,400
it.
 

4273
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:13,830
it.
Still looking for higher. They're still

4274
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:13,840
Still looking for higher. They're still
 

4275
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:23,350
Still looking for higher. They're still
trying to squeeze us.

4276
01:46:23,350 --> 01:46:23,360

 

4277
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:27,669

Here it goes. B. So 80s and then 300s.

4278
01:46:27,669 --> 01:46:27,679
Here it goes. B. So 80s and then 300s.
 

4279
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:31,189
Here it goes. B. So 80s and then 300s.
The big level. Remember the GEX level.

4280
01:46:31,189 --> 01:46:31,199
The big level. Remember the GEX level.
 

4281
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:32,790
The big level. Remember the GEX level.
Still watching these 50s for a trigger

4282
01:46:32,790 --> 01:46:32,800
Still watching these 50s for a trigger
 

4283
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,550
Still watching these 50s for a trigger
entry. If I'm going to see continuation

4284
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:34,560
entry. If I'm going to see continuation
 

4285
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:37,910
entry. If I'm going to see continuation
short under 60s. Watching this under 50.

4286
01:46:37,910 --> 01:46:37,920
short under 60s. Watching this under 50.
 

4287
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:40,390
short under 60s. Watching this under 50.
Sorry. Watching this here.

4288
01:46:40,390 --> 01:46:40,400
Sorry. Watching this here.
 

4289
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:52,070
Sorry. Watching this here.
Still absorbing that there.

4290
01:46:52,070 --> 01:46:52,080

 

4291
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:54,950

Very interested in their short when

4292
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:54,960
Very interested in their short when
 

4293
01:46:54,960 --> 01:47:00,870
Very interested in their short when
they're done with it.

4294
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:00,880

 

4295
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:02,470

And they want to lift up here is the

4296
01:47:02,470 --> 01:47:02,480
And they want to lift up here is the
 

4297
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:04,470
And they want to lift up here is the
question.

4298
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:04,480
question.
 

4299
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:05,830
question.
Do they want to get all the way out to

4300
01:47:05,830 --> 01:47:05,840
Do they want to get all the way out to
 

4301
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:08,310
Do they want to get all the way out to
65s? That would be huge move if they

4302
01:47:08,310 --> 01:47:08,320
65s? That would be huge move if they
 

4303
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,229
65s? That would be huge move if they
were able to do that. Waiting for

4304
01:47:10,229 --> 01:47:10,239
were able to do that. Waiting for
 

4305
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:15,189
were able to do that. Waiting for
backside.

4306
01:47:15,189 --> 01:47:15,199

 

4307
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:31,189

Sip of coffee while we wait.

4308
01:47:31,189 --> 01:47:31,199

 

4309
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:32,950

No audio is not way low. I'm just

4310
01:47:32,950 --> 01:47:32,960
No audio is not way low. I'm just
 

4311
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:38,070
No audio is not way low. I'm just
talking low. I'm running out of energy.

4312
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:38,080

 

4313
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:40,070

Okay. Do they go 300s then? By the looks

4314
01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:40,080
Okay. Do they go 300s then? By the looks
 

4315
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:44,870
Okay. Do they go 300s then? By the looks
of it, they want to retap these 300s.

4316
01:47:44,870 --> 01:47:44,880

 

4317
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,390

I think we will get stuck somewhere

4318
01:47:46,390 --> 01:47:46,400
I think we will get stuck somewhere
 

4319
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:47,910
I think we will get stuck somewhere
around here. Unless they lift through

4320
01:47:47,910 --> 01:47:47,920
around here. Unless they lift through
 

4321
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:49,750
around here. Unless they lift through
this node here and get all the way up

4322
01:47:49,750 --> 01:47:49,760
this node here and get all the way up
 

4323
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,350
this node here and get all the way up
into the 65. I think we will probably

4324
01:47:51,350 --> 01:47:51,360
into the 65. I think we will probably
 

4325
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:53,189
into the 65. I think we will probably
see it get stuck and a rotation back to

4326
01:47:53,189 --> 01:47:53,199
see it get stuck and a rotation back to
 

4327
01:47:53,199 --> 01:47:55,990
see it get stuck and a rotation back to
80 is probably coming soon. It is

4328
01:47:55,990 --> 01:47:56,000
80 is probably coming soon. It is
 

4329
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,070
80 is probably coming soon. It is
probably coming soon. Maybe on the new

4330
01:47:58,070 --> 01:47:58,080
probably coming soon. Maybe on the new
 

4331
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:04,790
probably coming soon. Maybe on the new
hour after the new hour.

4332
01:48:04,790 --> 01:48:04,800

 

4333
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:07,510

Watching these 40s and 50s. That's where

4334
01:48:07,510 --> 01:48:07,520
Watching these 40s and 50s. That's where
 

4335
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:08,870
Watching these 40s and 50s. That's where
the sellers keep getting stuck. Once we

4336
01:48:08,870 --> 01:48:08,880
the sellers keep getting stuck. Once we
 

4337
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:09,990
the sellers keep getting stuck. Once we
get under that, we might see

4338
01:48:09,990 --> 01:48:10,000
get under that, we might see
 

4339
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:14,550
get under that, we might see
continuation lower.

4340
01:48:14,550 --> 01:48:14,560

 

4341
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,310

Here we go. 40s. Do they fill these

4342
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:16,320
Here we go. 40s. Do they fill these
 

4343
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:21,830
Here we go. 40s. Do they fill these
imbalances now? Still bidding 40s.

4344
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:21,840

 

4345
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:23,270

They're going to flush this through the

4346
01:48:23,270 --> 01:48:23,280
They're going to flush this through the
 

4347
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:24,870
They're going to flush this through the
40s and fill this little imbalance to

4348
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:24,880
40s and fill this little imbalance to
 

4349
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:27,830
40s and fill this little imbalance to
35s or not. reselling here at 50s. All

4350
01:48:27,830 --> 01:48:27,840
35s or not. reselling here at 50s. All
 

4351
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,350
35s or not. reselling here at 50s. All
right, we might see a wash here if this

4352
01:48:29,350 --> 01:48:29,360
right, we might see a wash here if this
 

4353
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:31,750
right, we might see a wash here if this
seller steps in.

4354
01:48:31,750 --> 01:48:31,760
seller steps in.
 

4355
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:36,070
seller steps in.
Here's the imbalance.

4356
01:48:36,070 --> 01:48:36,080

 

4357
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:37,430

Filled the imbalance. Does this seller

4358
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:37,440
Filled the imbalance. Does this seller
 

4359
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:40,070
Filled the imbalance. Does this seller
hold 50s now? He's there at 50s. We want

4360
01:48:40,070 --> 01:48:40,080
hold 50s now? He's there at 50s. We want
 

4361
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:41,350
hold 50s now? He's there at 50s. We want
to see if he's actually going to hold it

4362
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:41,360
to see if he's actually going to hold it
 

4363
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:44,070
to see if he's actually going to hold it
or not. If he holds it, I'll consider a

4364
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:44,080
or not. If he holds it, I'll consider a
 

4365
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:45,510
or not. If he holds it, I'll consider a
join. I'm not convinced we're done yet,

4366
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:45,520
join. I'm not convinced we're done yet,
 

4367
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:46,870
join. I'm not convinced we're done yet,
but if he holds it, I'll consider a

4368
01:48:46,870 --> 01:48:46,880
but if he holds it, I'll consider a
 

4369
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:49,109
but if he holds it, I'll consider a
join.

4370
01:48:49,109 --> 01:48:49,119
join.
 

4371
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:50,629
join.
He's filled. I think they might squeeze

4372
01:48:50,629 --> 01:48:50,639
He's filled. I think they might squeeze
 

4373
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:53,430
He's filled. I think they might squeeze
a little bit higher here. Trying to time

4374
01:48:53,430 --> 01:48:53,440
a little bit higher here. Trying to time
 

4375
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:59,030
a little bit higher here. Trying to time
this if I'm going to get involved.

4376
01:48:59,030 --> 01:48:59,040

 

4377
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:03,350

We have buyers caught above 63s

4378
01:49:03,350 --> 01:49:03,360

 

4379
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,510

and we have sellers caught at 40s right

4380
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:05,520
and we have sellers caught at 40s right
 

4381
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,750
and we have sellers caught at 40s right
now. And that's the that's the 20

4382
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:07,760
now. And that's the that's the 20
 

4383
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,030
now. And that's the that's the 20
points. That's all they've got right

4384
01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:09,040
points. That's all they've got right
 

4385
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:11,990
points. That's all they've got right
now.

4386
01:49:11,990 --> 01:49:12,000
now.
 

4387
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,750
now.
VIX is not finding a bid where it needed

4388
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:13,760
VIX is not finding a bid where it needed
 

4389
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,350
VIX is not finding a bid where it needed
to find a bid. So sliding back down,

4390
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:15,360
to find a bid. So sliding back down,
 

4391
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:17,430
to find a bid. So sliding back down,
finding a bid down PDC, trading up to

4392
01:49:17,430 --> 01:49:17,440
finding a bid down PDC, trading up to
 

4393
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:21,830
finding a bid down PDC, trading up to
PDH on VIX.

4394
01:49:21,830 --> 01:49:21,840

 

4395
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:24,310

I'm interested in this short. Just

4396
01:49:24,310 --> 01:49:24,320
I'm interested in this short. Just
 

4397
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,310
I'm interested in this short. Just
waiting to see if we let go of 40s or

4398
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:26,320
waiting to see if we let go of 40s or
 

4399
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:28,629
waiting to see if we let go of 40s or
not. Keep they keep rebidding 40s. If we

4400
01:49:28,629 --> 01:49:28,639
not. Keep they keep rebidding 40s. If we
 

4401
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:30,149
not. Keep they keep rebidding 40s. If we
keep sell trapping sellers here, there's

4402
01:49:30,149 --> 01:49:30,159
keep sell trapping sellers here, there's
 

4403
01:49:30,159 --> 01:49:32,870
keep sell trapping sellers here, there's
nothing I can do, right? They keep

4404
01:49:32,870 --> 01:49:32,880
nothing I can do, right? They keep
 

4405
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:34,950
nothing I can do, right? They keep
rebidding versus this guy here. These

4406
01:49:34,950 --> 01:49:34,960
rebidding versus this guy here. These
 

4407
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:37,109
rebidding versus this guy here. These
are all the imbalances we can fill if

4408
01:49:37,109 --> 01:49:37,119
are all the imbalances we can fill if
 

4409
01:49:37,119 --> 01:49:39,270
are all the imbalances we can fill if
this guy takes over and we can maybe

4410
01:49:39,270 --> 01:49:39,280
this guy takes over and we can maybe
 

4411
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:41,350
this guy takes over and we can maybe
trade down to 190 at least. So, that's

4412
01:49:41,350 --> 01:49:41,360
trade down to 190 at least. So, that's
 

4413
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:44,310
trade down to 190 at least. So, that's
what I'm looking to trade if possible.

4414
01:49:44,310 --> 01:49:44,320
what I'm looking to trade if possible.
 

4415
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,310
what I'm looking to trade if possible.
Here we go. Back to 40s again. Watching

4416
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:46,320
Here we go. Back to 40s again. Watching
 

4417
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:48,070
Here we go. Back to 40s again. Watching
this again. If this guy just leaves the

4418
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,080
this again. If this guy just leaves the
 

4419
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:55,030
this again. If this guy just leaves the
tape and lets it go, I will join short.

4420
01:49:55,030 --> 01:49:55,040

 

4421
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:56,870

We already did the giveaway. You're

4422
01:49:56,870 --> 01:49:56,880
We already did the giveaway. You're
 

4423
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:58,709
We already did the giveaway. You're
asking how to do the giveaway. We

4424
01:49:58,709 --> 01:49:58,719
asking how to do the giveaway. We
 

4425
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:00,470
asking how to do the giveaway. We
already did the giveaway. No, I'm not in

4426
01:50:00,470 --> 01:50:00,480
already did the giveaway. No, I'm not in
 

4427
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:02,629
already did the giveaway. No, I'm not in
yet. I'm watching the 40s. I'm not in

4428
01:50:02,629 --> 01:50:02,639
yet. I'm watching the 40s. I'm not in
 

4429
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:07,189
yet. I'm watching the 40s. I'm not in
yet. We are still absorbing 40s.

4430
01:50:07,189 --> 01:50:07,199
yet. We are still absorbing 40s.
 

4431
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:09,270
yet. We are still absorbing 40s.
I will need to either see a break under

4432
01:50:09,270 --> 01:50:09,280
I will need to either see a break under
 

4433
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:12,310
I will need to either see a break under
40s that gets sold into aggressively to

4434
01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:12,320
40s that gets sold into aggressively to
 

4435
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:14,310
40s that gets sold into aggressively to
join or I'm going to need to see a push

4436
01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:14,320
join or I'm going to need to see a push
 

4437
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:16,390
join or I'm going to need to see a push
up towards 300s which is sold into which

4438
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:16,400
up towards 300s which is sold into which
 

4439
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,629
up towards 300s which is sold into which
where they trap buyers. I do not want to

4440
01:50:18,629 --> 01:50:18,639
where they trap buyers. I do not want to
 

4441
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:21,189
where they trap buyers. I do not want to
just enter here and wait. I want to see

4442
01:50:21,189 --> 01:50:21,199
just enter here and wait. I want to see
 

4443
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:23,430
just enter here and wait. I want to see
a reaction. I do not want to enter early

4444
01:50:23,430 --> 01:50:23,440
a reaction. I do not want to enter early
 

4445
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:25,430
a reaction. I do not want to enter early
and just wait. That would be a front

4446
01:50:25,430 --> 01:50:25,440
and just wait. That would be a front
 

4447
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:27,109
and just wait. That would be a front
side short. I don't want a front side

4448
01:50:27,109 --> 01:50:27,119
side short. I don't want a front side
 

4449
01:50:27,119 --> 01:50:29,510
side short. I don't want a front side
short. I want a backside short. Right?

4450
01:50:29,510 --> 01:50:29,520
short. I want a backside short. Right?
 

4451
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:32,149
short. I want a backside short. Right?
So, I need them to leave and do this or

4452
01:50:32,149 --> 01:50:32,159
So, I need them to leave and do this or
 

4453
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:34,470
So, I need them to leave and do this or
I need them to push and do something

4454
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:34,480
I need them to push and do something
 

4455
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:37,270
I need them to push and do something
like this and trap buyers up here. I do

4456
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:37,280
like this and trap buyers up here. I do
 

4457
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:39,270
like this and trap buyers up here. I do
not want want to just enter there. There

4458
01:50:39,270 --> 01:50:39,280
not want want to just enter there. There
 

4459
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:41,109
not want want to just enter there. There
is no trade here to just enter there.

4460
01:50:41,109 --> 01:50:41,119
is no trade here to just enter there.
 

4461
01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:44,950
is no trade here to just enter there.
This should be here.

4462
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:44,960

 

4463
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:46,790

40s again. Right. Still perking my

4464
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:46,800
40s again. Right. Still perking my
 

4465
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:49,430
40s again. Right. Still perking my
interest at 40s.

4466
01:50:49,430 --> 01:50:49,440
interest at 40s.
 

4467
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:51,109
interest at 40s.
Do they snap this? Now they're coming

4468
01:50:51,109 --> 01:50:51,119
Do they snap this? Now they're coming
 

4469
01:50:51,119 --> 01:50:53,430
Do they snap this? Now they're coming
in. They're still trying to bid 30s.

4470
01:50:53,430 --> 01:50:53,440

4471
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,030

Here's the first imbalance filled now.

4472
01:50:55,030 --> 01:50:55,040
Here's the first imbalance filled now.
 

4473
01:50:55,040 --> 01:51:00,310
Here's the first imbalance filled now.
Do we get a reaction at 40?

4474
01:51:00,310 --> 01:51:00,320

 

4475
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:01,990

Want to see a seller step in back in at

4476
01:51:01,990 --> 01:51:02,000
Want to see a seller step in back in at
 

4477
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:09,030
Want to see a seller step in back in at
40. Not seeing it yet. They're trying.

4478
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:09,040

 

4479
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:10,550

01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:11,830
They're still bidding 30. They're still
stepping up. I think we're going to wash

4482
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:11,840
stepping up. I think we're going to wash
 

4483
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:16,709
stepping up. I think we're going to wash
a little bit deeper, but not enough.

4484
01:51:16,709 --> 01:51:16,719

 

4485
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:18,470

Come on.

4486
01:51:18,470 --> 01:51:18,480
Come on.
 

4487
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:19,910
Come on.
What are you going to do? You're going

What are you going to do? You're going
 

4489
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:27,750
What are you going to do? You're going
to do one more shove up, you dirty dog.

4490
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:27,760

 

4491
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:29,510

They keep stacking 30s and 20s. There's

4492
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:29,520
They keep stacking 30s and 20s. There's
 

4493
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:35,830
They keep stacking 30s and 20s. There's
still a bid on the tape here.

4494
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:35,840

 

4495
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:37,589

It just trapped a few more people here

4496
01:51:37,589 --> 01:51:37,599
It just trapped a few more people here
 

4497

through sell side yet. Watching 40s

4500
01:51:41,910 --> 01:51:41,920
through sell side yet. Watching 40s
 

4501
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:43,669
through sell side yet. Watching 40s
again on this next tap in to see what

4502
01:51:43,669 --> 01:51:43,679
again on this next tap in to see what
 

4503
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:47,990
again on this next tap in to see what
happens.

4504
01:51:47,990 --> 01:51:48,000

 

4505
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,629

straight through it. No trade.

4506
01:51:50,629 --> 01:51:50,639
straight through it. No trade.
 

4507
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:52,149
straight through it. No trade.
I think they're not done with it. I

4508
01:51:52,149 --> 01:51:52,159
I think they're not done with it. I
 

4509
01:51:52,159 --> 01:51:53,430
I think they're not done with it. I
think they need to do like one more

4510
01:51:53,430 --> 01:51:53,440
think they need to do like one more
 

4511
01:51:53,440 --> 01:52:02,870
think they need to do like one more
squeeze out or something at the moment.

4512
01:52:02,870 --> 01:52:02,880

 

4513
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:05,750

It feels close.

4514
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:05,760
It feels close.
 

4515
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:13,430
It feels close.
Where are we on that hourly?

4516
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:13,440

 

4517
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:15,430

Just like can they lift to 312? It's

4518
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:15,440
Just like can they lift to 312? It's
 

4519
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:17,430
Just like can they lift to 312? It's
very possible looking at developing

4520
01:52:17,430 --> 01:52:17,440
very possible looking at developing
 

4521
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:21,350
very possible looking at developing
week. It's very very very possible. I'm

4522
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:21,360
week. It's very very very possible. I'm
 

4523
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:23,189
week. It's very very very possible. I'm
looking at this.

4524
01:52:23,189 --> 01:52:23,199
looking at this.
 

4525
01:52:23,199 --> 01:52:24,709
looking at this.
Very possible that they want to come

4526
01:52:24,709 --> 01:52:24,719
Very possible that they want to come
 

4527
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:27,350
Very possible that they want to come
further up into this node here. Very

4528
01:52:27,350 --> 01:52:27,360
further up into this node here. Very
 

4529
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:31,109
further up into this node here. Very
possible. Big wash. Save. Now we found

4530
01:52:31,109 --> 01:52:31,119
possible. Big wash. Save. Now we found
 

4531
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:36,149
possible. Big wash. Save. Now we found
bids. We will see.

4532
01:52:36,149 --> 01:52:36,159

 

4533
01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:42,390

So I can see the better.

4534
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:42,400

 

4535
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:46,390

We'll see.

4536
01:52:46,390 --> 01:52:46,400

 

4537
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:49,910

Okay, stuck a gray box again.

4538
01:52:49,910 --> 01:52:49,920
Okay, stuck a gray box again.
 

4539
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,750
Okay, stuck a gray box again.
Still interested. I just wonder if they

4540
01:52:51,750 --> 01:52:51,760
Still interested. I just wonder if they
 

4541
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,109
Still interested. I just wonder if they
need to lift. We're still interested

4542
01:52:53,109 --> 01:52:53,119
need to lift. We're still interested
 

4543
01:52:53,119 --> 01:52:55,990
need to lift. We're still interested
here. It's looking very messy on the

4544
01:52:55,990 --> 01:52:56,000
here. It's looking very messy on the
 

4545
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,310
here. It's looking very messy on the
charts here. Buy just got caught at 45

4546
01:52:58,310 --> 01:52:58,320
charts here. Buy just got caught at 45
 

4547
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,070
charts here. Buy just got caught at 45
in the last 5m minutee candle, but we're

4548
01:53:00,070 --> 01:53:00,080
in the last 5m minutee candle, but we're
 

4549
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:01,910
in the last 5m minutee candle, but we're
not accelerating away from him back down

4550
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:01,920
not accelerating away from him back down
 

4551
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:03,430
not accelerating away from him back down
to the 190s, which is what I'm looking

4552
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:03,440
to the 190s, which is what I'm looking
 

4553
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,830
to the 190s, which is what I'm looking
for. Starting. They're trying to try and

4554
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:05,840
for. Starting. They're trying to try and
 

4555
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,270
for. Starting. They're trying to try and
sell now. They're trying to now sell

4556
01:53:07,270 --> 01:53:07,280
sell now. They're trying to now sell
 

4557
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:11,750
sell now. They're trying to now sell
these lows. Here we go. Here we go.

4558
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:11,760
these lows. Here we go. Here we go.
 

4559
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:14,070
these lows. Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Come on then. Let's get to

4560
01:53:14,070 --> 01:53:14,080
Here we go. Come on then. Let's get to
 

4561
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:18,149
Here we go. Come on then. Let's get to
200s and 190s.

4562
01:53:18,149 --> 01:53:18,159

 

4563
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:20,629

Do not want any reclaim of 40s here,

4564
01:53:20,629 --> 01:53:20,639
Do not want any reclaim of 40s here,
 

4565
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:22,629
Do not want any reclaim of 40s here,
folks. All right. No reclaim of 40s. We

4566
01:53:22,629 --> 01:53:22,639
folks. All right. No reclaim of 40s. We
 

4567
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:23,990
folks. All right. No reclaim of 40s. We
are into imbalances. You can take

4568
01:53:23,990 --> 01:53:24,000
are into imbalances. You can take
 

4569
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,750
are into imbalances. You can take
partials on the way. Do not be like

4570
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:25,760
partials on the way. Do not be like
 

4571
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,109
partials on the way. Do not be like
overstaying your welcome if they start

4572
01:53:27,109 --> 01:53:27,119
overstaying your welcome if they start
 

4573
01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:28,550
overstaying your welcome if they start
on a reclaim. All right? Because this

4574
01:53:28,550 --> 01:53:28,560
on a reclaim. All right? Because this
 

4575
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:30,149
on a reclaim. All right? Because this
dip can hold. I would love it to get

4576
01:53:30,149 --> 01:53:30,159
dip can hold. I would love it to get
 

4577
01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:32,310
dip can hold. I would love it to get
down into 180s and below. It's what I'd

4578
01:53:32,310 --> 01:53:32,320
down into 180s and below. It's what I'd
 

4579
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:36,870
down into 180s and below. It's what I'd
really like.

4580
01:53:36,870 --> 01:53:36,880

 

4581
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:39,030

They're trying to bid 20s here. Look at

4582
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:39,040
They're trying to bid 20s here. Look at
 

4583
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:40,470
They're trying to bid 20s here. Look at
this aggressive bit of 20s. He should

4584
01:53:40,470 --> 01:53:40,480
this aggressive bit of 20s. He should
 

4585
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:42,390
this aggressive bit of 20s. He should
sell through this 20 if he gets stuck to

4586
01:53:42,390 --> 01:53:42,400
sell through this 20 if he gets stuck to
 

4587
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:49,830
sell through this 20 if he gets stuck to
200.

4588
01:53:49,830 --> 01:53:49,840

 

4589
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:52,550

Come on. Come down to 200 for me. He's

4590
01:53:52,550 --> 01:53:52,560
Come on. Come down to 200 for me. He's
 

4591
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,629
Come on. Come down to 200 for me. He's
still bidding 20s. Keeps refreshing.

4592
01:53:54,629 --> 01:53:54,639
still bidding 20s. Keeps refreshing.
 

4593
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:57,990
still bidding 20s. Keeps refreshing.
Come on. Get under him. Come on. Get

If we lose this, we should go 190.

4606
01:54:11,189 --> 01:54:11,199
If we lose this, we should go 190.
 

4607

01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,990

How many times I tell you I will get in

4616
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:24,000
How many times I tell you I will get in
 

4617
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,669
How many times I tell you I will get in
if we leave 140s. If we leave 140s

4618
01:54:27,669 --> 01:54:27,679
if we leave 140s. If we leave 140s

01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:36,480

 

4623
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:39,270

So, bidding 200s. If we lose 200s, I'm

4624
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:39,280
So, bidding 200s. If we lose 200s, I'm
 

4625
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:42,709
So, bidding 200s. If we lose 200s, I'm
going to cover some 190s and then 160s.

4626
01:54:42,709 --> 01:54:42,719
going to cover some 190s and then 160s.
 

4627
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:44,229
going to cover some 190s and then 160s.
All right, so they're bidding this shelf

4628
01:54:44,229 --> 01:54:44,239
All right, so they're bidding this shelf
 

4629
01:54:44,239 --> 01:54:46,070
All right, so they're bidding this shelf
here. We want to cover some into this

4630
01:54:46,070 --> 01:54:46,080
here. We want to cover some into this
 

4631
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:47,189
here. We want to cover some into this
shelf here. All right, they're trying to

4632
01:54:47,189 --> 01:54:47,199
shelf here. All right, they're trying to
 

4633
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:49,109
shelf here. All right, they're trying to
hold this here. All right, so we're

4634
01:54:49,109 --> 01:54:49,119
hold this here. All right, so we're
 

4635
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:51,350
hold this here. All right, so we're
going to cover some here and then 60s.

4636
01:54:51,350 --> 01:54:51,360
going to cover some here and then 60s.
 

4637
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:53,109
going to cover some here and then 60s.
All right, so we're going to be most out

4638
01:54:53,109 --> 01:54:53,119
All right, so we're going to be most out
 

4639
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:54,870
All right, so we're going to be most out
into here because we will then expect a

4640
01:54:54,870 --> 01:54:54,880
into here because we will then expect a
 

4641
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:56,390
into here because we will then expect a
bounce and if they sell that bounce, we

4642
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:56,400
bounce and if they sell that bounce, we
 

4643
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:59,510
bounce and if they sell that bounce, we
will look for a new low.

4644
01:54:59,510 --> 01:54:59,520
will look for a new low.
 

4645
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:01,430
will look for a new low.
We're early here because they can still

4646
01:55:01,430 --> 01:55:01,440
We're early here because they can still
 

4647
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:03,430
We're early here because they can still
do this, but we are positioned well

4648
01:55:03,430 --> 01:55:03,440
do this, but we are positioned well
 

4649
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:06,149
do this, but we are positioned well
versus this volume. All right. And we're

4650
01:55:06,149 --> 01:55:06,159
versus this volume. All right. And we're
 

4651
01:55:06,159 --> 01:55:08,550
versus this volume. All right. And we're
covering some and some more here. And if

4652
01:55:08,550 --> 01:55:08,560
covering some and some more here. And if
 

4653
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:10,390
covering some and some more here. And if
they lift and they resell it, we can

4654
01:55:10,390 --> 01:55:10,400
they lift and they resell it, we can
 

4655
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:18,229
they lift and they resell it, we can
look for lower.

4656
01:55:18,229 --> 01:55:18,239

01:57:04,790 --> 01:57:04,800
pull back. We might well continue down
 

4741
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:07,030
pull back. We might well continue down
here. Do not think that this is going to

4742
01:57:07,030 --> 01:57:07,040
here. Do not think that this is going to
 

4743
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:08,950
here. Do not think that this is going to
do all the way back up there. All right.

4744
01:57:08,950 --> 01:57:08,960
do all the way back up there. All right.
 

4745
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:11,750
do all the way back up there. All right.
Do do not think we are in uptrend. It's

4746
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:11,760
Do do not think we are in uptrend. It's
 

4747
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:13,589
Do do not think we are in uptrend. It's
not necessarily the case right now. We

4748
01:57:13,589 --> 01:57:13,599
not necessarily the case right now. We
 

4749
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:16,310
not necessarily the case right now. We
are starting to leave volume trapped at

4750
01:57:16,310 --> 01:57:16,320
are starting to leave volume trapped at
 

4751
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:18,310
are starting to leave volume trapped at
310s and above. Right? We are starting

4752
01:57:18,310 --> 01:57:18,320
310s and above. Right? We are starting
 

4753
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:22,390
310s and above. Right? We are starting
to leave volume trapped at 310 and above

4754
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:22,400
to leave volume trapped at 310 and above
 

4755
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:24,310
to leave volume trapped at 310 and above
this week. We are starting to reject

4756
01:57:24,310 --> 01:57:24,320
this week. We are starting to reject
 

4757
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:26,229
this week. We are starting to reject
that after a failed breakout. We are

4758
01:57:26,229 --> 01:57:26,239
that after a failed breakout. We are
 

4759
01:57:26,239 --> 01:57:28,390
that after a failed breakout. We are
starting to reject that. We are digging

4760
01:57:28,390 --> 01:57:28,400
starting to reject that. We are digging
 

4761
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:31,270
starting to reject that. We are digging
down into previous week levels right

4762
01:57:31,270 --> 01:57:31,280
down into previous week levels right
 

4763
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:34,229
down into previous week levels right
now. We have a naked point of control

4764
01:57:34,229 --> 01:57:34,239
now. We have a naked point of control
 

4765
01:57:34,239 --> 01:57:36,550
now. We have a naked point of control
which it wants to revisit. This is not a

4766
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:36,560
which it wants to revisit. This is not a
 

4767
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:39,030
which it wants to revisit. This is not a
big protrend update. All right. Do not

4768
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:39,040
big protrend update. All right. Do not
 

4769
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:49,189
big protrend update. All right. Do not
think that.

4770
01:57:49,189 --> 01:57:49,199

 

4771
01:57:49,199 --> 01:57:51,030

Is Lucid better than TPT? They're just

4772
01:57:51,030 --> 01:57:51,040
Is Lucid better than TPT? They're just
 

4773
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:52,709
Is Lucid better than TPT? They're just
different. It's not that they're better.

4774
01:57:52,709 --> 01:57:52,719
different. It's not that they're better.
 

4775
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:54,950
different. It's not that they're better.
They're just different. Right.

4776
01:57:54,950 --> 01:57:54,960
They're just different. Right.
 

4777
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:59,270
They're just different. Right.
Different.

4778
01:57:59,270 --> 01:57:59,280

 

4779
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:04,390

Can I call you baby again? Yeah.

4780
01:58:04,390 --> 01:58:04,400

 

4781
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:07,510

Here we go. Come on. Come on. I need a

4782
01:58:07,510 --> 01:58:07,520
Here we go. Come on. Come on. I need a
 

4783
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:09,669
Here we go. Come on. Come on. I need a
break down here. All right. Trimming

4784
01:58:09,669 --> 01:58:09,679
break down here. All right. Trimming
 

4785
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:11,990
break down here. All right. Trimming
some there. And if we get under this

4786
01:58:11,990 --> 01:58:12,000
some there. And if we get under this
 

4787
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,589
some there. And if we get under this
guy,

4788
01:58:13,589 --> 01:58:13,599
guy,
 

4789
01:58:13,599 --> 01:58:15,589
guy,
this guy. If we get under this guy,

4790
01:58:15,589 --> 01:58:15,599
this guy. If we get under this guy,
 

4791
01:58:15,599 --> 01:58:17,270
this guy. If we get under this guy,
we're going to look to trade into 50s

4792
01:58:17,270 --> 01:58:17,280
we're going to look to trade into 50s
 

4793
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:18,790
we're going to look to trade into 50s
and 60s. Right. If we can get under this

4794
01:58:18,790 --> 01:58:18,800
and 60s. Right. If we can get under this
 

4795
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:20,470
and 60s. Right. If we can get under this
big blue line, we're going to look to

4796
01:58:20,470 --> 01:58:20,480
big blue line, we're going to look to
 

4797
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:22,149
big blue line, we're going to look to
trade down here because that will mean

4798
01:58:22,149 --> 01:58:22,159
trade down here because that will mean
 

4799
01:58:22,159 --> 01:58:24,149
trade down here because that will mean
these big buyers will start being stuck.

4800
01:58:24,149 --> 01:58:24,159
these big buyers will start being stuck.
 

4801
01:58:24,159 --> 01:58:25,189
these big buyers will start being stuck.
And this is what we're talking about. If

4802
01:58:25,189 --> 01:58:25,199
And this is what we're talking about. If
 

4803
01:58:25,199 --> 01:58:27,189
And this is what we're talking about. If
they keep chasing and we can keep coming

4804
01:58:27,189 --> 01:58:27,199
they keep chasing and we can keep coming
 

4805
01:58:27,199 --> 01:58:28,950
they keep chasing and we can keep coming
under their price, if we can get under

4806
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:28,960
under their price, if we can get under
 

4807
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:30,709
under their price, if we can get under
150 today, there is a good chance that

4808
01:58:30,709 --> 01:58:30,719
150 today, there is a good chance that
 

4809
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:32,629
150 today, there is a good chance that
we'll auction down to the lows again.

4810
01:58:32,629 --> 01:58:32,639
we'll auction down to the lows again.
 

4811
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:33,830
we'll auction down to the lows again.
All right, but this level here is

4812
01:58:33,830 --> 01:58:33,840
All right, but this level here is
 

4813
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:35,910
All right, but this level here is
massive. This is not a madeup level.

4814
01:58:35,910 --> 01:58:35,920
massive. This is not a madeup level.
 

4815
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:37,830
massive. This is not a madeup level.
This is quite genuinely where they've

4816
01:58:37,830 --> 01:58:37,840
This is quite genuinely where they've
 

4817
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:47,990
This is quite genuinely where they've
been trading in and around.

4818
01:58:47,990 --> 01:58:48,000

 

4819
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,750

Here we go. Come on. Let's see if

4820
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:49,760
Here we go. Come on. Let's see if
 

4821
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:51,990
Here we go. Come on. Let's see if
there's acceleration under 90s. I'm out

4822
01:58:51,990 --> 01:58:52,000
there's acceleration under 90s. I'm out
 

4823
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,589
there's acceleration under 90s. I'm out
a decent size here. Let's just see if we

4824
01:58:53,589 --> 01:58:53,599
a decent size here. Let's just see if we
 

4825
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:58,149
a decent size here. Let's just see if we
can get acceleration down. Gray box P.

4826
01:58:58,149 --> 01:58:58,159
can get acceleration down. Gray box P.
 

4827
01:58:58,159 --> 01:59:00,229
can get acceleration down. Gray box P.
I'd really love it if we let go of this.

4828
01:59:00,229 --> 01:59:00,239
I'd really love it if we let go of this.
 

4829
01:59:00,239 --> 01:59:03,109
I'd really love it if we let go of this.
If we let go of 50s and 60s, right? We

4830
01:59:03,109 --> 01:59:03,119
If we let go of 50s and 60s, right? We
 

4831
01:59:03,119 --> 01:59:04,870
If we let go of 50s and 60s, right? We
know that they might well want to bid

4832
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:04,880
know that they might well want to bid
 

4833
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:07,030
know that they might well want to bid
here. They will want to protect here.

4834
01:59:07,030 --> 01:59:07,040
here. They will want to protect here.
 

4835
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:09,350
here. They will want to protect here.
But I tell you what, if we do this, we

4836
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:09,360
But I tell you what, if we do this, we
 

4837
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:15,510
But I tell you what, if we do this, we
are coming back for this.

4838
01:59:15,510 --> 01:59:15,520

 

4839
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:16,950

Don't know how it stayed on stream so

4840
01:59:16,950 --> 01:59:16,960
Don't know how it stayed on stream so
 

4841
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:23,750
Don't know how it stayed on stream so
long.

4842
01:59:23,750 --> 01:59:23,760

 

4843
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:26,550

We're going to get it. Come on. Come on.

4844
01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:26,560
We're going to get it. Come on. Come on.
 

4845
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,390
We're going to get it. Come on. Come on.
Stop saving it. This guy on the tape is

4846
01:59:28,390 --> 01:59:28,400
Stop saving it. This guy on the tape is
 

4847
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:30,550
Stop saving it. This guy on the tape is
relentless down here. This is maybe the

4848
01:59:30,550 --> 01:59:30,560
relentless down here. This is maybe the
 

4849
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:32,310
relentless down here. This is maybe the
same guy as the other day. Is it the

4850
01:59:32,310 --> 01:59:32,320
same guy as the other day. Is it the
 

4851
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:34,629
same guy as the other day. Is it the
same level that we're bidding? Oh, it

4852
01:59:34,629 --> 01:59:34,639
same level that we're bidding? Oh, it
 

4853
01:59:34,639 --> 01:59:36,550
same level that we're bidding? Oh, it
is. It's the same level where we had

4854
01:59:36,550 --> 01:59:36,560
is. It's the same level where we had
 

4855
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:39,510
is. It's the same level where we had
that relentless bidding on Monday.

4856
01:59:39,510 --> 01:59:39,520
that relentless bidding on Monday.
 

4857
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:42,149
that relentless bidding on Monday.
Interesting.

4858
01:59:42,149 --> 01:59:42,159
Interesting.
 

4859
01:59:42,159 --> 01:59:44,790
Interesting.
Interesting. It's probably the same guy

4860
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:44,800
Interesting. It's probably the same guy
 

4861
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:47,350
Interesting. It's probably the same guy
gobbling up down here.

4862
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:47,360
gobbling up down here.
 

4863
01:59:47,360 --> 02:00:03,430
gobbling up down here.
Still think there's a wash potentially.

4864
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:03,440

 

4865
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:06,229

Is that the Tyson setup? It was a bit

4866
02:00:06,229 --> 02:00:06,239
Is that the Tyson setup? It was a bit
 

4867
02:00:06,239 --> 02:00:08,149
Is that the Tyson setup? It was a bit
dirty because we didn't we we set the

4868
02:00:08,149 --> 02:00:08,159
dirty because we didn't we we set the
 

4869
02:00:08,159 --> 02:00:10,470
dirty because we didn't we we set the
low. We didn't retest the IB. But yes,

4870
02:00:10,470 --> 02:00:10,480
low. We didn't retest the IB. But yes,
 

4871
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:13,510
low. We didn't retest the IB. But yes,
technically we came in, we set the IB,

4872
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:13,520
technically we came in, we set the IB,
 

4873
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:15,109
technically we came in, we set the IB,
we traded back to VWAP. We're trying to

4874
02:00:15,109 --> 02:00:15,119
we traded back to VWAP. We're trying to
 

4875
02:00:15,119 --> 02:00:17,189
we traded back to VWAP. We're trying to
trade from VW up back to IB now if

4876
02:00:17,189 --> 02:00:17,199
trade from VW up back to IB now if
 

4877
02:00:17,199 --> 02:00:19,109
trade from VW up back to IB now if
possible. But we will respect this. But

4878
02:00:19,109 --> 02:00:19,119
possible. But we will respect this. But
 

4879
02:00:19,119 --> 02:00:21,030
possible. But we will respect this. But
if we get under that, we're looking for

4880
02:00:21,030 --> 02:00:21,040
if we get under that, we're looking for
 

4881
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:22,709
if we get under that, we're looking for
this, aren't we? So this is the Tyson

4882
02:00:22,709 --> 02:00:22,719
this, aren't we? So this is the Tyson
 

4883
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:25,270
this, aren't we? So this is the Tyson
trade both ways really. All right. IB to

4884
02:00:25,270 --> 02:00:25,280
trade both ways really. All right. IB to
 

4885
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:28,709
trade both ways really. All right. IB to
VW up, V up to IB.

4886
02:00:28,709 --> 02:00:28,719
VW up, V up to IB.
 

4887
02:00:28,719 --> 02:00:31,270
VW up, V up to IB.
Exactly that. You should be covering a

4888
02:00:31,270 --> 02:00:31,280
Exactly that. You should be covering a
 

4889
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:32,470
Exactly that. You should be covering a
decent chunk here if you haven't

4890
02:00:32,470 --> 02:00:32,480
decent chunk here if you haven't
 

4891
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:33,990
decent chunk here if you haven't
already. All right. So we traded from

4892
02:00:33,990 --> 02:00:34,000
already. All right. So we traded from
 

4893
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,750
already. All right. So we traded from
30s and 40s down to here. All right. If

4894
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:37,760
30s and 40s down to here. All right. If
 

4895
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:39,430
30s and 40s down to here. All right. If
they cannot sell through this, they

4896
02:00:39,430 --> 02:00:39,440
they cannot sell through this, they
 

4897
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:41,270
they cannot sell through this, they
might well come and revisit this node

4898

might well come and revisit this node
 

4899
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:45,589
might well come and revisit this node
again, which will not be fun.

4932
02:01:19,589 --> 02:01:19,599

4933
02:01:19,599 --> 02:01:20,790
revisit of 30s and 40s, right? Why
there? Because this is where we just

there? Because this is where we just
 

4935
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:22,709

looking for this. All right, or at least

5038
02:03:29,430 --> 02:03:29,440

looking for this, which we just got the
 

5041
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:34,149
looking for this, which we just got the
retest of this, right? If buyers reclaim

5042
02:03:34,149 --> 02:03:34,159
retest of this, right? If buyers reclaim
 

5043
02:03:34,159 --> 02:03:36,790
retest of this, right? If buyers reclaim
this, then we can argue we're going to

5045
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:38,950
this, then we can argue we're going to
use that liquidity. But right now, I see

5046
02:03:38,950 --> 02:03:38,960
use that liquidity. But right now, I see
 

5047
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:40,950
use that liquidity. But right now, I see
this as nothing more than a pullback. I

5048
02:03:40,950 --> 02:03:40,960
this as nothing more than a pullback. I
 

5049
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:43,270
this as nothing more than a pullback. I
know the range is big. I know that this

5050
02:03:43,270 --> 02:03:43,280
know the range is big. I know that this
 

5051
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:45,109
know the range is big. I know that this
has moved from 25,000. Well, it's like

5052
02:03:45,109 --> 02:03:45,119
has moved from 25,000. Well, it's like
 

5053
02:03:45,119 --> 02:03:47,430
has moved from 25,000. Well, it's like
what 200 point pullback, but that's

5054
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:47,440
what 200 point pullback, but that's
 

5055
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:49,350
what 200 point pullback, but that's
because we've done a five or 600 point

5056
02:03:49,350 --> 02:03:49,360
because we've done a five or 600 point
 

5057
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:51,430
because we've done a five or 600 point
sell. All right, so we've done a big

5058
02:03:51,430 --> 02:03:51,440
sell. All right, so we've done a big
 

5059
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:53,830
sell. All right, so we've done a big
sell pull back. I would expect this to

5060
02:03:53,830 --> 02:03:53,840
sell pull back. I would expect this to
 

5061
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:56,229
sell pull back. I would expect this to
get sold into somewhere around here. We

5062
02:03:56,229 --> 02:03:56,239
get sold into somewhere around here. We
 

5063
02:03:56,239 --> 02:03:59,669
get sold into somewhere around here. We
got that first cell down to the node. If

5064
02:03:59,669 --> 02:03:59,679
got that first cell down to the node. If
 

5065
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:01,750
got that first cell down to the node. If
they reclaim this level, then we can

5066
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:01,760
they reclaim this level, then we can
 

5067
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:03,830
they reclaim this level, then we can
think about that. Sure, I'm not going to

5068
02:04:03,830 --> 02:04:03,840
think about that. Sure, I'm not going to
 

5069
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:06,790
think about that. Sure, I'm not going to
argue with that. But right now,

5070
02:04:06,790 --> 02:04:06,800
argue with that. But right now,
 

5071
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:09,910
argue with that. But right now,
don't get too bullish biased here. Do

5072
02:04:09,910 --> 02:04:09,920
don't get too bullish biased here. Do
 

5073
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:15,589
don't get too bullish biased here. Do
not get too bullish biased here.

5074
02:04:15,589 --> 02:04:15,599

 

5075
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:18,229

Yeah, but the DJ is what 30 stocks which

5076
02:04:18,229 --> 02:04:18,239
Yeah, but the DJ is what 30 stocks which
 

5077
02:04:18,239 --> 02:04:22,470
Yeah, but the DJ is what 30 stocks which
are heavily manipulated. Um, and DJ has

5078
02:04:22,470 --> 02:04:22,480
are heavily manipulated. Um, and DJ has
 

5079
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:25,189
are heavily manipulated. Um, and DJ has
not got, if we have a look at the

5080
02:04:25,189 --> 02:04:25,199
not got, if we have a look at the
 

5081
02:04:25,199 --> 02:04:29,589
not got, if we have a look at the
breadth right now,

5082
02:04:29,589 --> 02:04:29,599

 

5083
02:04:29,599 --> 02:04:31,270

Vix is going lower. You are right. Vix

5084
02:04:31,270 --> 02:04:31,280
Vix is going lower. You are right. Vix
 

5085
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:33,189
Vix is going lower. You are right. Vix
is going lower.

5086
02:04:33,189 --> 02:04:33,199
is going lower.
 

5087
02:04:33,199 --> 02:04:36,149
is going lower.
If we look at the breadth right now,

5088
02:04:36,149 --> 02:04:36,159
If we look at the breadth right now,
 

5089
02:04:36,159 --> 02:04:38,470
If we look at the breadth right now,
this is probably going to like pause as

5090
02:04:38,470 --> 02:04:38,480
this is probably going to like pause as
 

5091
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:40,629
this is probably going to like pause as
soon as I bring it over. It always does.

5092
02:04:40,629 --> 02:04:40,639
soon as I bring it over. It always does.
 

5093
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:42,950
soon as I bring it over. It always does.
All right. That's the breadth

5094
02:04:42,950 --> 02:04:42,960
All right. That's the breadth
 

5095
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:45,750
All right. That's the breadth
all in ES. All right. All in ES. What's

5096
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:45,760
all in ES. All right. All in ES. What's
 

5097
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:48,790
all in ES. All right. All in ES. What's
big in NQ? This one. This one. This one.

5098
02:04:48,790 --> 02:04:48,800
big in NQ? This one. This one. This one.
 

5099
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:51,189
big in NQ? This one. This one. This one.
This one. This one. This one. So, all

5100
02:04:51,189 --> 02:04:51,199
This one. This one. This one. So, all
 

5101
02:04:51,199 --> 02:04:53,830
This one. This one. This one. So, all
the big boys other than Aqua Nvidia

5102
02:04:53,830 --> 02:04:53,840
the big boys other than Aqua Nvidia
 

5103
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:56,550
the big boys other than Aqua Nvidia
major cell. All right.

5104
02:04:56,550 --> 02:04:56,560
major cell. All right.
 

5105
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:59,350
major cell. All right.
What's big in YM? Hello.

5106
02:04:59,350 --> 02:04:59,360
What's big in YM? Hello.
 

5107
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:00,550
What's big in YM? Hello.
All right. So, why you think it's

5108
02:05:00,550 --> 02:05:00,560
All right. So, why you think it's
 

5109
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:02,229
All right. So, why you think it's
pushing? All right. So, it's breath.

5110
02:05:02,229 --> 02:05:02,239
pushing? All right. So, it's breath.
 

5111
02:05:02,239 --> 02:05:04,149
pushing? All right. So, it's breath.
It's breath rotation right now, which

5112
02:05:04,149 --> 02:05:04,159
It's breath rotation right now, which
 

5113
02:05:04,159 --> 02:05:06,470
It's breath rotation right now, which
has been the story since October last

5114
02:05:06,470 --> 02:05:06,480
has been the story since October last
 

5115
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:14,629
has been the story since October last
year.

5116
02:05:14,629 --> 02:05:14,639

 

5117
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:16,709

I mean, you say semis are pumping hard,

5118
02:05:16,709 --> 02:05:16,719
I mean, you say semis are pumping hard,
 

5119
02:05:16,719 --> 02:05:18,870
I mean, you say semis are pumping hard,
but you're acting like they're taking

5120
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:18,880
but you're acting like they're taking
 

5121
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:20,149
but you're acting like they're taking
out the highs when they're saying that.

5122
02:05:20,149 --> 02:05:20,159
out the highs when they're saying that.
 

5123
02:05:20,159 --> 02:05:22,149
out the highs when they're saying that.
They're rotating off the lows like ENQ

5124
02:05:22,149 --> 02:05:22,159
They're rotating off the lows like ENQ
 

5125
02:05:22,159 --> 02:05:25,669
They're rotating off the lows like ENQ
is. Can they reclaim is is the thing.

5126
02:05:25,669 --> 02:05:25,679
is. Can they reclaim is is the thing.
 

5127
02:05:25,679 --> 02:05:27,189
is. Can they reclaim is is the thing.
But

5128
02:05:27,189 --> 02:05:27,199
But
 

5129
02:05:27,199 --> 02:05:30,070
But
I would say look if if we start breaking

5130
02:05:30,070 --> 02:05:30,080
I would say look if if we start breaking
 

5131
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:32,629
I would say look if if we start breaking
out on Nvidia above that high that

5132
02:05:32,629 --> 02:05:32,639
out on Nvidia above that high that
 

5133
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:34,550
out on Nvidia above that high that
morning high which was also Monday's

5134
02:05:34,550 --> 02:05:34,560
morning high which was also Monday's
 

5135
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:36,870
morning high which was also Monday's
high, right, which we failed in twice.

5136
02:05:36,870 --> 02:05:36,880
high, right, which we failed in twice.
 

5137
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:39,109
high, right, which we failed in twice.
But if you look at Nvidia, it's pro

5138
02:05:39,109 --> 02:05:39,119
But if you look at Nvidia, it's pro
 

5139
02:05:39,119 --> 02:05:41,510
But if you look at Nvidia, it's pro
probably just doing a 61% retracement.

5140
02:05:41,510 --> 02:05:41,520
probably just doing a 61% retracement.
 

5141
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:44,229
probably just doing a 61% retracement.
Yeah, it's a golden zone retracement

5142
02:05:44,229 --> 02:05:44,239
Yeah, it's a golden zone retracement
 

5143
02:05:44,239 --> 02:05:46,550
Yeah, it's a golden zone retracement
until it proves otherwise. Same thing on

5144
02:05:46,550 --> 02:05:46,560
until it proves otherwise. Same thing on
 

5145
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:48,790
until it proves otherwise. Same thing on
this. I don't know what to say, guys.

5146
02:05:48,790 --> 02:05:48,800
this. I don't know what to say, guys.
 

5147
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:50,870
this. I don't know what to say, guys.
I'm trying to help the best I can, but

5148
02:05:50,870 --> 02:05:50,880
I'm trying to help the best I can, but
 

5149
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:52,310
I'm trying to help the best I can, but
I'm not going to fight with you guys. If

5150
02:05:52,310 --> 02:05:52,320
I'm not going to fight with you guys. If
 

5151
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:53,669
I'm not going to fight with you guys. If
you guys just want to long this because

5152
02:05:53,669 --> 02:05:53,679
you guys just want to long this because
 

5153
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:55,910
you guys just want to long this because
you think the market's pumping and it

5154
02:05:55,910 --> 02:05:55,920
you think the market's pumping and it
 

5155
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:57,589
you think the market's pumping and it
has to go higher, like I said, it's your

5156
02:05:57,589 --> 02:05:57,599
has to go higher, like I said, it's your
 

5157
02:05:57,599 --> 02:05:59,189
has to go higher, like I said, it's your
book. You do what you want. But all I

5158
02:05:59,189 --> 02:05:59,199
book. You do what you want. But all I
 

5159
02:05:59,199 --> 02:06:00,950
book. You do what you want. But all I
know is we've left volume, we've left

5160
02:06:00,950 --> 02:06:00,960
know is we've left volume, we've left
 

5161
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:03,350
know is we've left volume, we've left
weekly volume, we've broken down, we're

5162
02:06:03,350 --> 02:06:03,360
weekly volume, we've broken down, we're
 

5163
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:05,189
weekly volume, we've broken down, we're
pumping back up to retest that. We are

5164
02:06:05,189 --> 02:06:05,199
pumping back up to retest that. We are
 

5165
02:06:05,199 --> 02:06:07,270
pumping back up to retest that. We are
likely to try and trade lower. We need

5166
02:06:07,270 --> 02:06:07,280
likely to try and trade lower. We need
 

5167
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:09,830
likely to try and trade lower. We need
to get under this. But the higher

5168
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:09,840
to get under this. But the higher
 

5169
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:11,669
to get under this. But the higher
probability right now is here to here.

5170
02:06:11,669 --> 02:06:11,679
probability right now is here to here.
 

5171
02:06:11,679 --> 02:06:13,510
probability right now is here to here.
And if we lose this here to here, the

5172
02:06:13,510 --> 02:06:13,520
And if we lose this here to here, the
 

5173
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:15,589
And if we lose this here to here, the
lower probability right now is to bid

5174
02:06:15,589 --> 02:06:15,599
lower probability right now is to bid
 

5175
02:06:15,599 --> 02:06:17,750
lower probability right now is to bid
here expecting this. That is not a high

5176
02:06:17,750 --> 02:06:17,760
here expecting this. That is not a high
 

5177
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:20,310
here expecting this. That is not a high
probability move. Sometimes it happens.

5178
02:06:20,310 --> 02:06:20,320
probability move. Sometimes it happens.
 

5179
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:22,070
probability move. Sometimes it happens.
I will not deny it. Sometimes it

5180
02:06:22,070 --> 02:06:22,080
I will not deny it. Sometimes it
 

5181
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:23,990
I will not deny it. Sometimes it
happens. Zero TTE goes absolutely

5182
02:06:23,990 --> 02:06:24,000
happens. Zero TTE goes absolutely
 

5183
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,709
happens. Zero TTE goes absolutely
bonkers and we go [\h__\h] mad. But that

5184
02:06:26,709 --> 02:06:26,719
bonkers and we go [\h__\h] mad. But that
 

5185
02:06:26,719 --> 02:06:32,310
bonkers and we go [\h__\h] mad. But that
is less probable.

02:06:55,199 --> 02:06:56,390

5203
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:00,950
cool, that's fine. If you've just shown
up now and you're going to question

5204
02:07:00,950 --> 02:07:00,960
up now and you're going to question
 

5205
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:02,790
up now and you're going to question
everything when we've nailed over 200

5206
02:07:02,790 --> 02:07:02,800
everything when we've nailed over 200
 

5207

everything when we've nailed over 200
points today, it's up to you, mate. It's

It's totally up to you.

5215
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:23,990

S&P back to green. Not saying we're

5216
02:07:23,990 --> 02:07:24,000
S&P back to green. Not saying we're
 

5217
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,470
S&P back to green. Not saying we're
pumping. I mean,

5218
02:07:26,470 --> 02:07:26,480
pumping. I mean,
 

5219
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:29,430
pumping. I mean,
okay.

5220
02:07:29,430 --> 02:07:29,440
okay.
 

5221
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:31,910
okay.
Where's it back to, though? Look, I'll

5222
02:07:31,910 --> 02:07:31,920
Where's it back to, though? Look, I'll
 

5223

try and help you guys here.
Zoom out. Okay. It's gone. It's gone

5226
02:07:37,350 --> 02:07:37,360
Zoom out. Okay. It's gone. It's gone
 

5227
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:39,990
Zoom out. Okay. It's gone. It's gone
green.

5228
02:07:39,990 --> 02:07:40,000
green.
 

5229
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:43,669
green.
It's a nice recovery.

5230
02:07:43,669 --> 02:07:43,679
It's a nice recovery.
 

5231
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:48,470
It's a nice recovery.
How good is it really?

5232
02:07:48,470 --> 02:07:48,480

 

5233
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:51,030

How good is it really? All right. How

5234
02:07:51,030 --> 02:07:51,040
How good is it really? All right. How
 

5235
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:53,270
How good is it really? All right. How
good is it really?

5236
02:07:53,270 --> 02:07:53,280
good is it really?
 

5237
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:56,470
good is it really?
Big sell.

5238
02:07:56,470 --> 02:07:56,480
Big sell.
 

5239
02:07:56,480 --> 02:07:58,229
Big sell.
Okay. Failed to break lower here. Can't

5240
02:07:58,229 --> 02:07:58,239
Okay. Failed to break lower here. Can't
 

5241
02:07:58,239 --> 02:07:59,990
Okay. Failed to break lower here. Can't
deny it. Failed to break lower. That's

5242
02:07:59,990 --> 02:08:00,000
deny it. Failed to break lower. That's
 

5243
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,310
deny it. Failed to break lower. That's
the start of the relief. Where is it

5244
02:08:02,310 --> 02:08:02,320
the start of the relief. Where is it
 

5245
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:04,550
the start of the relief. Where is it
likely to sell? Between here and here,

5246
02:08:04,550 --> 02:08:04,560
likely to sell? Between here and here,
 

5247
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:06,069
likely to sell? Between here and here,
right? They are likely to sell it

5248
02:08:06,069 --> 02:08:06,079
right? They are likely to sell it
 

5249
02:08:06,079 --> 02:08:08,069
right? They are likely to sell it
somewhere in there, right? And they're

5250
02:08:08,069 --> 02:08:08,079
somewhere in there, right? And they're
 

5251
02:08:08,079 --> 02:08:10,550
somewhere in there, right? And they're
likely to look to return probably to 90

5252
02:08:10,550 --> 02:08:10,560
likely to look to return probably to 90
 

5253
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:12,229
likely to look to return probably to 90
to retest that. I'm not saying it has to

5254
02:08:12,229 --> 02:08:12,239
to retest that. I'm not saying it has to
 

5255
02:08:12,239 --> 02:08:15,030
to retest that. I'm not saying it has to
break down, but just cuz it's doing this

5256
02:08:15,030 --> 02:08:15,040
break down, but just cuz it's doing this
 

5257
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:19,030
break down, but just cuz it's doing this
when you're like big pump, it it's moved

5258
02:08:19,030 --> 02:08:19,040
when you're like big pump, it it's moved
 

5259
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:22,629
when you're like big pump, it it's moved
50% off a 100% move. It's it's retraced

5260
02:08:22,629 --> 02:08:22,639
50% off a 100% move. It's it's retraced
 

5261
02:08:22,639 --> 02:08:25,990
50% off a 100% move. It's it's retraced
50% which is likely somewhere around

5262
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:26,000
50% which is likely somewhere around
 

5263
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,069
50% which is likely somewhere around
that to be sold into. Likely somewhere

5264
02:08:28,069 --> 02:08:28,079
that to be sold into. Likely somewhere
 

5265
02:08:28,079 --> 02:08:29,510
that to be sold into. Likely somewhere
around that to be sold into, right?

5266
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:29,520
around that to be sold into, right?
 

5267
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:30,790
around that to be sold into, right?
Which is what you're seeing. So to call

5268
02:08:30,790 --> 02:08:30,800
Which is what you're seeing. So to call
 

5269
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:33,189
Which is what you're seeing. So to call
this a big pump for me, it's not a big

5270
02:08:33,189 --> 02:08:33,199
this a big pump for me, it's not a big
 

5271
02:08:33,199 --> 02:08:34,950
this a big pump for me, it's not a big
pump. A big pump would be like this.

5272
02:08:34,950 --> 02:08:34,960
pump. A big pump would be like this.
 

5273
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:38,470
pump. A big pump would be like this.
Okay, that's a big [\h__\h] pump. Sure.

5274
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:38,480
Okay, that's a big [\h__\h] pump. Sure.
 

5275
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:41,030
Okay, that's a big [\h__\h] pump. Sure.
Right. And we see that sometimes. we see

5276
02:08:41,030 --> 02:08:41,040
Right. And we see that sometimes. we see
 

5277
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:43,830
Right. And we see that sometimes. we see
that. I don't think this is that. I

5278
02:08:43,830 --> 02:08:43,840
that. I don't think this is that. I
 

5279
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:45,030
that. I don't think this is that. I
think this is like failure to break

5280
02:08:45,030 --> 02:08:45,040
think this is like failure to break
 

5281
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:46,550
think this is like failure to break
lower, failure to break lower. No wants

5282
02:08:46,550 --> 02:08:46,560
lower, failure to break lower. No wants
 

5283
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:48,149
lower, failure to break lower. No wants
to short the lows. They're waiting for a

5284
02:08:48,149 --> 02:08:48,159
to short the lows. They're waiting for a
 

5285
02:08:48,159 --> 02:08:49,830
to short the lows. They're waiting for a
retracement into a level which they can

5286
02:08:49,830 --> 02:08:49,840
retracement into a level which they can
 

5287
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:53,270
retracement into a level which they can
sell into. That would be my view on this

5288
02:08:53,270 --> 02:08:53,280
sell into. That would be my view on this
 

5289
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:55,270
sell into. That would be my view on this
on this market right now. But it's just

5290
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:55,280
on this market right now. But it's just
 

5291
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:57,109
on this market right now. But it's just
my view. What do I know? Let's see how

5292
02:08:57,109 --> 02:08:57,119
my view. What do I know? Let's see how
 

5293
02:08:57,119 --> 02:08:58,629
my view. What do I know? Let's see how
it plays out. Alex might be wrong and

5294
02:08:58,629 --> 02:08:58,639
it plays out. Alex might be wrong and
 

5295
02:08:58,639 --> 02:09:00,470
it plays out. Alex might be wrong and
I'm happy to be wrong, but like I said,

5296
02:09:00,470 --> 02:09:00,480
I'm happy to be wrong, but like I said,
 

5297
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:02,629
I'm happy to be wrong, but like I said,
I think somewhere between here and here

5298
02:09:02,629 --> 02:09:02,639
I think somewhere between here and here
 

5299
02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:04,629
I think somewhere between here and here
will be an area that they will want to

5300
02:09:04,629 --> 02:09:04,639
will be an area that they will want to
 

5301
02:09:04,639 --> 02:09:07,109
will be an area that they will want to
sell right down to here. And under here,

5302
02:09:07,109 --> 02:09:07,119
sell right down to here. And under here,
 

5303
02:09:07,119 --> 02:09:08,709
sell right down to here. And under here,
they will look to try and get down into

5304
02:09:08,709 --> 02:09:08,719
they will look to try and get down into
 

5305
02:09:08,719 --> 02:09:28,550
they will look to try and get down into
these

5306
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:28,560

 

5307
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:30,629

How did I get those candles with Ninja

5308
02:09:30,629 --> 02:09:30,639
How did I get those candles with Ninja
 

5309
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:34,310
How did I get those candles with Ninja
with the Delta? Uh, it's from a place

5315
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:43,830
uh
have to look it up. I remember what the

5316
02:09:43,830 --> 02:09:43,840
have to look it up. I remember what the
 

5317
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:45,030
have to look it up. I remember what the
indicator is called, but it's Twin

5318
02:09:45,030 --> 02:09:45,040
indicator is called, but it's Twin
 

5319
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:46,709
indicator is called, but it's Twin
Peaks.

5320
02:09:46,709 --> 02:09:46,719
Peaks.
 

5321
02:09:46,719 --> 02:10:04,550
Peaks.
Uh, I can post it in chat. Hang on.

5322
02:10:04,550 --> 02:10:04,560

 

5323
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:06,470

There you go. You get like a 5% discount

5324
02:10:06,470 --> 02:10:06,480
There you go. You get like a 5% discount
 

5325
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:15,990
There you go. You get like a 5% discount

5326
02:10:15,990 --> 02:10:16,000

 

5327
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,589

It could try and hold and grind to

5328
02:10:17,589 --> 02:10:17,599
It could try and hold and grind to
 

5329
02:10:17,599 --> 02:10:19,270
It could try and hold and grind to
that's it for big moves. Yeah, it could

5330
02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:19,280
that's it for big moves. Yeah, it could
 

5331
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:20,950
that's it for big moves. Yeah, it could
like it can come up to here. Like we

5332
02:10:20,950 --> 02:10:20,960
like it can come up to here. Like we
 

5333
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:22,629
like it can come up to here. Like we
said, it can come up to here. A back

5334
02:10:22,629 --> 02:10:22,639
said, it can come up to here. A back
 

5335
02:10:22,639 --> 02:10:24,950
said, it can come up to here. A back
test of here is very very possible. It

5336
02:10:24,950 --> 02:10:24,960
test of here is very very possible. It
 

5337
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:27,109
test of here is very very possible. It
can come up to here.

5338
02:10:27,109 --> 02:10:27,119
can come up to here.
 

5339
02:10:27,119 --> 02:10:29,109
can come up to here.
But like I'm not going to buy this here.

5340
02:10:29,109 --> 02:10:29,119
But like I'm not going to buy this here.
 

5341
02:10:29,119 --> 02:10:31,510
But like I'm not going to buy this here.
I'd much rather wait for buyers to get

5342
02:10:31,510 --> 02:10:31,520
I'd much rather wait for buyers to get
 

5343
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:33,189
I'd much rather wait for buyers to get
short, wait for buyers to get trapped

5344
02:10:33,189 --> 02:10:33,199
short, wait for buyers to get trapped
 

5345
02:10:33,199 --> 02:10:34,709
short, wait for buyers to get trapped
and look for the short back down like we

5346
02:10:34,709 --> 02:10:34,719
and look for the short back down like we
 

5347
02:10:34,719 --> 02:10:36,069
and look for the short back down like we
just did here. We just had this move

5348
02:10:36,069 --> 02:10:36,079
just did here. We just had this move
 

5349
02:10:36,079 --> 02:10:37,830
just did here. We just had this move
here, right?

5350
02:10:37,830 --> 02:10:37,840
here, right?
 

5351
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:41,510
here, right?
So the plays today were

5352
02:10:41,510 --> 02:10:41,520
So the plays today were
 

5353
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:43,830
So the plays today were
the leave of here. Was it 40s? I'm

5354
02:10:43,830 --> 02:10:43,840
the leave of here. Was it 40s? I'm
 

5355
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:45,189
the leave of here. Was it 40s? I'm
trying to remember. It was up here,

5356
02:10:45,189 --> 02:10:45,199
trying to remember. It was up here,
 

5357
02:10:45,199 --> 02:10:51,750
trying to remember. It was up here,
wasn't it? So

5358
02:10:51,750 --> 02:10:51,760

 

5359
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:54,470

this

5360
02:10:54,470 --> 02:10:54,480
this
 

5361
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:56,390
this
some of you got all the way down into

5362
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:56,400
some of you got all the way down into
 

5363
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:58,870
some of you got all the way down into
10. Tens was the cover point. All right.

5364
02:10:58,870 --> 02:10:58,880
10. Tens was the cover point. All right.
 

5365
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:01,350
10. Tens was the cover point. All right.
So some of you got this,

5366
02:11:01,350 --> 02:11:01,360
So some of you got this,
 

5367
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:06,390
So some of you got this,
right? And then we just had

5368
02:11:06,390 --> 02:11:06,400

 

5369
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:11,430

this,

5370
02:11:11,430 --> 02:11:11,440

 

5371
02:11:11,440 --> 02:11:13,430

right? And now we're waiting. If they

5372
02:11:13,430 --> 02:11:13,440
right? And now we're waiting. If they
 

5373
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:15,589
right? And now we're waiting. If they
lift it, like I said, if if they want to

5374
02:11:15,589 --> 02:11:15,599
lift it, like I said, if if they want to
 

5375
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:17,910
lift it, like I said, if if they want to
go turbo today,

5376
02:11:17,910 --> 02:11:17,920
go turbo today,
 

5377
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:19,910
go turbo today,
fine. Go [\h__\h] turbo with it all you

5378
02:11:19,910 --> 02:11:19,920
fine. Go [\h__\h] turbo with it all you
 

5379
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:22,470
fine. Go [\h__\h] turbo with it all you
want, guys. Uh I will not be playing

5380
02:11:22,470 --> 02:11:22,480
want, guys. Uh I will not be playing
 

5381
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:25,589
want, guys. Uh I will not be playing
long from here when I I quite literally

5382
02:11:25,589 --> 02:11:25,599
long from here when I I quite literally
 

5383
02:11:25,599 --> 02:11:27,350
long from here when I I quite literally
know that we've just left volume. All

5384
02:11:27,350 --> 02:11:27,360
know that we've just left volume. All
 

5385
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:30,550
know that we've just left volume. All
I'm looking at is the Audi. I don't give

5386
02:11:30,550 --> 02:11:30,560
I'm looking at is the Audi. I don't give
 

5387
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:32,229
I'm looking at is the Audi. I don't give
a care about anything else. All I'm

5388
02:11:32,229 --> 02:11:32,239
a care about anything else. All I'm
 

5389
02:11:32,239 --> 02:11:34,790
a care about anything else. All I'm
looking at is who's trapped this week.

5390
02:11:34,790 --> 02:11:34,800
looking at is who's trapped this week.
 

5391
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:37,270
looking at is who's trapped this week.
They are trapped here. And until we

5392
02:11:37,270 --> 02:11:37,280
They are trapped here. And until we
 

5393
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:40,629
They are trapped here. And until we
reclaim that, they are in trouble. Until

5394
02:11:40,629 --> 02:11:40,639
reclaim that, they are in trouble. Until
 

5395
02:11:40,639 --> 02:11:43,589
reclaim that, they are in trouble. Until
we reclaim this node here from Sunday,

5396
02:11:43,589 --> 02:11:43,599
we reclaim this node here from Sunday,
 

5397
02:11:43,599 --> 02:11:45,830
we reclaim this node here from Sunday,
they are in trouble. All right. So, I

5398
02:11:45,830 --> 02:11:45,840
they are in trouble. All right. So, I
 

5399
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:48,149
they are in trouble. All right. So, I
would expect them to try and sell this

5400
02:11:48,149 --> 02:11:48,159
would expect them to try and sell this
 

5401
02:11:48,159 --> 02:11:51,189
would expect them to try and sell this
for a move back down. And if we break

5402
02:11:51,189 --> 02:11:51,199
for a move back down. And if we break
 

5403
02:11:51,199 --> 02:11:53,589
for a move back down. And if we break
down there, my expectation is we will

5404
02:11:53,589 --> 02:11:53,599
down there, my expectation is we will
 

5405
02:11:53,599 --> 02:11:56,550
down there, my expectation is we will
revisit this at some point this week. If

5406
02:11:56,550 --> 02:11:56,560
revisit this at some point this week. If
 

5407
02:11:56,560 --> 02:11:58,950
revisit this at some point this week. If
we reclaim this range,

5408
02:11:58,950 --> 02:11:58,960
we reclaim this range,
 

5409
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:01,510
we reclaim this range,
then I will shut my mouth and we will go

5410
02:12:01,510 --> 02:12:01,520
then I will shut my mouth and we will go
 

5411
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:03,270
then I will shut my mouth and we will go
in range rotation and I will not touch

5412
02:12:03,270 --> 02:12:03,280
in range rotation and I will not touch
 

5413
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:05,350
in range rotation and I will not touch
it. And if we get above here, then Alex

5414
02:12:05,350 --> 02:12:05,360
it. And if we get above here, then Alex
 

5415
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:06,790
it. And if we get above here, then Alex
will tell you we're going to pump up

5416
02:12:06,790 --> 02:12:06,800
will tell you we're going to pump up
 

5417
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:08,709
will tell you we're going to pump up
here and then we're going to set a trap.

5418
02:12:08,709 --> 02:12:08,719
here and then we're going to set a trap.
 

5419
02:12:08,719 --> 02:12:10,229
here and then we're going to set a trap.
And that might be later in the week, but

5420
02:12:10,229 --> 02:12:10,239
And that might be later in the week, but
 

5421
02:12:10,239 --> 02:12:12,069
And that might be later in the week, but
I don't think we will do that now. They

5422
02:12:12,069 --> 02:12:12,079
I don't think we will do that now. They
 

5423
02:12:12,079 --> 02:12:13,430
I don't think we will do that now. They
should have done that today if they were

5424
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:13,440
should have done that today if they were
 

5425
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:15,189
should have done that today if they were
going to do it. But hey, look, these are

5426
02:12:15,189 --> 02:12:15,199
going to do it. But hey, look, these are
 

5427
02:12:15,199 --> 02:12:18,069
going to do it. But hey, look, these are
just my ideas and my thesis. What do I

5428
02:12:18,069 --> 02:12:18,079
just my ideas and my thesis. What do I
 

5429
02:12:18,079 --> 02:12:20,390
just my ideas and my thesis. What do I
know? Not a lot.

5430
02:12:20,390 --> 02:12:20,400
know? Not a lot.
 

5431
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:21,830
know? Not a lot.
I always talk about I'm just a

5432
02:12:21,830 --> 02:12:21,840
I always talk about I'm just a
 

5433
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:24,629
I always talk about I'm just a
40-year-old man who's pissed off most of

5434
02:12:24,629 --> 02:12:24,639
40-year-old man who's pissed off most of
 

5435
02:12:24,639 --> 02:12:32,550
40-year-old man who's pissed off most of
the time. Grumpy old man.

5436
02:12:32,550 --> 02:12:32,560

 

5437
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:34,629

Yeah. 50 to 61 retracement. Yeah,

5438
02:12:34,629 --> 02:12:34,639
Yeah. 50 to 61 retracement. Yeah,
 

5439
02:12:34,639 --> 02:12:37,669
Yeah. 50 to 61 retracement. Yeah,
exactly. So, you could line it up with

5440
02:12:37,669 --> 02:12:37,679
exactly. So, you could line it up with
 

5441
02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:40,069
exactly. So, you could line it up with
the IB

5442
02:12:40,069 --> 02:12:40,079
the IB
 

5443
02:12:40,079 --> 02:12:42,069
the IB
here to here. All right. We're right at

5444
02:12:42,069 --> 02:12:42,079
here to here. All right. We're right at
 

5445
02:12:42,079 --> 02:12:44,550
here to here. All right. We're right at
the 50 right now. The 61 would be into

5446
02:12:44,550 --> 02:12:44,560
the 50 right now. The 61 would be into
 

5447
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:46,950
the 50 right now. The 61 would be into
the 300. It's a GEX level as well, which

5448
02:12:46,950 --> 02:12:46,960
the 300. It's a GEX level as well, which
 

5449
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:48,550
the 300. It's a GEX level as well, which
we should have held earlier and chose

5450
02:12:48,550 --> 02:12:48,560
we should have held earlier and chose
 

5451
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:49,990
we should have held earlier and chose
not to hold and sold through. So, we

5452
02:12:49,990 --> 02:12:50,000
not to hold and sold through. So, we
 

5453
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,350
not to hold and sold through. So, we
know there'll probably be sellers

5454
02:12:51,350 --> 02:12:51,360
know there'll probably be sellers
 

5455
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:53,189
know there'll probably be sellers
hanging out there again, right? So, and

5456
02:12:53,189 --> 02:12:53,199
hanging out there again, right? So, and
 

5457
02:12:53,199 --> 02:12:54,790
hanging out there again, right? So, and
we have this node developing here now.

5458
02:12:54,790 --> 02:12:54,800
we have this node developing here now.
 

5459
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:56,550
we have this node developing here now.
So, if they lift through this node, they

5460
02:12:56,550 --> 02:12:56,560
So, if they lift through this node, they
 

5461
02:12:56,560 --> 02:12:59,109
So, if they lift through this node, they
will try and lift to 300. If they get

5462
02:12:59,109 --> 02:12:59,119
will try and lift to 300. If they get
 

5463
02:12:59,119 --> 02:13:01,910
will try and lift to 300. If they get
through 300, arguably the squeeze is on

5464
02:13:01,910 --> 02:13:01,920
through 300, arguably the squeeze is on
 

5465
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:04,069
through 300, arguably the squeeze is on
to 364, right? We're very, very thin. If

5466
02:13:04,069 --> 02:13:04,079
to 364, right? We're very, very thin. If
 

5467
02:13:04,079 --> 02:13:05,830
to 364, right? We're very, very thin. If
they get over 300 and they don't sell

5468
02:13:05,830 --> 02:13:05,840
they get over 300 and they don't sell
 

5469
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:18,709
they get over 300 and they don't sell
it, arguably the squeeze is on.

5470
02:13:18,709 --> 02:13:18,719

 

5471
02:13:18,719 --> 02:13:21,109

I look 30.

5472
02:13:21,109 --> 02:13:21,119
I look 30.
 

5473
02:13:21,119 --> 02:13:24,709
I look 30.
I'll take that.

5474
02:13:24,709 --> 02:13:24,719

 

5475
02:13:24,719 --> 02:13:26,629

Where did I learn orderflow from? Just

5476
02:13:26,629 --> 02:13:26,639
Where did I learn orderflow from? Just
 

5477
02:13:26,639 --> 02:13:28,790
Where did I learn orderflow from? Just
selftaught really. I've used bookmap

5478
02:13:28,790 --> 02:13:28,800
selftaught really. I've used bookmap
 

5479
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:32,310
selftaught really. I've used bookmap
forever. I used to use bookmap in uh in

5480
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:32,320
forever. I used to use bookmap in uh in
 

5481
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:34,709
forever. I used to use bookmap in uh in
uh small caps. Bookmap is so useful in

5482
02:13:34,709 --> 02:13:34,719
uh small caps. Bookmap is so useful in
 

5483
02:13:34,719 --> 02:13:37,750
uh small caps. Bookmap is so useful in
small caps because you can see the uh

5484
02:13:37,750 --> 02:13:37,760
small caps because you can see the uh
 

5485
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:39,990
small caps because you can see the uh
the manipulation really well. Reading a

5486
02:13:39,990 --> 02:13:40,000
the manipulation really well. Reading a
 

5487
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,470
the manipulation really well. Reading a
tape in small caps is [\h__\h]

5488
02:13:42,470 --> 02:13:42,480
tape in small caps is [\h__\h]
 

5489
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:44,149
tape in small caps is [\h__\h]
impossible.

5490
02:13:44,149 --> 02:13:44,159
impossible.
 

5491
02:13:44,159 --> 02:13:52,069
impossible.
Well, at least I found it impossible.

5492
02:13:52,069 --> 02:13:52,079

 

5493
02:13:52,079 --> 02:13:55,910

Thanks, Carol.

5494
02:13:55,910 --> 02:13:55,920

 

5495
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:57,350

Will you be happy if Arsenal wins

5496
02:13:57,350 --> 02:13:57,360
Will you be happy if Arsenal wins
 

5497
02:13:57,360 --> 02:13:58,790
Will you be happy if Arsenal wins
something? Yeah. Well, obviously that

5498
02:13:58,790 --> 02:13:58,800
something? Yeah. Well, obviously that
 

5499
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:05,430
something? Yeah. Well, obviously that
would delight me. It's been a long wait.

5500
02:14:05,430 --> 02:14:05,440

 

5501
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:07,030

I missed the move earlier cuz I had to

5502
02:14:07,030 --> 02:14:07,040
I missed the move earlier cuz I had to
 

5503
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:09,189

buyers get caught on bookmap and
 

5527

buyers get caught on bookmap and
aggressive sellers start to go from

02:14:38,229 --> 02:14:38,239
aggressive sellers start to go from
 

5529
02:14:38,239 --> 02:14:40,069
aggressive sellers start to go from
passive sellers to aggression and then

5530
02:14:40,069 --> 02:14:40,079
passive sellers to aggression and then

I'm new here. Is this guy good? No, he's
terrible.

5556
02:15:18,470 --> 02:15:18,480

 

5557
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:20,790

Do I recommend leaving limit orders in

5558
02:15:20,790 --> 02:15:20,800
Do I recommend leaving limit orders in
 

5559
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:23,910
Do I recommend leaving limit orders in
key areas? Uh, no, not really. I think

5560
02:15:23,910 --> 02:15:23,920
key areas? Uh, no, not really. I think
 

5561
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:25,510
key areas? Uh, no, not really. I think
it's really dangerous to do that unless

5562
02:15:25,510 --> 02:15:25,520
it's really dangerous to do that unless
 

5563
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:28,310
it's really dangerous to do that unless
you're playing a pullback.

5564
02:15:28,310 --> 02:15:28,320
you're playing a pullback.
 

5565
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:29,510
you're playing a pullback.
Unless you're playing a pullback

5566
02:15:29,510 --> 02:15:29,520
Unless you're playing a pullback
 

5567
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:31,270
Unless you're playing a pullback
protrend, I think it's dangerous to do

5568
02:15:31,270 --> 02:15:31,280
protrend, I think it's dangerous to do
 

5569
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:33,350
protrend, I think it's dangerous to do
that. I think it's better to look for

5570
02:15:33,350 --> 02:15:33,360
that. I think it's better to look for
 

5571
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:36,470
that. I think it's better to look for
what happens in that area.

5572
02:15:36,470 --> 02:15:36,480
what happens in that area.
 

5573
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:39,350
what happens in that area.

We might even gap fill and still bid,
 

5593
02:16:02,079 --> 02:16:05,430
We might even gap fill and still bid,
right? So, if this is the first push,

5594

the slightest. It's not my favorite
 

5647
02:17:16,880 --> 02:17:19,669
the slightest. It's not my favorite
stock. I'll be honest. Uh it does have

stock. I'll be honest. Uh it does have
 

5649
02:17:19,679 --> 02:17:21,990
stock. I'll be honest. Uh it does have
some potential debt issues, but I do

5650
02:17:21,990 --> 02:17:22,000
some potential debt issues, but I do
 

5651
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,589
some potential debt issues, but I do
think they've oversold it. I do prefer

think they've oversold it. I do prefer
 

5653
02:17:23,599 --> 02:17:27,110

don't think he uses higher time frame
 

5815
02:21:23,439 --> 02:21:26,309
don't think he uses higher time frame
too much. Um but I like Pat. I got no

too much. Um but I like Pat. I got no
issue with Pat whatsoever. I think he's

5818
02:21:28,469 --> 02:21:28,479

5819
02:21:28,479 --> 02:21:30,070

done a lot for the industry. I think
 

5821
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:32,309
done a lot for the industry. I think

people talk a lot of [\h__\h] Pat has gone
 

5823
02:21:32,319 --> 02:21:34,309
people talk a lot of [\h__\h] Pat has gone
through a lot. If you follow through

5824
02:21:34,309 --> 02:21:34,319
through a lot. If you follow through
 

5825
02:21:34,319 --> 02:21:35,910
through a lot. If you follow through
followed Patty for a long time, you will

5826
02:21:35,910 --> 02:21:35,920
followed Patty for a long time, you will
 

5827
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:38,070

kudos to because he's a self-made man
 

5835
02:21:44,479 --> 02:21:47,670
kudos to because he's a self-made man
and that I respect no matter what. No

02:21:47,670 --> 02:21:47,680
and that I respect no matter what. No
 

5837
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:57,190
and that I respect no matter what. No

5838
02:21:57,190 --> 02:21:57,200

 

5839
02:21:57,200 --> 02:21:59,270

Made a joke and night yelled at you. You

5840
02:21:59,270 --> 02:21:59,280
Made a joke and night yelled at you. You
 

5841
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:00,389
Made a joke and night yelled at you. You
probably did it in capital or something.

5842
02:22:00,389 --> 02:22:00,399
probably did it in capital or something.
 

5843
02:22:00,399 --> 02:22:03,750
probably did it in capital or something.
Don't worry, it's it's not a big deal.

5844
02:22:03,750 --> 02:22:03,760
Don't worry, it's it's not a big deal.
 

5845
02:22:03,760 --> 02:22:05,990
Don't worry, it's it's not a big deal.
Can we visit today's lows? Uh, let me

5846
02:22:05,990 --> 02:22:06,000
Can we visit today's lows? Uh, let me
 

5847
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:07,910
Can we visit today's lows? Uh, let me
have a look. You've got to get under

5848
02:22:07,910 --> 02:22:07,920
have a look. You've got to get under
 

5849
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:09,750
have a look. You've got to get under
this first, right? So, the first trade

5850
02:22:09,750 --> 02:22:09,760
this first, right? So, the first trade
 

5851
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:11,590
this first, right? So, the first trade
we talked about trapping buyers up here

5852
02:22:11,590 --> 02:22:11,600
we talked about trapping buyers up here
 

5853
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:13,030
we talked about trapping buyers up here
and trading back down to here. You need

5854
02:22:13,030 --> 02:22:13,040
and trading back down to here. You need
 

5855
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:14,950
and trading back down to here. You need
to get under this and then maybe we can

5856
02:22:14,950 --> 02:22:14,960
to get under this and then maybe we can
 

5857
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:16,150
to get under this and then maybe we can
have a look. I'll have a look on this

5858
02:22:16,150 --> 02:22:16,160
have a look. I'll have a look on this
 

5859
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:17,510
have a look. I'll have a look on this
one for you so you guys can all see it

5860
02:22:17,510 --> 02:22:17,520
one for you so you guys can all see it
 

5861
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:19,510
one for you so you guys can all see it
rather than my ninja one. Let's have a

5862
02:22:19,510 --> 02:22:19,520
rather than my ninja one. Let's have a
 

5863
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:22,230
rather than my ninja one. Let's have a
look at what we did. Did we trap buyers

5864
02:22:22,230 --> 02:22:22,240
look at what we did. Did we trap buyers
 

5865
02:22:22,240 --> 02:22:29,910
look at what we did. Did we trap buyers
at the highs?

5866
02:22:29,910 --> 02:22:29,920

 

5867
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:31,429

Strong selling up there. I'm going to

5868
02:22:31,429 --> 02:22:31,439
Strong selling up there. I'm going to
 

5869
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:33,190
Strong selling up there. I'm going to
compare this to ninja in a second just

5870
02:22:33,190 --> 02:22:33,200
compare this to ninja in a second just
 

5871
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:35,590
compare this to ninja in a second just
out of interest. All right. into some of

5872
02:22:35,590 --> 02:22:35,600
out of interest. All right. into some of
 

5873
02:22:35,600 --> 02:22:37,110
out of interest. All right. into some of
these imbalances which were starting to

5874
02:22:37,110 --> 02:22:37,120
these imbalances which were starting to
 

5875
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:38,710
these imbalances which were starting to
fill. Let's have a look at the low of

5876
02:22:38,710 --> 02:22:38,720
fill. Let's have a look at the low of
 

5877
02:22:38,720 --> 02:22:40,469
fill. Let's have a look at the low of
day. What was the auction like at low of

5878
02:22:40,469 --> 02:22:40,479
day. What was the auction like at low of
 

5879
02:22:40,479 --> 02:22:42,630
day. What was the auction like at low of
day? They good excess. Not great. All

5880
02:22:42,630 --> 02:22:42,640
day? They good excess. Not great. All
 

5881
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:46,230
day? They good excess. Not great. All
right. So, we can probably

5882
02:22:46,230 --> 02:22:46,240
right. So, we can probably
 

5883
02:22:46,240 --> 02:22:48,389
right. So, we can probably
What would I be looking at? 100s for

5884
02:22:48,389 --> 02:22:48,399
What would I be looking at? 100s for
 

5885
02:22:48,399 --> 02:22:51,750
What would I be looking at? 100s for
sure. And

5886
02:22:51,750 --> 02:22:51,760
sure. And
 

5887
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:54,389
sure. And
yeah, 70s we can maybe do it. Let me

5888
02:22:54,389 --> 02:22:54,399
yeah, 70s we can maybe do it. Let me
 

5889
02:22:54,399 --> 02:22:55,830
yeah, 70s we can maybe do it. Let me
just check ninja now because sometimes

5890
02:22:55,830 --> 02:22:55,840
just check ninja now because sometimes
 

5891
02:22:55,840 --> 02:22:58,309
just check ninja now because sometimes
it's a bit more accurate.

5892
02:22:58,309 --> 02:22:58,319
it's a bit more accurate.
 

5893
02:22:58,319 --> 02:23:00,550
it's a bit more accurate.
Is definitely more accurate. Okay. This

5894
02:23:00,550 --> 02:23:00,560
Is definitely more accurate. Okay. This
 

5895
02:23:00,560 --> 02:23:02,870
Is definitely more accurate. Okay. This
is what I'm seeing on NT. Right. So on

5896
02:23:02,870 --> 02:23:02,880
is what I'm seeing on NT. Right. So on
 

5897
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:05,270
is what I'm seeing on NT. Right. So on
that last shove, what happened here?

5898
02:23:05,270 --> 02:23:05,280
that last shove, what happened here?
 

5899
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:08,230
that last shove, what happened here?
Hello. Who's at the high day? Oh, longs

02:23:18,950 --> 02:23:18,960
All of these guys.
 

5911
02:23:18,960 --> 02:23:20,950
All of these guys.

5917
02:23:24,479 --> 02:23:26,150
[\h__\h] caught. What happened when we
dropped under 40 where the selling

5918
02:23:26,150 --> 02:23:26,160
dropped under 40 where the selling
 

5919
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:29,510

5921
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:31,830
started? Oh yeah, we [\h__\h] knifed.
Why? because it's the same [\h__\h] shelf

5922
02:23:31,830 --> 02:23:31,840
Why? because it's the same [\h__\h] shelf
 

5923
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:33,510
Why? because it's the same [\h__\h] shelf
where they're trapped above. Sorry, I'm

come back down to where where the big

5930
02:23:39,190 --> 02:23:39,200
come back down to where where the big
 

5931
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:41,270
come back down to where where the big
buyer was. 190. What did we say the

5932
02:23:41,270 --> 02:23:41,280
buyer was. 190. What did we say the
 

5933
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:45,590
buyer was. 190. What did we say the
rotation is? 50s 50s or 40s to 90s.

5934
02:23:45,590 --> 02:23:45,600
rotation is? 50s 50s or 40s to 90s.
 

5935
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:47,670
rotation is? 50s 50s or 40s to 90s.
That's the rotation. We can price back

5936
02:23:47,670 --> 02:23:47,680
That's the rotation. We can price back
 

5937
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:49,429
That's the rotation. We can price back
up here. They can still try and resell

5938
02:23:49,429 --> 02:23:49,439
up here. They can still try and resell
 

5939
02:23:49,439 --> 02:23:51,190
up here. They can still try and resell
this. All right, we have some imbalances

5940
02:23:51,190 --> 02:23:51,200
this. All right, we have some imbalances
 

5941
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:53,990
this. All right, we have some imbalances
down here. They need to get to go lower.

5942
02:23:53,990 --> 02:23:54,000
down here. They need to get to go lower.
 

5943
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,550
down here. They need to get to go lower.
The big gray box is what it is. All

5944
02:23:56,550 --> 02:23:56,560
The big gray box is what it is. All
 

5945
02:23:56,560 --> 02:23:59,030
The big gray box is what it is. All
these massive buyers. All right, look at

5946
02:23:59,030 --> 02:23:59,040
these massive buyers. All right, look at
 

5947
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:00,790
these massive buyers. All right, look at
these massive buyers. We need to get

5948
02:24:00,790 --> 02:24:00,800
these massive buyers. We need to get
 

5949
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:03,349
these massive buyers. We need to get
under them to get low of day. Until that

5950
02:24:03,349 --> 02:24:03,359
under them to get low of day. Until that
 

5951
02:24:03,359 --> 02:24:05,349
under them to get low of day. Until that
point, we cannot guarantee low of day,

5952
02:24:05,349 --> 02:24:05,359
point, we cannot guarantee low of day,
 

5953
02:24:05,359 --> 02:24:08,710
point, we cannot guarantee low of day,
but we can talk about going from here to

5954
02:24:08,710 --> 02:24:08,720
but we can talk about going from here to
 

5955
02:24:08,720 --> 02:24:11,030
but we can talk about going from here to
here. If we get under them, all right,

5956
02:24:11,030 --> 02:24:11,040
here. If we get under them, all right,
 

5957
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:13,429
here. If we get under them, all right,
we can talk about using their pain to go

5958
02:24:13,429 --> 02:24:13,439
we can talk about using their pain to go
 

5959
02:24:13,439 --> 02:24:16,230
we can talk about using their pain to go
from here maybe to here 89. We have to

5960
02:24:16,230 --> 02:24:16,240
from here maybe to here 89. We have to
 

5961
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:17,750
from here maybe to here 89. We have to
see if they actually want to auction

5962
02:24:17,750 --> 02:24:17,760
see if they actually want to auction
 

5963
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:20,230
see if they actually want to auction
lower. All right, so we have to see

5964
02:24:20,230 --> 02:24:20,240
lower. All right, so we have to see
 

5965
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:23,270
lower. All right, so we have to see
about this. We don't know. This is why

5966
02:24:23,270 --> 02:24:23,280
about this. We don't know. This is why
 

5967
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:26,309
about this. We don't know. This is why
we position ourselves short

5968
02:24:26,309 --> 02:24:26,319
we position ourselves short
 

5969
02:24:26,319 --> 02:24:29,190
we position ourselves short
for their pain. here. All right. Once we

5970
02:24:29,190 --> 02:24:29,200
for their pain. here. All right. Once we
 

5971
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:31,349
for their pain. here. All right. Once we
leave, we cover some into the level

5972
02:24:31,349 --> 02:24:31,359
leave, we cover some into the level
 

5973
02:24:31,359 --> 02:24:33,270
leave, we cover some into the level
where we know they might hold and we

5974
02:24:33,270 --> 02:24:33,280
where we know they might hold and we
 

5975
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:35,590
where we know they might hold and we
hold in case we find acceptance lower.

5976
02:24:35,590 --> 02:24:35,600
hold in case we find acceptance lower.
 

5977
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:37,270
hold in case we find acceptance lower.
All right. It's the same thing all the

5978
02:24:37,270 --> 02:24:37,280
All right. It's the same thing all the
 

5979
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:40,150
All right. It's the same thing all the
all the time. Location, momentum,

5980
02:24:40,150 --> 02:24:40,160
all the time. Location, momentum,
 

5981
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:42,150
all the time. Location, momentum,
location, momentum. Where is the best

5982
02:24:42,150 --> 02:24:42,160
location, momentum. Where is the best
 

5983
02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:44,230
location, momentum. Where is the best
location to get short? Up in here when

5984
02:24:44,230 --> 02:24:44,240
location to get short? Up in here when
 

5985
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:46,070
location to get short? Up in here when
we leave buyers trapped. Where are we

5986
02:24:46,070 --> 02:24:46,080
we leave buyers trapped. Where are we
 

5987
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:47,510
we leave buyers trapped. Where are we
going to cover some? Into the next

5988
02:24:47,510 --> 02:24:47,520
going to cover some? Into the next
 

5989
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:49,590
going to cover some? Into the next
location where buyers keep absorbing.

5990
02:24:49,590 --> 02:24:49,600
location where buyers keep absorbing.
 

5991
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:51,590
location where buyers keep absorbing.
Where is the ultimate target when these

5992
02:24:51,590 --> 02:24:51,600
Where is the ultimate target when these
 

5993
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:53,590
Where is the ultimate target when these
buyers get stuck? Down into low of day

5994
02:24:53,590 --> 02:24:53,600
buyers get stuck? Down into low of day
 

5995
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:55,990
buyers get stuck? Down into low of day
and possibly the naked point of control.

5996
02:24:55,990 --> 02:24:56,000
and possibly the naked point of control.
 

5997
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,150
and possibly the naked point of control.
All right. So,

5998
02:24:58,150 --> 02:24:58,160
All right. So,
 

5999
02:24:58,160 --> 02:24:59,590
All right. So,
I don't know what else to say, folks.

6000
02:24:59,590 --> 02:24:59,600
I don't know what else to say, folks.
 

6001
02:24:59,600 --> 02:25:00,950
I don't know what else to say, folks.
This has been on here the whole time.

6002
02:25:00,950 --> 02:25:00,960
This has been on here the whole time.
 

6003
02:25:00,960 --> 02:25:13,030
This has been on here the whole time.
What we've been looking for

6004
02:25:13,030 --> 02:25:13,040

 

6005
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:14,550

sucking Premier out of options before

6006
02:25:14,550 --> 02:25:14,560
sucking Premier out of options before
 

6007
02:25:14,560 --> 02:25:19,990
sucking Premier out of options before
nose driver. He might well be right.

6008
02:25:19,990 --> 02:25:20,000

 

6009
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:21,910

Rooks are similar to to me. I don't know

6010
02:25:21,910 --> 02:25:21,920
Rooks are similar to to me. I don't know
 

6011
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:24,630
Rooks are similar to to me. I don't know
if he is. I know he trades momentum. Uh

6012
02:25:24,630 --> 02:25:24,640
if he is. I know he trades momentum. Uh
 

6013
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:27,830
if he is. I know he trades momentum. Uh
I I Could not comment. Could not

comment.
Alex, what's the statistics you were

6018
02:25:31,910 --> 02:25:31,920
Alex, what's the statistics you were
 

6019
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:34,070
Alex, what's the statistics you were
talking about with the 80% chance taking

6020
02:25:34,070 --> 02:25:34,080
talking about with the 80% chance taking
 

6021
02:25:34,080 --> 02:25:36,469
talking about with the 80% chance taking
out value area low? Uh, it also depends

6022
02:25:36,469 --> 02:25:36,479
out value area low? Uh, it also depends
 

6023
02:25:36,479 --> 02:25:38,389
out value area low? Uh, it also depends
on the day, but yeah, if we're if we

6024
02:25:38,389 --> 02:25:38,399
on the day, but yeah, if we're if we
 

6025
02:25:38,399 --> 02:25:40,230
on the day, but yeah, if we're if we
trade above value area high, previous

6026
02:25:40,230 --> 02:25:40,240
trade above value area high, previous
 

6027
02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:41,670
trade above value area high, previous
day value area high and lose that,

6028
02:25:41,670 --> 02:25:41,680
day value area high and lose that,
 

6029
02:25:41,680 --> 02:25:43,510
day value area high and lose that,
there's like an 80% chance that we will

6030
02:25:43,510 --> 02:25:43,520
there's like an 80% chance that we will
 

6031
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:45,750
there's like an 80% chance that we will
revisit the value area low the next day,

6032
02:25:45,750 --> 02:25:45,760
revisit the value area low the next day,
 

6033
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:52,630
revisit the value area low the next day,
the same day. Sorry.

6034
02:25:52,630 --> 02:25:52,640

 

6035
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:54,710

Yes, I have tried to put my system into

6036
02:25:54,710 --> 02:25:54,720
Yes, I have tried to put my system into
 

6037
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:57,349
Yes, I have tried to put my system into
an algae. It's like it's impossible.

6038
02:25:57,349 --> 02:25:57,359
an algae. It's like it's impossible.
 

6039
02:25:57,359 --> 02:25:59,030
an algae. It's like it's impossible.
I've tried honestly. I've tried so hard.

6040
02:25:59,030 --> 02:25:59,040
I've tried honestly. I've tried so hard.
 

6041
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:00,630
I've tried honestly. I've tried so hard.
If anyone wants to have a go at it, by

6042
02:26:00,630 --> 02:26:00,640
If anyone wants to have a go at it, by
 

6043
02:26:00,640 --> 02:26:02,150
If anyone wants to have a go at it, by
all means have a go at it. It's really

6044
02:26:02,150 --> 02:26:02,160
all means have a go at it. It's really
 

6045
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:05,750
all means have a go at it. It's really
hard.

6046
02:26:05,750 --> 02:26:05,760

 

6047
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:13,990

Um,

6048
02:26:13,990 --> 02:26:14,000

 

6049
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:15,429

they could see all the flow in the pit.

6050
02:26:15,429 --> 02:26:15,439
they could see all the flow in the pit.
 

6051
02:26:15,439 --> 02:26:17,270
they could see all the flow in the pit.
Who was trapped the other? Yeah, they

6052
02:26:17,270 --> 02:26:17,280
Who was trapped the other? Yeah, they
 

6053
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:18,550
Who was trapped the other? Yeah, they
could, but they would have to see it and

6054
02:26:18,550 --> 02:26:18,560
could, but they would have to see it and
 

6055
02:26:18,560 --> 02:26:20,230
could, but they would have to see it and
listen to it. probably they probably

6056
02:26:20,230 --> 02:26:20,240
listen to it. probably they probably
 

6057
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:21,510
listen to it. probably they probably
they have talked about that at market

6058
02:26:21,510 --> 02:26:21,520
they have talked about that at market
 

6059
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:22,950
they have talked about that at market
wizards but not in the same way. Okay,

6060
02:26:22,950 --> 02:26:22,960
wizards but not in the same way. Okay,
 

6061
02:26:22,960 --> 02:26:24,550
wizards but not in the same way. Okay,
so there's your bare flag. Can they

6062
02:26:24,550 --> 02:26:24,560
so there's your bare flag. Can they
 

6063
02:26:24,560 --> 02:26:25,910
so there's your bare flag. Can they
break down under here? So if you were

6064
02:26:25,910 --> 02:26:25,920
break down under here? So if you were
 

6065
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:27,429
break down under here? So if you were
short, you're covering some into here

6066
02:26:27,429 --> 02:26:27,439
short, you're covering some into here
 

6067
02:26:27,439 --> 02:26:28,950
short, you're covering some into here
and you're hoping you find acceptance

6068
02:26:28,950 --> 02:26:28,960
and you're hoping you find acceptance
 

6069
02:26:28,960 --> 02:26:40,389
and you're hoping you find acceptance
lower.

6070
02:26:40,389 --> 02:26:40,399

 

6071
02:26:40,399 --> 02:26:43,349

me I run my mouth a lot. Well, it's

6084
02:27:04,469 --> 02:27:04,479
me I run my mouth a lot. Well, it's
 

6085
02:27:04,479 --> 02:27:06,389
me I run my mouth a lot. Well, it's
because people in chat are just

6086
02:27:06,389 --> 02:27:06,399
because people in chat are just
 

6087
02:27:06,399 --> 02:27:14,389
because people in chat are just
ridiculous.

6088
02:27:14,389 --> 02:27:14,399

 

6089
02:27:14,399 --> 02:27:20,469

Thanks, Kyle. Appreciate it, man.

6095
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:29,670

Do I think NT is better for footprint?

6096
02:27:29,670 --> 02:27:29,680
Do I think NT is better for footprint?
 

6097
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:32,469
Do I think NT is better for footprint?
Uh, yeah. I do. I do. I think it's a

6098
02:27:32,469 --> 02:27:32,479
Uh, yeah. I do. I do. I think it's a
 

6099
02:27:32,479 --> 02:27:33,670
Uh, yeah. I do. I do. I think it's a
little bit more accurate than Trading

6100
02:27:33,670 --> 02:27:33,680
little bit more accurate than Trading
 

6101
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:39,910
little bit more accurate than Trading
View, but Trading View is not bad.

6102
02:27:39,910 --> 02:27:39,920

 

6103
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:41,349

I've watched you for three days, and the

6104
02:27:41,349 --> 02:27:41,359
I've watched you for three days, and the
 

6105
02:27:41,359 --> 02:27:43,110
I've watched you for three days, and the
amount you've gone over in those three

6106
02:27:43,110 --> 02:27:43,120
amount you've gone over in those three
 

6107
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:46,469
amount you've gone over in those three
days burned my brain.

6108
02:27:46,469 --> 02:27:46,479
days burned my brain.
 

6109
02:27:46,479 --> 02:27:48,389
days burned my brain.

02:28:02,880 --> 02:28:04,389
Does he not? Does he trade volume?
Oh yeah, he moved to volume a while ago.

6122
02:28:04,389 --> 02:28:04,399
Oh yeah, he moved to volume a while ago.
 

6123
02:28:04,399 --> 02:28:06,469
Oh yeah, he moved to volume a while ago.
What am I talking about? I don't know

6124
02:28:06,469 --> 02:28:06,479
What am I talking about? I don't know
 

6125
02:28:06,479 --> 02:28:07,830
What am I talking about? I don't know
how he trades volume, but if he's

6126
02:28:07,830 --> 02:28:07,840
how he trades volume, but if he's
 

6127
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:09,510
how he trades volume, but if he's
trading volume profile, then he probably

6128
02:28:09,510 --> 02:28:09,520
trading volume profile, then he probably
 

6129
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:10,870
trading volume profile, then he probably
has a good understanding of where he

6130
02:28:10,870 --> 02:28:10,880
has a good understanding of where he
 

6131
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:14,790
has a good understanding of where he
wants to enter and exit.

6132
02:28:14,790 --> 02:28:14,800

 

6133
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:16,870

Could we re revisit the high today? I

6134
02:28:16,870 --> 02:28:16,880
Could we re revisit the high today? I
 

6135
02:28:16,880 --> 02:28:18,630
Could we re revisit the high today? I
very much doubt it. You would have to

6136
02:28:18,630 --> 02:28:18,640
very much doubt it. You would have to
 

6137
02:28:18,640 --> 02:28:21,270
very much doubt it. You would have to
reclaim all current days volume, all

6138
02:28:21,270 --> 02:28:21,280
reclaim all current days volume, all
 

6139
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:23,349
reclaim all current days volume, all
current week's volume, and break out

6140
02:28:23,349 --> 02:28:23,359
current week's volume, and break out
 

6141
02:28:23,359 --> 02:28:24,710
current week's volume, and break out
with everyone trapped above you. That's

6142
02:28:24,710 --> 02:28:24,720
with everyone trapped above you. That's
 

6143
02:28:24,720 --> 02:28:26,790
with everyone trapped above you. That's
why I keep saying we have volume trapped

6144
02:28:26,790 --> 02:28:26,800
why I keep saying we have volume trapped
 

6145
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:28,309
why I keep saying we have volume trapped
above us right now. I think it's very

6146
02:28:28,309 --> 02:28:28,319
above us right now. I think it's very
 

6147
02:28:28,319 --> 02:28:36,230
above us right now. I think it's very
unlikely we revisit today's high.

6148
02:28:36,230 --> 02:28:36,240

 

6149
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:38,389

Best book for traders. What I think what

6150
02:28:38,389 --> 02:28:38,399
Best book for traders. What I think what
 

6151
02:28:38,399 --> 02:28:39,830
Best book for traders. What I think what
I think I mean you can read lots of

6152
02:28:39,830 --> 02:28:39,840
I think I mean you can read lots of
 

6153
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:41,990
I think I mean you can read lots of
them. I think golf is not a game of

6154
02:28:41,990 --> 02:28:42,000
them. I think golf is not a game of
 

6155
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:49,349
them. I think golf is not a game of
perfect personally.

6156
02:28:49,349 --> 02:28:49,359

 

6157
02:28:49,359 --> 02:28:51,670

Uh yeah what uh you have to trade 8

6158
02:28:51,670 --> 02:28:51,680
Uh yeah what uh you have to trade 8
 

6159
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:53,910
Uh yeah what uh you have to trade 8
days. Uh you don't not just wait trade

6160
02:28:53,910 --> 02:28:53,920
days. Uh you don't not just wait trade
 

6161
02:28:53,920 --> 02:28:57,190
days. Uh you don't not just wait trade
the eight days. Tyson

6162
02:28:57,190 --> 02:28:57,200
the eight days. Tyson
 

6163
02:28:57,200 --> 02:29:00,070
the eight days. Tyson
is this resistance turn support or I

6164
02:29:00,070 --> 02:29:00,080
is this resistance turn support or I
 

6165
02:29:00,080 --> 02:29:02,710
is this resistance turn support or I
mean yes technically it is. I mean, it's

6166
02:29:02,710 --> 02:29:02,720
mean yes technically it is. I mean, it's
 

6167
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:05,190
mean yes technically it is. I mean, it's
just volume, right? So, we know they bid

6168
02:29:05,190 --> 02:29:05,200
just volume, right? So, we know they bid
 

6169
02:29:05,200 --> 02:29:07,030
just volume, right? So, we know they bid
off this. We covered, remember, we took

6170
02:29:07,030 --> 02:29:07,040
off this. We covered, remember, we took
 

6171
02:29:07,040 --> 02:29:09,030
off this. We covered, remember, we took
this trade, we covered into this, right?

6172
02:29:09,030 --> 02:29:09,040
this trade, we covered into this, right?
 

6173
02:29:09,040 --> 02:29:10,710
this trade, we covered into this, right?
If you're position short again for the

6174
02:29:10,710 --> 02:29:10,720
If you're position short again for the
 

6175
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:11,990
If you're position short again for the
same thing, you should be covering into

6176
02:29:11,990 --> 02:29:12,000
same thing, you should be covering into
 

6177
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,550
same thing, you should be covering into
this. But you now have these buyers

6178
02:29:14,550 --> 02:29:14,560
this. But you now have these buyers
 

6179
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:17,030
this. But you now have these buyers
trapped here, and we also have everyone

6180
02:29:17,030 --> 02:29:17,040
trapped here, and we also have everyone
 

6181
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:18,389
trapped here, and we also have everyone
trapped up here, right? Which is why

6182
02:29:18,389 --> 02:29:18,399
trapped up here, right? Which is why
 

6183
02:29:18,399 --> 02:29:19,670
trapped up here, right? Which is why
we're trying to trade lower all the

6184
02:29:19,670 --> 02:29:19,680
we're trying to trade lower all the
 

6185
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:22,150
we're trying to trade lower all the
time. You're protecting this, right?

6186
02:29:22,150 --> 02:29:22,160
time. You're protecting this, right?
 

6187
02:29:22,160 --> 02:29:24,469
time. You're protecting this, right?
Here's the pullback. This is the

6188
02:29:24,469 --> 02:29:24,479
Here's the pullback. This is the
 

6189
02:29:24,479 --> 02:29:26,630
Here's the pullback. This is the
protrend. All right? This protrend will

6190
02:29:26,630 --> 02:29:26,640
protrend. All right? This protrend will
 

6191
02:29:26,640 --> 02:29:28,309
protrend. All right? This protrend will
really start developing once you get

6192
02:29:28,309 --> 02:29:28,319
really start developing once you get
 

6193
02:29:28,319 --> 02:29:30,870
really start developing once you get
under here. They might chop between this

6194
02:29:30,870 --> 02:29:30,880
under here. They might chop between this
 

6195
02:29:30,880 --> 02:29:33,110
under here. They might chop between this
for a while. They can absolutely chop

6196
02:29:33,110 --> 02:29:33,120
for a while. They can absolutely chop
 

6197
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:34,950
for a while. They can absolutely chop
between that for a while. If they keep

6198
02:29:34,950 --> 02:29:34,960
between that for a while. If they keep
 

6199
02:29:34,960 --> 02:29:36,630
between that for a while. If they keep
trapping here and one side gets more

6200
02:29:36,630 --> 02:29:36,640
trapping here and one side gets more
 

6201
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:38,710
trapping here and one side gets more
stuck than the other. Can they get up

6202
02:29:38,710 --> 02:29:38,720
stuck than the other. Can they get up
 

6203
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:41,190
stuck than the other. Can they get up
here? It's possible. But the protrend is

6204
02:29:41,190 --> 02:29:41,200
here? It's possible. But the protrend is
 

6205
02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:44,469
here? It's possible. But the protrend is
down right now.

6206
02:29:44,469 --> 02:29:44,479
down right now.
 

6207
02:29:44,479 --> 02:29:46,230
down right now.
But we are going into look look at how

6208
02:29:46,230 --> 02:29:46,240
But we are going into look look at how
 

6209
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:48,230
But we are going into look look at how
we're developing these nodes now. So we

6210
02:29:48,230 --> 02:29:48,240
we're developing these nodes now. So we
 

6211
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:52,230
we're developing these nodes now. So we
got here, here, and here. All right. And

6212
02:29:52,230 --> 02:29:52,240
got here, here, and here. All right. And
 

6213
02:29:52,240 --> 02:29:53,750
got here, here, and here. All right. And
then we have one up here. All right. So

6214
02:29:53,750 --> 02:29:53,760
then we have one up here. All right. So
 

6215
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:55,750
then we have one up here. All right. So
we at the moment we're going from this

6216
02:29:55,750 --> 02:29:55,760
we at the moment we're going from this
 

6217
02:29:55,760 --> 02:29:58,070
we at the moment we're going from this
node to this node. from this node, maybe

6218
02:29:58,070 --> 02:29:58,080
node to this node. from this node, maybe
 

6219
02:29:58,080 --> 02:30:00,150
node to this node. from this node, maybe
back up. Maybe they resell this. If they

6220
02:30:00,150 --> 02:30:00,160
back up. Maybe they resell this. If they
 

6221
02:30:00,160 --> 02:30:01,349
back up. Maybe they resell this. If they
get under this, we'll probably go from

6222
02:30:01,349 --> 02:30:01,359
get under this, we'll probably go from
 

6223
02:30:01,359 --> 02:30:02,710
get under this, we'll probably go from
here to here for a minute and then see

6224
02:30:02,710 --> 02:30:02,720
here to here for a minute and then see
 

6225
02:30:02,720 --> 02:30:04,950
here to here for a minute and then see
if they flush it or reclaim and go over.

6226
02:30:04,950 --> 02:30:04,960
if they flush it or reclaim and go over.
 

6227
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:06,710
if they flush it or reclaim and go over.
If we get over here, then we're going to

6228
02:30:06,710 --> 02:30:06,720
If we get over here, then we're going to
 

6229
02:30:06,720 --> 02:30:08,389
If we get over here, then we're going to
try and revisit this node. And we might

6230
02:30:08,389 --> 02:30:08,399
try and revisit this node. And we might
 

6231
02:30:08,399 --> 02:30:10,070
try and revisit this node. And we might
do this for a bit. If we get over here,

6232
02:30:10,070 --> 02:30:10,080
do this for a bit. If we get over here,
 

6233
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:11,270
do this for a bit. If we get over here,
we're going to go from this to this,

6234
02:30:11,270 --> 02:30:11,280
we're going to go from this to this,
 

6235
02:30:11,280 --> 02:30:13,270
we're going to go from this to this,
this to this, this to this. All right.

6236
02:30:13,270 --> 02:30:13,280
this to this, this to this. All right.
 

6237
02:30:13,280 --> 02:30:15,030
this to this, this to this. All right.
So, these make it clear, especially as

6238
02:30:15,030 --> 02:30:15,040
So, these make it clear, especially as
 

6239
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:17,349
So, these make it clear, especially as
you get through the day, you find clear

6240
02:30:17,349 --> 02:30:17,359
you get through the day, you find clear
 

6241
02:30:17,359 --> 02:30:19,910
you get through the day, you find clear
levels.

6242
02:30:19,910 --> 02:30:19,920
levels.
 

6243
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:21,030
levels.
You're running out of time, though.

6244
02:30:21,030 --> 02:30:21,040
You're running out of time, though.
 

6245
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:23,030
You're running out of time, though.
You're getting into lunch. Oh my days.

6246
02:30:23,030 --> 02:30:23,040
You're getting into lunch. Oh my days.
 

6247
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:29,270
You're getting into lunch. Oh my days.
What is that? There's a big cover.

6248
02:30:29,270 --> 02:30:29,280

 

6249
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:32,469

Is there news here? Yeah, we've got

6250
02:30:32,469 --> 02:30:32,479
Is there news here? Yeah, we've got
 

6251
02:30:32,479 --> 02:30:38,550
Is there news here? Yeah, we've got
talkers.

6252
02:30:38,550 --> 02:30:38,560

 

6253
02:30:38,560 --> 02:30:41,270

Netanyahu signed on as a member of the

6254
02:30:41,270 --> 02:30:41,280
Netanyahu signed on as a member of the
 

6255
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:43,190
Netanyahu signed on as a member of the
board of peace. Are you [\h__\h] kidding

6256
02:30:43,190 --> 02:30:43,200
board of peace. Are you [\h__\h] kidding
 

6257
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:46,550
board of peace. Are you [\h__\h] kidding
me? In what world are we living in where

6258
02:30:46,550 --> 02:30:46,560
me? In what world are we living in where
 

6259
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:48,309
me? In what world are we living in where
he should be anywhere near anything

6260
02:30:48,309 --> 02:30:48,319
he should be anywhere near anything
 

6261
02:30:48,319 --> 02:30:53,110
he should be anywhere near anything
peaceful? Are you kidding me? Wow.

6262
02:30:53,110 --> 02:30:53,120
peaceful? Are you kidding me? Wow.
 

6263
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:55,190
peaceful? Are you kidding me? Wow.
Wow.

6264
02:30:55,190 --> 02:30:55,200
Wow.
 

6265
02:30:55,200 --> 02:31:02,790
Wow.
All right.

6266
02:31:02,790 --> 02:31:02,800

 

6267
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:05,750

It's Trump's board, right? That is me.

6268
02:31:05,750 --> 02:31:05,760
It's Trump's board, right? That is me.
 

6269
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:08,309
It's Trump's board, right? That is me.
In my mind, that's mental.

6270
02:31:08,309 --> 02:31:08,319
In my mind, that's mental.
 

6271
02:31:08,319 --> 02:31:13,910
In my mind, that's mental.
It's mental.

6272
02:31:13,910 --> 02:31:13,920

 

6273
02:31:13,920 --> 02:31:18,870

Yeah, exactly. That's how I feel.

6274
02:31:18,870 --> 02:31:18,880

 

6275
02:31:18,880 --> 02:31:21,349

6439
02:35:55,760 --> 02:36:07,990
ones as well, but there's nothing really
in them. Don't use them actively.

6440
02:36:07,990 --> 02:36:08,000

 

6441
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:14,550

Do I see sell 25 265 265

6442

Do I see sell 25 265 265
 

6443
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:16,309
Do I see sell 25 265 265
265

6444
02:36:16,309 --> 02:36:16,319
265
 

6445
02:36:16,319 --> 02:36:20,150
265
up here? Yeah, this is the kind of area.

6446
02:36:20,150 --> 02:36:20,160
up here? Yeah, this is the kind of area.
 

6447
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:21,349
up here? Yeah, this is the kind of area.
Look, they've just held that dip. What

6448
02:36:21,349 --> 02:36:21,359
Look, they've just held that dip. What
 

6449
02:36:21,359 --> 02:36:23,110
Look, they've just held that dip. What
did I just say? If bulls want to step

6450
02:36:23,110 --> 02:36:23,120
did I just say? If bulls want to step
 

6451
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:24,790
did I just say? If bulls want to step
in, they have to hold this now. Think

6452
02:36:24,790 --> 02:36:24,800
in, they have to hold this now. Think
 

6453
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:27,190
in, they have to hold this now. Think
about this, right? They have to now hold

6454
02:36:27,190 --> 02:36:27,200
about this, right? They have to now hold
 

6455
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:29,030
about this, right? They have to now hold
this and complete this. This is the area

6456
02:36:29,030 --> 02:36:29,040
this and complete this. This is the area
 

6457
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:32,230
this and complete this. This is the area
I think we will peter out in. It might

6458
02:36:32,230 --> 02:36:32,240
I think we will peter out in. It might
 

6459
02:36:32,240 --> 02:36:33,910
I think we will peter out in. It might
be that we've already peted out. It

6460
02:36:33,910 --> 02:36:33,920
be that we've already peted out. It
 

6461
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:35,190
be that we've already peted out. It
might be that they would want to do one

6462
02:36:35,190 --> 02:36:35,200
might be that they would want to do one
 

6463
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:38,150
might be that they would want to do one
more pump and then do it. But definitely

6464
02:36:38,150 --> 02:36:38,160
more pump and then do it. But definitely
 

6465
02:36:38,160 --> 02:36:39,910
more pump and then do it. But definitely
this is the area I think the market will

6466
02:36:39,910 --> 02:36:39,920
this is the area I think the market will
 

6467
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:42,469
this is the area I think the market will
struggly struggle to get above. I really

6468
02:36:42,469 --> 02:36:42,479
struggly struggle to get above. I really
 

6469
02:36:42,479 --> 02:36:43,750
struggly struggle to get above. I really
think it will struggle to get above that

6470
02:36:43,750 --> 02:36:43,760
think it will struggle to get above that
 

6471
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:46,550
think it will struggle to get above that
today. And I think the main move is back

6472
02:36:46,550 --> 02:36:46,560
today. And I think the main move is back
 

6473
02:36:46,560 --> 02:36:48,150
today. And I think the main move is back
down to here. And once you find

6474
02:36:48,150 --> 02:36:48,160
down to here. And once you find
 

6475
02:36:48,160 --> 02:36:50,230
down to here. And once you find
acceptance under here, it's to search

6476
02:36:50,230 --> 02:36:50,240
acceptance under here, it's to search
 

6477
02:36:50,240 --> 02:36:52,309
acceptance under here, it's to search
back into these lows. This is for me.

6478
02:36:52,309 --> 02:36:52,319
back into these lows. This is for me.
 

6479
02:36:52,319 --> 02:36:54,389
back into these lows. This is for me.
This is a pullback. We're now starting

6480
02:36:54,389 --> 02:36:54,399
This is a pullback. We're now starting
 

6481
02:36:54,399 --> 02:36:55,990
This is a pullback. We're now starting
to go sideways. We are building out

6482
02:36:55,990 --> 02:36:56,000
to go sideways. We are building out
 

6483
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:57,990
to go sideways. We are building out
liquidity here. If they do a failed

6484
02:36:57,990 --> 02:36:58,000
liquidity here. If they do a failed
 

6485
02:36:58,000 --> 02:36:59,830
liquidity here. If they do a failed
breakout of this, that will be really

6486
02:36:59,830 --> 02:36:59,840
breakout of this, that will be really
 

6487
02:36:59,840 --> 02:37:01,190
breakout of this, that will be really
nice for you in the afternoon. I will

6488
02:37:01,190 --> 02:37:01,200
nice for you in the afternoon. I will
 

6489
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:03,110
nice for you in the afternoon. I will
not be trading the afternoon. But think

6490
02:37:03,110 --> 02:37:03,120
not be trading the afternoon. But think
 

6491
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:05,990
not be trading the afternoon. But think
about this. All right. If we do a failed

6492
02:37:05,990 --> 02:37:06,000
about this. All right. If we do a failed
 

6493
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,389
about this. All right. If we do a failed
breakout of this, trap buyers, sell back

6494
02:37:08,389 --> 02:37:08,399
breakout of this, trap buyers, sell back
 

6495
02:37:08,399 --> 02:37:11,110
breakout of this, trap buyers, sell back
in, reject, that is an easy sell, isn't

6496
02:37:11,110 --> 02:37:11,120
in, reject, that is an easy sell, isn't
 

6497
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:12,710
in, reject, that is an easy sell, isn't
it? Because then we will use all the

6498
02:37:12,710 --> 02:37:12,720
it? Because then we will use all the
 

6499
02:37:12,720 --> 02:37:14,790
it? Because then we will use all the
liquidity to move lower. What would that

6500
02:37:14,790 --> 02:37:14,800
liquidity to move lower. What would that
 

6501
02:37:14,800 --> 02:37:16,790
liquidity to move lower. What would that
remind you of? Let's look at the high of

So, there is 400 lots passive just sat
 

6639
02:40:37,680 --> 02:40:40,070
So, there is 400 lots passive just sat
here hoping that they get filled to do

6640
02:40:40,070 --> 02:40:40,080
here hoping that they get filled to do
 

6641
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:46,469
here hoping that they get filled to do
that at the moment.

6642
02:40:46,469 --> 02:40:46,479

 

6643
02:40:46,479 --> 02:40:48,150

During pre-market, I trade small caps.

During pre-market, I trade small caps.
 

6645
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:49,429

You mentioned how bookmap is

6646
02:40:49,429 --> 02:40:49,439
You mentioned how bookmap is
 

6647
02:40:49,439 --> 02:40:51,110
You mentioned how bookmap is
specifically useful for small caps.

6648
02:40:51,110 --> 02:40:51,120
specifically useful for small caps.
 

6649
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:52,950
specifically useful for small caps.
Could I explain why? Yeah, totally.

6650
02:40:52,950 --> 02:40:52,960
Could I explain why? Yeah, totally.
 

6651
02:40:52,960 --> 02:40:54,389
Could I explain why? Yeah, totally.
because in small caps are heavily

6652
02:40:54,389 --> 02:40:54,399
because in small caps are heavily
 

6653
02:40:54,399 --> 02:40:57,590
because in small caps are heavily
manipulated. So unless you're really

6654
02:40:57,590 --> 02:40:57,600
manipulated. So unless you're really
 

6655
02:40:57,600 --> 02:40:59,429
manipulated. So unless you're really
really really really really good at

6656
02:40:59,429 --> 02:40:59,439
really really really really good at
 

6657
02:40:59,439 --> 02:41:01,429
really really really really good at
using the level two and tape. All right.

6658
02:41:01,429 --> 02:41:01,439
using the level two and tape. All right.
 

6659
02:41:01,439 --> 02:41:03,670
using the level two and tape. All right.
If you are trading something, say you

6660
02:41:03,670 --> 02:41:03,680
If you are trading something, say you
 

6661
02:41:03,680 --> 02:41:06,230
If you are trading something, say you
are trading something, I'm assuming

6662
02:41:06,230 --> 02:41:06,240
are trading something, I'm assuming
 

6663
02:41:06,240 --> 02:41:07,670
are trading something, I'm assuming
you're a short seller if you're trading

6664
02:41:07,670 --> 02:41:07,680
you're a short seller if you're trading
 

6665
02:41:07,680 --> 02:41:09,349
you're a short seller if you're trading
small caps. Am I making that assumption

6666
02:41:09,349 --> 02:41:09,359
small caps. Am I making that assumption
 

6667
02:41:09,359 --> 02:41:10,710
small caps. Am I making that assumption
right? Let's say you're trading

6668
02:41:10,710 --> 02:41:10,720
right? Let's say you're trading
 

6669
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:13,429
right? Let's say you're trading
something gapping up

6670
02:41:13,429 --> 02:41:13,439
something gapping up
 

6671
02:41:13,439 --> 02:41:15,750
something gapping up
one under 200 300% whatever. All right,

6672
02:41:15,750 --> 02:41:15,760
one under 200 300% whatever. All right,
 

6673
02:41:15,760 --> 02:41:18,230
one under 200 300% whatever. All right,
gapping up and you're looking back

6674
02:41:18,230 --> 02:41:18,240
gapping up and you're looking back
 

6675
02:41:18,240 --> 02:41:20,070
gapping up and you're looking back
historically. Where are the bag holders

6676
02:41:20,070 --> 02:41:20,080
historically. Where are the bag holders
 

6677
02:41:20,080 --> 02:41:21,750
historically. Where are the bag holders
stuck? Right? So you're marking out that

6678
02:41:21,750 --> 02:41:21,760
stuck? Right? So you're marking out that
 

6679
02:41:21,760 --> 02:41:23,830
stuck? Right? So you're marking out that
level where the bag holders are stuck.

6680
02:41:23,830 --> 02:41:23,840
level where the bag holders are stuck.
 

6681
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:26,309
level where the bag holders are stuck.
Uh you will see them on bookmap. They

6682
02:41:26,309 --> 02:41:26,319
Uh you will see them on bookmap. They
 

6683
02:41:26,319 --> 02:41:28,230
Uh you will see them on bookmap. They
will have their limits there. Thousands

6684
02:41:28,230 --> 02:41:28,240
will have their limits there. Thousands
 

6685
02:41:28,240 --> 02:41:30,309
will have their limits there. Thousands
and thousands of shares be sat there and

6686
02:41:30,309 --> 02:41:30,319
and thousands of shares be sat there and
 

6687
02:41:30,319 --> 02:41:31,910
and thousands of shares be sat there and
you'll see where the walls are and

6688
02:41:31,910 --> 02:41:31,920
you'll see where the walls are and
 

6689
02:41:31,920 --> 02:41:33,349
you'll see where the walls are and
you'll see where the buyers get trapped

6690
02:41:33,349 --> 02:41:33,359
you'll see where the buyers get trapped
 

6691
02:41:33,359 --> 02:41:35,030
you'll see where the buyers get trapped
above it. And then you can use their

6692
02:41:35,030 --> 02:41:35,040
above it. And then you can use their
 

6693
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:37,030
above it. And then you can use their
pain to go the other side. And uh you

6694
02:41:37,030 --> 02:41:37,040
pain to go the other side. And uh you
 

6695
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:38,550
pain to go the other side. And uh you
can always watch Ross Cameron and make

6696
02:41:38,550 --> 02:41:38,560
can always watch Ross Cameron and make
 

6697
02:41:38,560 --> 02:41:39,990
can always watch Ross Cameron and make
sure he trades into those guys and trade

6698
02:41:39,990 --> 02:41:40,000
sure he trades into those guys and trade
 

6699
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:41,830
sure he trades into those guys and trade
the other side of him, which is exactly

6700
02:41:41,830 --> 02:41:41,840
the other side of him, which is exactly
 

6701
02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:54,389
the other side of him, which is exactly
what I used to do.

6702
02:41:54,389 --> 02:41:54,399

 

6703
02:41:54,399 --> 02:41:56,309

Yeah, it's like a IRA. That's it, Hal.

6704
02:41:56,309 --> 02:41:56,319
Yeah, it's like a IRA. That's it, Hal.
 

6705
02:41:56,319 --> 02:42:01,030
Yeah, it's like a IRA. That's it, Hal.
That's exactly what it is.

6706
02:42:01,030 --> 02:42:01,040

 

6707
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:03,429

Uh, Delta's just sideways right now.
 

6709
02:42:03,439 --> 02:42:05,510

02:42:05,510 --> 02:42:05,520
Delta's matching this pretty well. Just
 

6711
02:42:05,520 --> 02:42:07,190

In fact, we've got passive, to be
honest, we've got passive selling

6718
02:42:12,150 --> 02:42:12,160
honest, we've got passive selling
 

6719
02:42:12,160 --> 02:42:14,309
honest, we've got passive selling
showing up on the Delta. We've got

6720
02:42:14,309 --> 02:42:14,319
showing up on the Delta. We've got
 

6721
02:42:14,319 --> 02:42:16,070
showing up on the Delta. We've got
passive selling showing up on the CBD.

passive selling showing up on the CBD.
 

6723
02:42:16,080 --> 02:42:17,590
passive selling showing up on the CBD.

02:42:17,590 --> 02:42:17,600
like
 

6725
02:42:17,600 --> 02:42:19,349
like
because we're we're not we're not

6726
02:42:19,349 --> 02:42:19,359

actually breaking out anywhere up here

6728
02:42:20,790 --> 02:42:20,800
actually breaking out anywhere up here
 

6729
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:22,710
actually breaking out anywhere up here
on CBD. So, we're we definitely have

passive selling which is what we expect
 

6733
02:42:24,319 --> 02:42:30,309
passive selling which is what we expect
in this in this area.

6813
02:44:47,359 --> 02:44:48,790
was it 13s? I can't remember, folks.
Might have been this [\h__\h] Was it this

6814
02:44:48,790 --> 02:44:48,800
Might have been this [\h__\h] Was it this
 

6815
02:44:48,800 --> 02:44:50,070
Might have been this [\h__\h] Was it this
[\h__\h] I might have got stopped out

6816
02:44:50,070 --> 02:44:50,080
[\h__\h] I might have got stopped out
 

6817
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:52,150
[\h__\h] I might have got stopped out
here on the runner. Oh my god. So, I

6818
02:44:52,150 --> 02:44:52,160
here on the runner. Oh my god. So, I
 

6819
02:44:52,160 --> 02:44:53,830
here on the runner. Oh my god. So, I
only locked in 50 points and I got

6820
02:44:53,830 --> 02:44:53,840
only locked in 50 points and I got
 

6821
02:44:53,840 --> 02:44:55,910
only locked in 50 points and I got
stopped out there on the runner. And the

6822
02:44:55,910 --> 02:44:55,920
stopped out there on the runner. And the
 

6823
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:59,990
stopped out there on the runner. And the
best cover. I think most guys got 110s

6824
02:44:59,990 --> 02:45:00,000
best cover. I think most guys got 110s
 

6825
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:03,510
best cover. I think most guys got 110s
110s, which was the area. 110s to 140 to

6826
02:45:03,510 --> 02:45:03,520
110s, which was the area. 110s to 140 to
 

6827
02:45:03,520 --> 02:45:05,510
110s, which was the area. 110s to 140 to
110s, which was originally the area. So

6828
02:45:05,510 --> 02:45:05,520
110s, which was originally the area. So
 

6829
02:45:05,520 --> 02:45:08,469
110s, which was originally the area. So
most people got 200 plus points. Alex

6830
02:45:08,469 --> 02:45:08,479
most people got 200 plus points. Alex
 

6831
02:45:08,479 --> 02:45:10,230
most people got 200 plus points. Alex
didn't. That was the trade. That was the

6832
02:45:10,230 --> 02:45:10,240
didn't. That was the trade. That was the
 

6833
02:45:10,240 --> 02:45:14,710
didn't. That was the trade. That was the
main trade today.

6834
02:45:14,710 --> 02:45:14,720

 

6835
02:45:14,720 --> 02:45:16,309

Let's trade here. I think I took a

6836
02:45:16,309 --> 02:45:16,319
Let's trade here. I think I took a
 

6837
02:45:16,319 --> 02:45:17,670
Let's trade here. I think I took a
squeeze earlier as well. I think I took

6838
02:45:17,670 --> 02:45:17,680
squeeze earlier as well. I think I took
 

6839
02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:19,349
squeeze earlier as well. I think I took
a long

6840
02:45:19,349 --> 02:45:19,359
a long
 

6841
02:45:19,359 --> 02:45:22,550
a long
here. There was a long somewhere here

6842
02:45:22,550 --> 02:45:22,560
here. There was a long somewhere here
 

6843
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:24,630
here. There was a long somewhere here
earlier today which was very very quick

6844
02:45:24,630 --> 02:45:24,640
earlier today which was very very quick
 

6845
02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:26,870
earlier today which was very very quick
and very early on. So I was saying to

6846
02:45:26,870 --> 02:45:26,880
and very early on. So I was saying to
 

6847
02:45:26,880 --> 02:45:28,710
and very early on. So I was saying to
the guys, don't don't follow me because

6848
02:45:28,710 --> 02:45:28,720
the guys, don't don't follow me because
 

6849
02:45:28,720 --> 02:45:30,309
the guys, don't don't follow me because
of that. I think it was just this for a

6850
02:45:30,309 --> 02:45:30,319
of that. I think it was just this for a
 

6851
02:45:30,319 --> 02:45:32,070
of that. I think it was just this for a
retest because I saw the shorts get

6852
02:45:32,070 --> 02:45:32,080
retest because I saw the shorts get
 

6853
02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:34,389
retest because I saw the shorts get
stuck. Didn't make much money out of

6854
02:45:34,389 --> 02:45:34,399
stuck. Didn't make much money out of
 

6855
02:45:34,399 --> 02:45:35,830
stuck. Didn't make much money out of
this. was 34 point. Yeah, that would

6856
02:45:35,830 --> 02:45:35,840
this. was 34 point. Yeah, that would
 

6857
02:45:35,840 --> 02:45:38,070

6859
02:45:38,080 --> 02:45:40,070
have been that one there.
Those were the trades. Short squeeze

6891
02:46:23,600 --> 02:46:26,150
you lose that, we're trading to 173. If
you lose that, we're trading to 150. If

6892
02:46:26,150 --> 02:46:26,160
you lose that, we're trading to 150. If
 

6893
02:46:26,160 --> 02:46:28,870
you lose that, we're trading to 150. If
you trade under 150, all right, it is

6894
02:46:28,870 --> 02:46:28,880
you trade under 150, all right, it is
 

6895
02:46:28,880 --> 02:46:30,870
you trade under 150, all right, it is
very possible that this cluster of

6896
02:46:30,870 --> 02:46:30,880
very possible that this cluster of
 

6897
02:46:30,880 --> 02:46:33,269
very possible that this cluster of
buyers here who are not a small size,

6898
02:46:33,269 --> 02:46:33,279
buyers here who are not a small size,
 

6899
02:46:33,279 --> 02:46:35,110
buyers here who are not a small size,
right, these are big big players, you

6900
02:46:35,110 --> 02:46:35,120
right, these are big big players, you
 

6901
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:37,349
right, these are big big players, you
lose 150, there is a very good chance

6902
02:46:37,349 --> 02:46:37,359
lose 150, there is a very good chance
 

6903
02:46:37,359 --> 02:46:39,670
lose 150, there is a very good chance
you trade back down to 290. If you lose

6904
02:46:39,670 --> 02:46:39,680
you trade back down to 290. If you lose
 

6905
02:46:39,680 --> 02:46:41,590
you trade back down to 290. If you lose
290, we are looking at these blocks down

6906
02:46:41,590 --> 02:46:41,600
290, we are looking at these blocks down
 

6907
02:46:41,600 --> 02:46:43,590
290, we are looking at these blocks down
here. Okay,

6908
02:46:43,590 --> 02:46:43,600
here. Okay,
 

6909
02:46:43,600 --> 02:46:45,670
here. Okay,
I would love to see this get to 24,800.

6910
02:46:45,670 --> 02:46:45,680
I would love to see this get to 24,800.
 

6911
02:46:45,680 --> 02:46:47,269
I would love to see this get to 24,800.
I'd love it not to do today because I

6912
02:46:47,269 --> 02:46:47,279
I'd love it not to do today because I
 

6913
02:46:47,279 --> 02:46:48,389
I'd love it not to do today because I
don't really want to trade anymore

6914
02:46:48,389 --> 02:46:48,399
don't really want to trade anymore
 

6915
02:46:48,399 --> 02:46:50,469
don't really want to trade anymore
today, but it is possible. But I would

6916
02:46:50,469 --> 02:46:50,479
today, but it is possible. But I would
 

6917
02:46:50,479 --> 02:46:51,990
today, but it is possible. But I would
be covering into some of these

6918
02:46:51,990 --> 02:46:52,000
be covering into some of these
 

6919
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:53,190
be covering into some of these
imbalances. Look, we're going to visit

6920
02:46:53,190 --> 02:46:53,200
imbalances. Look, we're going to visit
 

6921
02:46:53,200 --> 02:46:55,590
imbalances. Look, we're going to visit
visit it very very soon now. All right.

6922
02:46:55,590 --> 02:46:55,600
visit it very very soon now. All right.
 

6923
02:46:55,600 --> 02:46:57,269
visit it very very soon now. All right.
So, Alex is going to be proved right.

6924
02:46:57,269 --> 02:46:57,279
So, Alex is going to be proved right.
 

6925
02:46:57,279 --> 02:46:59,910
So, Alex is going to be proved right.
So, you have to wait and see. Now, 70s,

6926
02:46:59,910 --> 02:46:59,920
So, you have to wait and see. Now, 70s,
 

6927
02:46:59,920 --> 02:47:02,469
So, you have to wait and see. Now, 70s,
50s, can we get value low acceptance

6928
02:47:02,469 --> 02:47:02,479
50s, can we get value low acceptance
 

6929
02:47:02,479 --> 02:47:04,550
50s, can we get value low acceptance
under that? We can then think about an

6930
02:47:04,550 --> 02:47:04,560
under that? We can then think about an
 

6931
02:47:04,560 --> 02:47:07,429
under that? We can then think about an
expansion model. It's not ideal, but

6932
02:47:07,429 --> 02:47:07,439
expansion model. It's not ideal, but
 

6933
02:47:07,439 --> 02:47:08,950
expansion model. It's not ideal, but
let's have a think about where we get on

6934
02:47:08,950 --> 02:47:08,960
let's have a think about where we get on
 

6935
02:47:08,960 --> 02:47:11,190
let's have a think about where we get on
an expansion model today if they go for

6936
02:47:11,190 --> 02:47:11,200
an expansion model today if they go for
 

6937
02:47:11,200 --> 02:47:13,590
an expansion model today if they go for
an afternoon sell.

6938
02:47:13,590 --> 02:47:13,600
an afternoon sell.
 

6939
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:18,710
an afternoon sell.
Oh, look where the 1618 is.

6940
02:47:18,710 --> 02:47:18,720
Oh, look where the 1618 is.
 

6941
02:47:18,720 --> 02:47:20,550
Oh, look where the 1618 is.
I wonder if they've done that on

6942
02:47:20,550 --> 02:47:20,560
I wonder if they've done that on
 

6943
02:47:20,560 --> 02:47:22,309
I wonder if they've done that on
purpose.

6944
02:47:22,309 --> 02:47:22,319
purpose.
 

6945
02:47:22,319 --> 02:47:24,790
purpose.
right at the naked previous week point

6946
02:47:24,790 --> 02:47:24,800
right at the naked previous week point
 

6947
02:47:24,800 --> 02:47:28,790
right at the naked previous week point
of control. All right. So if if we do an

6948
02:47:28,790 --> 02:47:28,800
of control. All right. So if if we do an
 

6949
02:47:28,800 --> 02:47:31,349
of control. All right. So if if we do an
expansion model under here, you are

6950
02:47:31,349 --> 02:47:31,359
expansion model under here, you are
 

6951
02:47:31,359 --> 02:47:33,750
expansion model under here, you are
looking for this guy here, whether it's

6952
02:47:33,750 --> 02:47:33,760
looking for this guy here, whether it's
 

6953
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:36,309
looking for this guy here, whether it's
today or tomorrow,

6954
02:47:36,309 --> 02:47:36,319
today or tomorrow,
 

6955
02:47:36,319 --> 02:47:38,710
today or tomorrow,
right? What a surprise that they've

6956
02:47:38,710 --> 02:47:38,720
right? What a surprise that they've
 

6957
02:47:38,720 --> 02:47:41,429
right? What a surprise that they've
calculated it absolutely perfectly to

6958
02:47:41,429 --> 02:47:41,439
calculated it absolutely perfectly to
 

6959
02:47:41,439 --> 02:47:53,269
calculated it absolutely perfectly to
get into that if they do an expansion.

6960
02:47:53,269 --> 02:47:53,279

 

6961
02:47:53,279 --> 02:47:56,309

What made me go short? Where? Uh,

6962
02:47:56,309 --> 02:47:56,319
What made me go short? Where? Uh,
 

6963
02:47:56,319 --> 02:47:58,070
What made me go short? Where? Uh,
Maro, I don't know which one you're

6964
02:47:58,070 --> 02:47:58,080
Maro, I don't know which one you're
 

6965
02:47:58,080 --> 02:48:08,870
Maro, I don't know which one you're
talking about.

6966
02:48:08,870 --> 02:48:08,880

 

6967
02:48:08,880 --> 02:48:10,230

Buyers are getting absorbed. Yeah,

6968
02:48:10,230 --> 02:48:10,240
Buyers are getting absorbed. Yeah,
 

6969
02:48:10,240 --> 02:48:11,670
Buyers are getting absorbed. Yeah,
probably. I mean, they they want to

6970
02:48:11,670 --> 02:48:11,680
probably. I mean, they they want to
 

6971
02:48:11,680 --> 02:48:13,030
probably. I mean, they they want to
force this down. They would need to get

6972
02:48:13,030 --> 02:48:13,040
force this down. They would need to get
 

6973
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:15,910
force this down. They would need to get
a break underneath 50s and then really

6974
02:48:15,910 --> 02:48:15,920
a break underneath 50s and then really
 

6975
02:48:15,920 --> 02:48:19,750
a break underneath 50s and then really
it can start flying.

6976
02:48:19,750 --> 02:48:19,760

 

6977
02:48:19,760 --> 02:48:21,190

What was the screen with those buyers?

6978
02:48:21,190 --> 02:48:21,200
What was the screen with those buyers?
 

6979
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:24,150
What was the screen with those buyers?
Uh, Ninja Trader, uh, I use a a third

6980
02:48:24,150 --> 02:48:24,160
Uh, Ninja Trader, uh, I use a a third
 

6981
02:48:24,160 --> 02:48:26,230
Uh, Ninja Trader, uh, I use a a third
party software called Twin Peaks. Alex,

6982
02:48:26,230 --> 02:48:26,240
party software called Twin Peaks. Alex,
 

6983
02:48:26,240 --> 02:48:28,950
party software called Twin Peaks. Alex,
do I think the order flow course is good

6984
02:48:28,950 --> 02:48:28,960
do I think the order flow course is good
 

6985
02:48:28,960 --> 02:48:30,550
do I think the order flow course is good
after the advanced course? Yes,

6986
02:48:30,550 --> 02:48:30,560
after the advanced course? Yes,
 

6987
02:48:30,560 --> 02:48:32,469
after the advanced course? Yes,
definitely. Definitely. It will improve

6988
02:48:32,469 --> 02:48:32,479
definitely. Definitely. It will improve
 

6989
02:48:32,479 --> 02:48:35,590
definitely. Definitely. It will improve
your entries in my opinion, but uh, ask

6990
02:48:35,590 --> 02:48:35,600
your entries in my opinion, but uh, ask
 

6991
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:37,750
your entries in my opinion, but uh, ask
the guys in chat, ask guys in Discord,

6992
02:48:37,750 --> 02:48:37,760
the guys in chat, ask guys in Discord,
 

6993
02:48:37,760 --> 02:48:39,750
the guys in chat, ask guys in Discord,
but a lot of them are finding a lot of,

6994
02:48:39,750 --> 02:48:39,760
but a lot of them are finding a lot of,
 

6995
02:48:39,760 --> 02:48:43,590
but a lot of them are finding a lot of,
uh, a lot of edge now from it.

6996
02:48:43,590 --> 02:48:43,600
uh, a lot of edge now from it.
 

6997
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:45,190
uh, a lot of edge now from it.
From who did I learn to trade? I've been

6998
02:48:45,190 --> 02:48:45,200
From who did I learn to trade? I've been
 

6999
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:47,110
From who did I learn to trade? I've been
in too many rooms, to be honest. I

7000
02:48:47,110 --> 02:48:47,120
in too many rooms, to be honest. I
 

7001
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:48,630
in too many rooms, to be honest. I
learned how to not trade from most

7002
02:48:48,630 --> 02:48:48,640
learned how to not trade from most
 

7003
02:48:48,640 --> 02:48:53,110
learned how to not trade from most
courses I did.

7004
02:48:53,110 --> 02:48:53,120

 

7005
02:48:53,120 --> 02:48:55,590

I've already gone over gold, dude. I've

7006
02:48:55,590 --> 02:48:55,600
I've already gone over gold, dude. I've
 

7007
02:48:55,600 --> 02:48:58,150
I've already gone over gold, dude. I've
already gone over gold. Um, yeah, I've

7008
02:48:58,150 --> 02:48:58,160
already gone over gold. Um, yeah, I've
 

7009
02:48:58,160 --> 02:49:00,230
already gone over gold. Um, yeah, I've
gone over it. I've We're going to It

7010
02:49:00,230 --> 02:49:00,240
gone over it. I've We're going to It
 

7011
02:49:00,240 --> 02:49:01,830
gone over it. I've We're going to It
looks to me like we're going to do a

7012
02:49:01,830 --> 02:49:01,840
looks to me like we're going to do a
 

7013
02:49:01,840 --> 02:49:04,950
looks to me like we're going to do a
failure to follow through on GC.

7014
02:49:04,950 --> 02:49:04,960
failure to follow through on GC.
 

7015
02:49:04,960 --> 02:49:06,870
failure to follow through on GC.
Right. So, we went over this earlier,

7016
02:49:06,870 --> 02:49:06,880
Right. So, we went over this earlier,
 

7017
02:49:06,880 --> 02:49:08,790
Right. So, we went over this earlier,
but I'll show you again. This is the

7018
02:49:08,790 --> 02:49:08,800
but I'll show you again. This is the
 

7019
02:49:08,800 --> 02:49:10,230
but I'll show you again. This is the
edge of volume. You can see I've still

7020
02:49:10,230 --> 02:49:10,240
edge of volume. You can see I've still
 

7021
02:49:10,240 --> 02:49:13,110
edge of volume. You can see I've still
got it drawn out. If price cannot find

7022
02:49:13,110 --> 02:49:13,120
got it drawn out. If price cannot find
 

7023
02:49:13,120 --> 02:49:14,870
got it drawn out. If price cannot find
acceptance over here, if we keep

7024
02:49:14,870 --> 02:49:14,880
acceptance over here, if we keep
 

7025
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:17,190
acceptance over here, if we keep
rejecting here, I would imagine you're

7026
02:49:17,190 --> 02:49:17,200
rejecting here, I would imagine you're
 

7027
02:49:17,200 --> 02:49:18,630
rejecting here, I would imagine you're
going to see an attempt to roll over

7028
02:49:18,630 --> 02:49:18,640
going to see an attempt to roll over
 

7029
02:49:18,640 --> 02:49:21,190
going to see an attempt to roll over
lower. All right? So, I would be more

7030
02:49:21,190 --> 02:49:21,200
lower. All right? So, I would be more
 

7031
02:49:21,200 --> 02:49:22,630
lower. All right? So, I would be more
comfortable positioning short here,

7032
02:49:22,630 --> 02:49:22,640
comfortable positioning short here,
 

7033
02:49:22,640 --> 02:49:24,550
comfortable positioning short here,
looking for this move. All right? And

7034
02:49:24,550 --> 02:49:24,560
looking for this move. All right? And
 

7035
02:49:24,560 --> 02:49:26,389
looking for this move. All right? And
I'll be covering some as we move down

7036
02:49:26,389 --> 02:49:26,399
I'll be covering some as we move down
 

7037
02:49:26,399 --> 02:49:27,830
I'll be covering some as we move down
and then holding runners in case we

7038
02:49:27,830 --> 02:49:27,840
and then holding runners in case we
 

7039
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:30,790
and then holding runners in case we
trade lower. If you find acceptance over

7040
02:49:30,790 --> 02:49:30,800
trade lower. If you find acceptance over
 

7041
02:49:30,800 --> 02:49:32,309
trade lower. If you find acceptance over
this shelf, all right, if you're looking

7042
02:49:32,309 --> 02:49:32,319
this shelf, all right, if you're looking
 

7043
02:49:32,319 --> 02:49:34,309
this shelf, all right, if you're looking
for a new money long, you must find

7044
02:49:34,309 --> 02:49:34,319
for a new money long, you must find
 

7045
02:49:34,319 --> 02:49:36,230
for a new money long, you must find
acceptance here. It must basically do

7046
02:49:36,230 --> 02:49:36,240
acceptance here. It must basically do
 

7047
02:49:36,240 --> 02:49:39,269
acceptance here. It must basically do
like a one of these and find acceptance

7048
02:49:39,269 --> 02:49:39,279
like a one of these and find acceptance
 

7049
02:49:39,279 --> 02:49:40,710
like a one of these and find acceptance
here and then you can look for that

7050
02:49:40,710 --> 02:49:40,720
here and then you can look for that
 

7051
02:49:40,720 --> 02:49:43,349
here and then you can look for that
breakout. Uh the easier short is

7052
02:49:43,349 --> 02:49:43,359
breakout. Uh the easier short is
 

7053
02:49:43,359 --> 02:49:44,790
breakout. Uh the easier short is
definitely on silver. All right. Gold is

7054
02:49:44,790 --> 02:49:44,800
definitely on silver. All right. Gold is
 

7055
02:49:44,800 --> 02:49:46,550
definitely on silver. All right. Gold is
a much better hedge to what's going on.

7056
02:49:46,550 --> 02:49:46,560
a much better hedge to what's going on.
 

7057
02:49:46,560 --> 02:49:48,630
a much better hedge to what's going on.
But I would not be long up here right

7058
02:49:48,630 --> 02:49:48,640
But I would not be long up here right
 

7059
02:49:48,640 --> 02:49:50,870
But I would not be long up here right
now. This is you are asking for it if

7060
02:49:50,870 --> 02:49:50,880
now. This is you are asking for it if
 

7061
02:49:50,880 --> 02:50:09,910
now. This is you are asking for it if
you get long up there. Honestly,

7062
02:50:09,910 --> 02:50:09,920

 

7063
02:50:09,920 --> 02:50:14,070

180 trap shorts could pay out soon. 180.

7064
02:50:14,070 --> 02:50:14,080
180 trap shorts could pay out soon. 180.
 

7065
02:50:14,080 --> 02:50:15,910
180 trap shorts could pay out soon. 180.
Um, I don't think so, mate. Let me have

7066
02:50:15,910 --> 02:50:15,920
Um, I don't think so, mate. Let me have
 

7067
02:50:15,920 --> 02:50:18,870
Um, I don't think so, mate. Let me have
a look.

7068
02:50:18,870 --> 02:50:18,880
a look.
 

7069
02:50:18,880 --> 02:50:21,269
a look.
No, I don't think so.

7070
02:50:21,269 --> 02:50:21,279
No, I don't think so.
 

7071
02:50:21,279 --> 02:50:24,070
No, I don't think so.
I don't think so. It's just a big level

7072
02:50:24,070 --> 02:50:24,080
I don't think so. It's just a big level
 

7073
02:50:24,080 --> 02:50:25,670
I don't think so. It's just a big level
all over. I don't think there are many

7074
02:50:25,670 --> 02:50:25,680
all over. I don't think there are many
 

7075
02:50:25,680 --> 02:50:26,950
all over. I don't think there are many
shorts trapped here right now. You're

7076
02:50:26,950 --> 02:50:26,960
shorts trapped here right now. You're
 

7077
02:50:26,960 --> 02:50:29,269
shorts trapped here right now. You're
trading at previous week close here.

7078
02:50:29,269 --> 02:50:29,279
trading at previous week close here.
 

7079
02:50:29,279 --> 02:50:30,950
trading at previous week close here.
Like I said, 150 is the level. You're

7080
02:50:30,950 --> 02:50:30,960
Like I said, 150 is the level. You're
 

7081
02:50:30,960 --> 02:50:33,030
Like I said, 150 is the level. You're
starting to already lose 170. So, you've

7082
02:50:33,030 --> 02:50:33,040
starting to already lose 170. So, you've
 

7083
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:37,190
starting to already lose 170. So, you've
already lost 189, you're losing 170. 150

7084
02:50:37,190 --> 02:50:37,200
already lost 189, you're losing 170. 150
 

7085
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:39,030
already lost 189, you're losing 170. 150
is the next level. And if you lose that,

7086
02:50:39,030 --> 02:50:39,040
is the next level. And if you lose that,
 

7087
02:50:39,040 --> 02:50:40,630
is the next level. And if you lose that,
then all of those buyers are going to be

7088
02:50:40,630 --> 02:50:40,640
then all of those buyers are going to be
 

7089
02:50:40,640 --> 02:50:42,550
then all of those buyers are going to be
way out position. All the big buyers we

7090
02:50:42,550 --> 02:50:42,560
way out position. All the big buyers we
 

7091
02:50:42,560 --> 02:50:44,150
way out position. All the big buyers we
talked about that were coming in here in

7092
02:50:44,150 --> 02:50:44,160
talked about that were coming in here in
 

7093
02:50:44,160 --> 02:50:46,070
talked about that were coming in here in
clusters. All right? If you trade under

7094
02:50:46,070 --> 02:50:46,080
clusters. All right? If you trade under
 

7095
02:50:46,080 --> 02:50:47,590
clusters. All right? If you trade under
this, they are all going to be out of

7096
02:50:47,590 --> 02:50:47,600
this, they are all going to be out of
 

7097
02:50:47,600 --> 02:50:50,230
this, they are all going to be out of
position. They will all be hurt. Right?

7098
02:50:50,230 --> 02:50:50,240
position. They will all be hurt. Right?
 

7099
02:50:50,240 --> 02:50:51,110
position. They will all be hurt. Right?
Then you're going to have all this

7100
02:50:51,110 --> 02:50:51,120
Then you're going to have all this
 

7101
02:50:51,120 --> 02:50:53,910
Then you're going to have all this
volume here and here trapped because

7102
02:50:53,910 --> 02:50:53,920
volume here and here trapped because
 

7103
02:50:53,920 --> 02:50:55,830
volume here and here trapped because
like I talked about, here's your main

7104
02:50:55,830 --> 02:50:55,840
like I talked about, here's your main
 

7105
02:50:55,840 --> 02:50:58,309
like I talked about, here's your main
trend. Here's the pullback. Here's the

7106
02:50:58,309 --> 02:50:58,319
trend. Here's the pullback. Here's the
 

7107
02:50:58,319 --> 02:51:00,309
trend. Here's the pullback. Here's the
liquidity build. Here's the edge of it.

7108
02:51:00,309 --> 02:51:00,319
liquidity build. Here's the edge of it.
 

7109
02:51:00,319 --> 02:51:01,910
liquidity build. Here's the edge of it.
If you leave this, you will try and

7110
02:51:01,910 --> 02:51:01,920
If you leave this, you will try and
 

7111
02:51:01,920 --> 02:51:06,150
If you leave this, you will try and
revisit the lows.

7112
02:51:06,150 --> 02:51:06,160

 

7113
02:51:06,160 --> 02:51:07,830

Why I said I would not be long up here.

7114
02:51:07,830 --> 02:51:07,840
Why I said I would not be long up here.
 

7115
02:51:07,840 --> 02:51:11,269
Why I said I would not be long up here.
Like, I just don't think that is a play.

7116
02:51:11,269 --> 02:51:11,279
Like, I just don't think that is a play.
 

7117
02:51:11,279 --> 02:51:13,110
Like, I just don't think that is a play.
But you guys manage your own book. Don't

7118
02:51:13,110 --> 02:51:13,120
But you guys manage your own book. Don't
 

7119
02:51:13,120 --> 02:51:15,190
But you guys manage your own book. Don't
be like the guy earlier

7120
02:51:15,190 --> 02:51:15,200
be like the guy earlier
 

7121
02:51:15,200 --> 02:51:26,630
be like the guy earlier
saying it's my fault he's lost.

7122
02:51:26,630 --> 02:51:26,640

 

7123
02:51:26,640 --> 02:51:28,550

Can we set them for a re-entry in the G

7124
02:51:28,550 --> 02:51:28,560
Can we set them for a re-entry in the G
 

7125
02:51:28,560 --> 02:51:30,550
Can we set them for a re-entry in the G
in the gray box for a re-entry short?

7126
02:51:30,550 --> 02:51:30,560
in the gray box for a re-entry short?
 

7127
02:51:30,560 --> 02:51:33,510
in the gray box for a re-entry short?
Yes, you can. Yes, you can. If they fade

7128
02:51:33,510 --> 02:51:33,520
Yes, you can. Yes, you can. If they fade
 

7129
02:51:33,520 --> 02:51:35,510
Yes, you can. Yes, you can. If they fade
away from this and they reject it,

7130
02:51:35,510 --> 02:51:35,520
away from this and they reject it,
 

7131
02:51:35,520 --> 02:51:37,910
away from this and they reject it,
right? If they fade away from this and

7132
02:51:37,910 --> 02:51:37,920
right? If they fade away from this and
 

7133
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:39,510
right? If they fade away from this and
they reject it, you need to see buyers

7134
02:51:39,510 --> 02:51:39,520
they reject it, you need to see buyers
 

7135
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:40,950
they reject it, you need to see buyers
come and get trapped here and then you

7136
02:51:40,950 --> 02:51:40,960
come and get trapped here and then you
 

7137
02:51:40,960 --> 02:51:43,910
come and get trapped here and then you
can resell it down to here. It's not the

7138
02:51:43,910 --> 02:51:43,920
can resell it down to here. It's not the
 

7139
02:51:43,920 --> 02:51:45,990
can resell it down to here. It's not the
best. It's great momentum. It's not the

7140
02:51:45,990 --> 02:51:46,000
best. It's great momentum. It's not the
 

7141
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:47,590
best. It's great momentum. It's not the
best location on the day, is it? The

7142
02:51:47,590 --> 02:51:47,600
best location on the day, is it? The
 

7143
02:51:47,600 --> 02:51:49,510
best location on the day, is it? The
best location on the day was here or

7144
02:51:49,510 --> 02:51:49,520
best location on the day was here or
 

7145
02:51:49,520 --> 02:51:51,910
best location on the day was here or
here like we talked about. But if they

7146
02:51:51,910 --> 02:51:51,920
here like we talked about. But if they
 

7147
02:51:51,920 --> 02:51:54,070
here like we talked about. But if they
do that, it is a valid trade. But they

7148
02:51:54,070 --> 02:51:54,080
do that, it is a valid trade. But they
 

7149
02:51:54,080 --> 02:52:09,910
do that, it is a valid trade. But they
must stay heavy versus this.

7150
02:52:09,910 --> 02:52:09,920

 

7151
02:52:09,920 --> 02:52:11,590

look for that ad lower or the ad to
trade lower, right? But you can cover

7238
02:53:47,910 --> 02:53:47,920
trade lower, right? But you can cover
 

7239
02:53:47,920 --> 02:53:49,590
trade lower, right? But you can cover
some here now and you can hold some for

7240
02:53:49,590 --> 02:53:49,600
some here now and you can hold some for
 

7241
02:53:49,600 --> 02:53:51,269
some here now and you can hold some for
lower day and expansion. And like I

7242
02:53:51,269 --> 02:53:51,279
lower day and expansion. And like I
 

7243
02:53:51,279 --> 02:53:53,510
lower day and expansion. And like I
said, we did the fib. It's very possible

7244
02:53:53,510 --> 02:53:53,520
said, we did the fib. It's very possible
 

7245
02:53:53,520 --> 02:53:54,870
said, we did the fib. It's very possible
we come into previous week's point

7246

we come into previous week's point
 

7247
02:53:54,880 --> 02:53:56,790
we come into previous week's point
control. I really hope it doesn't do

7248
02:53:56,790 --> 02:53:56,800
control. I really hope it doesn't do
 

7249
02:53:56,800 --> 02:54:00,710
control. I really hope it doesn't do
that so I can get this trade tomorrow,

7250
02:54:00,710 --> 02:54:00,720
that so I can get this trade tomorrow,
 

7251
02:54:00,720 --> 02:54:02,309
that so I can get this trade tomorrow,
right? Because I'm not feeling up to

7252
02:54:02,309 --> 02:54:02,319
right? Because I'm not feeling up to
 

7253
02:54:02,319 --> 02:54:20,070
right? Because I'm not feeling up to
trading much more today.

to trade away from it and reject this
 

7269
02:54:33,040 --> 02:54:36,150

7309
02:55:37,840 --> 02:55:39,670

Why one minute over five minute? Uh I

02:55:39,670 --> 02:55:39,680
Why one minute over five minute? Uh I
 

7311

02:55:42,319 --> 02:55:43,830
use both dude. I use both. So on my
screen I have a one, a five, an hourly

7314
02:55:43,830 --> 02:55:43,840
screen I have a one, a five, an hourly
 

7315
02:55:43,840 --> 02:55:45,510
screen I have a one, a five, an hourly
and a daily. And over here I have a five

7316
02:55:45,510 --> 02:55:45,520
and a daily. And over here I have a five
 

7317
02:55:45,520 --> 02:55:48,150
and a daily. And over here I have a five
five55. But over here I'm looking at ES

7318
02:55:48,150 --> 02:55:48,160
five55. But over here I'm looking at ES
 

7319
02:55:48,160 --> 02:55:52,950
five55. But over here I'm looking at ES
Spy, uh QQQ and VIX. So I'm I'm looking

7320
02:55:52,950 --> 02:55:52,960
Spy, uh QQQ and VIX. So I'm I'm looking
 

7321
02:55:52,960 --> 02:55:55,349
Spy, uh QQQ and VIX. So I'm I'm looking
at all sorts all the time. It's just

7322
02:55:55,349 --> 02:55:55,359
at all sorts all the time. It's just
 

7323
02:55:55,359 --> 02:55:57,750
at all sorts all the time. It's just
when I'm looking at where we're for

7324
02:55:57,750 --> 02:55:57,760
when I'm looking at where we're for
 

7325
02:55:57,760 --> 02:55:59,830
when I'm looking at where we're for
execution, I want to be on the lowest

7326
02:55:59,830 --> 02:55:59,840
execution, I want to be on the lowest
 

7327
02:55:59,840 --> 02:56:01,830
execution, I want to be on the lowest
chart possible, right? Because I want to

7328
02:56:01,830 --> 02:56:01,840
chart possible, right? Because I want to
 

7329
02:56:01,840 --> 02:56:03,830
chart possible, right? Because I want to
have accurate execution. All right? If

7330
02:56:03,830 --> 02:56:03,840
have accurate execution. All right? If
 

7331
02:56:03,840 --> 02:56:06,230
have accurate execution. All right? If
I'm going to risk versus this and put my

7332
02:56:06,230 --> 02:56:06,240
I'm going to risk versus this and put my
 

7333
02:56:06,240 --> 02:56:08,230
I'm going to risk versus this and put my
stop here, I want to have accurate

7334
02:56:08,230 --> 02:56:08,240
stop here, I want to have accurate
 

7335
02:56:08,240 --> 02:56:09,910
stop here, I want to have accurate
execution. I want to see who's trapped,

7336
02:56:09,910 --> 02:56:09,920
execution. I want to see who's trapped,
 

7337
02:56:09,920 --> 02:56:12,070
execution. I want to see who's trapped,
where they're trapped, to trade lower.

7338
02:56:12,070 --> 02:56:12,080
where they're trapped, to trade lower.
 

7339
02:56:12,080 --> 02:56:13,750
where they're trapped, to trade lower.
All right? So, the lower the time frame,

7340
02:56:13,750 --> 02:56:13,760
All right? So, the lower the time frame,
 

7341
02:56:13,760 --> 02:56:15,110
All right? So, the lower the time frame,
the more accurate I can be with my

7342
02:56:15,110 --> 02:56:15,120
the more accurate I can be with my
 

7343
02:56:15,120 --> 02:56:17,510
the more accurate I can be with my
execution. My bias does not come from a

7344
02:56:17,510 --> 02:56:17,520
execution. My bias does not come from a
 

7345
02:56:17,520 --> 02:56:24,070
execution. My bias does not come from a
one minute chart.

7346
02:56:24,070 --> 02:56:24,080
