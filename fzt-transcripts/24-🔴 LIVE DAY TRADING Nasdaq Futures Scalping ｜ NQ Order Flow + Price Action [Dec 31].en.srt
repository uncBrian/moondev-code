been talking about it. We've been
 

25
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,830
been talking about it. We've been
trading inside. We were trading inside

bar we talked about overnight, we gapped

32
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
bar we talked about overnight, we gapped
 

33
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,590
bar we talked about overnight, we gapped
down. All right, we came and filled into

34
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
down. All right, we came and filled into
 

35
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,390
down. All right, we came and filled into
the Friday close. All right, so creating

00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
the Friday close. All right, so creating
 

37
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,390
the Friday close. All right, so creating
efficiency in here, closing Friday, this

38
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
efficiency in here, closing Friday, this
 

39
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,510
efficiency in here, closing Friday, this
gray box you would have seen, it's been

40
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
gray box you would have seen, it's been
 

41
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,270
gray box you would have seen, it's been
here the whole time into this low volume

42
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
here the whole time into this low volume
 

43
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,670
here the whole time into this low volume
node which we've repriced. We have found

44
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
node which we've repriced. We have found
 

45
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,390
node which we've repriced. We have found
a bid off there. All right. On the uh

46
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
a bid off there. All right. On the uh
 

47
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,749
a bid off there. All right. On the uh
job numbers, if you want to believe

48
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
job numbers, if you want to believe
 

49
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,430
job numbers, if you want to believe
them, I would say that is about the most

50
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
them, I would say that is about the most
 

51
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,870
them, I would say that is about the most
obvious cooking of the books I've ever

52
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
obvious cooking of the books I've ever
 

53
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,990
obvious cooking of the books I've ever
seen. But hey, they are what they are

54
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
seen. But hey, they are what they are
 

55
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,870
seen. But hey, they are what they are
and uh this is what they do. So,

56
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
and uh this is what they do. So,
 

57
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,629
and uh this is what they do. So,
apparently they're revised and they're

58
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
apparently they're revised and they're
 

59
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,909
apparently they're revised and they're
really good. They're better than

60
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
really good. They're better than
 

61
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,110
really good. They're better than
expected. [\h__\h] But anyway, they

62
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
expected. [\h__\h] But anyway, they
 

63
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,790
expected. [\h__\h] But anyway, they
revised them perfectly at the perfect

64
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
revised them perfectly at the perfect
 

65
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,590
revised them perfectly at the perfect
time to buy that dip.

66
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
time to buy that dip.
 

67
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,150
time to buy that dip.
And uh now we uh can come back and look

68
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
And uh now we uh can come back and look
 

69
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,710
And uh now we uh can come back and look
at the rotation back above us. So, we're

70
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
at the rotation back above us. So, we're
 

71
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,390
at the rotation back above us. So, we're
looking at the same area. So right now

72
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
looking at the same area. So right now
 

73
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,830
looking at the same area. So right now
what it looks like at the moment is a

74
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
what it looks like at the moment is a
 

75
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,110
what it looks like at the moment is a
look below and fail as we come back into

76
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
look below and fail as we come back into
 

77
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,029
look below and fail as we come back into
the previous week range, the previous

78
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
the previous week range, the previous
 

79
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,950
the previous week range, the previous
day range, and the range on the on the

80
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
day range, and the range on the on the
 

81
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,390
day range, and the range on the on the
current week. All right, as we come back

82
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
current week. All right, as we come back
 

83
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,390
current week. All right, as we come back
inside that, if we go down to the

84
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
inside that, if we go down to the
 

85
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,990
inside that, if we go down to the
hourlys, we're going to see a little bit

86
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
hourlys, we're going to see a little bit
 

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,150
hourlys, we're going to see a little bit
more of an idea of what's going on. All

88
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
more of an idea of what's going on. All
 

89
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,830
more of an idea of what's going on. All
right, so what I'm actually just going

90
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
right, so what I'm actually just going
 

91
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,230
right, so what I'm actually just going
to do here

92
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
to do here
 

93
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,469
to do here
is

94
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
is
 

95
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:22,950
is
just do a fixed range from Sunday's open

96
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960

 

97
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,390

All right. So, that's the current weekly

98
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
All right. So, that's the current weekly
 

99
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,870
All right. So, that's the current weekly
range. This blue box, if anyone was

100
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
range. This blue box, if anyone was
 

101
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,629
range. This blue box, if anyone was
trading premarket, this blue box is what

102
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
trading premarket, this blue box is what
 

103
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,909
trading premarket, this blue box is what
I gave you uh in the weekly newsletter

104
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
I gave you uh in the weekly newsletter
 

105
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,510
I gave you uh in the weekly newsletter
and all week. And we talked about this

106
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
and all week. And we talked about this
 

107
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,029
and all week. And we talked about this
node here. Someone asked, do I look at

108
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
node here. Someone asked, do I look at
 

109
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,189
node here. Someone asked, do I look at
volume outside of value? And I said yes.

110
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
volume outside of value? And I said yes.
 

111
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,270
volume outside of value? And I said yes.
And that's why. All right. So, once we

112
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
And that's why. All right. So, once we
 

113
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,790
And that's why. All right. So, once we
close a gap and came into that node,

114
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
close a gap and came into that node,
 

115
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,550
close a gap and came into that node,
it's clearly found a bid. It's been a

116
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
it's clearly found a bid. It's been a
 

117
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,629
it's clearly found a bid. It's been a
very aggressive bid off that jobs number

118
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
very aggressive bid off that jobs number
 

119
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,230
very aggressive bid off that jobs number
and we've gone straight back where

120
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
and we've gone straight back where
 

121
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,150
and we've gone straight back where
straight back into current week and

122
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
straight back into current week and
 

123
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,309
straight back into current week and
previous week and previous days value.

124
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
previous week and previous days value.
 

125
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,070
previous week and previous days value.
All right. So if we think about this

126
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
All right. So if we think about this
 

127
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,230
All right. So if we think about this
previous week's value is here. Previous

128
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
previous week's value is here. Previous
 

129
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,430
previous week's value is here. Previous
days value is

130
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
days value is
 

131
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,029
days value is
here.

132
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
here.
 

133
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,629
here.
Current week's value is here. All right.

134
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
Current week's value is here. All right.
 

135
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,110
Current week's value is here. All right.
And you have to ask yourself are we

136
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
And you have to ask yourself are we
 

137
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,830
And you have to ask yourself are we
finding acceptance below at the moment?

138
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
finding acceptance below at the moment?
 

139
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,070
finding acceptance below at the moment?
The answer is absolutely clearly no. We

140
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,080
The answer is absolutely clearly no. We
 

141
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,230
The answer is absolutely clearly no. We
could not get outside of previous week's

142
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240
could not get outside of previous week's
 

143
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,710
could not get outside of previous week's
value. It had an attempt to leg down

144
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
value. It had an attempt to leg down
 

145
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,510
value. It had an attempt to leg down
here and it instantly got reclaimed. So

146
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:19,520
here and it instantly got reclaimed. So
 

147
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,870
here and it instantly got reclaimed. So
what does that mean? Currently

148
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:20,880
what does that mean? Currently
 

149
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,270
what does that mean? Currently
everything outside previous week is not

150
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
everything outside previous week is not
 

151
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,710
everything outside previous week is not
being accepted. We're not accepting

152
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:24,720
being accepted. We're not accepting
 

153
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,629
being accepted. We're not accepting
lower prices. So what what are the

154
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
lower prices. So what what are the
 

155
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,469
lower prices. So what what are the
possibilities this morning? We can go

156
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
possibilities this morning? We can go
 

157
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,309
possibilities this morning? We can go
into more of a rotation. Absolutely. Um

158
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,319
into more of a rotation. Absolutely. Um
 

159
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,510
into more of a rotation. Absolutely. Um
we can potentially fail this uh point of

160
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
we can potentially fail this uh point of
 

161
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,510
we can potentially fail this uh point of
control, right? Two times point of

162
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
control, right? Two times point of
 

163
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,710
control, right? Two times point of
control, which is where we're failing at

164
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
control, which is where we're failing at
 

165
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,990
control, which is where we're failing at
the moment. But I'd be very careful

166
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
the moment. But I'd be very careful
 

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,909
the moment. But I'd be very careful
about think being too slanted into being

168
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
about think being too slanted into being
 

169
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,550
about think being too slanted into being
bearish. That's a decent reaction. So

170
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
bearish. That's a decent reaction. So
 

171
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,870
bearish. That's a decent reaction. So
what would I be thinking? Well, can we

172
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:46,880
what would I be thinking? Well, can we
 

173
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,390
what would I be thinking? Well, can we
hold

174
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
hold
 

175
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,430
hold
uh previous day or previous or current

176
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
uh previous day or previous or current
 

177
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,670
uh previous day or previous or current
week value? All right, so do bulls come

178
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:53,680
week value? All right, so do bulls come
 

179
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,909
week value? All right, so do bulls come
in and sort of defend let's call it

180
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
in and sort of defend let's call it
 

181
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,950
in and sort of defend let's call it
680s. Right, that's the first level. Do

182
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
680s. Right, that's the first level. Do
 

183
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,990
680s. Right, that's the first level. Do
bulls defend 680s? That's neat here.

184
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
bulls defend 680s? That's neat here.
 

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,070
bulls defend 680s? That's neat here.
Sorry about that, Tim. All right, if

186
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
Sorry about that, Tim. All right, if
 

187
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,670
Sorry about that, Tim. All right, if
they defend 680s, what are we looking

188
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
they defend 680s, what are we looking
 

189
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,589
they defend 680s, what are we looking
at? We're looking at this same rotation.

190
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
at? We're looking at this same rotation.
 

191
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,150
at? We're looking at this same rotation.
All right, if bulls defend 680s, right,

192
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
All right, if bulls defend 680s, right,
 

193
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,830
All right, if bulls defend 680s, right,
that' be a higher low. We're looking at

194
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
that' be a higher low. We're looking at
 

195
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,869
that' be a higher low. We're looking at
the same rotation back up to 740s and

196
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:16,879
the same rotation back up to 740s and
 

197
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,029
the same rotation back up to 740s and
then it's the same play as yesterday. Do

198
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:19,039
then it's the same play as yesterday. Do
 

199
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,830
then it's the same play as yesterday. Do
we find acceptance through 740s? All

200
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
we find acceptance through 740s? All
 

201
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,550
we find acceptance through 740s? All
right, and can we get do they do

202
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,560
right, and can we get do they do
 

203
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,790
right, and can we get do they do
something like this? All right, all day

204
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
something like this? All right, all day
 

205
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,670
something like this? All right, all day
or do we get something like this and

206
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,680
or do we get something like this and
 

207
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,270
or do we get something like this and
come and try and get to the other side

208
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
come and try and get to the other side
 

209
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,949
come and try and get to the other side
of the weekly value considering we've

210
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
of the weekly value considering we've
 

211
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,670
of the weekly value considering we've
just done a look below and fail. Are we

212
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
just done a look below and fail. Are we
 

213
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,790
just done a look below and fail. Are we
now going to come to the other side of

214
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
now going to come to the other side of
 

215
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,909
now going to come to the other side of
the week? That would be the first thing

216
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
the week? That would be the first thing
 

217
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,149
the week? That would be the first thing
I'd be looking at. If bulls do a deeper

218
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
I'd be looking at. If bulls do a deeper
 

219
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,709
I'd be looking at. If bulls do a deeper
drive this morning, right? If bears

220
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
drive this morning, right? If bears
 

221
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,790
drive this morning, right? If bears
defend point of control, current week,

222
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
defend point of control, current week,
 

223
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,550
defend point of control, current week,
previous day, which is where we're

224
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
previous day, which is where we're
 

225
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,070
previous day, which is where we're
currently finding a sell around these

226
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
currently finding a sell around these
 

227
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,070
currently finding a sell around these
sort of 17s,

228
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
sort of 17s,
 

229
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,310
sort of 17s,
seven in the teens, 720. All right. And

230
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
seven in the teens, 720. All right. And
 

231
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,470
seven in the teens, 720. All right. And
if they fail outside of current week and

232
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
if they fail outside of current week and
 

233
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,630
if they fail outside of current week and
previous day value, then we'll be

234
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
previous day value, then we'll be
 

235
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,389
previous day value, then we'll be
looking at this pivot here. All right,

236
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
looking at this pivot here. All right,
 

237
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,389
looking at this pivot here. All right,
previous week value area high. So, I'd

238
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
previous week value area high. So, I'd
 

239
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,310
previous week value area high. So, I'd
be watching 680s to see if it's

240
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,320
be watching 680s to see if it's
 

241
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,269
be watching 680s to see if it's
defended, 630s to see if it's defended.

242
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
defended, 630s to see if it's defended.
 

243
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,430
defended, 630s to see if it's defended.
If that isn't defended, then I'm going

244
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
If that isn't defended, then I'm going
 

245
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,590
If that isn't defended, then I'm going
to assume we're starting to uh

246
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
to assume we're starting to uh
 

247
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,430
to assume we're starting to uh
potentially drift. All right, because

248
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
potentially drift. All right, because
 

249
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,430
potentially drift. All right, because
this is overnight volume. We're probably

250
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
this is overnight volume. We're probably
 

251
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,310
this is overnight volume. We're probably
going to drift down into here, 518s, and

252
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
going to drift down into here, 518s, and
 

253
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,870
going to drift down into here, 518s, and
possibly all the way down into this old

254
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
possibly all the way down into this old
 

255
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,230
possibly all the way down into this old
naked weekly point of control. Right, we

256
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
naked weekly point of control. Right, we
 

257
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,470
naked weekly point of control. Right, we
have not tested that since we broke away

258
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
have not tested that since we broke away
 

259
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,070
have not tested that since we broke away
from it. This is the area I've been

260
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
from it. This is the area I've been
 

261
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,829
from it. This is the area I've been
really waiting for price to come back

262
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
really waiting for price to come back
 

263
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,230
really waiting for price to come back
to. So, we have to be flexible. All

264
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
to. So, we have to be flexible. All
 

265
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,670
to. So, we have to be flexible. All
right, we have to be flexible because

266
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
right, we have to be flexible because
 

267
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,990
right, we have to be flexible because
we're trading inside a previous week,

268
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
we're trading inside a previous week,
 

269
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,150
we're trading inside a previous week,
inside a current week. We found a bid

270
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
inside a current week. We found a bid
 

271
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,550
inside a current week. We found a bid
without acceptance and we're back to

272
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560
without acceptance and we're back to
 

273
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,710
without acceptance and we're back to
value on those previous week, current

274
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
value on those previous week, current
 

275
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,389
value on those previous week, current
week, previous day. All right, so we

276
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:42,399
week, previous day. All right, so we
 

277
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,470
week, previous day. All right, so we
need to be flexible here today. Do not

278
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
need to be flexible here today. Do not
 

279
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,949
need to be flexible here today. Do not
be too rigid, but I would say

280
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
be too rigid, but I would say
 

281
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,590
be too rigid, but I would say
possibility or a dip opportunity here

282
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
possibility or a dip opportunity here
 

283
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,389
possibility or a dip opportunity here
and here would be the first things I'd

284
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
and here would be the first things I'd
 

285
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,829
and here would be the first things I'd
consider. right? Unless unless we push

286
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:55,839
consider. right? Unless unless we push
 

287
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,030
consider. right? Unless unless we push
and fail right at the open and then you

288
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
and fail right at the open and then you
 

289
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,070
and fail right at the open and then you
need to see do they just slap us back

290
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,080
need to see do they just slap us back
 

291
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,230
need to see do they just slap us back
all the way back down. But be flexible

292
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
all the way back down. But be flexible
 

293
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,829
all the way back down. But be flexible
today. Remember it's very light volume.

294
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
today. Remember it's very light volume.
 

295
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,910
today. Remember it's very light volume.
Last trading day of the week uh of the

296
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
Last trading day of the week uh of the
 

297
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,070
Last trading day of the week uh of the
week. Last trading day of the year,

298
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:10,080
week. Last trading day of the year,
 

299
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,070
week. Last trading day of the year,
right? Very light volume. If we just

300
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,080
right? Very light volume. If we just
 

301
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,590
right? Very light volume. If we just
move up into a fivem minute. Do I need

302
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
move up into a fivem minute. Do I need
 

303
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,949
move up into a fivem minute. Do I need
to make this bigger for you guys? There

304
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:14,959
to make this bigger for you guys? There
 

305
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,269
to make this bigger for you guys? There
we go. We move up to a fivem minute. You

306
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279
we go. We move up to a fivem minute. You
 

307
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,350
we go. We move up to a fivem minute. You
can see how we've had that nice curl off

308
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
can see how we've had that nice curl off
 

309
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,350
can see how we've had that nice curl off
the bottom. So Asia sideways, London

310
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
the bottom. So Asia sideways, London
 

311
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,190
the bottom. So Asia sideways, London
expansion, gap been filled, gone back

312
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
expansion, gap been filled, gone back
 

313
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,269
expansion, gap been filled, gone back
the other side, reclaimed 21, reclaimed

314
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
the other side, reclaimed 21, reclaimed
 

315
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,790
the other side, reclaimed 21, reclaimed
200 into point of control. And for me,

316
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
200 into point of control. And for me,
 

317
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,030
200 into point of control. And for me,
momentum at the moment is with the

318
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
momentum at the moment is with the
 

319
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,750
momentum at the moment is with the
bulls. It's just a question of if and

320
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
bulls. It's just a question of if and
 

321
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,590
bulls. It's just a question of if and
where they step in. If they don't step

322
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
where they step in. If they don't step
 

323
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,750
where they step in. If they don't step
in, they don't step in. That's as simple

324
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
in, they don't step in. That's as simple
 

325
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,670
in, they don't step in. That's as simple
as that.

326
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
as that.
 

327
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,230
as that.
Okay, high time uh lower time frame

328
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
Okay, high time uh lower time frame
 

329
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,910
Okay, high time uh lower time frame
even. God, get your words out today,

330
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
even. God, get your words out today,
 

331
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,150
even. God, get your words out today,
Alex. And let's have a look to see if we

332
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
Alex. And let's have a look to see if we
 

333
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,509
Alex. And let's have a look to see if we
can see

334
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
can see
 

335
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,670
can see
any divergences or anything going on in

336
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
any divergences or anything going on in
 

337
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,509
any divergences or anything going on in
the ES. Let's have a little look see

338
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
the ES. Let's have a little look see
 

339
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,910
the ES. Let's have a little look see
here.

340
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
here.
 

341
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,389
here.
Same kind of setup here on ES. All

342
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
Same kind of setup here on ES. All
 

343
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,790
Same kind of setup here on ES. All
right, we talked about this earlier in

344
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
right, we talked about this earlier in
 

345
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,590
right, we talked about this earlier in
the week. Right, taking out this pivot.

346
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
the week. Right, taking out this pivot.
 

347
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,350
the week. Right, taking out this pivot.
It's got another high to aim for over

348
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
It's got another high to aim for over
 

349
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,190
It's got another high to aim for over
here.

350
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
here.
 

351
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,550
here.
There's your pullback. If they're going

352
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
There's your pullback. If they're going
 

353
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,190
There's your pullback. If they're going
to hold this and accelerate, they can

354
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
to hold this and accelerate, they can
 

355
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,710
to hold this and accelerate, they can
look for that all-time high move. This

356
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
look for that all-time high move. This
 

357
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,910
look for that all-time high move. This
is probably a nice 30. Yeah, right into

358
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
is probably a nice 30. Yeah, right into
 

359
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,389
is probably a nice 30. Yeah, right into
the sort of bull zone scenario for a

360
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
the sort of bull zone scenario for a
 

361
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,910
the sort of bull zone scenario for a
pullback to hold. So, it all depends.

362
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:19,920
pullback to hold. So, it all depends.
 

363
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,910
pullback to hold. So, it all depends.
Are they able to get going or are they

364
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
Are they able to get going or are they
 

365
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,590
Are they able to get going or are they
going to get caught in this same

366
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
going to get caught in this same
 

367
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,430
going to get caught in this same
consolidation here? All right. So, do

368
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
consolidation here? All right. So, do
 

369
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,310
consolidation here? All right. So, do
they fail this and do this? Do they keep

370
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,320
they fail this and do this? Do they keep
 

371
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,030
they fail this and do this? Do they keep
squeezing or do bears just say no, no,

372
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
squeezing or do bears just say no, no,
 

373
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,630
squeezing or do bears just say no, no,
no, no, no. You're not coming back into

374
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
no, no, no. You're not coming back into
 

375
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,030
no, no, no. You're not coming back into
this old balance which we created. If we

376
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
this old balance which we created. If we
 

377
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,430
this old balance which we created. If we
look at the spiders,

378
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
look at the spiders,
 

379
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,790
look at the spiders,
right, you will know I've talked about

380
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
right, you will know I've talked about
 

381
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,470
right, you will know I've talked about
it. They've had uh

382
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,480
it. They've had uh
 

383
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,710
it. They've had uh
new highs created a complete opposite to

384
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
new highs created a complete opposite to
 

385
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,030
new highs created a complete opposite to
ES. All right, this has not created a

386
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
ES. All right, this has not created a
 

387
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,790
ES. All right, this has not created a
new high up here. All right, so we have

388
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
new high up here. All right, so we have
 

389
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:58,710
new high up here. All right, so we have
divergence in the spy.

390
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720

 

391
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,389

Yeah, exactly the same scenario.

392
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
Yeah, exactly the same scenario.
 

393
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,550
Yeah, exactly the same scenario.
Nothing's changed there. Finding a pivot

394
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
Nothing's changed there. Finding a pivot
 

395
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,230
Nothing's changed there. Finding a pivot
off this little stop start we talked

396
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,240
off this little stop start we talked
 

397
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,069
off this little stop start we talked
about. All right, bid off there. Might

398
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
about. All right, bid off there. Might
 

399
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,829
about. All right, bid off there. Might
get stuck here. Might rotate more. Might

400
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
get stuck here. Might rotate more. Might
 

401
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,670
get stuck here. Might rotate more. Might
come down. try and rebid if they start

402
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680
come down. try and rebid if they start
 

403
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,350
come down. try and rebid if they start
losing this. This is where bears can

404
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
losing this. This is where bears can
 

405
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,670
losing this. This is where bears can
really actually take control.

406
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
really actually take control.
 

407
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,750
really actually take control.
So, nothing too much to look at. Q's

408
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
So, nothing too much to look at. Q's
 

409
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,590
So, nothing too much to look at. Q's
exactly the same. All right, little

410
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
exactly the same. All right, little
 

411
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,110
exactly the same. All right, little
undercut here.

412
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
undercut here.
 

413
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,269
undercut here.
Found a bid back to this chop zone. All

414
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
Found a bid back to this chop zone. All
 

415
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,870
Found a bid back to this chop zone. All
right, this is the zone I really don't

416
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
right, this is the zone I really don't
 

417
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,389
right, this is the zone I really don't
want to trade in if I can avoid it. I

418
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399
want to trade in if I can avoid it. I
 

419
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,509
want to trade in if I can avoid it. I
don't really want to start a new

420
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:27,519
don't really want to start a new
 

421
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,750
don't really want to start a new
position there. So, I'm open to dips,

422
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
position there. So, I'm open to dips,
 

423
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,910
position there. So, I'm open to dips,
open to push and holds, open to push and

424
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
open to push and holds, open to push and
 

425
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,509
open to push and holds, open to push and
fails, and open to re offers under here.

426
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519
fails, and open to re offers under here.
 

427
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,509
fails, and open to re offers under here.
I don't really if I can avoid it, I

428
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
I don't really if I can avoid it, I
 

429
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,190
I don't really if I can avoid it, I
don't really want to trade into this

430
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200
don't really want to trade into this
 

431
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,389
don't really want to trade into this
zone ideally in an ideal scenario. Let's

432
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:42,399
zone ideally in an ideal scenario. Let's
 

433
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,389
zone ideally in an ideal scenario. Let's
have a quick look at the VIX. All right,

434
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
have a quick look at the VIX. All right,
 

435
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,069
have a quick look at the VIX. All right,
still the same thing we've talked about.

436
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
still the same thing we've talked about.
 

437
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,030
still the same thing we've talked about.
You can see

438
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040
You can see
 

439
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,949
You can see
this is still happening here, folks. All

440
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:50,959
this is still happening here, folks. All
 

441
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,310
this is still happening here, folks. All
right, still can't get through this

442
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
right, still can't get through this
 

443
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,990
right, still can't get through this
pivot, but we are producing higher

444
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,000
pivot, but we are producing higher
 

445
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,710
pivot, but we are producing higher
highs, higher lows in this pivot. It

446
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
highs, higher lows in this pivot. It
 

447
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,910
highs, higher lows in this pivot. It
must get through here to find

448
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:57,920
must get through here to find
 

449
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,910
must get through here to find
acceptance. Otherwise, this can be a

450
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
acceptance. Otherwise, this can be a
 

451
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,230
acceptance. Otherwise, this can be a
huge build out of liquidity

452
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
huge build out of liquidity
 

453
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,910
huge build out of liquidity
for a flush moment if the market does

454
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
for a flush moment if the market does
 

455
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,710
for a flush moment if the market does
want to break higher. And

456
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
want to break higher. And
 

457
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,150
want to break higher. And
let's have a look at the MAC. How we

458
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
let's have a look at the MAC. How we
 

459
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,269
let's have a look at the MAC. How we
doing for time? Yeah, we got to get

460
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279
doing for time? Yeah, we got to get
 

461
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,870
doing for time? Yeah, we got to get
through this.

above the 190s to really go. So any
 

511
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,870
above the 190s to really go. So any
pullback on Nvidia which holds I'd say

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
pullback on Nvidia which holds I'd say
 

513
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,430
pullback on Nvidia which holds I'd say
88. Yeah. Anywhere around the 88s, if

514
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,440
88. Yeah. Anywhere around the 88s, if
 

515
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,990
88. Yeah. Anywhere around the 88s, if
it's able to hold that drive up to 190

598
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639

 

599
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,550

All right. No need to get aggressive.

600
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:14,560

Very, very simple. We either hold the

602
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:16,399
Very, very simple. We either hold the
 

603
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,350
Very, very simple. We either hold the
sort of 80ish kind of level this morning

604
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,360
sort of 80ish kind of level this morning
 

605
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,470
sort of 80ish kind of level this morning
and rotate back up towards these. All

606
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,480
and rotate back up towards these. All
 

607
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,590
and rotate back up towards these. All
right. So, we're either going to hold

608
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,600
right. So, we're either going to hold
 

609
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,629
right. So, we're either going to hold
this this morning.

610
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:26,639
this this morning.
 

611
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,069
this this morning.
Come on, brush. We're either going to

612
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:28,079
Come on, brush. We're either going to
 

613
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,590
Come on, brush. We're either going to
hold this around here for this move here

614
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
hold this around here for this move here
 

615
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,189
hold this around here for this move here
or we're going to come back down in here

616
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
or we're going to come back down in here
 

617
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,790
or we're going to come back down in here
and see if they hold this. So maybe

618
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:34,800
and see if they hold this. So maybe
 

619
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,389
and see if they hold this. So maybe
there's a flush opportunity down to here

620
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:36,399
there's a flush opportunity down to here
 

621
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,910
there's a flush opportunity down to here
and see if they hold that. If they fail

622
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
and see if they hold that. If they fail
 

623
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,590
and see if they hold that. If they fail
to hold all of those and bears will take

624
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,600
to hold all of those and bears will take
 

625
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,590
to hold all of those and bears will take
control of this market, right?

626
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
control of this market, right?
 

627
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,389
control of this market, right?

Here's the acceleration. All right, I'm
 

799
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,710
Here's the acceleration. All right, I'm
getting interested in this now. What we

800
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
getting interested in this now. What we
 

801
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,230
getting interested in this now. What we
going to do at previous day value area

going to do at previous day value area
 

803
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,390
going to do at previous day value area
low? This is what becomes key. What are

we going to do up here? They're going to
 

807
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,029
we going to do up here? They're going to
resell it or we going to find acceptance

resell it or we going to find acceptance
 

809
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,190
resell it or we going to find acceptance
back inside? Are we reselling this or we

So, a little bit of a mixed bag going on

834
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960
So, a little bit of a mixed bag going on
 

835
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,950
So, a little bit of a mixed bag going on
here. If they fail this, like we talked

836
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:26,960
here. If they fail this, like we talked
 

837
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,110
here. If they fail this, like we talked
about, if they sell this, it is possible

838
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,120
about, if they sell this, it is possible
 

839
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,630
about, if they sell this, it is possible
to come all the way back down to

840
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:30,640
to come all the way back down to
 

841
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,470
to come all the way back down to

Sure, these line up there. 36 40s there

844
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:38,159
Sure, these line up there. 36 40s there
 

845
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:54,630
Sure, these line up there. 36 40s there
or thereabouts.

846
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:54,640

 

847
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,549

Most of the magnell red outside of Tesla

848
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:00,559

 

849
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,909

feels like they want to come down into

850
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:01,919
feels like they want to come down into
 

851
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,669
feels like they want to come down into
this. So, I'm trying to be patient. Like

852
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:03,679
this. So, I'm trying to be patient. Like
 

853
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,830
this. So, I'm trying to be patient. Like
the opportunities really are are we

854
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
the opportunities really are are we
 

855
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,750
the opportunities really are are we
going to come down into this and bid off

856
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:07,760
going to come down into this and bid off
 

857
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,470
going to come down into this and bid off
or lose it, right? So, probably need to

858
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:10,480
or lose it, right? So, probably need to
 

859
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,830
or lose it, right? So, probably need to
be patient for this. I think they had a

860
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:11,840
be patient for this. I think they had a
 

861
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,510
be patient for this. I think they had a
chance here to rebid over and they

862
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:13,520
chance here to rebid over and they
 

863
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,510
chance here to rebid over and they
failed. So, shorts took control here.

864
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:15,520
failed. So, shorts took control here.
 

865
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,870
failed. So, shorts took control here.
probably want to complete a rotation

866
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:16,880
probably want to complete a rotation
 

867
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,430
probably want to complete a rotation
into this and then uh we can sort of see

868
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,440
into this and then uh we can sort of see
 

869
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,710
into this and then uh we can sort of see
what's what once we get down into there

870
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:22,720
what's what once we get down into there
 

871
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,510
what's what once we get down into there
and reassess what's what

872
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:29,520

 

873
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,070

50s what we looking at 40s and 30s I

874
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,080
50s what we looking at 40s and 30s I
 

875
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:38,789
50s what we looking at 40s and 30s I
think kind of area

876
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:38,799

 

877
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,110

883
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,950

Feels like they should just complete

884
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:56,960
Feels like they should just complete
 

885
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,750
Feels like they should just complete
this rotation down now.

886
00:22:59,750 --> 00:22:59,760
this rotation down now.
 

887
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:13,029
this rotation down now.
Just being patient here.

888
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:13,039

 

889
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,549

Yes, it's coming down. It's that same

890
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:14,559
Yes, it's coming down. It's that same
 

891
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,390
Yes, it's coming down. It's that same
level that globe XM what we talked about

00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:16,400
level that globe XM what we talked about
 

893
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,390

previous day low on a spiders all sort

894

previous day low on a spiders all sort
 

895
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,669
previous day low on a spiders all sort
of around this level.

So from here to sort of 30s

898
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:24,480
So from here to sort of 30s
 

899
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,789
So from here to sort of 30s
down into here ideally

900
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:26,799
down into here ideally
 

901
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,590
down into here ideally
and see if they auction off this and if

902
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:29,600
and see if they auction off this and if
 

903
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,789
and see if they auction off this and if
not if they lose this then we come down

904
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:32,799
not if they lose this then we come down
 

905
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,789
not if they lose this then we come down
into this.

906
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:34,799
into this.
 

907
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,070
into this.
They're finding a little bit of a bid

908
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080
They're finding a little bit of a bid
 

909
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,909
They're finding a little bit of a bid
early here in front of it all. It's a

910
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:37,919
early here in front of it all. It's a
 

911
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,590
early here in front of it all. It's a
bit front running by the looks of it.

912
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:41,600
bit front running by the looks of it.
 

913
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,310
bit front running by the looks of it.
If they accelerate through here there's

914
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,320
If they accelerate through here there's
 

915
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,390
If they accelerate through here there's
not much until we get up to 700. There's

916
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:46,400
not much until we get up to 700. There's
 

917
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,789
not much until we get up to 700. There's
a VPO here from the current day at 75

918
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:48,799
a VPO here from the current day at 75
 

919
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,590
a VPO here from the current day at 75
which we just came into. And if they get

920
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:51,600
which we just came into. And if they get
 

921
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,909
which we just came into. And if they get
through that then uh it's possible.

922
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:53,919
through that then uh it's possible.
 

923
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,909
through that then uh it's possible.
Sorry. Croaky throat. We go up to 700

924
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:55,919
Sorry. Croaky throat. We go up to 700
 

925
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,830
Sorry. Croaky throat. We go up to 700
which is

926
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:57,840
which is
 

927
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,669
which is
not ideal the way they've set it up.

928
00:23:59,669 --> 00:23:59,679
not ideal the way they've set it up.
 

929
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,029
not ideal the way they've set it up.
I'll be honest with you. They're front

930
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:01,039
I'll be honest with you. They're front
 

931
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,029
I'll be honest with you. They're front
running at all. We need it to come a

932
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:03,039
running at all. We need it to come a
 

933
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,430
running at all. We need it to come a
little bit lower first on on absolutely

934
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,440
little bit lower first on on absolutely
 

935
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,750
little bit lower first on on absolutely
everywhere that I'm looking right now.

936
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760

 

937
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,669

Control on the session right here. Get

938
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679
Control on the session right here. Get
 

939
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,149
Control on the session right here. Get
some volume on early. That is annoying

940
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:14,159
some volume on early. That is annoying
 

941
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,590
some volume on early. That is annoying
that they've come into no man's land

942
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:15,600
that they've come into no man's land
 

943
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,070
that they've come into no man's land
there. But there we go.

944
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,080
there. But there we go.
 

945
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,029
there. But there we go.
Thin volume. We kind of expect nonsense.

946
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:21,039
Thin volume. We kind of expect nonsense.
 

947
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,070
Thin volume. We kind of expect nonsense.
There we go.

948
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:24,080
There we go.
 

949
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,990
There we go.
This is also slightly incorrect by the

950
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,000
This is also slightly incorrect by the
 

951
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,870
This is also slightly incorrect by the
looks of it. Okay, back up to like I

952
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:28,880
looks of it. Okay, back up to like I
 

953
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,710
looks of it. Okay, back up to like I
said, we can come all the way up to 700s

954
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:30,720
said, we can come all the way up to 700s
 

955
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,630
said, we can come all the way up to 700s
if it wants. This is value area high on

956
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
if it wants. This is value area high on
 

957
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,310
if it wants. This is value area high on
the session here is 80s. We're starting

958
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:34,320
the session here is 80s. We're starting
 

959
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,990
the session here is 80s. We're starting
to find a little bit the bid here. The

960
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,000
to find a little bit the bid here. The
 

961
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,470
to find a little bit the bid here. The
bid is a little bit early in my opinion.

962
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:38,480
bid is a little bit early in my opinion.
 

963
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,950
bid is a little bit early in my opinion.
It's a bit early in front of this. All

964
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:40,960
It's a bit early in front of this. All
 

965
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,750
It's a bit early in front of this. All
right. So, I want to wait for this or

966
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:43,760
right. So, I want to wait for this or
 

967
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,909
right. So, I want to wait for this or
acceptance above this. I don't want to

968
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:45,919
acceptance above this. I don't want to
 

969
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,230
acceptance above this. I don't want to
get caught in between the two. Not much

970
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,240
get caught in between the two. Not much
 

971
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,750
get caught in between the two. Not much
to do if you get caught in between the

972
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:49,760
to do if you get caught in between the
 

973
00:24:49,760 --> 00:25:04,630
to do if you get caught in between the
two.

974
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:04,640

 

975
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,430

How do I have conviction whether the

976
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:07,440
How do I have conviction whether the
 

977
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,830
How do I have conviction whether the
market will stay in a value area on

978
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:09,840
market will stay in a value area on
 

979
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,149
market will stay in a value area on
certain days at open or will trade out

980
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:12,159
certain days at open or will trade out
 

981
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,789
certain days at open or will trade out
of it like you mentioned yesterday? Um,

982
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:14,799
of it like you mentioned yesterday? Um,
 

983
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,390
of it like you mentioned yesterday? Um,
it's really based on where that volume

984
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:16,400
it's really based on where that volume
 

985
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,870
it's really based on where that volume
is and where we're opening up. Are we

986
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:18,880
is and where we're opening up. Are we
 

987
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,110
is and where we're opening up. Are we
opening up in value, out of value? How

988
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,120
opening up in value, out of value? How
 

989
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,269
opening up in value, out of value? How
are we shaping up? Who's trapped during

990
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:23,279
are we shaping up? Who's trapped during
 

991
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,950
are we shaping up? Who's trapped during
that session? How do we create volume

992
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
that session? How do we create volume
 

993
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,310
that session? How do we create volume
during that session? All right, here we

994
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,320
during that session? All right, here we
 

995
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,230
during that session? All right, here we
come back down into these key levels.

996
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:28,240
come back down into these key levels.
 

997
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,750
come back down into these key levels.
Previous week below. So, the question

998
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:29,760
Previous week below. So, the question
 

999
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,909
Previous week below. So, the question
now is, do we find a bid here? It's the

1000
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:31,919
now is, do we find a bid here? It's the
 

1001
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,350
now is, do we find a bid here? It's the
big question now. Do we find a bid here?

1002
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
big question now. Do we find a bid here?
 

1003
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,870
big question now. Do we find a bid here?
If we don't find a bid here, we will

1004
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:34,880
If we don't find a bid here, we will
 

1005
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,310
If we don't find a bid here, we will
come all the way back down for these

1006
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
come all the way back down for these
 

1007
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,549
come all the way back down for these
lows. Okay, so they need to find a bid

1008
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:38,559
lows. Okay, so they need to find a bid
 

1009
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,430
lows. Okay, so they need to find a bid
here. the bulls if they have uh a chance

1010
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:41,440
here. the bulls if they have uh a chance
 

1011
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,070
here. the bulls if they have uh a chance
in holding us up today for that drive

1012
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,080
in holding us up today for that drive
 

1013
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,590
in holding us up today for that drive
and acceptance back into here at the

1014
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:45,600
and acceptance back into here at the
 

1015
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,510
and acceptance back into here at the
moment. And you would say bears are in

1016
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:47,520
moment. And you would say bears are in
 

1017
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,510
moment. And you would say bears are in
control because we've rejected the old

1018
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:49,520
control because we've rejected the old
 

1019
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,710
control because we've rejected the old
point of control up here.

1020
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:52,720
point of control up here.
 

1021
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,070
point of control up here.
We've rejected previous day value.

1022
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,080
We've rejected previous day value.
 

1023
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,549
We've rejected previous day value.
We've traded under previous week value.

1024
00:25:58,549 --> 00:25:58,559
We've traded under previous week value.
 

1025
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,470
We've traded under previous week value.
All right. And if we don't do one of

1026
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:00,480
All right. And if we don't do one of
 

1027
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,230
All right. And if we don't do one of
these, then bears will look to complete

1028
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:02,240
these, then bears will look to complete
 

1029
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,149
these, then bears will look to complete
the rotation all the way down. And you

1030
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:04,159
the rotation all the way down. And you
 

1031
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,590
the rotation all the way down. And you
can't rule out this move down here

1032
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:05,600
can't rule out this move down here
 

1033
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,630
can't rule out this move down here
really. But let's just see.

1034
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:08,640
really. But let's just see.
 

1035
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,149
really. But let's just see.
Still very early in the day.

1036
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:14,159

 

1037
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,149

It's good job from bears so far. Very

1038
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159
It's good job from bears so far. Very
 

1039
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:22,870
It's good job from bears so far. Very
good job from bears.

1040
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:22,880

 

1041
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,950

Having a good spike here as well. So

1042
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:24,960
Having a good spike here as well. So
 

1043
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,470
Having a good spike here as well. So
there is some alignment. Just going to

1044
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:26,480
there is some alignment. Just going to
 

1045
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,630
there is some alignment. Just going to
let this just settle down though. Very

1046
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:28,640
let this just settle down though. Very
 

1047
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:36,310
let this just settle down though. Very
very very low volume.

1048
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:36,320

 

1049
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,070

Guessing no Santa rally. I mean, we did

1050
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,080
Guessing no Santa rally. I mean, we did
 

1051
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,149
Guessing no Santa rally. I mean, we did
hit alltime highs on the spiders a

1052
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:40,159
hit alltime highs on the spiders a
 

1053
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,630
hit alltime highs on the spiders a
couple days ago. I don't understand when

1054
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:42,640
couple days ago. I don't understand when
 

1055
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,549
couple days ago. I don't understand when
uh it's past Christmas, you've hit

1056
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:44,559
uh it's past Christmas, you've hit
 

1057
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,029
uh it's past Christmas, you've hit
alltime highs. It's not like we're

1058
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:47,039
alltime highs. It's not like we're
 

1059
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,310
alltime highs. It's not like we're
trading at lows, is it? We're trading in

1060
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,320
trading at lows, is it? We're trading in
 

1061
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,789
trading at lows, is it? We're trading in
on the cues at a midpoint of a range and

1062
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
on the cues at a midpoint of a range and
 

1063
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,390
on the cues at a midpoint of a range and
the breadth has been actually a little

1064
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:54,400
the breadth has been actually a little
 

1065
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,870
the breadth has been actually a little
bit better if we want to be unbiased um

1066
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:56,880
bit better if we want to be unbiased um
 

1067
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,310
bit better if we want to be unbiased um
outside of tech.

1068
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,320
outside of tech.
 

1069
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,990
outside of tech.
I wouldn't be too um

1070
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,000
I wouldn't be too um
 

1071
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,669
I wouldn't be too um
I wouldn't come down on the market too

1072
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:05,679
I wouldn't come down on the market too
 

1073
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,789
I wouldn't come down on the market too
hard. just like try and put it that way.

1074
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:08,799
hard. just like try and put it that way.
 

1075
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,990
hard. just like try and put it that way.
Right, they're finding a bit of a beard

1076
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,000
Right, they're finding a bit of a beard
 

1077
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,990
Right, they're finding a bit of a beard
in front of previous week low here. We

1078
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000
in front of previous week low here. We
 

1079
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,590
in front of previous week low here. We
had lots of short selling coming in here

1080
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,600
had lots of short selling coming in here
 

1081
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,950
had lots of short selling coming in here
at 24 and 3435.

1082
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:16,960
at 24 and 3435.
 

1083
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,669
at 24 and 3435.
So VWAP and value area low and previous

1084
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:19,679
So VWAP and value area low and previous
 

1085
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,590
So VWAP and value area low and previous
week value area low still probably the

1086
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:21,600
week value area low still probably the
 

1087
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,510
week value area low still probably the
triggers to see if they get relief up or

1088
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:23,520
triggers to see if they get relief up or
 

1089
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,549
triggers to see if they get relief up or
if they resell it. So this kind of area

1090
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:26,559
if they resell it. So this kind of area
 

1091
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,430
if they resell it. So this kind of area
now that we're in, do they start to

1092
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,440
now that we're in, do they start to
 

1093
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,110
now that we're in, do they start to
drive through and up or are they going

1094
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,120
drive through and up or are they going
 

1095
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,269
drive through and up or are they going
to resell this VWAP resell value area

1096
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
to resell this VWAP resell value area
 

1097
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,149
to resell this VWAP resell value area
low? These are the sort of 35s I just

1098
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:36,159
low? These are the sort of 35s I just
 

1099
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,590
low? These are the sort of 35s I just
talked about where sellers came in with

1100
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:37,600
talked about where sellers came in with
 

1101
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,350
talked about where sellers came in with
strength.

1102
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,360
strength.
 

1103
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,950
strength.
Or are we going to do this sort of look

1104
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:40,960
Or are we going to do this sort of look
 

1105
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,350
Or are we going to do this sort of look
below previous week and start to find a

1106
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:43,360
below previous week and start to find a
 

1107
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,190
below previous week and start to find a
bid, which is what they're attempting to

1108
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,200
bid, which is what they're attempting to
 

1109
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,870
bid, which is what they're attempting to
do at the moment? Not convinced yet, but

1110
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:48,880
do at the moment? Not convinced yet, but
 

1111
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,390
do at the moment? Not convinced yet, but
h let's see. We just tapped right back

1112
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:52,400
h let's see. We just tapped right back
 

1113
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,149
h let's see. We just tapped right back
into this same level as previous week

1114
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:54,159
into this same level as previous week
 

1115
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,230
into this same level as previous week
value low.

1116
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:58,240

 

1117
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,630

It's very thin on the book. I'm looking

1118
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
It's very thin on the book. I'm looking
 

1119
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,909
It's very thin on the book. I'm looking
at like sizes of sixes and fives on the

1120
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:03,919
at like sizes of sixes and fives on the
 

1121
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,549
at like sizes of sixes and fives on the
book right now.

1122
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:06,559
book right now.
 

1123
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,950
book right now.
Would not take much to move this market.

1124
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:08,960
Would not take much to move this market.
 

1125
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,669
Would not take much to move this market.
The big player comes in or move quick

1126
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:11,679
The big player comes in or move quick
 

1127
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,310
The big player comes in or move quick
either direction. So, I want to be uh

1128
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:14,320
either direction. So, I want to be uh
 

1129
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:22,789
either direction. So, I want to be uh
positioned the wrong side of this.

1130
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:22,799

 

1131
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,269

Definitely left some sellers under 25 so

1132
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:25,279
Definitely left some sellers under 25 so
 

1133
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,549
Definitely left some sellers under 25 so
far.

1134
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:28,559

 

1135
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,230

Still early. They're starting to retest

1136
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,240
Still early. They're starting to retest
 

1137
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,870
Still early. They're starting to retest
this player at 25 and see it on the

1138
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:32,880
this player at 25 and see it on the
 

1139
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,710
this player at 25 and see it on the
order book. They sort of started coming

1140
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:34,720
order book. They sort of started coming
 

1141
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,950
order book. They sort of started coming
in at 35, 30, 25, 23s, 20s, and then

1142
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:40,960
in at 35, 30, 25, 23s, 20s, and then
 

1143
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,549
in at 35, 30, 25, 23s, 20s, and then
14s. So, it just depends if they let

1144
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:42,559
14s. So, it just depends if they let
 

1145
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,950
14s. So, it just depends if they let
these sellers out or not. They're trying

1146
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:44,960
these sellers out or not. They're trying
 

1147
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,389
these sellers out or not. They're trying
to get back down to let them out at the

1148
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:46,399
to get back down to let them out at the
 

1149
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,310
to get back down to let them out at the
moment. Point control now flipped lower.

1150
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,320
moment. Point control now flipped lower.
 

1151
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,230
moment. Point control now flipped lower.
They're letting them out now. We're

1152
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:50,240
They're letting them out now. We're
 

1153
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,630
They're letting them out now. We're
starting to drive lower. And if we get

1154
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:52,640
starting to drive lower. And if we get
 

1155
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,549
starting to drive lower. And if we get
acceptance under here for this previous

1156
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:54,559
acceptance under here for this previous
 

1157
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,149
acceptance under here for this previous
week low, there is a deeper drive into

1158
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:56,159
week low, there is a deeper drive into
 

1159
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,549
week low, there is a deeper drive into
GlobeEx available. So right now bears

1160
00:28:58,549 --> 00:28:58,559
GlobeEx available. So right now bears
 

1161
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,110
GlobeEx available. So right now bears
are defending right this area here. We

1162
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,120
are defending right this area here. We
 

1163
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,549
are defending right this area here. We
talked about if they defend this we can

1164
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:02,559
talked about if they defend this we can
 

1165
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,710
talked about if they defend this we can
come down into this. If we get this move

1166
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:04,720
come down into this. If we get this move
 

1167
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,310
come down into this. If we get this move
here this will probably offer a squeeze

1168
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:06,320
here this will probably offer a squeeze
 

1169
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,110
here this will probably offer a squeeze
up because we have low volume here. So

1170
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,120
up because we have low volume here. So
 

1171
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,190
up because we have low volume here. So
still just waiting here. Not really too

1172
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,200
still just waiting here. Not really too
 

1173
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,789
still just waiting here. Not really too
interested at the moment. Nothing

1174
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:12,799
interested at the moment. Nothing
 

1175
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,350
interested at the moment. Nothing
perking my interest yet.

1176
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,360
perking my interest yet.
 

1177
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,750
perking my interest yet.
If we reclaim I'll be interested. If uh

1178
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:17,760
If we reclaim I'll be interested. If uh
 

1179
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,789
If we reclaim I'll be interested. If uh
we flush really deep and I see it being

1180
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:20,799
we flush really deep and I see it being
 

1181
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,510
we flush really deep and I see it being
more aggressive I'm interested as well.

1182
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:25,520
more aggressive I'm interested as well.
 

1183
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,990
more aggressive I'm interested as well.
Mag has starting to bleed a little bit

1184
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,000
Mag has starting to bleed a little bit
 

1185
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,269
Mag has starting to bleed a little bit
more. I'll be honest with you. Tesla

1186
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:29,279
more. I'll be honest with you. Tesla
 

1187
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,750
more. I'll be honest with you. Tesla

only one that's clinging on there really

1196
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:45,840
only one that's clinging on there really
 

1197
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,590
only one that's clinging on there really
is Nvidia. The rest of the market

1198
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:47,600
is Nvidia. The rest of the market
 

1199
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,590
is Nvidia. The rest of the market
doesn't look particularly good. But we

1200
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:49,600
doesn't look particularly good. But we
 

1201
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,909
doesn't look particularly good. But we
are into a level of interest. This is

1202
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:51,919
are into a level of interest. This is
 

1203
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,070
are into a level of interest. This is
previous week low down here. This is

1204
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,080
previous week low down here. This is
 

1205
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,950
previous week low down here. This is
previous week value area low down here.

1206
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:56,960
previous week value area low down here.
 

1207
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,669
previous week value area low down here.
Very simple. We either reclaim this and

1208
00:29:59,669 --> 00:29:59,679
Very simple. We either reclaim this and
 

1209
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,029
Very simple. We either reclaim this and
start squeezing or they're going to

1210
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:01,039
start squeezing or they're going to
 

1211
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,190
start squeezing or they're going to
flush versus this and come down to these

1212
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,200
flush versus this and come down to these
 

1213
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,990
flush versus this and come down to these
sort of GlobeEx lows.

1214
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,000
sort of GlobeEx lows.
 

1215
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,310
sort of GlobeEx lows.
And we do have that old naked point of

1216
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,320
And we do have that old naked point of
 

1217
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,230
And we do have that old naked point of
control. I've got to remember where that

1218
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,240
control. I've got to remember where that
 

1219
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,950
control. I've got to remember where that
is on a weekly. Where is him? Where is

1220
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:12,960
is on a weekly. Where is him? Where is
 

1221
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,710
is on a weekly. Where is him? Where is
he?

1222
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:14,720
he?
 

1223
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,630
he?
So next ups would be 520s and 330s. So

1224
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:18,640
So next ups would be 520s and 330s. So
 

1225
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,870
So next ups would be 520s and 330s. So
we need to remember those 520s and 330s

1226
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:20,880
we need to remember those 520s and 330s
 

1227
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,870
we need to remember those 520s and 330s
if they remain heavy. Big big if. We're

1228
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:22,880
if they remain heavy. Big big if. We're
 

1229
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,710
if they remain heavy. Big big if. We're
building out nice volume here right now,

1230
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:24,720
building out nice volume here right now,
 

1231
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,470
building out nice volume here right now,
which can be used as a shelf either

1232
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:26,480
which can be used as a shelf either
 

1233
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:42,870
which can be used as a shelf either
side.

1234
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:42,880

 

1235
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,470

Pretty slow, isn't it?

1236
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:46,480
Pretty slow, isn't it?
 

1237
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,710
Pretty slow, isn't it?
Pretty slow for a morning open. We've

1238
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:48,720
Pretty slow for a morning open. We've
 

1239
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,950
Pretty slow for a morning open. We've
we've gone stuck in a 10point range for

1240
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:50,960
we've gone stuck in a 10point range for
 

1241
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,269
we've gone stuck in a 10point range for
the last one, two, three, four, five,

1242
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:53,279
the last one, two, three, four, five,
 

1243
00:30:53,279 --> 00:31:13,430
the last one, two, three, four, five,
six minutes. Wonder what we expected.

1244
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:13,440

 

1245
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,110

I want to say these bears look a little

1246
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,120
I want to say these bears look a little
 

1247
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,350
I want to say these bears look a little
bit stuck, but balls are not coming in

1248
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:17,360
bit stuck, but balls are not coming in
 

1249
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,350
bit stuck, but balls are not coming in
and squeezing and the volume is just

1250
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,360
and squeezing and the volume is just
 

1251
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,909
and squeezing and the volume is just
non-existent. It's just absolutely

1252
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:21,919
non-existent. It's just absolutely
 

1253
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,909
non-existent. It's just absolutely
non-existent. So, I don't really want to

1254
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:23,919
non-existent. So, I don't really want to
 

1255
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,669
non-existent. So, I don't really want to
think about

1256
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:25,679
think about
 

1257
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,750
think about
trap right now off no volume.

1258
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:31,760

 

1259
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,430

And what size was that? That just got

1260
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:33,440
And what size was that? That just got
 

1261
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:50,389
And what size was that? That just got
absorbed. 47 lot. Oh, so small. So,

1262
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:50,399

 

1263
00:31:50,399 --> 00:32:02,549

CVD is still heavy.

1264
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:02,559

 

1265
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,230

They're trying to resell this. Here we

1266
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,240
They're trying to resell this. Here we
 

1267
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,389
They're trying to resell this. Here we
go.

1268
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:06,399
go.
 

1269
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,070
go.
There is some absorption taking place

1270
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,080
There is some absorption taking place
 

1271
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,549
There is some absorption taking place
here. I just don't trust it's so thin on

1272
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:10,559
here. I just don't trust it's so thin on
 

1273
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,950
here. I just don't trust it's so thin on
volume. It's unreal. There definitely

1274
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:12,960
volume. It's unreal. There definitely
 

1275
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,870
volume. It's unreal. There definitely
some absorption here into 17s. I think

1276
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:14,880
some absorption here into 17s. I think
 

1277
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,549
some absorption here into 17s. I think
they should probably flush all these lot

1278
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:16,559
they should probably flush all these lot
 

1279
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,110
they should probably flush all these lot
out. They've been here so long. PS

1280
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,120
out. They've been here so long. PS
 

1281
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,710
out. They've been here so long. PS
making a new low. I think INQ is going

1282
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:20,720
making a new low. I think INQ is going
 

1283
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:35,269
making a new low. I think INQ is going
to join it.

1284
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:35,279

 

1285
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,350

Might have literally gone to sleep here.

1286
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:37,360
Might have literally gone to sleep here.
 

1287
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:48,070
Might have literally gone to sleep here.
Market is absolutely asleep.

1288
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,080

 

1289
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,990

You understand? And we're 15 minutes in

1290
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,000
You understand? And we're 15 minutes in
 

1291
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,990
You understand? And we're 15 minutes in
and we're struggling to move 10 points.

1292
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,000
and we're struggling to move 10 points.
 

1293
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,190
and we're struggling to move 10 points.
This is uh

1294
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,200
This is uh
 

1295
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,149
This is uh
wild in not a good way. Wild in a very

1296
00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:00,159
wild in not a good way. Wild in a very
 

1297
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,190
wild in not a good way. Wild in a very
slow day.

1298
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,200
slow day.
 

1299
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,990
slow day.
All right, new lows. ES.

1300
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000

 

1301
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,750

We still haven't taken out that previous

1302
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:09,760
We still haven't taken out that previous
 

1303
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:17,990
We still haven't taken out that previous
week low. This green line right here.

1304
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,000

 

1305
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,350

building up lots of volume here. It's

1306
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:19,360
building up lots of volume here. It's
 

1307
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,630
building up lots of volume here. It's
possible they drift all the way down

1308
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:20,640
possible they drift all the way down
 

1309
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,230
possible they drift all the way down
into here and take all this out if they

1310
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,240
into here and take all this out if they
 

1311
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,230
into here and take all this out if they
really want to

1312
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,240
really want to
 

1313
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,750
really want to
that node there into 570s and then uh

1314
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:27,760
that node there into 570s and then uh
 

1315
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,990
that node there into 570s and then uh
old value 525. But I uh I'm really

1316
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,000
old value 525. But I uh I'm really
 

1317
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,830
old value 525. But I uh I'm really
uninterested in how this is moving right

1318
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:33,840
uninterested in how this is moving right
 

1319
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,990
uninterested in how this is moving right
now. This is uh to see this in the

1320
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,000
now. This is uh to see this in the
 

1321
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,269
now. This is uh to see this in the
opening 15 minutes

1322
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:41,279
opening 15 minutes
 

1323
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:45,590
opening 15 minutes
to see 20 points like that. O I don't

1324
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:45,600
to see 20 points like that. O I don't
 

1325
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,230
to see 20 points like that. O I don't
know mate.

1326
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,240
know mate.
 

1327
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,549
know mate.
It's not filling me with the confidence

1328
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:50,559
It's not filling me with the confidence
 

1329
00:33:50,559 --> 00:34:01,190
It's not filling me with the confidence
to do anything today. Tell you that much

1330
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:01,200

 

1331
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,789

there. Finally breaking lower. Well

1332
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:02,799
there. Finally breaking lower. Well
 

1333
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,350
there. Finally breaking lower. Well
done, Bears. That took you uh about 10

1334
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:05,360
done, Bears. That took you uh about 10
 

1335
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,909
done, Bears. That took you uh about 10
minutes to do a very obvious simple

1336
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:07,919
minutes to do a very obvious simple
 

1337
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,510
minutes to do a very obvious simple
move. Jeez Louise.

1338
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,520
move. Jeez Louise.
 

1339
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,430
move. Jeez Louise.
Okay, so flushing coming now. Finally,

1340
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:13,440
Okay, so flushing coming now. Finally,
 

1341
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,950
Okay, so flushing coming now. Finally,
they've using this volume for the

1342
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:14,960
they've using this volume for the
 

1343
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,790
they've using this volume for the
breakaway. This is the next level. This

1344
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:16,800
breakaway. This is the next level. This
 

1345
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,710
breakaway. This is the next level. This
blue box and that's GloEx low from

1346
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:18,720
blue box and that's GloEx low from
 

1347
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,389
blue box and that's GloEx low from
overnight. We get through there. There's

1348
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:20,399
overnight. We get through there. There's
 

1349
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,470
overnight. We get through there. There's
an old fact I'm going to put these on

1350
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:22,480
an old fact I'm going to put these on
 

1351
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,430
an old fact I'm going to put these on
the screen so we can remember these. We

1352
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:25,440
the screen so we can remember these. We
 

1353
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,550
the screen so we can remember these. We
have one little one here

1354
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:28,560
have one little one here
 

1355
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,589
have one little one here
and we do a white dotted line for naked

1356
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:31,599
and we do a white dotted line for naked
 

1357
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:40,069
and we do a white dotted line for naked
PC. Maybe we remember it.

1358
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:40,079

 

1359
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,430

Maybe we do as red.

1360
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:43,440
Maybe we do as red.
 

1361
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,389
Maybe we do as red.
Make it P.

1362
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:46,399
Make it P.
 

1363
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,629
Make it P.
There we go. So all the way down that

1364
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:48,639
There we go. So all the way down that
 

1365
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,950
There we go. So all the way down that
print. Yeah. Good.

1366
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:52,960

 

1367
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,109

Okay.

1368
00:34:57,109 --> 00:34:57,119

 

1369
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,670

Drifting lower. All of the mag now red

1370
00:34:59,670 --> 00:34:59,680
Drifting lower. All of the mag now red
 

1371
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,310
Drifting lower. All of the mag now red
other than Nvidia. This is so slow

1372
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:02,320
other than Nvidia. This is so slow
 

1373
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,670
other than Nvidia. This is so slow
though. This is uh really slow.

1374
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:07,680

 

1375
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,630

These breakaways are uh a whopping 10 to

1376
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:10,640
These breakaways are uh a whopping 10 to
 

1377
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,030
These breakaways are uh a whopping 10 to
20 points. I mean it's uh but we are

1378
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,040
20 points. I mean it's uh but we are
 

1379
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,270
20 points. I mean it's uh but we are
starting to leave volume. This is the

1380
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:15,280
starting to leave volume. This is the
 

1381
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,990
starting to leave volume. This is the
next level. All right. This was the uh

1382
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,000
next level. All right. This was the uh
 

1383
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,910
next level. All right. This was the uh
volume created back in 15th of December.

1384
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:21,920
volume created back in 15th of December.
 

1385
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,829
volume created back in 15th of December.
We did uh flush through this overnight

1386
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:23,839
We did uh flush through this overnight
 

1387
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,750
We did uh flush through this overnight
and then refound a bid. So it just

1388
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:25,760
and then refound a bid. So it just
 

1389
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,109
and then refound a bid. So it just
depends. Are they going to hold this

1390
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:27,119
depends. Are they going to hold this
 

1391
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,870
depends. Are they going to hold this
look straight up straight back down? We

1392
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:28,880
look straight up straight back down? We
 

1393
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,589
look straight up straight back down? We
talk about that all the time

1394
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:31,599
talk about that all the time
 

1395
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,710
talk about that all the time
and I'd say bears are in control of this

1396
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:34,720
and I'd say bears are in control of this
 

1397
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,069
and I'd say bears are in control of this
current session all the time. somewhere

1398
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:36,079
current session all the time. somewhere
 

1399
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,950
current session all the time. somewhere
under this right here.

1400
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:40,960

 

1401
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,310

No, don't want to change it.

1402
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:44,320
No, don't want to change it.
 

1403
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,430
No, don't want to change it.
There we go.

1404
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:47,440
There we go.
 

1405
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,829
There we go.
And this is their target. This one and

1406
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:49,839
And this is their target. This one and
 

1407
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,349
And this is their target. This one and
this one. And if they get really weak,

1408
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:51,359
this one. And if they get really weak,
 

1409
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,630
this one. And if they get really weak,
then we can think about all the way down

1410
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:52,640
then we can think about all the way down
 

1411
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,349
then we can think about all the way down
to there. Like I said, this uh this was

1412
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:55,359
to there. Like I said, this uh this was
 

1413
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,030
to there. Like I said, this uh this was
a spoof move. All right. This is uh if

1414
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,040
a spoof move. All right. This is uh if
 

1415
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,109
a spoof move. All right. This is uh if
you believe that newsprint, you're

1416
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:01,119
you believe that newsprint, you're
 

1417
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,630
you believe that newsprint, you're
[\h__\h] not reading any bit of

1418
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:02,640
[\h__\h] not reading any bit of
 

1419
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,190
[\h__\h] not reading any bit of
information ever. Um, absolute bollocks.

1420
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:07,200
information ever. Um, absolute bollocks.
 

1421
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,470
information ever. Um, absolute bollocks.
Can't believe they get away with doing

1422
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:08,480
Can't believe they get away with doing
 

1423
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,950
Can't believe they get away with doing
that. But they do. They do get away with

1424
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:10,960
that. But they do. They do get away with
 

1425
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,230
that. But they do. They do get away with
it.

1426
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:14,240

 

1427
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,990

Readjusting the numbers in a positive

1428
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,000
Readjusting the numbers in a positive
 

1429
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,310
Readjusting the numbers in a positive
favor when we come into a very key level

1430
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:18,320
favor when we come into a very key level
 

1431
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,069
favor when we come into a very key level
of the stock market. Who who' have

1432
00:36:20,069 --> 00:36:20,079
of the stock market. Who who' have
 

1433
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,990
of the stock market. Who who' have
guessed?

1434
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,000
guessed?
 

1435
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,910
guessed?
Am I not trading today? I mean, if I see

1436
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:23,920
Am I not trading today? I mean, if I see
 

1437
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,589
Am I not trading today? I mean, if I see
something I really really want, I will

1438
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:25,599
something I really really want, I will
 

1439
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,790
something I really really want, I will
trade. But we're very you got to

1440
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:26,800
trade. But we're very you got to
 

1441
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,790
trade. But we're very you got to
understand, we're very low on volume

1442
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:28,800
understand, we're very low on volume
 

1443
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,870
understand, we're very low on volume
right now.

1444
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:30,880
right now.
 

1445
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,710
right now.
So, uh, I would have to see something

1446
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:32,720
So, uh, I would have to see something
 

1447
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,310
So, uh, I would have to see something
that's really screaming out to me to,

1448
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:36,320
that's really screaming out to me to,
 

1449
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:43,190
that's really screaming out to me to,
uh, take a trade.

1450
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,200

 

1451
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,870

Unfortunately, the way they've set up,

1452
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:44,880
Unfortunately, the way they've set up,
 

1453
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,430
Unfortunately, the way they've set up,
like this rebid this morning was really

1454
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:47,440
like this rebid this morning was really
 

1455
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,670
like this rebid this morning was really
good.

1456
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:49,680
good.
 

1457
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,589
good.
You could argue there was a short here

1458
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:51,599
You could argue there was a short here
 

1459
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,349
You could argue there was a short here
off the morning drive, but watching like

1460
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:53,359
off the morning drive, but watching like
 

1461
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,790
off the morning drive, but watching like
such low volume.

1462
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:56,800
such low volume.
 

1463
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,910
such low volume.
Could have, would have, should have.

1464
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:57,920
Could have, would have, should have.
 

1465
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,790
Could have, would have, should have.
Maybe there was a an opportunity up

1466
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:00,800
Maybe there was a an opportunity up
 

1467
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,870
Maybe there was a an opportunity up
there for the short. I'm more interested

1468
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:02,880
there for the short. I'm more interested
 

1469
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,390
there for the short. I'm more interested
as we're starting to build out levels

1470
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:04,400
as we're starting to build out levels
 

1471
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,990
as we're starting to build out levels
now of like how we act.

1472
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,000

 

1473
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,630

You know, if we uh reclaim value and

1474
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:12,640
You know, if we uh reclaim value and
 

1475
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,230
You know, if we uh reclaim value and
start very simple, if bulls reclaim this

1476
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:16,240
start very simple, if bulls reclaim this
 

1477
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,230
start very simple, if bulls reclaim this
and this, we go straight back upside.

1478
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:18,240
and this, we go straight back upside.
 

1479
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,150
and this, we go straight back upside.
So, I'm open to that. If bears defend

1480
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,160
So, I'm open to that. If bears defend
 

1481
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,470
So, I'm open to that. If bears defend
this and I think we have auction left to

1482
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:22,480
this and I think we have auction left to
 

1483
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,589
this and I think we have auction left to
finish, I'm open to that. You're

1484
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:23,599
finish, I'm open to that. You're
 

1485
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,430
finish, I'm open to that. You're
starting to see aggressive bulls come in

1486
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:25,440
starting to see aggressive bulls come in
 

1487
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,190
starting to see aggressive bulls come in
in front of this level. for his previous

1488
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:27,200
in front of this level. for his previous
 

1489
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,910
in front of this level. for his previous
week. So, this is perking my interest.

1490
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:29,920
week. So, this is perking my interest.
 

1491
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,390
week. So, this is perking my interest.
Back to previous week low.

1492
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:32,400
Back to previous week low.
 

1493
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,310
Back to previous week low.
Do they sustain a bid through here or

1494
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:34,320
Do they sustain a bid through here or
 

1495
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,829
Do they sustain a bid through here or
does this just have the door shut on

1496
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:35,839
does this just have the door shut on
 

1497
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,310
does this just have the door shut on
their face and do we actually want to

1498
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:38,320
their face and do we actually want to
 

1499
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,150
their face and do we actually want to
trade lower? There's still low hanging

1500
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:40,160
trade lower? There's still low hanging
 

1501
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,750
trade lower? There's still low hanging
fruit lower right now. I will say that

1502
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:41,760
fruit lower right now. I will say that
 

1503
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,510
fruit lower right now. I will say that
much.

1504
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:43,520
much.
 

1505
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,270
much.
There is still low hanging fruit lower

1506
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,280
There is still low hanging fruit lower
 

1507
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,150
There is still low hanging fruit lower
right now. There's still this blue box

1508
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:48,160
right now. There's still this blue box
 

1509
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,069
right now. There's still this blue box
and Globeex

1510
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:50,079
and Globeex
 

1511
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,750
and Globeex
and you can see previous week low key

1512
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:51,760
and you can see previous week low key
 

1513
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,910
and you can see previous week low key
level there with the volume above. So

1514
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:53,920
level there with the volume above. So
 

1515
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,430
level there with the volume above. So
bear's currently defending that.

1516
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
bear's currently defending that.
 

1517
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,750
bear's currently defending that.
I'm just not in a hurry here, guys. Like

1518
00:37:59,750 --> 00:37:59,760
I'm just not in a hurry here, guys. Like
 

1519
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,430
I'm just not in a hurry here, guys. Like
last day of the year.

1520
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:03,440
last day of the year.
 

1521
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:12,870
last day of the year.
Not in a hurry here.

1522
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:12,880

 

1523
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:19,190

So still unfinished business lower.

1524
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,200

 

1525
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,510

Do I think there's a crash incoming and

1526
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:21,520
Do I think there's a crash incoming and
 

1527
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,510
Do I think there's a crash incoming and
in another market? Can you bet on the

1528
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:23,520
in another market? Can you bet on the
 

1529
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,109
in another market? Can you bet on the
Chinese market, for example? I wouldn't

1530
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:25,119
Chinese market, for example? I wouldn't
 

1531
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,349
Chinese market, for example? I wouldn't
be betting on the Chinese market if you

1532
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:27,359
be betting on the Chinese market if you
 

1533
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,589
be betting on the Chinese market if you
feel that the US market's going to go

1534
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:29,599
feel that the US market's going to go
 

1535
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,829
feel that the US market's going to go
get derailed. You're better off to take

1536
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:31,839
get derailed. You're better off to take
 

1537
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,109
get derailed. You're better off to take
short positions on the US market or but

1538
00:38:35,109 --> 00:38:35,119
short positions on the US market or but
 

1539
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,030
short positions on the US market or but
you know, it's probably a bit late, but

1540
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,040
you know, it's probably a bit late, but
 

1541
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,990
you know, it's probably a bit late, but
there's a reason there's long exposure

1542
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,000
there's a reason there's long exposure
 

1543
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,310
there's a reason there's long exposure
right now into gold and metals.

1544
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:44,320
right now into gold and metals.
 

1545
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,069
right now into gold and metals.
Okay, back to previous week low again.

1546
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:46,079
Okay, back to previous week low again.
 

1547
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,349
Okay, back to previous week low again.
They're starting to try and reclaim.

1548
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:47,359
They're starting to try and reclaim.
 

1549
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,710
They're starting to try and reclaim.
They're going back to this gray box.

1550
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:48,720
They're going back to this gray box.
 

1551
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,990
They're going back to this gray box.
These are your triggers up here. Did

1552
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,000
These are your triggers up here. Did
 

1553
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,990
These are your triggers up here. Did
they reshort this or is this a look

1554
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,000
they reshort this or is this a look
 

1555
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,670
they reshort this or is this a look
below and fail and we go mega mega

1556
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:53,680
below and fail and we go mega mega
 

1557
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,069
below and fail and we go mega mega
squeeze? I'm not ruling anything out

1558
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:56,079
squeeze? I'm not ruling anything out
 

1559
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,910
squeeze? I'm not ruling anything out
because the volume's so light here. All

1560
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:57,920
because the volume's so light here. All
 

1561
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,589
because the volume's so light here. All
right,

1562
00:38:59,589 --> 00:38:59,599
right,
 

1563
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,430
right,
so bears came in at 17s to 25. So that's

1564
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:03,440
so bears came in at 17s to 25. So that's
 

1565
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,750
so bears came in at 17s to 25. So that's
the the level bears will want to defend.

1566
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:05,760
the the level bears will want to defend.
 

1567
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,589
the the level bears will want to defend.
All right, 517s to 525 is where they

1568
00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:09,599
All right, 517s to 525 is where they
 

1569
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,109
All right, 517s to 525 is where they
came in heavy. That is where they will

1570
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:11,119
came in heavy. That is where they will
 

1571
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,550
came in heavy. That is where they will
want to defend. If they don't defend

1572
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:12,560
want to defend. If they don't defend
 

1573
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,670
want to defend. If they don't defend
that, we can see a squeeze.

1574
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:15,680
that, we can see a squeeze.
 

1575
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,630
that, we can see a squeeze.
So here's the test of 17s. We just

1576
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:18,640
So here's the test of 17s. We just
 

1577
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,349
So here's the test of 17s. We just
talked about it

1578
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:21,359
talked about it
 

1579
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,870
talked about it
literally to the tick.

1580
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:26,880

 

1581
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,470

Yeah, exactly. CB, it wouldn't take a

1582
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:28,480
Yeah, exactly. CB, it wouldn't take a
 

1583
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,069
Yeah, exactly. CB, it wouldn't take a
lot to push it around, right? You get

1584
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:30,079
lot to push it around, right? You get
 

1585
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,750
lot to push it around, right? You get
one big player come in and uh this

1586
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:31,760
one big player come in and uh this
 

1587
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,990
one big player come in and uh this
market changes direction very quickly or

1588
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,000
market changes direction very quickly or
 

1589
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,750
market changes direction very quickly or
expands very very quickly. That's

1590
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:35,760
expands very very quickly. That's
 

1591
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,470
expands very very quickly. That's
exactly what I'm getting at.

1592
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:38,480
exactly what I'm getting at.
 

1593
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,069
exactly what I'm getting at.
And you wouldn't want to be the wrong

1594
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:40,079
And you wouldn't want to be the wrong
 

1595
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,990
And you wouldn't want to be the wrong
side of that because it will skip if

1596
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,000
side of that because it will skip if
 

1597
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,310
side of that because it will skip if
that is what's going to happen. We're

1598
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:44,320
that is what's going to happen. We're
 

1599
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,990
that is what's going to happen. We're
starting to see some bids turn up on

1600
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,000
starting to see some bids turn up on
 

1601
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,710
starting to see some bids turn up on
Tesla and Goo here now folks. We still

1602
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:48,720
Tesla and Goo here now folks. We still
 

1603
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,870
Tesla and Goo here now folks. We still
have low low hanging fruit below for

1604
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:50,880
have low low hanging fruit below for
 

1605
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,230
have low low hanging fruit below for
sure, but we're starting to see some

1606
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:52,240
sure, but we're starting to see some
 

1607
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,990
sure, but we're starting to see some
bids. I'd say shorts under 93 a quart.

1608
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:56,000
bids. I'd say shorts under 93 a quart.
 

1609
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,990
bids. I'd say shorts under 93 a quart.
All right, so if bids start to hold

1610
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:58,000
All right, so if bids start to hold
 

1611
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,390
All right, so if bids start to hold
above 93, the rotation is from there up

1612
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:00,400
above 93, the rotation is from there up
 

1613
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,430
above 93, the rotation is from there up
to sort of the 17s, the 25s we talked

1614
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:03,440
to sort of the 17s, the 25s we talked
 

1615
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,390
to sort of the 17s, the 25s we talked
about. All right, a big if button may

1616
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:06,400
about. All right, a big if button may
 

1617
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,310
about. All right, a big if button may
right now while they start to make a

1618
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:08,320
right now while they start to make a
 

1619
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,910
right now while they start to make a
decision.

1620
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:13,920

 

1621
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,510

Do I think after hours are going to be

1622
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:15,520
Do I think after hours are going to be
 

1623
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,670
Do I think after hours are going to be
important after the 1st of January? Uh

1624
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:17,680
important after the 1st of January? Uh
 

1625
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,310
important after the 1st of January? Uh
what? Because of the silver legislation

1626
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:20,320
what? Because of the silver legislation
 

1627
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,270
what? Because of the silver legislation
coming in in China, you mean?

1628
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:23,280
coming in in China, you mean?
 

1629
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,710
coming in in China, you mean?
I don't know. There's been so much talk

1630
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:24,720
I don't know. There's been so much talk
 

1631
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,990
I don't know. There's been so much talk
about it. I would say it's probably

1632
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:26,000
about it. I would say it's probably
 

1633
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,109
about it. I would say it's probably
priced in, you know. But unless unless

1634
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:29,119
priced in, you know. But unless unless
 

1635
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,710
priced in, you know. But unless unless
there's a discrepancy in what people

1636
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:30,720
there's a discrepancy in what people
 

1637
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,829
there's a discrepancy in what people
think is going to happen and what

1638
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:31,839
think is going to happen and what
 

1639
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,349
think is going to happen and what
actually happens. All right. They're

1640
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:33,359
actually happens. All right. They're
 

1641
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,550
actually happens. All right. They're
starting to leave these shorts

1642
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:34,560
starting to leave these shorts
 

1643
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,630
starting to leave these shorts
underneath 90s core, right underneath

1644
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:36,640
underneath 90s core, right underneath
 

1645
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,030
underneath 90s core, right underneath
here.

1646
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,040

 

1647
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,630

We have some shorts caught. We just

1648
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:42,640
We have some shorts caught. We just
 

1649
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,790
We have some shorts caught. We just
talked about it underneath 90s right

1650
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:44,800
talked about it underneath 90s right
 

1651
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,870
talked about it underneath 90s right
under here. Shorts are caught. If we

1652
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:46,880
under here. Shorts are caught. If we
 

1653
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,030
under here. Shorts are caught. If we
start to see this expansion now through

1654
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,040
start to see this expansion now through
 

1655
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,069
start to see this expansion now through
these levels, you're going to see the

1656
00:40:50,069 --> 00:40:50,079
these levels, you're going to see the
 

1657
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,030
these levels, you're going to see the
squeeze. So, I'm starting to get

1658
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,040
squeeze. So, I'm starting to get
 

1659
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,270
squeeze. So, I'm starting to get
interested in this. We talked about this

1660
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:53,280
interested in this. We talked about this
 

1661
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,710
interested in this. We talked about this
17s, didn't we? 17s to 25. If we start

1662
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:56,720
17s, didn't we? 17s to 25. If we start
 

1663
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,910
17s, didn't we? 17s to 25. If we start
getting through that, we're going to see

1664
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:57,920
getting through that, we're going to see
 

1665
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,150
getting through that, we're going to see
expansion back upside and squeeze them

1666
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,160
expansion back upside and squeeze them
 

1667
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,390
expansion back upside and squeeze them
all out. Here we go. All right. Very

1668
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:02,400
all out. Here we go. All right. Very
 

1669
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,630
all out. Here we go. All right. Very
interested now. So, there's the 25. 17s

1670
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:04,640
interested now. So, there's the 25. 17s
 

1671
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,750
interested now. So, there's the 25. 17s
to 25s. Here comes VWAP. Looking for

1672
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:07,760
to 25s. Here comes VWAP. Looking for
 

1673
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,910
to 25s. Here comes VWAP. Looking for
bullish momentum to continue this higher

1674
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:09,920
bullish momentum to continue this higher
 

1675
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,630
bullish momentum to continue this higher
for a squeeze now.

1676
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:12,640
for a squeeze now.
 

1677
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,630
for a squeeze now.
And if especially if we get back through

1678
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:14,640
And if especially if we get back through
 

1679
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,150
And if especially if we get back through
previous week value area low. It's a

1680
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:16,160
previous week value area low. It's a
 

1681
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,670
previous week value area low. It's a
shame we left low hanging fruit here.

1682
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:17,680
shame we left low hanging fruit here.
 

1683
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,190
shame we left low hanging fruit here.
But if we do this I'm very interested.

1684
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:23,200

 

1685
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,190

So some of you asking was it going to

1686
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:25,200
So some of you asking was it going to
 

1687
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,790
So some of you asking was it going to
trade? I just need to wait to see the

1688
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:26,800
trade? I just need to wait to see the
 

1689
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,550
trade? I just need to wait to see the
setup.

1690
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:30,560

 

1691
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,550

We created a new point of control up

1692
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:32,560
We created a new point of control up
 

1693
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,150
We created a new point of control up
here at 25 shorts. 17 is still the level

1694
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:36,160
here at 25 shorts. 17 is still the level
 

1695
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,069
here at 25 shorts. 17 is still the level
for shorts. All right, so they will want

1696
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:38,079
for shorts. All right, so they will want
 

1697
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,550
for shorts. All right, so they will want
it back below 17s right now. Balls will

1698
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:40,560
it back below 17s right now. Balls will
 

1699
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,630
it back below 17s right now. Balls will
want to get back over 640 to really take

1700
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:42,640
want to get back over 640 to really take
 

1701
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,950
want to get back over 640 to really take
control.

1702
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:46,960

 

1703
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,030

Coming back into these 17s. Let's see if

1704
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,040
Coming back into these 17s. Let's see if
 

1705
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,630
Coming back into these 17s. Let's see if
bulls defend this and leave these shorts

1706
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:50,640
bulls defend this and leave these shorts
 

1707
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,109
bulls defend this and leave these shorts
cooked. If we go back lower into this

1708
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:53,119
cooked. If we go back lower into this
 

1709
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,790
cooked. If we go back lower into this
gray box, letting this rotate for a

1710
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:54,800
gray box, letting this rotate for a
 

1711
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,470
gray box, letting this rotate for a
moment in this gray box before I make a

1712
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:56,480
moment in this gray box before I make a
 

1713
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,390
moment in this gray box before I make a
decision here.

1714
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,400

 

1715
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,990

17's big level here. I can see on the

1716
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,000
17's big level here. I can see on the
 

1717
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,390
17's big level here. I can see on the
book. keep trading into it there or

1718
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:06,400
book. keep trading into it there or
 

1719
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,910
book. keep trading into it there or
thereabouts. If I say like an exact

1720
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:07,920
thereabouts. If I say like an exact
 

1721
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,109
thereabouts. If I say like an exact
level, you know, you got to give it a

1722
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:09,119
level, you know, you got to give it a
 

1723
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:16,069
level, you know, you got to give it a
few few points either side, folks.

1724
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:16,079

 

1725
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,069

See, that didn't take much to reflush

1726
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:18,079
See, that didn't take much to reflush
 

1727
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,829
See, that didn't take much to reflush
that. That was one player and it wasn't

1728
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:19,839
that. That was one player and it wasn't
 

1729
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,589
that. That was one player and it wasn't
much size. This is the worry. What did

1730
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:21,599
much size. This is the worry. What did
 

1731
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,390
much size. This is the worry. What did
he come in with? 37 lot and then he ran

1732
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:24,400
he come in with? 37 lot and then he ran
 

1733
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,190
he come in with? 37 lot and then he ran
a 100 uh 100 lot stops there. So, it's

1734
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:27,200
a 100 uh 100 lot stops there. So, it's
 

1735
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,870
a 100 uh 100 lot stops there. So, it's
not taking a lot to move this around

1736
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:28,880
not taking a lot to move this around
 

1737
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,190
not taking a lot to move this around
right now. That's this is the concern I

1738
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:31,200
right now. That's this is the concern I
 

1739
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:38,309
right now. That's this is the concern I
have.

1740
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:38,319

 

1741
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,829

still underneath VWAP, but we're trying

1742
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:39,839
still underneath VWAP, but we're trying
 

1743
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,390
still underneath VWAP, but we're trying
to reclaim previous weak lows here. ES

1744
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:42,400
to reclaim previous weak lows here. ES
 

1745
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:50,230
to reclaim previous weak lows here. ES
is also stuck at VWAP.

1746
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:50,240

 

1747
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,190

This is possible. We're not there yet to

1748
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:53,200
This is possible. We're not there yet to
 

1749
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,349
This is possible. We're not there yet to
do it, but it's possible. They can also

1750
00:42:55,349 --> 00:42:55,359
do it, but it's possible. They can also
 

1751
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,109
do it, but it's possible. They can also
reject this gray box and complete

1752
00:42:57,109 --> 00:42:57,119
reject this gray box and complete
 

1753
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,829
reject this gray box and complete
rotation to here. So,

1754
00:42:59,829 --> 00:42:59,839
rotation to here. So,
 

1755
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,589
rotation to here. So,
I don't think I want to be bearish down

1756
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:01,599
I don't think I want to be bearish down
 

1757
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,030
I don't think I want to be bearish down
here at the moment. just because how

1758
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,040
here at the moment. just because how
 

1759
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,630
here at the moment. just because how
we're building out. But uh see

1760
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:08,640

 

1761
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,069

1767
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,069
big level. Here comes point of control
again. Are we going to start to see

1768
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:18,079
again. Are we going to start to see
 

1769
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,309
again. Are we going to start to see
expansion? Can we get through value? Can

1770
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:20,319
expansion? Can we get through value? Can
 

1771
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,630
expansion? Can we get through value? Can
we get through VWAP?

00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:22,640
we get through VWAP?
 

1773
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,870

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,390

75. Okay.

1884
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:50,400

 

1885
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,069

Sorry, mumbling to myself. I was just

1886
00:46:52,069 --> 00:46:52,079
Sorry, mumbling to myself. I was just
 

1887
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,470
Sorry, mumbling to myself. I was just
looking at who's been bidding lower and

1888
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:54,480
looking at who's been bidding lower and
 

1889
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,510
looking at who's been bidding lower and
moving the book around.

1890
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:57,520
moving the book around.
 

1891
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,109
moving the book around.
Right. They're trying to have another

1892
00:46:59,109 --> 00:46:59,119
Right. They're trying to have another
 

1893
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,670
Right. They're trying to have another
attempt here again. 7 17 It's the same

1894
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:01,680
attempt here again. 7 17 It's the same
 

1895
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,790
attempt here again. 7 17 It's the same
level, folks. Right. 17 to 25 is where

1896
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:04,800
level, folks. Right. 17 to 25 is where
 

1897
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,870
level, folks. Right. 17 to 25 is where
sellers are willing to be aggressive in

1898
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:06,880
sellers are willing to be aggressive in
 

1899
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,829
sellers are willing to be aggressive in
this gray box. If we lose this gray box,

1900
00:47:09,829 --> 00:47:09,839
this gray box. If we lose this gray box,
 

1901
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,510
this gray box. If we lose this gray box,
all right, we haven't had the I

1902
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:11,520
all right, we haven't had the I
 

1903
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,069
all right, we haven't had the I
feathered in long from sort of here.

1904
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:16,079
feathered in long from sort of here.
 

1905
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,630
feathered in long from sort of here.
Draw from here to here just in case we

1906
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:18,640
Draw from here to here just in case we
 

1907
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,470
Draw from here to here just in case we
got this to add heavy. We didn't. So,

1908
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:20,480
got this to add heavy. We didn't. So,
 

1909
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,030
got this to add heavy. We didn't. So,
cut it. We're losing this now. We might

1910
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:23,040
cut it. We're losing this now. We might
 

1911
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,270
cut it. We're losing this now. We might
well revisit this, this, and this. All

1912
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:25,280
well revisit this, this, and this. All
 

1913
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,030
well revisit this, this, and this. All
right. If they lose this, we might well

1914
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:27,040
right. If they lose this, we might well
 

1915
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,069
right. If they lose this, we might well
revisit it. Creating fairly standard

1916
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:30,079
revisit it. Creating fairly standard
 

1917
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,309
revisit it. Creating fairly standard
D-shape down here after leaving value.

1918
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:34,319
D-shape down here after leaving value.
 

1919
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,230
D-shape down here after leaving value.
And we have not been able to reclaim

1920
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:36,240
And we have not been able to reclaim
 

1921
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,829
And we have not been able to reclaim
previous week value. So technically,

1922
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:37,839
previous week value. So technically,
 

1923
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:40,550
previous week value. So technically,
this is bearish right now.

1924
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:40,560
this is bearish right now.
 

1925
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,230
this is bearish right now.
Just what I'm seeing on the tape isn't

1926
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:42,240
Just what I'm seeing on the tape isn't
 

1927
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,550
Just what I'm seeing on the tape isn't
really matching the the levels. That's a

1928
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:46,560
really matching the the levels. That's a
 

1929
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,750
really matching the the levels. That's a
little bit weird, but whatever.

1930
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:49,760
little bit weird, but whatever.
 

1931
00:47:49,760 --> 00:48:03,670
little bit weird, but whatever.
Expected.

1932
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:03,680

 

1933
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,030

Silver. Yeah. Well, silver's very

1934
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
Silver. Yeah. Well, silver's very
 

1935
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,390
Silver. Yeah. Well, silver's very
volatile right now. I'm uh I like that

1936
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:08,400
volatile right now. I'm uh I like that
 

1937
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,069
volatile right now. I'm uh I like that
trade when everyone forgets about it and

1938
00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:10,079
trade when everyone forgets about it and
 

1939
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,470
trade when everyone forgets about it and
it's less crowded because I want to take

1940
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:12,480
it's less crowded because I want to take
 

1941
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,829
it's less crowded because I want to take
swing positions on it.

1942
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:17,839

 

1943
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,510

New hour coming up here, folks, as well.

1944
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:19,520
New hour coming up here, folks, as well.
 

1945
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:25,349
New hour coming up here, folks, as well.
New 4 hour, new hour.

1946
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:25,359

 

1947
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:26,790

This last hour doesn't look very good,

1948
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:26,800
This last hour doesn't look very good,
 

1949
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:37,589
This last hour doesn't look very good,
does it?

1950
00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:37,599

 

1951
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,910

Take care, Adam. You like the short?

1952
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:39,920
Take care, Adam. You like the short?
 

1953
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,270
Take care, Adam. You like the short?
Yeah, I mean the short is possible

1954
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:41,280
Yeah, I mean the short is possible
 

1955
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,109
Yeah, I mean the short is possible
versus this gray box. It's just what I'm

1956
00:48:43,109 --> 00:48:43,119
versus this gray box. It's just what I'm
 

1957
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,710
versus this gray box. It's just what I'm
seeing on the tape doesn't feel very

1958
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:44,720
seeing on the tape doesn't feel very
 

1959
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,870
seeing on the tape doesn't feel very
good for that move. Technically, it

1960
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:46,880
good for that move. Technically, it
 

1961
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,390
good for that move. Technically, it
looks it looks like there's a possible

1962
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:48,400
looks it looks like there's a possible
 

1963
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,910
looks it looks like there's a possible
setup there to drive lower. I would

1964
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:49,920
setup there to drive lower. I would
 

1965
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,670
setup there to drive lower. I would
agree with you. We've we've had an

1966
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:51,680
agree with you. We've we've had an
 

1967
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,270
agree with you. We've we've had an
attempt, but what I'm seeing on the on

1968
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:53,280
attempt, but what I'm seeing on the on
 

1969
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,829
attempt, but what I'm seeing on the on
the tape, it just doesn't look very

1970
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:55,839
the tape, it just doesn't look very
 

1971
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,910
the tape, it just doesn't look very
good. The only time they're

1972
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:57,920
good. The only time they're
 

1973
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:09,109
good. The only time they're
participating is in these 17s and 25s.

1974
00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:09,119

 

1975
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,549

They're trying to find a bid here,

1976
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:10,559
They're trying to find a bid here,
 

1977
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:19,510
They're trying to find a bid here,
honestly.

1978
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:19,520

 

1979
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,030

Even up here on the take, you can see I

1980
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,040
Even up here on the take, you can see I
 

1981
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,270
Even up here on the take, you can see I
said 17s and 25s. All the re all the

1982
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:23,280

1983
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,670
said 17s and 25s. All the re all the
passive reoffers are up at 25 and 30s.

1984
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:25,680
passive reoffers are up at 25 and 30s.
 

1985
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,710
passive reoffers are up at 25 and 30s.
No one's like aggressively stepping on.

1986
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:28,720
No one's like aggressively stepping on.
 

1987
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,349
No one's like aggressively stepping on.
Um,

00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:31,359
Um,
 

1989

Um,
no one's aggressively stepping on either

1990
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:32,960
no one's aggressively stepping on either
 

1991
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,030
no one's aggressively stepping on either
side right now. There's like one guy who

1992
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:35,040
side right now. There's like one guy who
 

1993
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,030
side right now. There's like one guy who
seems to step on for like 10 20 points.

1994
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:37,040
seems to step on for like 10 20 points.
 

1995
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,270
seems to step on for like 10 20 points.
Like he's trying again now. Maybe

1996
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:39,280
Like he's trying again now. Maybe
 

1997
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,549
Like he's trying again now. Maybe
they're trying to get these fields down

1998
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:40,559
they're trying to get these fields down
 

1999
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,309
they're trying to get these fields down
to 90s.

2000

to 90s.
 

2001
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,230
to 90s.
Again, absorbed off nothing. Like what

Again, absorbed off nothing. Like what
 

2003

What's in here? A nine lot. Man, it's so
guys, it's really thin. I don't know if

2008
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:54,880
guys, it's really thin. I don't know if
 

2009
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,109
guys, it's really thin. I don't know if
I'm going to uh anticipate unless we

2010
00:49:57,109 --> 00:49:57,119
I'm going to uh anticipate unless we
 

2011
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,910
I'm going to uh anticipate unless we
start breaking like big key levels. It's

2012
00:49:59,910 --> 00:49:59,920
start breaking like big key levels. It's
 

2013
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:12,630
start breaking like big key levels. It's
very very very thin.

2014
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:12,640

 

2015
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,549

It feels like a uh it feels like a

It feels like a uh it feels like a
 

2017

It feels like a uh it feels like a
glowback session.

2018
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:16,720
glowback session.
 

2019
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,549
glowback session.
Watching the book. That's what it feels

2020
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:18,559
Watching the book. That's what it feels
 

2021
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:36,950
Watching the book. That's what it feels
like.

2022
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:36,960

Yeah. Under 90s is where they've been
 

2027
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,750
Yeah. Under 90s is where they've been
stuck, these bears so far this morning.

2028
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:45,760
stuck, these bears so far this morning.
 

2029
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,270
stuck, these bears so far this morning.

2035
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,430
think half size is a good way to be.
Look, you they can't get under these

00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:53,440
Look, you they can't get under these
 

2037
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,390
Look, you they can't get under these
90s. So these guys that were stuck here,

2038
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:56,400
90s. So these guys that were stuck here,
 

2039
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,150
90s. So these guys that were stuck here,
right? They can't get under here and

2040
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:58,160

2042
00:50:59,750 --> 00:50:59,760
they're not willing to be aggressive
 

2043
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,589
they're not willing to be aggressive
unless they're up here, the sellers. So

2044
00:51:01,589 --> 00:51:01,599
unless they're up here, the sellers. So
 

2045
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,150
unless they're up here, the sellers. So
sellers are being aggressive in here and

2046
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:04,160
sellers are being aggressive in here and
 

2047
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,990
sellers are being aggressive in here and
not in here at the moment. And these

2048
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:06,000
not in here at the moment. And these
 

2049
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,750
not in here at the moment. And these
guys here are stuck. So we're just like

2050
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:07,760
guys here are stuck. So we're just like
 

2051
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,309
guys here are stuck. So we're just like
building out. And this is not very big,

2052
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:10,319
building out. And this is not very big,
 

2053
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:11,910
building out. And this is not very big,
folks.

2054
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:11,920
folks.
 

2055
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,230
folks.
That's your rotation right now on low

2056
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:14,240
That's your rotation right now on low
 

2057
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,710
That's your rotation right now on low
volume.

2058
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:16,720
volume.
 

2059
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,630
volume.
So maybe we come back up and test these

2060
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:18,640
So maybe we come back up and test these
 

2061
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,630
So maybe we come back up and test these
17s again. I mean,

2062
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:22,640
17s again. I mean,
 

2063
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,390
17s again. I mean,
yeah, there's not there's not much here

2064
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:24,400
yeah, there's not there's not much here
 

2065
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,589
yeah, there's not there's not much here
until then. I mean, you've got this

2066
00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:25,599
until then. I mean, you've got this
 

2067
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:26,870
until then. I mean, you've got this
previous week low that we're rejecting

2068
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:26,880
previous week low that we're rejecting
 

2069
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,950
previous week low that we're rejecting
off, but the all the volume is up above.

2070
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:28,960
off, but the all the volume is up above.
 

2071
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,870
off, but the all the volume is up above.
All the volume is up here. No one's

2072
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:30,880
All the volume is up here. No one's
 

2073
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:56,309
All the volume is up here. No one's
willing to transact down here right now.

2074
00:51:56,309 --> 00:51:56,319

 

2075
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:57,910

testing previous week low as well. What

2076
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:57,920
testing previous week low as well. What
 

2077
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,390
testing previous week low as well. What
copy do I use? Affordable indicators.

2078
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:00,400
copy do I use? Affordable indicators.
 

2079
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:07,510
copy do I use? Affordable indicators.
Affordable indicators.

2080
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:07,520

 

2081
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,030

I think they want to go and test the if

2082
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:09,040
I think they want to go and test the if
 

2083
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,309
I think they want to go and test the if
they get through previous week low, they

2084
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:10,319
they get through previous week low, they
 

2085
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:11,990
they get through previous week low, they
want to go and test these 17s again.

2086
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:12,000
want to go and test these 17s again.
 

2087
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,230
want to go and test these 17s again.
It's it's a big if if they can get

2088
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:14,240
It's it's a big if if they can get
 

2089
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,430
It's it's a big if if they can get
through this level we're at now, these

2090
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:15,440
through this level we're at now, these
 

2091
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,150
through this level we're at now, these
sort of 609 610s.

2092
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:18,160
sort of 609 610s.
 

2093
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,510
sort of 609 610s.
Then they just want to go and drive up

2094
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:19,520
Then they just want to go and drive up
 

2095
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,670
Then they just want to go and drive up
and test 17 to 25 again and see if those

2096
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:21,680
and test 17 to 25 again and see if those
 

2097
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,270
and test 17 to 25 again and see if those
sellers are still there. There is a

2098
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:23,280
sellers are still there. There is a
 

2099
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,030
sellers are still there. There is a
seller come back on the book here

2100
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:25,040

first time today. He's moved to 610.

2104
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:37,280

 

2105
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,109

anchored volume profile. Volume on the

00:52:39,109 --> 00:52:39,119
anchored volume profile. Volume on the
 

2107
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:46,069

Back to this gray box. And honestly, if
 

2157
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,230
Back to this gray box. And honestly, if
this is a higher low and we lift through

2158
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:00,240
this is a higher low and we lift through
 

2159
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,829
this is a higher low and we lift through
this, I'm still willing to look at this

this, I'm still willing to look at this
 

2161
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:11,510
this, I'm still willing to look at this
rotation above 40s.

2162
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:11,520

 

2163
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,109

00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:48,880
we did expect obviously we did expect
 

2193
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,750
we did expect obviously we did expect
this.

2194
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:53,760

 

2195
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,069

Do I prefer the trade of eight 50k apex

2196
00:54:56,069 --> 00:54:56,079
Do I prefer the trade of eight 50k apex
 

2197
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:57,910
Do I prefer the trade of eight 50k apex
count or rhythm? Rhythmic trade of eight

2198
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:57,920
count or rhythm? Rhythmic trade of eight
 

2199
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,150
count or rhythm? Rhythmic trade of eight
definitely trade of eight. Do I think

2200
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:00,160
definitely trade of eight. Do I think
 

2201
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,829
definitely trade of eight. Do I think
trading will get heavy again on the

2202
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:01,839
trading will get heavy again on the
 

2203
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:03,589
trading will get heavy again on the
second or there'll be another light day

2204
00:55:03,589 --> 00:55:03,599
second or there'll be another light day
 

2205
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,270
second or there'll be another light day
and everybody will be waiting for the

2206
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:05,280
and everybody will be waiting for the
 

2207
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,270
and everybody will be waiting for the
fifth. Um I don't know. It's probably

2208
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:07,280
fifth. Um I don't know. It's probably
 

2209
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,710
fifth. Um I don't know. It's probably
going to take a little bit of time to

2210
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:08,720
going to take a little bit of time to
 

2211
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,630
going to take a little bit of time to
pick up volume again. Depends how

2212
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:10,640
pick up volume again. Depends how
 

2213
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,230
pick up volume again. Depends how
desperate. Honestly, a lot's going to

2214
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:12,240
desperate. Honestly, a lot's going to
 

2215
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,790
desperate. Honestly, a lot's going to
depend on tax season. It depends if they

2216
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:14,800
depend on tax season. It depends if they
 

2217
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:15,990
depend on tax season. It depends if they
can start. Here we go. So, here's the

2218
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:16,000
can start. Here we go. So, here's the
 

2219
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,069
can start. Here we go. So, here's the
move to 17 again we just talked about

2220
00:55:18,069 --> 00:55:18,079
move to 17 again we just talked about
 

2221
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,630
move to 17 again we just talked about
and rejection of 17 again so far. And if

2222
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:20,640
and rejection of 17 again so far. And if
 

2223
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,230
and rejection of 17 again so far. And if
they squeeze through 17, we're going to

2224
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:22,240
they squeeze through 17, we're going to
 

2225
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,030
they squeeze through 17, we're going to
go 25s. And if we squeeze through 25s,

2226
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:25,040
go 25s. And if we squeeze through 25s,
 

2227
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,870
go 25s. And if we squeeze through 25s,
we're going to go check 40. And it's at

2228
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:26,880
we're going to go check 40. And it's at
 

2229
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,589
we're going to go check 40. And it's at
that point where I'll be become vaguely

2230
00:55:29,589 --> 00:55:29,599
that point where I'll be become vaguely
 

2231
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,750
that point where I'll be become vaguely
interested in this market and not

2232
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:31,760
interested in this market and not
 

2233
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,470
interested in this market and not
before. You can see this lift to 17

2234
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:34,480
before. You can see this lift to 17
 

2235
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,910
before. You can see this lift to 17
right here. I keep talking about that's

2236
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:35,920
right here. I keep talking about that's
 

2237
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,190
right here. I keep talking about that's
the level that they're willing to trade

2238
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:37,200
the level that they're willing to trade
 

2239
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,150
the level that they're willing to trade
at. 17 to 25 is where they're willing to

2240
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:40,160
at. 17 to 25 is where they're willing to
 

2241
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,950
at. 17 to 25 is where they're willing to
offer. They're not really interested in

2242
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:42,960
offer. They're not really interested in
 

2243
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,309
offer. They're not really interested in
selling low. So, they're not being

2244
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:44,319
selling low. So, they're not being
 

2245
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,510
selling low. So, they're not being
aggressive at the lows so far. I'm can

2246
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:47,520
aggressive at the lows so far. I'm can
 

2247
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,670
aggressive at the lows so far. I'm can
only go by what we've seen so far today.

2248
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:49,680
only go by what we've seen so far today.
 

2249
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,510
only go by what we've seen so far today.
Things can change. Uh, what were you

2250
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:51,520
Things can change. Uh, what were you
 

2251
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,670
Things can change. Uh, what were you
saying? Volume. Yes. I don't know. Yeah,

2252
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:53,680
saying? Volume. Yes. I don't know. Yeah,
 

2253
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,030
saying? Volume. Yes. I don't know. Yeah,
I think a lot would depend on tax

2254
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:55,040
I think a lot would depend on tax
 

2255
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,190
I think a lot would depend on tax
season. I would have expected, to be

2256
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:57,200
season. I would have expected, to be
 

2257
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,950
season. I would have expected, to be
honest, any big losses that they had

2258
00:55:58,950 --> 00:55:58,960
honest, any big losses that they had
 

2259
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,470
honest, any big losses that they had
earlier this year that they'd start to

2260
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:00,480
earlier this year that they'd start to
 

2261
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,710
earlier this year that they'd start to
lift out of them and maybe rotate back

2262
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:02,720
lift out of them and maybe rotate back
 

2263
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,190
lift out of them and maybe rotate back
into them cheap, but we're not really

2264
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:05,200
into them cheap, but we're not really
 

2265
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,870
into them cheap, but we're not really
seeing that into the end of the year.

2266
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:08,880
seeing that into the end of the year.
 

2267
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,710
seeing that into the end of the year.
So,

2268
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:10,720
So,
 

2269
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,789
So,
let's have a look at the uh

2270
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:14,799
let's have a look at the uh
 

2271
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:21,750
let's have a look at the uh
calendar.

2272
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:21,760

 

2273
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,589

I mean, yeah, fifth fifth is where it

2274
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:23,599
I mean, yeah, fifth fifth is where it
 

2275
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,710
I mean, yeah, fifth fifth is where it
gets in more interesting for sure. Uh

2276
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:28,720
gets in more interesting for sure. Uh
 

2277
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,630
gets in more interesting for sure. Uh
probably the seventh is going to be the

2278
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:30,640
probably the seventh is going to be the
 

2279
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,990
probably the seventh is going to be the
first big move big mover. ADP employment

2280
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:34,000
first big move big mover. ADP employment
 

2281
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,150
first big move big mover. ADP employment
and then job openings and US factory

2282
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:36,160
and then job openings and US factory
 

2283
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,750
and then job openings and US factory
orders and that's followed by initial

2284
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:37,760
orders and that's followed by initial
 

2285
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,670
orders and that's followed by initial
jobless claims the next day. So seventh

2286
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:39,680
jobless claims the next day. So seventh
 

2287
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,750
jobless claims the next day. So seventh
and eighth and ninth are going to be big

2288
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:41,760
and eighth and ninth are going to be big
 

2289
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,630
and eighth and ninth are going to be big
days. How much do they cook the books or

2290
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:44,640
days. How much do they cook the books or
 

2291
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,870
days. How much do they cook the books or
do we actually get real stats without

2292
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:46,880
do we actually get real stats without
 

2293
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,150
do we actually get real stats without
the [\h__\h] Um

2294
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:50,160
the [\h__\h] Um
 

2295
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,430
the [\h__\h] Um
you know do they uh miss 80% of CPI out

2296
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:53,440
you know do they uh miss 80% of CPI out
 

2297
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,470
you know do they uh miss 80% of CPI out
next time again and pretend like they

2298
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:56,480
next time again and pretend like they
 

2299
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,390
next time again and pretend like they
didn't include stuff and not talk about

2300
00:56:58,390 --> 00:56:58,400
didn't include stuff and not talk about
 

2301
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,309
didn't include stuff and not talk about
it which what they did last time. Do

2302
00:57:00,309 --> 00:57:00,319
it which what they did last time. Do
 

2303
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:01,750
it which what they did last time. Do
they cook the books like they did this

2304
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:01,760
they cook the books like they did this
 

2305
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,510
they cook the books like they did this
morning?

2306
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:03,520
morning?
 

2307
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,589
morning?
Who knows? Tell you what, there's buck

2308
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:05,599
Who knows? Tell you what, there's buck
 

2309
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,630
Who knows? Tell you what, there's buck
all job creation and uh unemployment has

2310
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:08,640
all job creation and uh unemployment has
 

2311
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,069
all job creation and uh unemployment has
been ticking up every month since

2312
00:57:10,069 --> 00:57:10,079
been ticking up every month since
 

2313
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:12,150
been ticking up every month since
January and all you have to do is do a

2314
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:12,160
January and all you have to do is do a
 

2315
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,390
January and all you have to do is do a
little bit of a deep dive beyond the

2316
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:14,400
little bit of a deep dive beyond the
 

2317
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,789
little bit of a deep dive beyond the
[\h__\h] that they put out and you'll

2318
00:57:16,789 --> 00:57:16,799
[\h__\h] that they put out and you'll
 

2319
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,750
[\h__\h] that they put out and you'll
see that. So, will crack start to open

2320
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:19,760
see that. So, will crack start to open
 

2321
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,710
see that. So, will crack start to open
in January? Maybe. I' I'd expect in Q1

2322
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:22,720
in January? Maybe. I' I'd expect in Q1
 

2323
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:30,390
in January? Maybe. I' I'd expect in Q1
there's some volatility coming.

2324
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:30,400

 

2325
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,109

Oh, yeah. I'm asleep.

2326
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:33,119
Oh, yeah. I'm asleep.
 

2327
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,750
Oh, yeah. I'm asleep.
>> I am asleep.

2328
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:37,760

 

2329
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,990

Well, I haven't traded this morning.

2399
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,030

All right. 17 is still the level being

2400
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:39,040
All right. 17 is still the level being
 

2401
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:44,309
All right. 17 is still the level being
defended by bears.

2403
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,230

Still the level being defended by bears

2404
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:46,240
Still the level being defended by bears
 

2405
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,950
Still the level being defended by bears
right now. P has shifted down in this

2406
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:48,960
right now. P has shifted down in this
 

2407
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,670
right now. P has shifted down in this
session.

2408
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:51,680
session.
 

2409
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,109

Bears are in control all the time. when

2410
00:59:53,109 --> 00:59:53,119

we're defending this sort of 17 to 25,

2412
00:59:55,109 --> 00:59:55,119
we're defending this sort of 17 to 25,
 

2413
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:56,789
we're defending this sort of 17 to 25,
this sort of gray box. All right, if we

2414
00:59:56,789 --> 00:59:56,799
this sort of gray box. All right, if we
 

2415
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,470
this sort of gray box. All right, if we
get acceptance above that, I think we

2416
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:58,480
get acceptance above that, I think we
 

2417
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,829
get acceptance above that, I think we
have squeeze potential because we're

2418
00:59:59,829 --> 00:59:59,839
have squeeze potential because we're
 

2419
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:02,549
have squeeze potential because we're
very thin in this move down, right? We

2420
01:00:02,549 --> 01:00:02,559
very thin in this move down, right? We
 

2421
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,910
very thin in this move down, right? We
were thin up, thin down,

2422
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:05,920
were thin up, thin down,
 

2423
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,670
were thin up, thin down,
but we have unfinished business down

2424
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:07,680
but we have unfinished business down
 

2425
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,670
but we have unfinished business down
here and down here. And that's really

2426
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:09,680
here and down here. And that's really
 

2427
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,190
here and down here. And that's really
based off the higher time frame, not

2428
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:11,200
based off the higher time frame, not
 

2429
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,870
based off the higher time frame, not
just based on overnight, right? We have

2430
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:12,880
just based on overnight, right? We have
 

2431
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,470
just based on overnight, right? We have
unfinished business. If we zoom out on

01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:14,480
unfinished business. If we zoom out on
 

2433
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,789
unfinished business. If we zoom out on
the hourlys,

01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:16,799
the hourlys,
 

2435
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:18,390
the hourlys,
all right, we have this node here, which

2436
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:18,400
all right, we have this node here, which
 

2437
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,470
all right, we have this node here, which
we have pre-market. It might be that

2438
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:20,480
we have pre-market. It might be that
 

2439
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,069
we have pre-market. It might be that
they want to close the weekly opening

for efficiency reasons. If we get

2448
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:36,079
for efficiency reasons. If we get
 

2449
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:37,670
for efficiency reasons. If we get
through that we're watching this old

2450
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:37,680
through that we're watching this old
 

2451
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,109
through that we're watching this old
value area high and we're watching this

2452
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:39,119
value area high and we're watching this
 

2453
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,270
value area high and we're watching this
naked PC. All right. So if they fail

2454
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:41,280
naked PC. All right. So if they fail
 

2455
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,630
naked PC. All right. So if they fail
fade this if we get this expansion move

01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:44,640
fade this if we get this expansion move
 

2457
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:48,390
fade this if we get this expansion move
if we're thinking about

2458
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:48,400

 

2459
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,069

it's kind of awkward how they've done it

2460
01:00:50,069 --> 01:00:50,079
it's kind of awkward how they've done it
 

2461
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,510
it's kind of awkward how they've done it
but uh yeah we could get a three sigma

2462
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:53,520
but uh yeah we could get a three sigma
 

2463
01:00:53,520 --> 01:01:24,549
but uh yeah we could get a three sigma
move into it is possible.

01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:30,880
aggression, guys, on the tape. There's
 

2471
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,030
aggression, guys, on the tape. There's
literally like no aggression on the tape

2472
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:33,040
literally like no aggression on the tape
 

2473
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:37,990
literally like no aggression on the tape
today.

2475
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:47,670

If we lose 26, can we get to 25412? 26.

2476
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:47,680

 

2477
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,390

If we Yeah. Look, if we lose 26, the

2478
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:50,400
If we Yeah. Look, if we lose 26, the
 

2479
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,349
If we Yeah. Look, if we lose 26, the
first level is that 550, 560, that node

2480
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:53,359
first level is that 550, 560, that node
 

2481
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:56,870
first level is that 550, 560, that node
that we came into uh dating back to 15.

2482
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:56,880
that we came into uh dating back to 15.
 

2483
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,910
that we came into uh dating back to 15.
If we lose that, we can trade into 520s.

2484
01:01:59,910 --> 01:01:59,920
If we lose that, we can trade into 520s.
 

2485
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,309
If we lose that, we can trade into 520s.
If we lose 520s,

2486
01:02:02,309 --> 01:02:02,319
If we lose 520s,
 

2487
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:05,430
If we lose 520s,
we will trade into 340s, right? So, yes,

2488
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:05,440
we will trade into 340s, right? So, yes,

2499
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,870
willing to come in is 17 to 25. They are
not willing to step on the gas down

2500
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:18,880

here. You have to understand that like
 

2503
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,430
here. You have to understand that like
they are only willing to sell up here

they are only willing to sell up here

willing to sell here. We're not seeing
 

2513
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,670
willing to sell here. We're not seeing
them sell here and walk this market down

them sell here and walk this market down

Not yet. We're not seeing that. Which is
why I'm very apprehensive about thinking

When you refer to the tape, can you
 

2529
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,829
When you refer to the tape, can you
explain to what I mean? Quite literally

2530
01:02:59,829 --> 01:02:59,839
explain to what I mean? Quite literally

Quite literally a tape. It's the

Quite literally a tape. It's the

Quite literally a tape. It's the
equivalent of like a receipt being

equivalent of like a receipt being
 

2541
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:24,789
equivalent of like a receipt being

I'm imagining there's also probably a
bit of a put at 685 on spy.

01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:10,870

cuz we're just pinned above it.

can't.

2571
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,910

back up and check them if they're not

01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:31,920
back up and check them if they're not

2623
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,829
bit time left for that IB to be set, but
I mean, I'd say the the problem is not

01:05:51,829 --> 01:05:51,839
I mean, I'd say the the problem is not
 

2625

I mean, I'd say the the problem is not
the IB because the initial balance high

the IB because the initial balance high
 

2627

the IB because the initial balance high

2637
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,430
I mean, maybe there was a snapshot there
to be had, but I just didn't really want

2638
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:11,440
to be had, but I just didn't really want
 

2639

01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:14,950
to trade the open on a low volume day,
but that's the only thing I've seen. The

01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:14,960
but that's the only thing I've seen. The
 

2643
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,990

rejection of PC, the rejection of value,

rejection of PC, the rejection of value,
 

2645
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,670
rejection of PC, the rejection of value,
and that trade back down. And they did

2646
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:19,680
and that trade back down. And they did
 

2647
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,069
and that trade back down. And they did
reject it twice here in fairness. But,

2648
01:06:22,069 --> 01:06:22,079
reject it twice here in fairness. But,
 

2649
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,990

uh,

uh,
 

2651
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,150
uh,
yeah, I'd say bears have the edge in

2652
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:26,160
yeah, I'd say bears have the edge in
 

2653
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,230
yeah, I'd say bears have the edge in
this market at the moment, lower time

01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:28,240
this market at the moment, lower time

It's just are they actually going to

2683
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:19,990
with the rates going up in Japan, they
have exposure to US, right? And if

have exposure to US, right? And if
 

2685

people want to unpeg the USD and
 

2687
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:25,670
people want to unpeg the USD and
minimize exposure into things like the

01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:25,680
minimize exposure into things like the
 

2689
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,270
minimize exposure into things like the
cues, then they're going to start

2690
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:27,280
cues, then they're going to start
 

2691
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,589

These 90s are key. This is where they

2774
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:56,640
These 90s are key. This is where they
 

2775
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,110
These 90s are key. This is where they
started aggressively selling. Are they

2776
01:09:59,110 --> 01:09:59,120
started aggressively selling. Are they
 

2777
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,630
started aggressively selling. Are they
going to remain aggressively selling

2778
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:00,640
going to remain aggressively selling
 

2779
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,470
going to remain aggressively selling
these 90s?

2780
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:02,480
these 90s?
 

2781
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,830
these 90s?
At the moment, it looks like yes.

2782
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:03,840
At the moment, it looks like yes.
 

2783
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,350
At the moment, it looks like yes.
They're trying to protect value area low

2784
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:05,360
They're trying to protect value area low
 

2785
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:28,470
They're trying to protect value area low
on the day.

2786
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:28,480

 

2787
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:33,910

Some passive buying down here.

2788
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:33,920

 

2789
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,070

Some divergence on CBD starting to show

2790
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:36,080
Some divergence on CBD starting to show
 

2791
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,750
Some divergence on CBD starting to show
up. There's definitely a bit of passive

2792
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:37,760
up. There's definitely a bit of passive
 

2793
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,830
up. There's definitely a bit of passive
buying down here. I'd rather just they

2794
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:39,840
buying down here. I'd rather just they
 

2795
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,350
buying down here. I'd rather just they
just get a move on and flush it all out

2796
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:41,360
just get a move on and flush it all out
 

2797
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:57,669
just get a move on and flush it all out
in a hurry. We can do something. So,

2798
01:10:57,669 --> 01:10:57,679

 

2799
01:10:57,679 --> 01:10:59,910

back to the 90s again. Back to value

2800
01:10:59,910 --> 01:10:59,920
back to the 90s again. Back to value
 

2801
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,390
back to the 90s again. Back to value
area low on the session again.

2802
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:02,400
area low on the session again.
 

2803
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,870
area low on the session again.
Still unfinished business below for the

2804
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:04,880
Still unfinished business below for the
 

2805
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:11,830
Still unfinished business below for the
Q's but not for the ES.

2806
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:11,840

 

2807
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,470

So they started selling into 92 on that

2808
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:14,480
So they started selling into 92 on that
 

2809
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,950
So they started selling into 92 on that
way down. The next block above that is

2810
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:16,960
way down. The next block above that is
 

2811
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,709
way down. The next block above that is
at I mean it's not very far. It's at

2812
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:18,719
at I mean it's not very far. It's at
 

2813
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:21,270
at I mean it's not very far. It's at
601, right?

2814
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:21,280
601, right?
 

2815
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,470
601, right?
And point of control is at 606. So I'd

2816
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:24,480
And point of control is at 606. So I'd
 

2817
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:29,350
And point of control is at 606. So I'd
say

2818
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:29,360

 

2819
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,189

Yeah,

2820
01:11:31,189 --> 01:11:31,199
Yeah,
 

2821
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:33,830
Yeah,
this node here is where they sold 92 is

2822
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:33,840
this node here is where they sold 92 is
 

2823
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,310
this node here is where they sold 92 is
right here. Flow zone still downside.

2824
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:38,320
right here. Flow zone still downside.
 

2825
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:45,750
right here. Flow zone still downside.
Still unfinished business lower.

2826
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:45,760

 

2827
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,990

How much does London high London Asia

2828
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:50,000
How much does London high London Asia
 

2829
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,990
How much does London high London Asia
high and low play into your analysis? I

2830
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:52,000
high and low play into your analysis? I
 

2831
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,510
high and low play into your analysis? I
mean, I do care about Here we go. So,

2832
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:53,520
mean, I do care about Here we go. So,
 

2833
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,830
mean, I do care about Here we go. So,
they're going to lift this now

2834
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:55,840
they're going to lift this now
 

2835
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,430
they're going to lift this now
off that blue box. Like I said, we had

2836
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:57,440
off that blue box. Like I said, we had
 

2837
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,950
off that blue box. Like I said, we had
passive buyers down there. You could see

2838
01:11:58,950 --> 01:11:58,960
passive buyers down there. You could see
 

2839
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,350
passive buyers down there. You could see
it on the CBD. We're going into these

2840
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:01,360
it on the CBD. We're going into these
 

2841
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,070
it on the CBD. We're going into these
92s to 94s now. And if they lift this,

2842
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:04,080
92s to 94s now. And if they lift this,
 

2843
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,350
92s to 94s now. And if they lift this,
we're going to go up to the point of

2844
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:05,360
we're going to go up to the point of
 

2845
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,189
we're going to go up to the point of
control. And they're just going to keep

2846
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:07,199
control. And they're just going to keep
 

2847
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,590
control. And they're just going to keep
rotating and churning until someone gets

2848
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:09,600
rotating and churning until someone gets
 

2849
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,950
rotating and churning until someone gets
aggressive. And we're just not seeing

2850
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:10,960
aggressive. And we're just not seeing
 

2851
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,070
aggressive. And we're just not seeing
that at the moment. Uh how much does it

2852
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:14,080
that at the moment. Uh how much does it
 

2853
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,590
that at the moment. Uh how much does it
affect my analysis? I mean, it does

2854
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:15,600
affect my analysis? I mean, it does
 

2855
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,550
affect my analysis? I mean, it does
affect it, but uh I don't believe we

2856
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:18,560
affect it, but uh I don't believe we
 

2857
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,950
affect it, but uh I don't believe we
always need to to sweep all the levels,

2858
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:20,960
always need to to sweep all the levels,
 

2859
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,790
always need to to sweep all the levels,
but I do care about GlobeEx. I don't

2860
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:22,800
but I do care about GlobeEx. I don't
 

2861
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,470
but I do care about GlobeEx. I don't
care as much about GloEx as I do New

2862
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:24,480
care as much about GloEx as I do New
 

2863
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,910
care as much about GloEx as I do New
York because I care about the volume in

2864
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:25,920
York because I care about the volume in
 

2865
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,990
York because I care about the volume in
New York. But I do care where

2866
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:28,000
New York. But I do care where
 

2867
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,229
New York. But I do care where
participation happened. Like we for

2868
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:30,239
participation happened. Like we for
 

2869
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:35,270
participation happened. Like we for
example in in London when we broke down

2870
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:35,280
example in in London when we broke down
 

2871
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,870
example in in London when we broke down
under that low. All right. What we

2872
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:36,880
under that low. All right. What we
 

2873
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,189
under that low. All right. What we
actually traded into was the high volume

2874
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:39,199
actually traded into was the high volume
 

2875
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:42,470
actually traded into was the high volume
node back from Monday the 15th of

2876
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:42,480
node back from Monday the 15th of
 

2877
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,149
node back from Monday the 15th of
December and we didn't find acceptance

2878
01:12:44,149 --> 01:12:44,159
December and we didn't find acceptance
 

2879
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,709
December and we didn't find acceptance
underneath it. So

2880
01:12:46,709 --> 01:12:46,719
underneath it. So
 

2881
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:48,630
underneath it. So
this here

2882
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:48,640
this here
 

2883
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,870
this here
right this blue box is a is a high

2884
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:50,880
right this blue box is a is a high
 

2885
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,430
right this blue box is a is a high
volume node from 15th of December. You

2886
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:53,440
volume node from 15th of December. You
 

2887
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,709
volume node from 15th of December. You
can see we don't find acceptance

2888
01:12:54,709 --> 01:12:54,719
can see we don't find acceptance
 

2889
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:56,630
can see we don't find acceptance
underneath it and we rebid off it. So

2890
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:56,640
underneath it and we rebid off it. So
 

2891
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,189
underneath it and we rebid off it. So
this is still an important level for me

2892
01:12:59,189 --> 01:12:59,199
this is still an important level for me
 

2893
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:01,510
this is still an important level for me
right because this is low well this is

2894
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:01,520
right because this is low well this is
 

2895
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,590
right because this is low well this is
low volume. This is what should we call

2896
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:03,600
low volume. This is what should we call
 

2897
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,669
low volume. This is what should we call
it [\h__\h] low volume right? So I do

2898
01:13:07,669 --> 01:13:07,679
it [\h__\h] low volume right? So I do
 

2899
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,149
it [\h__\h] low volume right? So I do
care about the levels and how we act at

2900
01:13:10,149 --> 01:13:10,159
care about the levels and how we act at
 

2901
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:15,189
care about the levels and how we act at
them. We know buyers showed up here.

2902
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:15,199

 

2903
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:17,030

Um, if we get acceptance beneath that,

2904
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:17,040
Um, if we get acceptance beneath that,
 

2905
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:21,030
Um, if we get acceptance beneath that,
then this is actually the uh

2906
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:21,040
then this is actually the uh
 

2907
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,149
then this is actually the uh
value area high from that week. These

2908
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:24,159
value area high from that week. These
 

2909
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:25,590
value area high from that week. These
are all the same levels from the weekly

2910
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:25,600
are all the same levels from the weekly
 

2911
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:32,870
are all the same levels from the weekly
newsletter, right? Nothing's changed.

2912
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:32,880

 

2913
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,709

Later, can we go over CBD? Yeah, we can

2914
01:13:34,709 --> 01:13:34,719
Later, can we go over CBD? Yeah, we can
 

2915
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,630
Later, can we go over CBD? Yeah, we can
go over CBD.

2916
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:36,640
go over CBD.
 

2917
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:42,470
go over CBD.
>> No worries.

2918
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:42,480

 

2919
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,430

595 is a 20-day. Yeah. I mean, that's

2920
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:45,440
595 is a 20-day. Yeah. I mean, that's
 

2921
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,830
595 is a 20-day. Yeah. I mean, that's
that's it, mate. We're just at mean

2922
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:47,840
that's it, mate. We're just at mean
 

2923
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,669
that's it, mate. We're just at mean
reversion. Like, if we go to a daily,

2924
01:13:49,669 --> 01:13:49,679
reversion. Like, if we go to a daily,
 

2925
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:50,950
reversion. Like, if we go to a daily,
we're at mean reversion. All right.

2926
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:50,960
we're at mean reversion. All right.
 

2927
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,750
we're at mean reversion. All right.
We're starting to bid with these sellers

2928
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:53,760
We're starting to bid with these sellers
 

2929
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,910
We're starting to bid with these sellers
keep coming in now under 86s and getting

2930
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:55,920
keep coming in now under 86s and getting
 

2931
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,830
keep coming in now under 86s and getting
stuck. We're back inside. So, we're

2932
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:57,840
stuck. We're back inside. So, we're
 

2933
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,229
stuck. We're back inside. So, we're
leaving sellers under 86s stuck right

2934
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:00,239
leaving sellers under 86s stuck right
 

2935
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:04,550
leaving sellers under 86s stuck right
now. Right. Under 86s. Oh my god. They

2936
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:04,560
now. Right. Under 86s. Oh my god. They
 

2937
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,750
now. Right. Under 86s. Oh my god. They
keep being aggressive under here and

2938
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:05,760
keep being aggressive under here and
 

2939
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,110
keep being aggressive under here and
they're getting caught. This is

2940
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:07,120
they're getting caught. This is
 

2941
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,350
they're getting caught. This is
compression. This level still matters.

2942
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:09,360
compression. This level still matters.
 

2943
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,030
compression. This level still matters.
Sellers need to defend this level. If

2944
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:11,040
Sellers need to defend this level. If
 

2945
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,470
Sellers need to defend this level. If
they don't, the squeeze happens. If they

2946
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:12,480
they don't, the squeeze happens. If they
 

2947
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,470
they don't, the squeeze happens. If they
defend it, we can keep moving lower. But

2948
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:14,480
defend it, we can keep moving lower. But
 

2949
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,350
defend it, we can keep moving lower. But
uh I will tell you now from 86 to 83,

2950
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:17,360
uh I will tell you now from 86 to 83,
 

2951
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,510
uh I will tell you now from 86 to 83,
it's tiny range, but that's where big

2952
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:19,520
it's tiny range, but that's where big
 

2953
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,030
it's tiny range, but that's where big
big selling stepped in. And we're not

2954
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:21,040
big selling stepped in. And we're not
 

2955
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,830
big selling stepped in. And we're not
trading under that yet. The range is so

2956
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:23,840
trading under that yet. The range is so
 

2957
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,830
trading under that yet. The range is so
small, guys. You you have to understand

2958
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:25,840
small, guys. You you have to understand
 

2959
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,910
small, guys. You you have to understand
what I'm looking at here. Like I'm

2960
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:27,920
what I'm looking at here. Like I'm
 

2961
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,950
what I'm looking at here. Like I'm
looking at this pathetic amount here,

2962
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:30,960
looking at this pathetic amount here,
 

2963
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,110
looking at this pathetic amount here,
right? Like these guys are currently

2964
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:33,120
right? Like these guys are currently
 

2965
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,470
right? Like these guys are currently
caught. If we let them out, this is

2966
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:36,480
caught. If we let them out, this is
 

2967
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,229
caught. If we let them out, this is
possible. If we keep them caught, we've

2968
01:14:38,229 --> 01:14:38,239
possible. If we keep them caught, we've
 

2969
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:40,550
possible. If we keep them caught, we've
got imbalances up here to come and fill.

2970
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:40,560
got imbalances up here to come and fill.
 

2971
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,750
got imbalances up here to come and fill.
But this is like, look, you're talking

2972
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:41,760
But this is like, look, you're talking
 

2973
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,910
But this is like, look, you're talking
about like 10 points. This is why I'm

2974
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:43,920
about like 10 points. This is why I'm
 

2975
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:47,669
about like 10 points. This is why I'm
not overly interested right now.

2976
01:14:47,669 --> 01:14:47,679
not overly interested right now.
 

2977
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,510
not overly interested right now.
But if we lift through all of this and

2978
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:49,520
But if we lift through all of this and
 

2979
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,430
But if we lift through all of this and
we run all these stops, then you know,

2980
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:51,440
we run all these stops, then you know,
 

2981
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,189
we run all these stops, then you know,
maybe there's a 30 point trade to be

2982
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:53,199
maybe there's a 30 point trade to be
 

2983
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:55,189
maybe there's a 30 point trade to be
had. All right, here we go. PC like we

2984
01:14:55,189 --> 01:14:55,199
had. All right, here we go. PC like we
 

2985
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:59,430
had. All right, here we go. PC like we
talked about.

2986
01:14:59,430 --> 01:14:59,440

 

2987
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,070

Remember, ES did sweep Globeex. ES has

2988
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:02,080
Remember, ES did sweep Globeex. ES has
 

2989
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,950
Remember, ES did sweep Globeex. ES has
taken it. Here comes point of control

2990
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:04,960
taken it. Here comes point of control
 

2991
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,950
taken it. Here comes point of control
and previous week low and do we find

2992
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:06,960
and previous week low and do we find
 

2993
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,709
and previous week low and do we find
acceptance above this? Now if we find

2994
01:15:08,709 --> 01:15:08,719
acceptance above this? Now if we find
 

2995
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:10,870
acceptance above this? Now if we find
acceptance above this then we can look

2996
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:10,880
acceptance above this then we can look
 

2997
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:16,790
acceptance above this then we can look
for a move up to 30s.

2998
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:16,800

 

2999
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,270

I would say this is uh very much a see

3000
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:19,280
I would say this is uh very much a see
 

3001
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,430
I would say this is uh very much a see
money take money environment folks. So

3002
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:21,440
money take money environment folks. So
 

3003
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,870
money take money environment folks. So
let's see if we can uh find acceptance

3004
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:24,880
let's see if we can uh find acceptance
 

3005
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:30,790
let's see if we can uh find acceptance
or bears defend this P here.

3006
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:30,800

 

3007
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,310

If we can get through PC, I think

3008
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:32,320
If we can get through PC, I think
 

3009
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:37,030
If we can get through PC, I think
there's a move up to 30.

3010
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:37,040

 

3011
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:45,110

We need to get above and base though.

3012
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:45,120

 

3013
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,310

PC back tests. They've left imbalances

3014
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:48,320
PC back tests. They've left imbalances
 

3015
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,630
PC back tests. They've left imbalances
all the way down to 93 cuz we're very

3016
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:50,640
all the way down to 93 cuz we're very
 

3017
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,229
all the way down to 93 cuz we're very
thin.

3018
01:15:52,229 --> 01:15:52,239
thin.
 

3019
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:54,790
thin.
There we go.

3020
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:54,800
There we go.
 

3021
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,070
There we go.
That's the problem with it being so

3022
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:56,080
That's the problem with it being so
 

3023
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,350
That's the problem with it being so
thin.

3024
01:15:59,350 --> 01:15:59,360

 

3025
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,350

down to 93s. We probably go here for a

3026
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:01,360
down to 93s. We probably go here for a
 

3027
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,390
down to 93s. We probably go here for a
back test into these imbalances. So, one

3028
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:04,400
back test into these imbalances. So, one
 

3029
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,350
back test into these imbalances. So, one
imbalance is uh 600 to 97. The second

3030
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:07,360
imbalance is uh 600 to 97. The second
 

3031
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:12,229
imbalance is uh 600 to 97. The second
imbalance is 95 to 93s.

3032
01:16:12,229 --> 01:16:12,239

 

3033
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:13,750

So, do they fill those? And if they

3034
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:13,760
So, do they fill those? And if they
 

3035
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,270
So, do they fill those? And if they
flash back through those back to value

3036
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:15,280
flash back through those back to value
 

3037
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,149
flash back through those back to value
area low, they will need to bid off you.

3038
01:16:18,149 --> 01:16:18,159
area low, they will need to bid off you.
 

3039
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:20,149
area low, they will need to bid off you.
Bulls will need to defend 86 if they're

3040
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:20,159
Bulls will need to defend 86 if they're
 

3041
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:21,750
Bulls will need to defend 86 if they're
going to rotate. Even if you're a

01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:21,760
going to rotate. Even if you're a

rotational bull, even if you're just

rotational bull, even if you're just
 

3045
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,270
rotational bull, even if you're just
looking for rotations, you do not do not

01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:25,280
looking for rotations, you do not do not

Look how dark the look map is. There's

3050
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:29,520
Look how dark the look map is. There's
 

3051
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:38,550
Look how dark the look map is. There's
just nothing happening here.

3052

3053
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,350

I just don't want to be overly uh biased

01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:41,360
I just don't want to be overly uh biased
 

3055
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:50,870
I just don't want to be overly uh biased
in this market.

3057
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,870

Save gray box, right? They're defending

Save gray box, right? They're defending
 

3059

Balls want to defend here.
This is the rotation,

01:16:59,750 --> 01:16:59,760
This is the rotation,
 

3065
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,990
This is the rotation,
right? Bears win this, they flush. Bulls

So, either acceptance above, hold below,

3074
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:12,480
So, either acceptance above, hold below,
 

3075
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:25,990
So, either acceptance above, hold below,
or acceptance below.

3077
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,830

In normal market conditions, is it

3078
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:27,840
In normal market conditions, is it
 

3079
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,229
In normal market conditions, is it
possible to predict move up or down New

3080
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:30,239
possible to predict move up or down New

01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,149

point at New York open? No, I don't

3086
01:17:38,149 --> 01:17:38,159
point at New York open? No, I don't
 

3087
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:40,070
point at New York open? No, I don't
think necessarily at the open. What

3088
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:40,080
think necessarily at the open. What
 

3089
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,870
think necessarily at the open. What
matters at the open really is you've got

3090
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:42,880
matters at the open really is you've got
 

3091
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,270
matters at the open really is you've got
to understand that

3092
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:45,280
to understand that
 

3093
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:48,550
to understand that
uh big institutions are not paid to run

3094
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:48,560
uh big institutions are not paid to run
 

3095
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,790
uh big institutions are not paid to run
out that any liquidity created. That's

3096
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:50,800
out that any liquidity created. That's
 

3097
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,669
out that any liquidity created. That's
just a a bonus. Big institutions will be

3098
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:53,679
just a a bonus. Big institutions will be
 

3099
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:55,590
just a a bonus. Big institutions will be
told their positions. They're quite

3100
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:55,600
told their positions. They're quite
 

3101
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,630
told their positions. They're quite
literally told you need to buy

3102
01:17:58,630 --> 01:17:58,640
literally told you need to buy
 

3103
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:04,149
literally told you need to buy
5 million of Apple today uh at an

3104
01:18:04,149 --> 01:18:04,159
5 million of Apple today uh at an
 

3105
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,149
5 million of Apple today uh at an
average price of this and you will get a

3106
01:18:06,149 --> 01:18:06,159
average price of this and you will get a
 

3107
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:08,790
average price of this and you will get a
bonus if you can buy at an average price

3108
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:08,800
bonus if you can buy at an average price
 

3109
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,950
bonus if you can buy at an average price
under this or under VWAP etc etc. So

3110
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:12,960
under this or under VWAP etc etc. So
 

3111
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,350
under this or under VWAP etc etc. So
sometimes that's why market on close and

3112
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:15,360
sometimes that's why market on close and
 

3113
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,990
sometimes that's why market on close and
market on open imbalances matter because

3114
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:18,000
market on open imbalances matter because
 

3115
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,470
market on open imbalances matter because
they're trying to rifle through you know

3116
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:20,480
they're trying to rifle through you know
 

3117
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,070
they're trying to rifle through you know
billions and billions of dollars worth

3118
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:22,080
billions and billions of dollars worth
 

3119
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,510
billions and billions of dollars worth
and and that's the same at the open.

3120
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:23,520
and and that's the same at the open.
 

3121
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,189
and and that's the same at the open.
They use that liquidity to just get in

3122
01:18:25,189 --> 01:18:25,199
They use that liquidity to just get in
 

3123
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:28,790
They use that liquidity to just get in
and out the market quickly.

3124
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:28,800
and out the market quickly.
 

3125
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,030
and out the market quickly.
So the first half an hour to hour is

3126
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:31,040
So the first half an hour to hour is
 

3127
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:34,070
So the first half an hour to hour is
sort of important for them to get

3128
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:34,080
sort of important for them to get
 

3129
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,750
sort of important for them to get
through their orders while there's

3130
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:35,760
through their orders while there's
 

3131
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,430
through their orders while there's
liquidity for them to have the ability

3132
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:37,440
liquidity for them to have the ability
 

3133
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:41,110
liquidity for them to have the ability
to do that.

3134
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:41,120

 

3135
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,669

Yeah, exactly, TJ. So, where bookmap is

3136
01:18:43,669 --> 01:18:43,679
Yeah, exactly, TJ. So, where bookmap is
 

3137
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:45,910
Yeah, exactly, TJ. So, where bookmap is
dark, there's just no one on the book.

3138
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:45,920
dark, there's just no one on the book.
 

3139
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,350
dark, there's just no one on the book.
Literally, there's just no players there

3140
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:47,360
Literally, there's just no players there
 

3141
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,189
Literally, there's just no players there
or no players of any significance.

3142
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:49,199
or no players of any significance.
 

3143
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:51,669
or no players of any significance.
Right, back to Vpo again. So, let's see.

3144
01:18:51,669 --> 01:18:51,679
Right, back to Vpo again. So, let's see.
 

3145
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:54,070
Right, back to Vpo again. So, let's see.
Now, this is the second attempt. We did

3146
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:54,080
Now, this is the second attempt. We did
 

3147
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,590
Now, this is the second attempt. We did
just hold like we talked about. All

3148
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:55,600
just hold like we talked about. All
 

3149
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,870
just hold like we talked about. All
right, we didn't come all the way down

3150
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:56,880
right, we didn't come all the way down
 

3151
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,470
right, we didn't come all the way down
here. We held those imbalances that I

3152
01:18:58,470 --> 01:18:58,480
here. We held those imbalances that I
 

3153
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,110
here. We held those imbalances that I
gave you and we're back to Vo again. I'm

3154
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:01,120
gave you and we're back to Vo again. I'm
 

3155
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,189
gave you and we're back to Vo again. I'm
waiting to see if we can find acceptance

3156
01:19:03,189 --> 01:19:03,199
waiting to see if we can find acceptance
 

3157
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:05,430
waiting to see if we can find acceptance
above gray box. All right, above gray

3158
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:05,440
above gray box. All right, above gray
 

3159
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,030
above gray box. All right, above gray
box. Otherwise, they can keep defending

3160
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:07,040
box. Otherwise, they can keep defending
 

3161
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:07,830
box. Otherwise, they can keep defending
it.

3162
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:07,840
it.
 

3163
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,790
it.
There's just no uh size here. You're

3164
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:10,800
There's just no uh size here. You're
 

3165
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,430
There's just no uh size here. You're
talking about tiny little rotations. You

3166
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:13,440
talking about tiny little rotations. You
 

3167
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:14,790
talking about tiny little rotations. You
know, it's only going to take one player

3168
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:14,800
know, it's only going to take one player
 

3169
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,870
know, it's only going to take one player
to come in and just be like, I'm in. And

3170
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:16,880
to come in and just be like, I'm in. And
 

3171
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,030
to come in and just be like, I'm in. And
this thing will go 30 points and it will

3172
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:19,040
this thing will go 30 points and it will
 

3173
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,709
this thing will go 30 points and it will
feel like 300 points because we barely

3174
01:19:20,709 --> 01:19:20,719
feel like 300 points because we barely
 

3175
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:23,430
feel like 300 points because we barely
move.

3176
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:23,440
move.
 

3177
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,030
move.
Yes. Thank you, Miguel. Initial balance

3178
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:25,040
Yes. Thank you, Miguel. Initial balance
 

3179
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,870
Yes. Thank you, Miguel. Initial balance

3180
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:26,880
now set.
 

3181
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:38,390
now set.
Thank you. Thank you, mate.

3182
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:38,400

 

3183
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,910

I don't think it's even bulls are weak

3184
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:39,920
I don't think it's even bulls are weak
 

3185
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,550
I don't think it's even bulls are weak
as hell. I just think the market's just

3186
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:42,560
as hell. I just think the market's just
 

3187
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,430
as hell. I just think the market's just
slow. You got to remember like

3188
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:45,440
slow. You got to remember like
 

3189
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,189
slow. You got to remember like
we've done we've done the moves this

3190
01:19:47,189 --> 01:19:47,199
we've done we've done the moves this
 

3191
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,229
we've done we've done the moves this
year. Done the moves this year, right?

3192
01:19:50,229 --> 01:19:50,239
year. Done the moves this year, right?
 

3193
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:55,270
year. Done the moves this year, right?
It's still early. We're only an hour in.

3194
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:55,280
It's still early. We're only an hour in.
 

3195
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,510
It's still early. We're only an hour in.

3199
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,709
boss. Been following your channel for a
couple weeks now and I've learned so

3205
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,229

So, just testing this gray box over and

3206
01:20:10,229 --> 01:20:10,239
So, just testing this gray box over and
 

3207
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,390
So, just testing this gray box over and
over and over and over and over again

3208
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:12,400
over and over and over and over again
 

3209
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:18,470
over and over and over and over again
right now.

3210
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:18,480

 

3211
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,790

That's awesome, Green. Glad you're

3212
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:20,800
That's awesome, Green. Glad you're
 

3213
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:24,790
That's awesome, Green. Glad you're
enjoying it.

3214
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:24,800

 

3215
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,790

Okay, so maybe the test value area low

3216
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:26,800
Okay, so maybe the test value area low
 

3217
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,470
Okay, so maybe the test value area low
again. No imbalances left lower now.

3218
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:28,480
again. No imbalances left lower now.
 

3219
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,430
again. No imbalances left lower now.
would build the board already. So, it's

3220
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:31,440
would build the board already. So, it's
 

3221
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:49,510
would build the board already. So, it's
85s maybe for a retest.

3222
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:49,520

 

3223
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,870

Think the market is going to go all the

3224
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:50,880
Think the market is going to go all the
 

3225
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,550
Think the market is going to go all the
way down and eventually recover in the

3226
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:52,560
way down and eventually recover in the
 

3227
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:56,070
way down and eventually recover in the
new year? All the way down to where?

3228
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:56,080
new year? All the way down to where?
 

3229
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,030
new year? All the way down to where?
Where do you think it's going to go all

3230
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:57,040
Where do you think it's going to go all
 

3231
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,790
Where do you think it's going to go all
the way down to? I don't I don't have

3232
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:00,800
the way down to? I don't I don't have
 

3233
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,630
the way down to? I don't I don't have
too much of a bias right now just

3234
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:02,640
too much of a bias right now just
 

3235
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,470
too much of a bias right now just
because of on a daily of where we are,

3236
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:04,480
because of on a daily of where we are,
 

3237
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,709
because of on a daily of where we are,
right? We're we're we're right at the

3238
01:21:06,709 --> 01:21:06,719
right? We're we're we're right at the
 

3239
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:09,189
right? We're we're we're right at the
mean. Ballinger bands are starting to

3240
01:21:09,189 --> 01:21:09,199
mean. Ballinger bands are starting to
 

3241
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:12,229
mean. Ballinger bands are starting to
contract. We can produce a higher low or

3242
01:21:12,229 --> 01:21:12,239
contract. We can produce a higher low or
 

3243
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:14,229
contract. We can produce a higher low or
one more shove higher. If they want to

3244
01:21:14,229 --> 01:21:14,239
one more shove higher. If they want to
 

3245
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:16,870
one more shove higher. If they want to
absolutely, you know, destroy everyone.

3246
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:16,880
absolutely, you know, destroy everyone.
 

3247
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,189
absolutely, you know, destroy everyone.
If everyone's everyone's bearish bias

3248
01:21:19,189 --> 01:21:19,199
If everyone's everyone's bearish bias
 

3249
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:20,790
If everyone's everyone's bearish bias
based on macro environment and they want

3250
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:20,800
based on macro environment and they want
 

3251
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,669
based on macro environment and they want
to be nasty, they will. Um, do I think

3252
01:21:23,669 --> 01:21:23,679
to be nasty, they will. Um, do I think
 

3253
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:25,590
to be nasty, they will. Um, do I think
the state of the economy is good? No, I

3254
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:25,600
the state of the economy is good? No, I
 

3255
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,430
the state of the economy is good? No, I
don't. Do I think that always matters in

3256
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:27,440
don't. Do I think that always matters in
 

3257
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,110
don't. Do I think that always matters in
the market? No, I don't. Even if you

3258
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:29,120
the market? No, I don't. Even if you
 

3259
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:32,550
the market? No, I don't. Even if you
think even if you believe that we are

3260
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:32,560
think even if you believe that we are
 

3261
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:36,709
think even if you believe that we are
early stage of, you know, 2008 kind of

3262
01:21:36,709 --> 01:21:36,719
early stage of, you know, 2008 kind of
 

3263
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:38,310
early stage of, you know, 2008 kind of
scenario, I don't think we have quite

3264
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:38,320
scenario, I don't think we have quite
 

3265
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,830
scenario, I don't think we have quite
the same issues. But if we're going to

3266
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:39,840
the same issues. But if we're going to
 

3267
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,229
the same issues. But if we're going to
go into liquidity crisis this year, uh

3268
01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:42,239
go into liquidity crisis this year, uh
 

3269
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:45,030
go into liquidity crisis this year, uh
it can take a long time to pan out. All

3270
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:45,040
it can take a long time to pan out. All
 

3271
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,470
it can take a long time to pan out. All
right? You're going to need data to back

3272
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:46,480
right? You're going to need data to back
 

3273
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:47,990
right? You're going to need data to back
it. You're going to need panic to set

3274
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:48,000
it. You're going to need panic to set
 

3275
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,270
it. You're going to need panic to set
in. Um you'd be surprised how long

3276
01:21:51,270 --> 01:21:51,280
in. Um you'd be surprised how long
 

3277
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,870
in. Um you'd be surprised how long
markets can just hold up and drift

3278
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:52,880
markets can just hold up and drift
 

3279
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,350
markets can just hold up and drift
around. No one really wants, you got to

3280
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:55,360
around. No one really wants, you got to
 

3281
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,709
around. No one really wants, you got to
remember, no one really wants to see

3282
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:56,719
remember, no one really wants to see
 

3283
01:21:56,719 --> 01:21:58,790
remember, no one really wants to see
that move. No one really wants to see

3284
01:21:58,790 --> 01:21:58,800
that move. No one really wants to see
 

3285
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,830
that move. No one really wants to see
that move. So, if they can avoid that,

3286
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:01,840
that move. So, if they can avoid that,
 

3287
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,189
that move. So, if they can avoid that,
they will. I mean, everyone talked about

3288
01:22:03,189 --> 01:22:03,199
they will. I mean, everyone talked about
 

3289
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:06,629
they will. I mean, everyone talked about
that happening when uh Japan put the

3290
01:22:06,629 --> 01:22:06,639
that happening when uh Japan put the
 

3291
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:07,830
that happening when uh Japan put the
rates up, and I said, you know, it's

3292
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:07,840
rates up, and I said, you know, it's
 

3293
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,310
rates up, and I said, you know, it's
probably priced in because we already

3294
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:10,320
probably priced in because we already
 

3295
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,790
probably priced in because we already
know. We've known about it for weeks,

3296
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:12,800
know. We've known about it for weeks,
 

3297
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,189
know. We've known about it for weeks,
and this is the thing. But what really

3298
01:22:15,189 --> 01:22:15,199
and this is the thing. But what really
 

3299
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:16,790
and this is the thing. But what really
shakes and moves the market is when

3300
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:16,800
shakes and moves the market is when
 

3301
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,030
shakes and moves the market is when
something isn't priced in. If you want

3302
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:19,040
something isn't priced in. If you want
 

3303
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,550
something isn't priced in. If you want
my opinion, I think we end up doing

3304
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:20,560
my opinion, I think we end up doing
 

3305
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,149
my opinion, I think we end up doing
three rate cuts next year. I don't think

3306
01:22:22,149 --> 01:22:22,159
three rate cuts next year. I don't think
 

3307
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:24,470
three rate cuts next year. I don't think
we do one. I think we do three. Why?

3308
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:24,480
we do one. I think we do three. Why?
 

3309
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,070
we do one. I think we do three. Why?
Because I think the data will actually

3310
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:26,080
Because I think the data will actually
 

3311
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,870
Because I think the data will actually
come out saying that this market's weak,

3312
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:28,880
come out saying that this market's weak,
 

3313
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,470
come out saying that this market's weak,
right? Lack of job creation. Job

3314
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:30,480
right? Lack of job creation. Job
 

3315
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,030
right? Lack of job creation. Job
creation that is or companies that are

3316
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:33,040
creation that is or companies that are
 

3317
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,110
creation that is or companies that are
doing well have no job creation. They're

3318
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:35,120
doing well have no job creation. They're
 

3319
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,189
doing well have no job creation. They're
not hiring. They're on hiring freezes.

3320
01:22:37,189 --> 01:22:37,199
not hiring. They're on hiring freezes.
 

3321
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:38,870
not hiring. They're on hiring freezes.
They're actually lowering their labor

3322
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:38,880
They're actually lowering their labor
 

3323
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,870
They're actually lowering their labor
workforce. Uh and they're pivoting to

3324
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:40,880
workforce. Uh and they're pivoting to
 

3325
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,709
workforce. Uh and they're pivoting to
AI. So everything's pivoting that way.

3326
01:22:42,709 --> 01:22:42,719
AI. So everything's pivoting that way.
 

3327
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:43,910
AI. So everything's pivoting that way.
That means you've got less consumer

3328
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:43,920
That means you've got less consumer
 

3329
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,550
That means you've got less consumer
spending which affects retail and

3330
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:46,560
spending which affects retail and
 

3331
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:49,189
spending which affects retail and
commercial more. Um, you've got, like

3332
01:22:49,189 --> 01:22:49,199
commercial more. Um, you've got, like
 

3333
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:52,790
commercial more. Um, you've got, like
I've talked about many times, uh,

3334
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:52,800
I've talked about many times, uh,
 

3335
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,030
I've talked about many times, uh,
uh, more delinquencies, more small and

3336
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:55,040
uh, more delinquencies, more small and
 

3337
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,189
uh, more delinquencies, more small and
medium businesses shutting down, uh,

3338
01:22:57,189 --> 01:22:57,199
medium businesses shutting down, uh,
 

3339
01:22:57,199 --> 01:23:00,070
medium businesses shutting down, uh,
more repossessions of, uh, cars month on

3340
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:00,080
more repossessions of, uh, cars month on
 

3341
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,750
more repossessions of, uh, cars month on
month for the last four months now.

3342
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:01,760
month for the last four months now.
 

3343
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,669
month for the last four months now.
Unemployment up since January, so 12

3344
01:23:03,669 --> 01:23:03,679
Unemployment up since January, so 12
 

3345
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:06,310
Unemployment up since January, so 12
month uptick on unemployment, and I

3346
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:06,320
month uptick on unemployment, and I
 

3347
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,070
month uptick on unemployment, and I
think, uh, you'll probably see the repo

3348
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:08,080
think, uh, you'll probably see the repo
 

3349
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,910
think, uh, you'll probably see the repo
start to happen in the housing market as

3350
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:09,920
start to happen in the housing market as
 

3351
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,229
start to happen in the housing market as
well. So, I think that all combined will

3352
01:23:12,229 --> 01:23:12,239
well. So, I think that all combined will
 

3353
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:15,590
well. So, I think that all combined will
lead lead to the Fed to a big pivot and

3354
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:15,600
lead lead to the Fed to a big pivot and
 

3355
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,189
lead lead to the Fed to a big pivot and
starting to do mass cuts. The question

3356
01:23:17,189 --> 01:23:17,199
starting to do mass cuts. The question
 

3357
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:19,830
starting to do mass cuts. The question
is, do we sell versus those mass mass

3358
01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:19,840
is, do we sell versus those mass mass
 

3359
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:33,910
is, do we sell versus those mass mass
cuts? That's kind of what I think.

3360
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:33,920

 

3361
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,910

Payout approved. Good man. Good man.

01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:43,760

 

3365

RIP's made 395,000 today. probably

3366
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:46,480
RIP's made 395,000 today. probably
 

3367
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,550
RIP's made 395,000 today. probably
trading silver, I'd imagine if he was uh

3368
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:48,560
trading silver, I'd imagine if he was uh
 

3369
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:55,430
trading silver, I'd imagine if he was uh
trading with that much size.

3370
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:55,440

 

3371
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,590

It's just delta. It's It's just trading

3372
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:57,600
It's just delta. It's It's just trading
 

3373
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,030
It's just delta. It's It's just trading
views delta. This one you mean? It's

3374
01:23:59,030 --> 01:23:59,040

3376
01:24:08,709 --> 01:24:08,719

 

3377
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:11,110

We're sort of just kind of asleep here,

3378
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:11,120
We're sort of just kind of asleep here,
 

3379
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,629
We're sort of just kind of asleep here,
guys, and show you what I'm looking at.

3380
01:24:12,629 --> 01:24:12,639
guys, and show you what I'm looking at.
 

3381
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:14,070
guys, and show you what I'm looking at.
This is where sellers keep trying to

3382
01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:14,080
This is where sellers keep trying to
 

3383
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,910
This is where sellers keep trying to
come in. This is value area low. Sellers

3384
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:15,920
come in. This is value area low. Sellers
 

3385
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,070
come in. This is value area low. Sellers
need to find acceptance underneath this

3386
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:18,080
need to find acceptance underneath this
 

3387
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,350
need to find acceptance underneath this
if we're going to drift into some of

3388
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:19,360
if we're going to drift into some of
 

3389
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,430
if we're going to drift into some of
these pockets down here. Every time we

3390
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:21,440
these pockets down here. Every time we
 

3391
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,510
these pockets down here. Every time we
come down here, we're seeing absorption

3392
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:23,520
come down here, we're seeing absorption
 

3393
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,390
come down here, we're seeing absorption
with very, very low numbers. All right,

3394
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:26,400
with very, very low numbers. All right,
 

3395
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,629
with very, very low numbers. All right,
so it's just a question of can we pivot

3396
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:28,639
so it's just a question of can we pivot
 

3397
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,550
so it's just a question of can we pivot
down and start puking. Every time we

3398
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:30,560
down and start puking. Every time we
 

3399
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:33,430
down and start puking. Every time we
come up to VPO, we keep getting stuck.

3400
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:33,440
come up to VPO, we keep getting stuck.
 

3401
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,550
come up to VPO, we keep getting stuck.
Get rid of this. We don't need this

3402
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:34,560
Get rid of this. We don't need this
 

3403
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,229
Get rid of this. We don't need this
anymore. Right. Every time we come up to

3404
01:24:36,229 --> 01:24:36,239
anymore. Right. Every time we come up to
 

3405
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:37,590
anymore. Right. Every time we come up to
here, we keep getting stuck. You can see

3406
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:37,600
here, we keep getting stuck. You can see
 

3407
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:38,870
here, we keep getting stuck. You can see
buyers have been caught above that. And

3408
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:38,880
buyers have been caught above that. And
 

3409
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,950
buyers have been caught above that. And
then there's a selling block up here.

3410
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:40,960
then there's a selling block up here.
 

3411
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,510
then there's a selling block up here.
This is the 17 to 25s I keep talking

3412
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:43,520
This is the 17 to 25s I keep talking
 

3413
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,709
This is the 17 to 25s I keep talking
about. That's where they're willing to

3414
01:24:44,709 --> 01:24:44,719
about. That's where they're willing to
 

3415
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:47,510
about. That's where they're willing to
be aggressive, right? So there's just

3416
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:47,520
be aggressive, right? So there's just
 

3417
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,110
be aggressive, right? So there's just
you think about value area high is at

3418
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:49,120
you think about value area high is at
 

3419
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:52,310
you think about value area high is at
626 on the session. Value area low is at

3420
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:52,320
626 on the session. Value area low is at
 

3421
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,709
626 on the session. Value area low is at
85. You're talking about a 40 point

3422
01:24:54,709 --> 01:24:54,719
85. You're talking about a 40 point
 

3423
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:57,430
85. You're talking about a 40 point
range day right now. That's what we're

3424
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:57,440
range day right now. That's what we're
 

3425
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,790
range day right now. That's what we're
talking about. So when guys like this

3426
01:24:58,790 --> 01:24:58,800
talking about. So when guys like this
 

3427
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,790
talking about. So when guys like this
guy doesn't trade, I will trade when

3428
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:00,800
guy doesn't trade, I will trade when
 

3429
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,310
guy doesn't trade, I will trade when
there's

3430
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:02,320
there's
 

3431
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,709
there's

3745
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:10,709
what shall I say? It's not turning me
on.

3746
01:34:10,709 --> 01:34:10,719

 

3747
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:12,790

It's cuz the range is so tight. If you

3748
01:34:12,790 --> 01:34:12,800
It's cuz the range is so tight. If you
 

3749
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,430
It's cuz the range is so tight. If you
imagine a normal day where volume's

3750
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:15,440
imagine a normal day where volume's
 

3751
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:16,709
imagine a normal day where volume's
good, right? If we fail to get

3752
01:34:16,709 --> 01:34:16,719
good, right? If we fail to get
 

3753
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:18,629
good, right? If we fail to get
acceptance here and we reclaim and this

3754
01:34:18,629 --> 01:34:18,639
acceptance here and we reclaim and this
 

3755
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:20,310
acceptance here and we reclaim and this
move here, that that might be like a

3756
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:20,320
move here, that that might be like a
 

3757
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,629
move here, that that might be like a
40point move, not a sixpoint move,

3758
01:34:22,629 --> 01:34:22,639
40point move, not a sixpoint move,
 

3759
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:24,470
40point move, not a sixpoint move,
right?

3760
01:34:24,470 --> 01:34:24,480
right?
 

3761
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:25,990
right?

when there's nothing going on, I don't
 

3765
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:30,950
when there's nothing going on, I don't
want to trade for six six points. Some

3766
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:30,960
want to trade for six six points. Some
 

3767
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,550

3889
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,070

3891
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:39,270

01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:39,280
Definitely have to adjust them on
 

3893
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,669
Definitely have to adjust them on

3894
01:37:41,669 --> 01:37:41,679
volatility, right? Because your risk is
 

3895
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:43,830
volatility, right? Because your risk is
going to go up. You can't be risking a

01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:43,840
going to go up. You can't be risking a
 

3897
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,750
going to go up. You can't be risking a
fixed rate. Like if you're normally

01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:45,760
fixed rate. Like if you're normally
 

3899
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:48,629

01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:50,709
risk, I don't know 10 points and we're
in a highly volatile day. If we've got

3902
01:37:50,709 --> 01:37:50,719
in a highly volatile day. If we've got
 

3903
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:53,830
in a highly volatile day. If we've got
VIX at high teens and 20s and we're

3905
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:56,870
VIX at high teens and 20s and we're
doing 200 to 400 point rotations in ENQ,

3906
01:37:56,870 --> 01:37:56,880
doing 200 to 400 point rotations in ENQ,

which it has been doing frequently this
 

3909
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,310
which it has been doing frequently this
year, you can't be risking 10 points.

3910
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:00,320
year, you can't be risking 10 points.
 

3911
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,830
year, you can't be risking 10 points.
You're probably going to need to risk 40

3912
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:01,840
You're probably going to need to risk 40
 

3913
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,109
You're probably going to need to risk 40
or 50 points, which means you're

3914
01:38:03,109 --> 01:38:03,119
or 50 points, which means you're
 

3915
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:06,629
or 50 points, which means you're
probably going to need to size down. Um,

3916
01:38:06,629 --> 01:38:06,639
probably going to need to size down. Um,
 

3917
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:09,830
probably going to need to size down. Um,
but I do like to size up in A+ where

3918
01:38:09,830 --> 01:38:09,840
but I do like to size up in A+ where
 

3919
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,669
but I do like to size up in A+ where
possible. But sometimes that size up

3920
01:38:11,669 --> 01:38:11,679
possible. But sometimes that size up
 

3921
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:13,270
possible. But sometimes that size up
might just mean I have to size down and

3922
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:13,280
might just mean I have to size down and
 

3923
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:25,350
might just mean I have to size down and
I'm holding for the full rotation.

3924
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:25,360

 

3925
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,189

01:38:27,189 --> 01:38:27,199
Multiple rate cuts continues the bull
 

3927
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:30,390
Multiple rate cuts continues the bull
run.

3928
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:30,400

 

3929
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:33,030

I wouldn't be so sure. Historically,

3930
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:33,040
I wouldn't be so sure. Historically,
 

3931
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,669
I wouldn't be so sure. Historically,
yes. Well, actually, no. In a healthy

01:38:35,669 --> 01:38:35,679
yes. Well, actually, no. In a healthy

01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:37,669
yes. Well, actually, no. In a healthy

01:38:43,430 --> 01:38:43,440
other factors. Why? If we do rate cuts,
 

3941
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,870
other factors. Why? If we do rate cuts,
if they're only predicting one and we

end up doing three and there's a panic,

you have to include why. Why that's a

01:38:48,709 --> 01:38:48,719
you have to include why. Why that's a
 

3947
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:50,550
you have to include why. Why that's a
problem. They're trying to stimulate

3948
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:50,560
problem. They're trying to stimulate
 

3949
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:56,629

something which is not moving.

3951
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:58,629

How did you do this year when we just

3952
01:38:58,629 --> 01:38:58,639
How did you do this year when we just
 

3953
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:00,229
How did you do this year when we just
kept hitting alltime highs over and

3954
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:00,239
kept hitting alltime highs over and
 

3955
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:02,310
kept hitting alltime highs over and
over? I seriously struggled during that.

3956
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:02,320
over? I seriously struggled during that.
 

3957
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:03,669

3999
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:44,390
ES is coming down to its 20-day new
lows, but I don't think that means

4000
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:44,400
lows, but I don't think that means
 

4001
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,390
lows, but I don't think that means
it's not necessarily a sign for a long,

4002
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:46,400
it's not necessarily a sign for a long,
 

4003

it's not necessarily a sign for a long,
okay? It just means that the breadth on

4008
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:54,000
hit. That's all it means, right? So, if
 

4009
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,350
hit. That's all it means, right? So, if
you have a look at the market as a whole

you have a look at the market as a whole

As you can see on the top set platform,

4226
01:50:17,350 --> 01:50:17,360
As you can see on the top set platform,
 

4227
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:20,229
As you can see on the top set platform,
uh, yes, they have. The orange line is

Absolutely have. You can quite clearly

Absolutely have. You can quite clearly

01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,229
Absolutely have. You can quite clearly
see they have. So, I'm not sure if you

4237
01:50:28,239 --> 01:50:30,629
see they have. So, I'm not sure if you
have delayed data there, my friend. You

4238
01:50:30,629 --> 01:50:30,639
have delayed data there, my friend. You
 

4239
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:31,830
have delayed data there, my friend. You
might, if you're not paying for Trading

might, if you're not paying for Trading
View or something, you might be 10

4242
01:50:33,109 --> 01:50:33,119
View or something, you might be 10
 

4243
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:35,750

minutes behind or something like that.

Apex or Lucid, which one? Uh,

4246
01:50:39,350 --> 01:50:39,360
Apex or Lucid, which one? Uh,
 

4247
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,669
Apex or Lucid, which one? Uh,
really depends what your uh ambitions

4248
01:50:41,669 --> 01:50:41,679
really depends what your uh ambitions
 

4249
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:45,669
really depends what your uh ambitions
are. I'd say Lucid probably has the best

4250
01:50:45,669 --> 01:50:45,679
are. I'd say Lucid probably has the best
 

4251
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:48,149

4257
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:57,030
passing, in terms of payouts, in terms
of growth. Apex is uh probably better

4258
01:50:57,030 --> 01:50:57,040
of growth. Apex is uh probably better
 

4259
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:58,950
of growth. Apex is uh probably better
for scaling if you know what you're

4260
01:50:58,950 --> 01:50:58,960
for scaling if you know what you're
 

4261
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:01,350
for scaling if you know what you're
doing. I've got a video on it. So, if

4262
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:01,360
doing. I've got a video on it. So, if
 

4263
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:02,790
doing. I've got a video on it. So, if
you're just like brand new to trading

4264
01:51:02,790 --> 01:51:02,800
you're just like brand new to trading
 

4265

4267
01:51:05,119 --> 01:51:07,109
and you just want to like get used to
some software and trading it, I would

4268
01:51:07,109 --> 01:51:07,119
some software and trading it, I would
 

4269
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:08,470
some software and trading it, I would
say if you're not going to trade on SIM,

4270
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:08,480
say if you're not going to trade on SIM,
 

4271
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:09,910
say if you're not going to trade on SIM,
then do Apex because it's only going to

01:51:09,910 --> 01:51:09,920
then do Apex because it's only going to
 

4273
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:13,189
then do Apex because it's only going to
cost you 20 bucks. If you're half decent

cost you 20 bucks. If you're half decent
 

4275

cost you 20 bucks. If you're half decent
at trading and you're starting to like

M andq is is your M andQ different?

4288
01:51:35,510 --> 01:51:35,520
M andq is is your M andQ different?
 

4289
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:37,510
M andq is is your M andQ different?
Maybe maybe you've got a divergence

4290
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:37,520
Maybe maybe you've got a divergence
 

4291
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:40,550
Maybe maybe you've got a divergence
there. No, MQ is also taking the lows.

4292
01:51:40,550 --> 01:51:40,560
there. No, MQ is also taking the lows.
 

4293
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:43,430
there. No, MQ is also taking the lows.
So, I'm not sure my friend what you're

4294
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:43,440
So, I'm not sure my friend what you're
 

4295
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:45,030
So, I'm not sure my friend what you're
looking at, but they both taking them

4296
01:51:45,030 --> 01:51:45,040
looking at, but they both taking them
 

4297
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:49,669
looking at, but they both taking them
out.

4298
01:51:49,669 --> 01:51:49,679

 

4299
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:51,589

Okay. So, this is the area. Now, trend

4300
01:51:51,589 --> 01:51:51,599
Okay. So, this is the area. Now, trend
 

4301
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:54,229
Okay. So, this is the area. Now, trend
versus non-trend will be defined right

4302
01:51:54,229 --> 01:51:54,239
versus non-trend will be defined right
 

4303
01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:57,990
versus non-trend will be defined right
here. All right. trend versus non-trend

4304
01:51:57,990 --> 01:51:58,000
here. All right. trend versus non-trend
 

4305
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,070
here. All right. trend versus non-trend
will be be defined right here. So, it's

4306
01:52:00,070 --> 01:52:00,080
will be be defined right here. So, it's
 

4307
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:05,510
will be be defined right here. So, it's
an area of interest.

4308
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:05,520

 

4309
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,510

How much is it to activate Apex at the

4310
01:52:07,510 --> 01:52:07,520
How much is it to activate Apex at the
 

4311
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:09,910
How much is it to activate Apex at the
moment in the sale? It's 60 bucks. Yes,

4312
01:52:09,910 --> 01:52:09,920
moment in the sale? It's 60 bucks. Yes,
 

4313
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:13,109
moment in the sale? It's 60 bucks. Yes,
I think uh all

4314
01:52:13,109 --> 01:52:13,119
I think uh all
 

4315
01:52:13,119 --> 01:52:14,709
I think uh all
someone can tell me if I've got this

4316
01:52:14,709 --> 01:52:14,719
someone can tell me if I've got this
 

4317
01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:17,589
someone can tell me if I've got this
wrong. I think it's 25, 50K, and 150K

4318
01:52:17,589 --> 01:52:17,599
wrong. I think it's 25, 50K, and 150K
 

4319
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:21,750
wrong. I think it's 25, 50K, and 150K
are about 20 bucks per eval. And then to

4320
01:52:21,750 --> 01:52:21,760
are about 20 bucks per eval. And then to
 

4321
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:24,229
are about 20 bucks per eval. And then to
activate it, it's about 60. So all in

4322
01:52:24,229 --> 01:52:24,239
activate it, it's about 60. So all in
 

4323
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:25,990
activate it, it's about 60. So all in
it's about 80 bucks. I think that's

4324
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:26,000
it's about 80 bucks. I think that's
 

4325
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,990
it's about 80 bucks. I think that's
right. Or is it 40? I think that's

4326
01:52:27,990 --> 01:52:28,000
right. Or is it 40? I think that's
 

4327
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:35,109
right. Or is it 40? I think that's
right. I think that's right.

4328
01:52:35,109 --> 01:52:35,119

 

4329
01:52:35,119 --> 01:52:36,709

The funding tick rule changes messed me

4330
01:52:36,709 --> 01:52:36,719

[\h__\h] ton of my money

4342
01:52:51,030 --> 01:52:51,040
think their response to everything has
 

4343
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:53,750
think their response to everything has
been nothing short of a joke. So, no

4344
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:53,760
been nothing short of a joke. So, no
 

4345
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,109
been nothing short of a joke. So, no
more trading with them. And I lost

4346
01:52:55,109 --> 01:52:55,119
more trading with them. And I lost
 

4347
01:52:55,119 --> 01:52:56,229

trader, Lucid. For me, those are the top

4374
01:53:27,990 --> 01:53:28,000
trader, Lucid. For me, those are the top
 

4375
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,350
trader, Lucid. For me, those are the top
three. They could be in any order that

4376
01:53:29,350 --> 01:53:29,360
three. They could be in any order that
 

4377
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:31,270
three. They could be in any order that
you want depending how you trade. And

4378
01:53:31,270 --> 01:53:31,280
you want depending how you trade. And
 

4379

01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:46,000

 

4385
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:50,709

All right, back to this IB, folks.

4386
01:53:50,709 --> 01:53:50,719

 

4387
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:52,870

There was a seller at 67. There's an

4388
01:53:52,870 --> 01:53:52,880
There was a seller at 67. There's an
 

4389
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:55,189
There was a seller at 67. There's an
imbalance up to 71.

4390
01:53:55,189 --> 01:53:55,199
imbalance up to 71.
 

4391
01:53:55,199 --> 01:53:59,430

4393
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:04,149
And uh we will reclaim at 77s. All
right. So, I'd be watching 67s and 77s

4394
01:54:04,149 --> 01:54:04,159
right. So, I'd be watching 67s and 77s
 

4395
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:06,229
right. So, I'd be watching 67s and 77s
to see if they reject or they reclaim

4396
01:54:06,229 --> 01:54:06,239
to see if they reject or they reclaim

4471
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:52,950

4481
01:56:05,119 --> 01:56:08,470

probably the 50K, honestly.

4482
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:08,480
probably the 50K, honestly.
 

4483

4487
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:17,510
renewals, max loss limit, 2,000, which
is not the best, but there you go.

4488
01:56:17,510 --> 01:56:17,520
is not the best, but there you go.
 

4489
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:21,510
is not the best, but there you go.
Profit target 3,000. Um, free. It's

Profit target 3,000. Um, free. It's
They've moved it to 50% consistency, so

4492
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:23,840
They've moved it to 50% consistency, so
 

4493
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:25,750
They've moved it to 50% consistency, so
you can pass it in two days now. use up

4494
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:25,760
you can pass it in two days now. use up
 

4495
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:29,350
you can pass it in two days now. use up
to four minis or 40 micros. Um, no

4496
01:56:29,350 --> 01:56:29,360
to four minis or 40 micros. Um, no
 

4497
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:31,030
to four minis or 40 micros. Um, no
consistency when funded. That's that's

4498
01:56:31,030 --> 01:56:31,040
consistency when funded. That's that's
 

4499
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:34,149
consistency when funded. That's that's
probably the one to go for

4500
01:56:34,149 --> 01:56:34,159
probably the one to go for
 

4501
01:56:34,159 --> 01:56:47,109
probably the one to go for
in my mind.

4502
01:56:47,109 --> 01:56:47,119

 

4503
01:56:47,119 --> 01:56:48,390

So, here we go. We're going to test this

4504
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:48,400
So, here we go. We're going to test this
 

4505
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:50,070
So, here we go. We're going to test this
IB. Let's see if we can get acceptance.

4506
01:56:50,070 --> 01:56:50,080
IB. Let's see if we can get acceptance.
 

4507
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:51,589
IB. Let's see if we can get acceptance.
There is a little imbalance like I

4508
01:56:51,589 --> 01:56:51,599
There is a little imbalance like I
 

4509
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:54,070
There is a little imbalance like I
talked about up to 71. And then I' I'd

4510
01:56:54,070 --> 01:56:54,080
talked about up to 71. And then I' I'd
 

4511
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:56,550
talked about up to 71. And then I' I'd
be watching this area here, right? It's

4512
01:56:56,550 --> 01:56:56,560
be watching this area here, right? It's
 

4513
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:59,669
be watching this area here, right? It's
very simple. If bears are to produce a

4514
01:56:59,669 --> 01:56:59,679
very simple. If bears are to produce a
 

4515
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:02,470
very simple. If bears are to produce a
trend day, right, then they will want to

4516
01:57:02,470 --> 01:57:02,480
trend day, right, then they will want to
 

4517
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:04,310
trend day, right, then they will want to
reject this with like a two leg and

4518
01:57:04,310 --> 01:57:04,320
reject this with like a two leg and
 

4519
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,149
reject this with like a two leg and
something like this. If they're unable

4520
01:57:06,149 --> 01:57:06,159
something like this. If they're unable
 

4521
01:57:06,159 --> 01:57:07,990
something like this. If they're unable
to do this, if this is a look below and

4522
01:57:07,990 --> 01:57:08,000
to do this, if this is a look below and
 

4523
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,070
to do this, if this is a look below and
a sweep, we will go straight back in and

4524
01:57:10,070 --> 01:57:10,080
a sweep, we will go straight back in and
 

4525
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:11,669
a sweep, we will go straight back in and
we will try and attack up here. If we

4526
01:57:11,669 --> 01:57:11,679
we will try and attack up here. If we
 

4527
01:57:11,679 --> 01:57:13,109
we will try and attack up here. If we
find acceptance through here, we will

4528
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:13,119
find acceptance through here, we will
 

4529
01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:15,109
find acceptance through here, we will
try and attack up here. Those are the

4530
01:57:15,109 --> 01:57:15,119
try and attack up here. Those are the
 

4531
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:16,709
try and attack up here. Those are the
two options. There's always two options

4532
01:57:16,709 --> 01:57:16,719
two options. There's always two options
 

4533
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:19,030
two options. There's always two options
on the table. I'm more willing to play

4534
01:57:19,030 --> 01:57:19,040
on the table. I'm more willing to play
 

4535
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:23,510
on the table. I'm more willing to play
the long if they're going to find a bid.

4536
01:57:23,510 --> 01:57:23,520
the long if they're going to find a bid.
 

4537
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:24,870
the long if they're going to find a bid.
At the moment, I'm not too bothered

4538
01:57:24,870 --> 01:57:24,880
At the moment, I'm not too bothered
 

4539
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:33,830
At the moment, I'm not too bothered
about doing anything.

4540
01:57:33,830 --> 01:57:33,840

 

4541
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,669

What happened to funding ticks? My guess

4542
01:57:35,669 --> 01:57:35,679
What happened to funding ticks? My guess
 

4543
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:38,390
What happened to funding ticks? My guess
is that um it was too easy to get

4544
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:38,400
is that um it was too easy to get
 

4545
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:41,430
is that um it was too easy to get
payouts from. They probably had some

4546
01:57:41,430 --> 01:57:41,440
payouts from. They probably had some
 

4547
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:44,550
payouts from. They probably had some
liquidity issues. So they uh

4548
01:57:44,550 --> 01:57:44,560
liquidity issues. So they uh
 

4549
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:47,510
liquidity issues. So they uh
retrospectively changed the rules and uh

4550
01:57:47,510 --> 01:57:47,520
retrospectively changed the rules and uh
 

4551
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:49,270
retrospectively changed the rules and uh
denied a lot of people payouts

4552
01:57:49,270 --> 01:57:49,280
denied a lot of people payouts
 

4553
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:51,750
denied a lot of people payouts
unfortunately and then removed capital

4554
01:57:51,750 --> 01:57:51,760
unfortunately and then removed capital
 

4555
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:53,669
unfortunately and then removed capital
from people's accounts based on the new

4556
01:57:53,669 --> 01:57:53,679
from people's accounts based on the new
 

4557
01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:56,550
from people's accounts based on the new
rule changes which they bought in

4558
01:57:56,550 --> 01:57:56,560
rule changes which they bought in
 

4559
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:59,669
rule changes which they bought in
um and then just acted I would say the

4560
01:57:59,669 --> 01:57:59,679
um and then just acted I would say the
 

4561
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:02,229
um and then just acted I would say the
CEO acted like

4562
01:58:02,229 --> 01:58:02,239
CEO acted like
 

4563
01:58:02,239 --> 01:58:04,149
CEO acted like
well a bit of a dick to be quite honest.

4564
01:58:04,149 --> 01:58:04,159
well a bit of a dick to be quite honest.
 

4565
01:58:04,159 --> 01:58:06,709
well a bit of a dick to be quite honest.
He didn't reply to people like me who

4566
01:58:06,709 --> 01:58:06,719
He didn't reply to people like me who
 

4567
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:08,470
He didn't reply to people like me who
were saying you know this is uh you need

4568
01:58:08,470 --> 01:58:08,480
were saying you know this is uh you need
 

4569
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:10,950
were saying you know this is uh you need
to look at this this isn't good and his

4570
01:58:10,950 --> 01:58:10,960
to look at this this isn't good and his
 

4571
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:14,550
to look at this this isn't good and his
response was uh well arrogant and wrong

4572
01:58:14,550 --> 01:58:14,560
response was uh well arrogant and wrong
 

4573
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:16,310
response was uh well arrogant and wrong
and uh they will lose business because

4574
01:58:16,310 --> 01:58:16,320
and uh they will lose business because
 

4575
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,990
and uh they will lose business because
of it. It is as simple as that. They

4576
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:18,000
of it. It is as simple as that. They
 

4577
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,830
of it. It is as simple as that. They
they have they have absolutely shafted

4578
01:58:19,830 --> 01:58:19,840
they have they have absolutely shafted
 

4579
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:22,310
they have they have absolutely shafted
themselves um because people have lost

4580
01:58:22,310 --> 01:58:22,320
themselves um because people have lost
 

4581
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:25,589
themselves um because people have lost
respect for them.

4582
01:58:25,589 --> 01:58:25,599
respect for them.
 

4583
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:27,510
respect for them.
It t it can take years to build up

4584
01:58:27,510 --> 01:58:27,520
It t it can take years to build up
 

4585
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:29,589
It t it can take years to build up
trust. It only takes a moment to get rid

4586
01:58:29,589 --> 01:58:29,599
trust. It only takes a moment to get rid
 

4587
01:58:29,599 --> 01:58:31,830
trust. It only takes a moment to get rid
of trust. Right. So I think that's

4588
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:31,840
of trust. Right. So I think that's
 

4589
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:35,430
of trust. Right. So I think that's
probably what happened.

4590
01:58:35,430 --> 01:58:35,440

 

4591
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:37,669

Which profile am I using? Session or

4592
01:58:37,669 --> 01:58:37,679
Which profile am I using? Session or
 

4593
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:40,550
Which profile am I using? Session or
fix? This is this one right here is is

4594
01:58:40,550 --> 01:58:40,560
fix? This is this one right here is is
 

4595
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:41,910
fix? This is this one right here is is
actually anchored, but it's basically

4596
01:58:41,910 --> 01:58:41,920
actually anchored, but it's basically
 

4597
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:45,990
actually anchored, but it's basically
session to the 930 open.

4598
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:46,000
session to the 930 open.
 

4599
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,430
session to the 930 open.
So, they're still finding some dips

4600
01:58:47,430 --> 01:58:47,440
So, they're still finding some dips
 

4601
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:49,350
So, they're still finding some dips
here. So far, there's some passive

4602
01:58:49,350 --> 01:58:49,360
here. So far, there's some passive
 

4603
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:50,950
here. So far, there's some passive
buying here, but like I said all day,

4604
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:50,960
buying here, but like I said all day,
 

4605
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:53,430
buying here, but like I said all day,
the volume is very light. Very, very

4606
01:58:53,430 --> 01:58:53,440
the volume is very light. Very, very
 

4607
01:58:53,440 --> 01:59:09,830
the volume is very light. Very, very
light.

4608
01:59:09,830 --> 01:59:09,840

 

4609
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:11,910

would the flow zone indicator signals be

4610
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:11,920
would the flow zone indicator signals be
 

4611
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:14,229
would the flow zone indicator signals be
different if you choose regular trading

4612
01:59:14,229 --> 01:59:14,239
different if you choose regular trading
 

4613
01:59:14,239 --> 01:59:16,229
different if you choose regular trading
hours versus electronic hours? Yeah, it

4614
01:59:16,229 --> 01:59:16,239
hours versus electronic hours? Yeah, it
 

4615
01:59:16,239 --> 01:59:20,470
hours versus electronic hours? Yeah, it
would it would slightly differ for sure

4616
01:59:20,470 --> 01:59:20,480
would it would slightly differ for sure
 

4617
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:23,109
would it would slightly differ for sure
because it can only move based on the

4618
01:59:23,109 --> 01:59:23,119
because it can only move based on the
 

4619
01:59:23,119 --> 01:59:27,430
because it can only move based on the
candle structure you give it.

4620
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:27,440

 

4621
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:28,950

Four hours a massive head and shoulders.

4622
01:59:28,950 --> 01:59:28,960
Four hours a massive head and shoulders.
 

4623
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:30,229
Four hours a massive head and shoulders.
Yeah, I mean we were talking about that

4624
01:59:30,229 --> 01:59:30,239
Yeah, I mean we were talking about that
 

4625
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:32,229
Yeah, I mean we were talking about that
yesterday. It is and they've broken

4626
01:59:32,229 --> 01:59:32,239
yesterday. It is and they've broken
 

4627
01:59:32,239 --> 01:59:34,470
yesterday. It is and they've broken
down. The problem is where you're

4628
01:59:34,470 --> 01:59:34,480
down. The problem is where you're
 

4629
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:36,950
down. The problem is where you're
breaking down into.

4630
01:59:36,950 --> 01:59:36,960
breaking down into.
 

4631
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:42,070
breaking down into.
Right. So if we if we start losing bids

4632
01:59:42,070 --> 01:59:42,080
Right. So if we if we start losing bids
 

4633
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:44,629
Right. So if we if we start losing bids
under 520s then we are going to go to

4634
01:59:44,629 --> 01:59:44,639
under 520s then we are going to go to
 

4635
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:47,990
under 520s then we are going to go to
330s. Right. But if we do not lose that

4636
01:59:47,990 --> 01:59:48,000
330s. Right. But if we do not lose that
 

4637
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,990
330s. Right. But if we do not lose that
right we can still keep bidding up and

4638
01:59:49,990 --> 01:59:50,000
right we can still keep bidding up and
 

4639
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,350
right we can still keep bidding up and
down in this range. You got to ask

4640
01:59:51,350 --> 01:59:51,360
down in this range. You got to ask
 

4641
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:53,990
down in this range. You got to ask
yourself like is this market really

4642
01:59:53,990 --> 01:59:54,000
yourself like is this market really
 

4643
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,510
yourself like is this market really
willing to do a 300 point sell on the

4644
01:59:57,510 --> 01:59:57,520
willing to do a 300 point sell on the
 

4645
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:58,950
willing to do a 300 point sell on the
last day of the year. I'm not convinced

4646
01:59:58,950 --> 01:59:58,960
last day of the year. I'm not convinced
 

4647
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:01,669
last day of the year. I'm not convinced
it is.

4648
02:00:01,669 --> 02:00:01,679
it is.
 

4649
02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:04,149
it is.
We've been over this numerous times now.

4650
02:00:04,149 --> 02:00:04,159
We've been over this numerous times now.
 

4651
02:00:04,159 --> 02:00:05,750
We've been over this numerous times now.
Right? If you are the person looking for

4652
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:05,760
Right? If you are the person looking for
 

4653
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:09,030
Right? If you are the person looking for
this move here, which is fine, leaving

4654
02:00:09,030 --> 02:00:09,040
this move here, which is fine, leaving
 

4655
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:12,149
this move here, which is fine, leaving
this volume retest stayed heavy. The

4656
02:00:12,149 --> 02:00:12,159
this volume retest stayed heavy. The
 

4657
02:00:12,159 --> 02:00:14,550
this volume retest stayed heavy. The
question is really, are you going to

4658
02:00:14,550 --> 02:00:14,560
question is really, are you going to
 

4659
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:17,030
question is really, are you going to
trade inside this? Right? So, you need

4660
02:00:17,030 --> 02:00:17,040
trade inside this? Right? So, you need
 

4661
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:19,189
trade inside this? Right? So, you need
to see this move here. That's when I

4662
02:00:19,189 --> 02:00:19,199
to see this move here. That's when I
 

4663
02:00:19,199 --> 02:00:21,669
to see this move here. That's when I
become very interested. I wouldn't be

4664
02:00:21,669 --> 02:00:21,679
become very interested. I wouldn't be
 

4665
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:24,229
become very interested. I wouldn't be
selling under this.

4666
02:00:24,229 --> 02:00:24,239
selling under this.
 

4667
02:00:24,239 --> 02:00:27,430
selling under this.
That's dangerous.

4668
02:00:27,430 --> 02:00:27,440
That's dangerous.
 

4669
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:30,229
That's dangerous.
Right now, we're just seeing not much

4670
02:00:30,229 --> 02:00:30,239
Right now, we're just seeing not much
 

4671
02:00:30,239 --> 02:00:33,510
Right now, we're just seeing not much
happen happening at all.

4672
02:00:33,510 --> 02:00:33,520
happen happening at all.
 

4673
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:45,910
happen happening at all.
Very slow. Back to IB again.

4674
02:00:45,910 --> 02:00:45,920

 

4675
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:48,629

next two to three days maybe. It would

4676
02:00:48,629 --> 02:00:48,639
next two to three days maybe. It would
 

4677
02:00:48,639 --> 02:00:51,510
next two to three days maybe. It would
be nice. Uh

4678
02:00:51,510 --> 02:00:51,520
be nice. Uh
 

4679
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:53,270
be nice. Uh
Lorny, I think I've said it right. It

4680
02:00:53,270 --> 02:00:53,280
Lorny, I think I've said it right. It
 

4681
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:55,510
Lorny, I think I've said it right. It
would be nice. I'm here for it. I'm here

4682
02:00:55,510 --> 02:00:55,520
would be nice. I'm here for it. I'm here
 

4683
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:57,350
would be nice. I'm here for it. I'm here
for that fade uh back into the old

4684
02:00:57,350 --> 02:00:57,360
for that fade uh back into the old
 

4685
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:59,430
for that fade uh back into the old
value. I'm here for if they want to hold

4686
02:00:59,430 --> 02:00:59,440
value. I'm here for if they want to hold
 

4687
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:01,589
value. I'm here for if they want to hold
a bid down there, I'm here for that as

4688
02:01:01,589 --> 02:01:01,599
a bid down there, I'm here for that as
 

4689
02:01:01,599 --> 02:01:02,870
a bid down there, I'm here for that as
well. If they don't want to hold the bid

4690
02:01:02,870 --> 02:01:02,880
well. If they don't want to hold the bid
 

4691
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:04,950
well. If they don't want to hold the bid
and we go full panic mode, I'm [\h__\h]

4692
02:01:04,950 --> 02:01:04,960
and we go full panic mode, I'm [\h__\h]
 

4693
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:06,550
and we go full panic mode, I'm [\h__\h]
here for that as well. I will absolutely

4694
02:01:06,550 --> 02:01:06,560
here for that as well. I will absolutely
 

4695
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:09,910
here for that as well. I will absolutely
slam SQQ for a few months and let this

4696
02:01:09,910 --> 02:01:09,920
slam SQQ for a few months and let this
 

4697
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:11,669
slam SQQ for a few months and let this
market do whatever it is it wants to do.

4698
02:01:11,669 --> 02:01:11,679
market do whatever it is it wants to do.
 

4699
02:01:11,679 --> 02:01:14,070
market do whatever it is it wants to do.
I'm willing to honestly I'm willing to

4700
02:01:14,070 --> 02:01:14,080
I'm willing to honestly I'm willing to
 

4701
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:15,750
I'm willing to honestly I'm willing to
trade both sides at the moment. You have

4702
02:01:15,750 --> 02:01:15,760
trade both sides at the moment. You have
 

4703
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:17,750
trade both sides at the moment. You have
to be willing to trade both sides at the

4704
02:01:17,750 --> 02:01:17,760
to be willing to trade both sides at the
 

4705
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:20,390
to be willing to trade both sides at the
moment. Does the macro environment look

4706
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:20,400
moment. Does the macro environment look
 

4707
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:22,229
moment. Does the macro environment look
good? No. Can we still drift higher?

4708
02:01:22,229 --> 02:01:22,239
good? No. Can we still drift higher?
 

4709
02:01:22,239 --> 02:01:23,669
good? No. Can we still drift higher?
Yeah. If it wants to, it can. So, that's

4710
02:01:23,669 --> 02:01:23,679
Yeah. If it wants to, it can. So, that's
 

4711
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:26,470
Yeah. If it wants to, it can. So, that's
why I try not to be too biased until we

4712
02:01:26,470 --> 02:01:26,480
why I try not to be too biased until we
 

4713
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:28,229
why I try not to be too biased until we
clearly make some decisions, right? If

4714
02:01:28,229 --> 02:01:28,239
clearly make some decisions, right? If
 

4715
02:01:28,239 --> 02:01:30,470
clearly make some decisions, right? If
we're clearly going to go into a major

4716
02:01:30,470 --> 02:01:30,480
we're clearly going to go into a major
 

4717
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:33,430
we're clearly going to go into a major
major sell and leave major divergence

4718
02:01:33,430 --> 02:01:33,440
major sell and leave major divergence
 

4719
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:36,070
major sell and leave major divergence
where RTY and ES takes highs and ENQ

4720
02:01:36,070 --> 02:01:36,080
where RTY and ES takes highs and ENQ
 

4721
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:37,669
where RTY and ES takes highs and ENQ
doesn't and we start to sell tech and

4722
02:01:37,669 --> 02:01:37,679
doesn't and we start to sell tech and
 

4723
02:01:37,679 --> 02:01:39,669
doesn't and we start to sell tech and
the panic starts to come in. Obviously,

4724
02:01:39,669 --> 02:01:39,679
the panic starts to come in. Obviously,
 

4725
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:41,109
the panic starts to come in. Obviously,
I'm going to sit bearish. I'm not going

4726
02:01:41,109 --> 02:01:41,119
I'm going to sit bearish. I'm not going
 

4727
02:01:41,119 --> 02:01:43,589
I'm going to sit bearish. I'm not going
to be looking for dips. But uh you know

4728
02:01:43,589 --> 02:01:43,599
to be looking for dips. But uh you know
 

4729
02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:45,589
to be looking for dips. But uh you know
let's deal with that next year if and

4730
02:01:45,589 --> 02:01:45,599
let's deal with that next year if and
 

4731
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:54,950
let's deal with that next year if and
when it happens.

4732
02:01:54,950 --> 02:01:54,960

 

4733
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:56,950

What rule changes did funding ticks

4734
02:01:56,950 --> 02:01:56,960
What rule changes did funding ticks
 

4735
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:00,310
What rule changes did funding ticks
make? Uh they made rule changes to the

4736
02:02:00,310 --> 02:02:00,320
make? Uh they made rule changes to the
 

4737
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,070
make? Uh they made rule changes to the
amount of money you need to make each

4738
02:02:02,070 --> 02:02:02,080
amount of money you need to make each
 

4739
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:04,709
amount of money you need to make each
day to qualify for a payout. They made a

4740
02:02:04,709 --> 02:02:04,719
day to qualify for a payout. They made a
 

4741
02:02:04,719 --> 02:02:06,629
day to qualify for a payout. They made a
rule change on to how long you have to

4742
02:02:06,629 --> 02:02:06,639
rule change on to how long you have to
 

4743
02:02:06,639 --> 02:02:12,149
rule change on to how long you have to
hold trades for. Um

4744
02:02:12,149 --> 02:02:12,159

 

4745
02:02:12,159 --> 02:02:13,350

uh I'm trying to think what else. There

4746
02:02:13,350 --> 02:02:13,360
uh I'm trying to think what else. There
 

4747
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:26,629
uh I'm trying to think what else. There
are some other bits as well.

4748
02:02:26,629 --> 02:02:26,639

 

4749
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:28,870

Still can't get through this low volume

4750
02:02:28,870 --> 02:02:28,880
Still can't get through this low volume
 

4751
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:31,990
Still can't get through this low volume
node. This gray box. Right. So still

4752
02:02:31,990 --> 02:02:32,000
node. This gray box. Right. So still
 

4753
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,189
node. This gray box. Right. So still
can't get through the gray box. We're

4754
02:02:33,189 --> 02:02:33,199
can't get through the gray box. We're
 

4755
02:02:33,199 --> 02:02:48,149
can't get through the gray box. We're
building volume here now.

4756
02:02:48,149 --> 02:02:48,159

 

4757
02:02:48,159 --> 02:02:51,990

any players underneath

4758
02:02:51,990 --> 02:02:52,000
any players underneath
 

4759
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:55,430
any players underneath
525 that's in this box. Anyone under

4760
02:02:55,430 --> 02:02:55,440
525 that's in this box. Anyone under
 

4761
02:02:55,440 --> 02:03:09,030
525 that's in this box. Anyone under
that?

4762
02:03:09,030 --> 02:03:09,040

 

4763
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:11,910

divergence between spy and QQQ. Uh all

4764
02:03:11,910 --> 02:03:11,920
divergence between spy and QQQ. Uh all
 

4765
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:14,070
divergence between spy and QQQ. Uh all
it is is on sector. That's all you

4766
02:03:14,070 --> 02:03:14,080
it is is on sector. That's all you
 

4767
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:16,310
it is is on sector. That's all you
really need to think about. You just got

4768
02:03:16,310 --> 02:03:16,320
really need to think about. You just got
 

4769
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:19,910
really need to think about. You just got
to understand spy is 500 stocks. Q's are

4770
02:03:19,910 --> 02:03:19,920
to understand spy is 500 stocks. Q's are
 

4771
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:22,790
to understand spy is 500 stocks. Q's are
100 stocks. Q's heavily weighted in tech

4772
02:03:22,790 --> 02:03:22,800
100 stocks. Q's heavily weighted in tech
 

4773
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:25,830
100 stocks. Q's heavily weighted in tech
and very heavy weighted into the mag.

4774
02:03:25,830 --> 02:03:25,840
and very heavy weighted into the mag.
 

4775
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:27,750
and very heavy weighted into the mag.
Right? So if you have a day where

4776
02:03:27,750 --> 02:03:27,760
Right? So if you have a day where
 

4777
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:31,030
Right? So if you have a day where
breadth is good, for example, bank

4778
02:03:31,030 --> 02:03:31,040
breadth is good, for example, bank
 

4779
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:32,550
breadth is good, for example, bank
sector's doing well, healthcare is doing

4780
02:03:32,550 --> 02:03:32,560
sector's doing well, healthcare is doing
 

4781
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:34,950
sector's doing well, healthcare is doing
well, energy is doing well, but maybe

4782
02:03:34,950 --> 02:03:34,960
well, energy is doing well, but maybe
 

4783
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:37,350
well, energy is doing well, but maybe
we're having a selloff day in something

4784
02:03:37,350 --> 02:03:37,360
we're having a selloff day in something
 

4785
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:40,470
we're having a selloff day in something
like Nvidia and the chip names and ABGO

4786
02:03:40,470 --> 02:03:40,480
like Nvidia and the chip names and ABGO
 

4787
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:43,910
like Nvidia and the chip names and ABGO
and you know, etc., etc. Um, that's when

4788
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:43,920
and you know, etc., etc. Um, that's when
 

4789
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:46,149
and you know, etc., etc. Um, that's when
you see relative weakness. If you're

4790
02:03:46,149 --> 02:03:46,159
you see relative weakness. If you're
 

4791
02:03:46,159 --> 02:03:48,870
you see relative weakness. If you're
looking at divergence, you want to play,

4792
02:03:48,870 --> 02:03:48,880
looking at divergence, you want to play,
 

4793
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:50,149
looking at divergence, you want to play,
technically speaking, you want to be

4794
02:03:50,149 --> 02:03:50,159
technically speaking, you want to be
 

4795
02:03:50,159 --> 02:03:51,750
technically speaking, you want to be
long on relative strength and you want

4796
02:03:51,750 --> 02:03:51,760
long on relative strength and you want
 

4797
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:53,270
long on relative strength and you want
to be short on relative weakness.

4798
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:53,280
to be short on relative weakness.
 

4799
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:54,790
to be short on relative weakness.
Sometimes you have a catch-up trade

4800
02:03:54,790 --> 02:03:54,800
Sometimes you have a catch-up trade
 

4801
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:57,669
Sometimes you have a catch-up trade
where sectors are rotating. All right,

4802
02:03:57,669 --> 02:03:57,679
where sectors are rotating. All right,
 

4803
02:03:57,679 --> 02:03:59,270
where sectors are rotating. All right,
so they might sell one sector to the

4804
02:03:59,270 --> 02:03:59,280
so they might sell one sector to the
 

4805
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:00,629
so they might sell one sector to the
next to the next to the next to the

4806
02:04:00,629 --> 02:04:00,639
next to the next to the next to the
 

4807
02:04:00,639 --> 02:04:02,470
next to the next to the next to the
next. Okay, let's just focus on here now

4808
02:04:02,470 --> 02:04:02,480
next. Okay, let's just focus on here now
 

4809
02:04:02,480 --> 02:04:03,750
next. Okay, let's just focus on here now
because there might be a trigger coming

4810
02:04:03,750 --> 02:04:03,760
because there might be a trigger coming
 

4811
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:08,950
because there might be a trigger coming
here in a minute.

4812
02:04:08,950 --> 02:04:08,960

 

4813
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:10,470

Right into that imbalance we just talked

4814
02:04:10,470 --> 02:04:10,480
Right into that imbalance we just talked
 

4815
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:13,830
Right into that imbalance we just talked
about at 70s.

4816
02:04:13,830 --> 02:04:13,840
about at 70s.
 

4817
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:16,310
about at 70s.
Like one trade here today if possible.

4818
02:04:16,310 --> 02:04:16,320
Like one trade here today if possible.
 

4819
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:19,109
Like one trade here today if possible.
So

4820
02:04:19,109 --> 02:04:19,119
So
 

4821
02:04:19,119 --> 02:04:20,950
So
they just faded the gray box we talked

4822
02:04:20,950 --> 02:04:20,960
they just faded the gray box we talked
 

4823
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:22,310
they just faded the gray box we talked
about. This is where sellers trying to

4824
02:04:22,310 --> 02:04:22,320
about. This is where sellers trying to
 

4825
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:23,750
about. This is where sellers trying to
defend. Buyers want to get through and

4826
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:23,760
defend. Buyers want to get through and
 

4827
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:37,109
defend. Buyers want to get through and
above

4828
02:04:37,109 --> 02:04:37,119

 

4829
02:04:37,119 --> 02:04:39,109

back to this same level again. Can we

4830
02:04:39,109 --> 02:04:39,119
back to this same level again. Can we
 

4831
02:04:39,119 --> 02:04:40,790
back to this same level again. Can we
find acceptance back inside or they're

4832
02:04:40,790 --> 02:04:40,800
find acceptance back inside or they're
 

4833
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:47,589
find acceptance back inside or they're
going to shove this back lower?

4834
02:04:47,589 --> 02:04:47,599

 

4835
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:49,109

Uh, you missed the first giveaway. We're

4836
02:04:49,109 --> 02:04:49,119

02:04:55,350 --> 02:04:55,360
value area low. If we're going to find
 

4845
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:57,669
value area low. If we're going to find
acceptance and drive up, right, if we're

4846
02:04:57,669 --> 02:04:57,679
acceptance and drive up, right, if we're
 

4847
02:04:57,679 --> 02:04:59,830
acceptance and drive up, right, if we're
going to find acceptance back into value

4848
02:04:59,830 --> 02:04:59,840
going to find acceptance back into value

going to find acceptance back into value
and pivot, there is a chance for us to

4850
02:05:02,229 --> 02:05:02,239
and pivot, there is a chance for us to
 

4851
02:05:02,239 --> 02:05:06,550
and pivot, there is a chance for us to
get back into 607 615. Sellers took

4852
02:05:06,550 --> 02:05:06,560
get back into 607 615. Sellers took
 

4853
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:10,149
get back into 607 615. Sellers took
control at 17s and 25s as well. So,

4854
02:05:10,149 --> 02:05:10,159
control at 17s and 25s as well. So,
 

4855
02:05:10,159 --> 02:05:12,310
control at 17s and 25s as well. So,
there is a chance. So, it sounds like a

02:05:12,310 --> 02:05:12,320
there is a chance. So, it sounds like a
 

4857
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:14,390
there is a chance. So, it sounds like a
massive move, but it's about 30 to 40

4858
02:05:14,390 --> 02:05:14,400
massive move, but it's about 30 to 40
 

4859
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:18,310
massive move, but it's about 30 to 40
points. It's all it is. But you're

4861
02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:19,750
points. It's all it is. But you're
saying there's a chance. There is a

02:05:19,750 --> 02:05:19,760
saying there's a chance. There is a

this will be a look below and fail back
 

4869
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:26,070
this will be a look below and fail back
into IB. But this can still be defended.

So, I'm going to try and give this a

So, I'm going to try and give this a
 

4873
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:29,270
So, I'm going to try and give this a
little bit of time. See if we can do

4874
02:05:29,270 --> 02:05:29,280
little bit of time. See if we can do
 

4875
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:31,750
little bit of time. See if we can do
either this or this. I would I would

4876
02:05:31,750 --> 02:05:31,760
either this or this. I would I would
 

4877
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:33,350
either this or this. I would I would
consider this. If we look above and fail

4878
02:05:33,350 --> 02:05:33,360
consider this. If we look above and fail
 

4879
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:34,790
consider this. If we look above and fail
and come back down, I will consider the

4880
02:05:34,790 --> 02:05:34,800
and come back down, I will consider the
 

4881
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,550
and come back down, I will consider the
fade.

4882
02:05:36,550 --> 02:05:36,560
fade.
 

4883
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:40,709

02:07:54,639 --> 02:07:57,430
see aggressive sellers get caught
offside. Right? That's kind of what I

4990
02:07:57,430 --> 02:07:57,440
offside. Right? That's kind of what I
 

4991
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:00,069
offside. Right? That's kind of what I
want to see.

4992
02:08:00,069 --> 02:08:00,079
want to see.
 

4993
02:08:00,079 --> 02:08:02,550
want to see.
Starting to look good here. Can we see

4994
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:02,560
Starting to look good here. Can we see
 

4995
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:03,830
Starting to look good here. Can we see
some aggression to get involved here?

4996
02:08:03,830 --> 02:08:03,840
some aggression to get involved here?
 

4997
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:06,310
some aggression to get involved here?
This is better. Hello.

4998
02:08:06,310 --> 02:08:06,320
This is better. Hello.
 

4999
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:07,990
This is better. Hello.
Hello. Here's value area low. All right.

5000
02:08:07,990 --> 02:08:08,000
Hello. Here's value area low. All right.
 

5001
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,310
Hello. Here's value area low. All right.
What I'm watching here is 84s.

5002
02:08:10,310 --> 02:08:10,320
What I'm watching here is 84s.
 

5003
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:11,910
What I'm watching here is 84s.
That's where big selling came in is into

5004
02:08:11,910 --> 02:08:11,920
That's where big selling came in is into
 

5005
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:13,830
That's where big selling came in is into
84s and 85. So, if we can drive up

5006
02:08:13,830 --> 02:08:13,840
84s and 85. So, if we can drive up
 

5007
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:15,189
84s and 85. So, if we can drive up
there, if we get through that, then I

5008
02:08:15,189 --> 02:08:15,199
there, if we get through that, then I
 

5009
02:08:15,199 --> 02:08:16,229
there, if we get through that, then I
know we're going to leave sellers

5010
02:08:16,229 --> 02:08:16,239
know we're going to leave sellers
 

5011
02:08:16,239 --> 02:08:20,470
know we're going to leave sellers
trapped.

5012
02:08:20,470 --> 02:08:20,480

 

5013
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:22,470

Some selling coming into 70s. We want to

5014
02:08:22,470 --> 02:08:22,480
Some selling coming into 70s. We want to
 

5015
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:24,390
Some selling coming into 70s. We want to
see it lift to 84. like every four or

5016
02:08:24,390 --> 02:08:24,400
see it lift to 84. like every four or
 

5017
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:26,229
see it lift to 84. like every four or
five points feels very hard to get at

5018
02:08:26,229 --> 02:08:26,239
five points feels very hard to get at
 

5019
02:08:26,239 --> 02:08:33,990
five points feels very hard to get at
the moment.

5020
02:08:33,990 --> 02:08:34,000

 

5021
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,790

Right into value area low here. We want

5022
02:08:36,790 --> 02:08:36,800
Right into value area low here. We want
 

5023
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:39,350
Right into value area low here. We want
to get back into 84s and really we want

5024
02:08:39,350 --> 02:08:39,360
to get back into 84s and really we want
 

5025
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:41,669
to get back into 84s and really we want
to get back above 88s and 90s. Here we

5026
02:08:41,669 --> 02:08:41,679
to get back above 88s and 90s. Here we
 

5027
02:08:41,679 --> 02:08:43,270
to get back above 88s and 90s. Here we
go.

5028
02:08:43,270 --> 02:08:43,280
go.
 

5029
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:50,629
go.
Can you lift to 84s? Here we come.

5030
02:08:50,629 --> 02:08:50,639

 

5031
02:08:50,639 --> 02:08:52,550

He doesn't tell me what he's looking

5032
02:08:52,550 --> 02:08:52,560
He doesn't tell me what he's looking
 

5033
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:56,470
He doesn't tell me what he's looking
for.

5034
02:08:56,470 --> 02:08:56,480

 

5035
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:58,790

Patience is a virtue.

5036
02:08:58,790 --> 02:08:58,800
Patience is a virtue.
 

5037
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:00,709
Patience is a virtue.
Can we get through the 84s? You can see

5038
02:09:00,709 --> 02:09:00,719
Can we get through the 84s? You can see
 

5039
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:03,109
Can we get through the 84s? You can see
this right right in front of 84s. Right.

5040
02:09:03,109 --> 02:09:03,119
this right right in front of 84s. Right.
 

5041
02:09:03,119 --> 02:09:04,550
this right right in front of 84s. Right.
I can tell you right now there's there

5042
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:04,560
I can tell you right now there's there
 

5043
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:06,470
I can tell you right now there's there
was a seller this morning at 84s. I can

5044
02:09:06,470 --> 02:09:06,480
was a seller this morning at 84s. I can
 

5045
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:08,629
was a seller this morning at 84s. I can
see he had big size there. So, I'm

5046
02:09:08,629 --> 02:09:08,639
see he had big size there. So, I'm
 

5047
02:09:08,639 --> 02:09:10,149
see he had big size there. So, I'm
looking to see if we can get above him

5048
02:09:10,149 --> 02:09:10,159
looking to see if we can get above him
 

5049
02:09:10,159 --> 02:09:11,910
looking to see if we can get above him
because if that's his average price, he

5050
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:11,920
because if that's his average price, he
 

5051
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:13,589
because if that's his average price, he
might want to stop out. If we can't get

5052
02:09:13,589 --> 02:09:13,599
might want to stop out. If we can't get
 

5053
02:09:13,599 --> 02:09:16,790
might want to stop out. If we can't get
above him, then he remains in control.

5054
02:09:16,790 --> 02:09:16,800
above him, then he remains in control.
 

5055
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:18,069
above him, then he remains in control.
All right. So, this is how I'm looking

5056
02:09:18,069 --> 02:09:18,079
All right. So, this is how I'm looking
 

5057
02:09:18,079 --> 02:09:20,069
All right. So, this is how I'm looking
at levels and what I'm thinking. There's

5058
02:09:20,069 --> 02:09:20,079
at levels and what I'm thinking. There's
 

5059
02:09:20,079 --> 02:09:21,669
at levels and what I'm thinking. There's
not much size on the book. So, if we get

5060
02:09:21,669 --> 02:09:21,679
not much size on the book. So, if we get
 

5061
02:09:21,679 --> 02:09:24,390
not much size on the book. So, if we get
above 84, is there a potential squeeze?

5062
02:09:24,390 --> 02:09:24,400
above 84, is there a potential squeeze?
 

5063
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:27,109
above 84, is there a potential squeeze?
Yes. To 600 and to 607 if we can get

5064
02:09:27,109 --> 02:09:27,119
Yes. To 600 and to 607 if we can get
 

5065
02:09:27,119 --> 02:09:29,669
Yes. To 600 and to 607 if we can get
above 84. So, I'm already long peeling

5066
02:09:29,669 --> 02:09:29,679
above 84. So, I'm already long peeling
 

5067
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:31,830
above 84. So, I'm already long peeling
some off into 84 in case we reject.

5068
02:09:31,830 --> 02:09:31,840
some off into 84 in case we reject.
 

5069
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:33,510
some off into 84 in case we reject.
Right. I'm trying to be proactive

5070
02:09:33,510 --> 02:09:33,520
Right. I'm trying to be proactive
 

5071
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:40,390
Right. I'm trying to be proactive
because I don't know.

5072
02:09:40,390 --> 02:09:40,400

 

5073
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:44,069

I really want to see now

5074
02:09:44,069 --> 02:09:44,079
I really want to see now
 

5075
02:09:44,079 --> 02:09:46,709
I really want to see now
75s down to 70s hold. Here we go.

5076
02:09:46,709 --> 02:09:46,719
75s down to 70s hold. Here we go.
 

5077
02:09:46,719 --> 02:09:48,870
75s down to 70s hold. Here we go.
Testing 84. You can see how accurate the

5078
02:09:48,870 --> 02:09:48,880
Testing 84. You can see how accurate the
 

5079
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:52,950
Testing 84. You can see how accurate the
84 is. Right. Look at 84. Right. 84.

5080
02:09:52,950 --> 02:09:52,960
84 is. Right. Look at 84. Right. 84.
 

5081
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:55,669
84 is. Right. Look at 84. Right. 84.
This is why I'm peeling some off into 84

5082
02:09:55,669 --> 02:09:55,679
This is why I'm peeling some off into 84
 

5083
02:09:55,679 --> 02:09:58,069
This is why I'm peeling some off into 84
cuz I know this is where a big seller

5084
02:09:58,069 --> 02:09:58,079
cuz I know this is where a big seller
 

5085
02:09:58,079 --> 02:10:04,229
cuz I know this is where a big seller
came in.

5086
02:10:04,229 --> 02:10:04,239

 

5087
02:10:04,239 --> 02:10:05,990

They're going to have to hold these dips

5088
02:10:05,990 --> 02:10:06,000
They're going to have to hold these dips
 

5089
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,870
They're going to have to hold these dips
into 75 to 70s. If they don't, I will

5090
02:10:08,870 --> 02:10:08,880
into 75 to 70s. If they don't, I will
 

5091
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:10,390
into 75 to 70s. If they don't, I will
just stop out on the rest. And that's

5092
02:10:10,390 --> 02:10:10,400
just stop out on the rest. And that's
 

5093
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:12,149
just stop out on the rest. And that's
fine. I do not want a failed look

5094
02:10:12,149 --> 02:10:12,159
fine. I do not want a failed look
 

5095
02:10:12,159 --> 02:10:14,790
fine. I do not want a failed look
inside. Remember we talked about the

5096
02:10:14,790 --> 02:10:14,800
inside. Remember we talked about the
 

5097
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:20,390
inside. Remember we talked about the
opportunities here are going to be

5098
02:10:20,390 --> 02:10:20,400

 

5099
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:23,750

this move here or

5100
02:10:23,750 --> 02:10:23,760
this move here or
 

5101
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:25,589
this move here or
this move here if they have unfinished

5102
02:10:25,589 --> 02:10:25,599
this move here if they have unfinished
 

5103
02:10:25,599 --> 02:10:26,950
this move here if they have unfinished
business. All right. I'm willing to play

5104
02:10:26,950 --> 02:10:26,960
business. All right. I'm willing to play
 

5105
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:29,589
business. All right. I'm willing to play
both. I am willing to play both. Right

5106
02:10:29,589 --> 02:10:29,599
both. I am willing to play both. Right
 

5107
02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:31,910
both. I am willing to play both. Right
now I'm trying to get long or this move

5108
02:10:31,910 --> 02:10:31,920
now I'm trying to get long or this move
 

5109
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:33,910
now I'm trying to get long or this move
here. I've already peeled some off. I'm

5110
02:10:33,910 --> 02:10:33,920
here. I've already peeled some off. I'm
 

5111
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:35,430
here. I've already peeled some off. I'm
not going to reload unless it really

5112
02:10:35,430 --> 02:10:35,440
not going to reload unless it really
 

5113
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:37,430
not going to reload unless it really
proves to me. I will just stop out on

5114
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:37,440
proves to me. I will just stop out on
 

5115
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:40,149
proves to me. I will just stop out on
the rest and that's fine because we are

5116
02:10:40,149 --> 02:10:40,159
the rest and that's fine because we are
 

5117
02:10:40,159 --> 02:10:42,149
the rest and that's fine because we are
in a very very low volume. What I do not

5118
02:10:42,149 --> 02:10:42,159
in a very very low volume. What I do not
 

5119
02:10:42,159 --> 02:10:44,149
in a very very low volume. What I do not
want to do, right, is just be like, I'm

5120
02:10:44,149 --> 02:10:44,159
want to do, right, is just be like, I'm
 

5121
02:10:44,159 --> 02:10:46,229
want to do, right, is just be like, I'm
going to risk down here. And for some

5122
02:10:46,229 --> 02:10:46,239
going to risk down here. And for some
 

5123
02:10:46,239 --> 02:10:47,750
going to risk down here. And for some
reason, some big seller comes in and

5124
02:10:47,750 --> 02:10:47,760
reason, some big seller comes in and
 

5125
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:49,990
reason, some big seller comes in and
goes, "Fuck you." in one candle because

5126
02:10:49,990 --> 02:10:50,000
goes, "Fuck you." in one candle because
 

5127
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,750
goes, "Fuck you." in one candle because
this might look big, but it's actually

5128
02:10:51,750 --> 02:10:51,760
this might look big, but it's actually
 

5129
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:53,510
this might look big, but it's actually
tiny. It's only 20 points and it

5130
02:10:53,510 --> 02:10:53,520
tiny. It's only 20 points and it
 

5131
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:55,270
tiny. It's only 20 points and it
wouldn't take a lot. If we can build

5132
02:10:55,270 --> 02:10:55,280
wouldn't take a lot. If we can build
 

5133
02:10:55,280 --> 02:11:04,390
wouldn't take a lot. If we can build
here, we look good.

5134
02:11:04,390 --> 02:11:04,400

 

5135
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:05,910

Can you guys see that on the book? I
 

5147
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:19,350
Can you guys see that on the book? I
might have to move it up a bit.

Need my other hand for the mouse. All
 

5151

right. This Where's it gone? Need that.
I need that to show you. All right. This

5154
02:11:26,870 --> 02:11:26,880
I need that to show you. All right. This
 

5155
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:29,750
I need that to show you. All right. This
guy here is a big seller. All right.

5156
02:11:29,750 --> 02:11:29,760
guy here is a big seller. All right.
 

5157
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:31,990
guy here is a big seller. All right.
This is the delta. I can see at this

5158
02:11:31,990 --> 02:11:32,000
This is the delta. I can see at this
 

5159
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,430
This is the delta. I can see at this
price. This is why I knew we'd probably

5160
02:11:33,430 --> 02:11:33,440
price. This is why I knew we'd probably
 

5161
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:35,589
price. This is why I knew we'd probably
come up and test him. He's still clearly

5162
02:11:35,589 --> 02:11:35,599
come up and test him. He's still clearly
 

5163
02:11:35,599 --> 02:11:37,030
come up and test him. He's still clearly
there. All right. He's present and he's

5164
02:11:37,030 --> 02:11:37,040
there. All right. He's present and he's
 

5165
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:38,870
there. All right. He's present and he's
passive because this is aggressive

5166
02:11:38,870 --> 02:11:38,880
passive because this is aggressive
 

5167
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:41,189
passive because this is aggressive
market order buying. And this is passive

5168
02:11:41,189 --> 02:11:41,199
market order buying. And this is passive
 

5169
02:11:41,199 --> 02:11:42,550
market order buying. And this is passive
selling into this level with an

5170
02:11:42,550 --> 02:11:42,560
selling into this level with an
 

5171
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:43,910
selling into this level with an
imbalance. So I know there's still a

5172
02:11:43,910 --> 02:11:43,920
imbalance. So I know there's still a
 

5173
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:45,910
imbalance. So I know there's still a
seller there. Once we get above that, I

5174
02:11:45,910 --> 02:11:45,920
seller there. Once we get above that, I
 

5175
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:47,430
seller there. Once we get above that, I
know that the seller is out the money

5176
02:11:47,430 --> 02:11:47,440
know that the seller is out the money
 

5177
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:49,910
know that the seller is out the money
and everyone below him is out the money.

5178
02:11:49,910 --> 02:11:49,920
and everyone below him is out the money.
 

5179
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:51,510
and everyone below him is out the money.
And then we can think about a squeeze,

5180
02:11:51,510 --> 02:11:51,520
And then we can think about a squeeze,
 

5181
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:53,589
And then we can think about a squeeze,
right? So I'm trying to use their pain.

5182
02:11:53,589 --> 02:11:53,599
right? So I'm trying to use their pain.
 

5183
02:11:53,599 --> 02:11:56,470
right? So I'm trying to use their pain.
I'm positioned in case we do it. But I

5184
02:11:56,470 --> 02:11:56,480
I'm positioned in case we do it. But I
 

5185
02:11:56,480 --> 02:11:59,030
I'm positioned in case we do it. But I
don't expect us to have to do it. That's

5186
02:11:59,030 --> 02:11:59,040
don't expect us to have to do it. That's
 

5187
02:11:59,040 --> 02:12:01,430
don't expect us to have to do it. That's
the difference.

5188
02:12:01,430 --> 02:12:01,440
the difference.
 

5189
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:02,709
the difference.
Hopefully that makes sense. That

5190
02:12:02,709 --> 02:12:02,719
Hopefully that makes sense. That
 

5191
02:12:02,719 --> 02:12:04,069
Hopefully that makes sense. That

with me a long time and have been around
long enough will know how I trade. to

5196
02:12:07,910 --> 02:12:07,920
long enough will know how I trade. to
 

5197
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:11,189
long enough will know how I trade. to
trade people's pain. But this is a see

5198
02:12:11,189 --> 02:12:11,199
trade people's pain. But this is a see
 

5199
02:12:11,199 --> 02:12:18,310
trade people's pain. But this is a see
money take money environment right now

5200
02:12:18,310 --> 02:12:18,320

 

5201
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:21,189

at 25608. There are a lot of buyers that

5202
02:12:21,189 --> 02:12:21,199
at 25608. There are a lot of buyers that
 

5203
02:12:21,199 --> 02:12:22,790
at 25608. There are a lot of buyers that
were offside and got trapped on my

5204
02:12:22,790 --> 02:12:22,800
were offside and got trapped on my
 

5205
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:25,109
were offside and got trapped on my
delta. Would you be looking to scale out

5206
02:12:25,109 --> 02:12:25,119
delta. Would you be looking to scale out
 

5207
02:12:25,119 --> 02:12:28,310
delta. Would you be looking to scale out
there also? What did you say my friends?

5208
02:12:28,310 --> 02:12:28,320
there also? What did you say my friends?
 

5209

25608
 

5211
02:12:31,199 --> 02:12:33,109
25608
608. I mean yeah I mean look that's

5212
02:12:33,109 --> 02:12:33,119
608. I mean yeah I mean look that's
 

5213
02:12:33,119 --> 02:12:35,189
608. I mean yeah I mean look that's
that's the gray box right point control

5214
02:12:35,189 --> 02:12:35,199
that's the gray box right point control
 

5215
02:12:35,199 --> 02:12:36,950
that's the gray box right point control
right here. That's it. That's exactly

5216
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:36,960
right here. That's it. That's exactly
 

5217
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:38,950
right here. That's it. That's exactly
it. So, we want to try and get what

5218
02:12:38,950 --> 02:12:38,960
it. So, we want to try and get what
 

5219
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:40,790
it. So, we want to try and get what
we're trying to do is get from here to

5220
02:12:40,790 --> 02:12:40,800
we're trying to do is get from here to
 

5221
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:42,550
we're trying to do is get from here to
here. And I Yes, I absolutely would

5222
02:12:42,550 --> 02:12:42,560
here. And I Yes, I absolutely would
 

5223
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:44,950
here. And I Yes, I absolutely would
scale some out there. And if we find a

5224
02:12:44,950 --> 02:12:44,960
scale some out there. And if we find a
 

5225
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:46,470
scale some out there. And if we find a
trade through here, then we're going to

5226
02:12:46,470 --> 02:12:46,480
trade through here, then we're going to
 

5227
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:48,470
trade through here, then we're going to
go and test current day's value area

5228
02:12:48,470 --> 02:12:48,480
go and test current day's value area
 

5229
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:49,830
go and test current day's value area
high, which is previous week's value

5230
02:12:49,830 --> 02:12:49,840
high, which is previous week's value
 

5231
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:52,229
high, which is previous week's value
area low. Right?

5232
02:12:52,229 --> 02:12:52,239
area low. Right?
 

5233
02:12:52,239 --> 02:12:54,390
area low. Right?
So, all all it takes is some patience. I

5234
02:12:54,390 --> 02:12:54,400
So, all all it takes is some patience. I
 

5235
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:56,149
So, all all it takes is some patience. I
would say to you, if you haven't peeled

5236
02:12:56,149 --> 02:12:56,159
would say to you, if you haven't peeled
 

5237
02:12:56,159 --> 02:12:57,990
would say to you, if you haven't peeled
any off, I would peel some off into here

5238
02:12:57,990 --> 02:12:58,000
any off, I would peel some off into here
 

5239
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:07,270
any off, I would peel some off into here
just in case, even if it's 10 20%.

5240
02:13:07,270 --> 02:13:07,280

 

5241
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:09,030

What indicator is that? The one on Ninja

5242
02:13:09,030 --> 02:13:09,040
What indicator is that? The one on Ninja
 

5243
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:13,750
What indicator is that? The one on Ninja
Trader. It's called

5244
02:13:13,750 --> 02:13:13,760

 

5245
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:16,390

City.

5246
02:13:16,390 --> 02:13:16,400
City.
 

5247
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:17,750
City.
But you can just do it on here, guys.

5248
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:17,760
But you can just do it on here, guys.
 

5249
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:19,510
But you can just do it on here, guys.
You can just It's the same level on

5250
02:13:19,510 --> 02:13:19,520
You can just It's the same level on
 

5251
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:21,669
You can just It's the same level on
here, right? You You would just need to

5252
02:13:21,669 --> 02:13:21,679
here, right? You You would just need to
 

5253
02:13:21,679 --> 02:13:24,550
here, right? You You would just need to
look for where

5254
02:13:24,550 --> 02:13:24,560
look for where
 

5255
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:26,629
look for where
you had a big delta C here. And then you

5256
02:13:26,629 --> 02:13:26,639
you had a big delta C here. And then you
 

5257
02:13:26,639 --> 02:13:29,189
you had a big delta C here. And then you
use spikes in volume profile. Can you

5258
02:13:29,189 --> 02:13:29,199
use spikes in volume profile. Can you
 

5259
02:13:29,199 --> 02:13:31,189
use spikes in volume profile. Can you
see this spike? This guy right here.

5260
02:13:31,189 --> 02:13:31,199
see this spike? This guy right here.
 

5261
02:13:31,199 --> 02:13:33,750
see this spike? This guy right here.
This node. This is a high volume node.

5262
02:13:33,750 --> 02:13:33,760
This node. This is a high volume node.
 

5263
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:35,430
This node. This is a high volume node.
All right, it's the same level. All

5264
02:13:35,430 --> 02:13:35,440
All right, it's the same level. All
 

5265
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:37,030
All right, it's the same level. All
right, so that's when you put confluence

5266
02:13:37,030 --> 02:13:37,040
right, so that's when you put confluence
 

5267
02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:48,709
right, so that's when you put confluence
together.

5268
02:13:48,709 --> 02:13:48,719

 

5269
02:13:48,719 --> 02:13:50,069

They're going to go for it again here.

5270
02:13:50,069 --> 02:13:50,079
They're going to go for it again here.
 

5271
02:13:50,079 --> 02:13:51,830
They're going to go for it again here.
They're trying. They are desperately

5272
02:13:51,830 --> 02:13:51,840
They're trying. They are desperately
 

5273
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:55,350
They're trying. They are desperately
trying.

5274
02:13:55,350 --> 02:13:55,360

 

5275
02:13:55,360 --> 02:13:57,830

Lift it. Lift it. Lift it. Lift it. Come

5276
02:13:57,830 --> 02:13:57,840
Lift it. Lift it. Lift it. Lift it. Come
 

5277
02:13:57,840 --> 02:14:00,069
Lift it. Lift it. Lift it. Lift it. Come
on. Someone turn up. ES is banging into

5278
02:14:00,069 --> 02:14:00,079
on. Someone turn up. ES is banging into
 

5279
02:14:00,079 --> 02:14:01,750
on. Someone turn up. ES is banging into
GlobeEx lows and initial balance as

5280
02:14:01,750 --> 02:14:01,760
GlobeEx lows and initial balance as
 

5281
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:03,910
GlobeEx lows and initial balance as
well. So we want ES to follow what ENQ

5282
02:14:03,910 --> 02:14:03,920
well. So we want ES to follow what ENQ
 

5283
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:05,430
well. So we want ES to follow what ENQ
is doing, right? We want ES to get back

5284
02:14:05,430 --> 02:14:05,440
is doing, right? We want ES to get back
 

5285
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:07,109
is doing, right? We want ES to get back
through IB. So if you think about what

5286
02:14:07,109 --> 02:14:07,119
through IB. So if you think about what
 

5287
02:14:07,119 --> 02:14:08,709
through IB. So if you think about what
we're doing right now, we're long in

5288
02:14:08,709 --> 02:14:08,719
we're doing right now, we're long in
 

5289
02:14:08,719 --> 02:14:11,189
we're doing right now, we're long in
relative strength based on where we're

5290
02:14:11,189 --> 02:14:11,199
relative strength based on where we're
 

5291
02:14:11,199 --> 02:14:13,990
relative strength based on where we're

CBD is actually in total alignment right
 

5303
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:37,270
CBD is actually in total alignment right
now. So, we're not seeing in this part

imbalance above and see if we can start
 

5319
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:57,510
imbalance above and see if we can start
a squeeze. Where's that little [\h__\h] whit

do not want to pop and fail. We need a
 

5335
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:18,709
do not want to pop and fail. We need a
base above. We want the flow zones to

5336
02:15:18,709 --> 02:15:18,719
base above. We want the flow zones to
 

5337
02:15:18,719 --> 02:15:20,149
base above. We want the flow zones to
start supporting. It might be that we

5338
02:15:20,149 --> 02:15:20,159
start supporting. It might be that we
 

5339
02:15:20,159 --> 02:15:21,430
start supporting. It might be that we
need to build out some liquidity cuz

5340
02:15:21,430 --> 02:15:21,440
need to build out some liquidity cuz
 

5341
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:23,189

this is uh a little bit naughty how they

5342
02:15:23,189 --> 02:15:23,199
this is uh a little bit naughty how they
 

5343
02:15:23,199 --> 02:15:24,950
this is uh a little bit naughty how they
developed it. If we're very lucky, they

5344
02:15:24,950 --> 02:15:24,960
developed it. If we're very lucky, they
 

5345
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:26,470
developed it. If we're very lucky, they
will just do a straight squeeze here and

5346
02:15:26,470 --> 02:15:26,480
will just do a straight squeeze here and
 

5347
02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:28,470
will just do a straight squeeze here and
run all these stops. Uh which will be

5348
02:15:28,470 --> 02:15:28,480
run all these stops. Uh which will be
 

5349
02:15:28,480 --> 02:15:31,030
run all these stops. Uh which will be
fun, but it might be that they need to

5350
02:15:31,030 --> 02:15:31,040
fun, but it might be that they need to
 

5351
02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:32,870
fun, but it might be that they need to
offer something like this. But uh let's

5352
02:15:32,870 --> 02:15:32,880
offer something like this. But uh let's
 

5353
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:46,390
offer something like this. But uh let's
see. Hopefully, we get going

5354
02:15:46,390 --> 02:15:46,400

 

5355
02:15:46,400 --> 02:16:01,830

the person with different way of looking

5436
02:17:46,469 --> 02:17:46,479
the person with different way of looking
 

5437
02:17:46,479 --> 02:17:49,349
the person with different way of looking
at the charts I can see that we have

5438
02:17:49,349 --> 02:17:49,359
at the charts I can see that we have
 

5439
02:17:49,359 --> 02:17:52,309
at the charts I can see that we have
let's say some same bias for the move I

5440
02:17:52,309 --> 02:17:52,319
let's say some same bias for the move I
 

5441
02:17:52,319 --> 02:17:54,230
let's say some same bias for the move I
think you're saying so you look at the

5442
02:17:54,230 --> 02:17:54,240
think you're saying so you look at the
 

5443
02:17:54,240 --> 02:17:55,750
think you're saying so you look at the
charts differently but you're seeing the

5444
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:55,760
charts differently but you're seeing the
 

5445
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:58,389
charts differently but you're seeing the
same bias right now it's good like I

5446
02:17:58,389 --> 02:17:58,399
same bias right now it's good like I
 

5447
02:17:58,399 --> 02:18:01,110
same bias right now it's good like I

next node here. And the only thing left
 

5471
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:23,509
next node here. And the only thing left
right now is to get into this pocket up

02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:27,830
here. All right. So I would say there
were some sellers at 96s. The next one

5476
02:18:27,830 --> 02:18:27,840
were some sellers at 96s. The next one
 

5477
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:30,790
were some sellers at 96s. The next one
that stands out to me is 6 600 601. And

gr gray box. If we hold the gray box and
 

5493
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:48,389
gr gray box. If we hold the gray box and
we will look for expansion. All right,

02:20:52,790 --> 02:20:52,800
you do well.
 

5599
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:54,309
you do well.
Like I always talk about having the

5600
02:20:54,309 --> 02:20:54,319
Like I always talk about having the
 

5601
02:20:54,319 --> 02:20:56,150
Like I always talk about having the
eight iron. When you're a beginner at

5602
02:20:56,150 --> 02:20:56,160
eight iron. When you're a beginner at
 

5603
02:20:56,160 --> 02:20:58,150
eight iron. When you're a beginner at
golf, get around the course with an

5604
02:20:58,150 --> 02:20:58,160
golf, get around the course with an
 

5605
02:20:58,160 --> 02:21:01,590
golf, get around the course with an
eight iron. Leave the driver in the bag.

5606
02:21:01,590 --> 02:21:01,600
eight iron. Leave the driver in the bag.
 

5607
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:03,590
eight iron. Leave the driver in the bag.
All right. Don't get the driver out. You

5608
02:21:03,590 --> 02:21:03,600
All right. Don't get the driver out. You
 

5609
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:05,190
All right. Don't get the driver out. You
get the driver out, you're gonna put it

5610
02:21:05,190 --> 02:21:05,200
get the driver out, you're gonna put it
 

5611
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:07,670
get the driver out, you're gonna put it
in the pond. You're gonna, I don't know,

5612
02:21:07,670 --> 02:21:07,680
in the pond. You're gonna, I don't know,
 

5613
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:09,429
in the pond. You're gonna, I don't know,
maybe put it in a bunker. Maybe you get

5614
02:21:09,429 --> 02:21:09,439
maybe put it in a bunker. Maybe you get
 

5615
02:21:09,439 --> 02:21:11,429
maybe put it in a bunker. Maybe you get
so pissed off you smash the driver. All

5616
02:21:11,429 --> 02:21:11,439
so pissed off you smash the driver. All
 

5617
02:21:11,439 --> 02:21:12,870
so pissed off you smash the driver. All
right. Imagine that driver is your

5618
02:21:12,870 --> 02:21:12,880
right. Imagine that driver is your
 

5619
02:21:12,880 --> 02:21:14,550
right. Imagine that driver is your
trading screen. That's what happens when

5620
02:21:14,550 --> 02:21:14,560
trading screen. That's what happens when
 

5621
02:21:14,560 --> 02:21:16,230
trading screen. That's what happens when
you're oversized, when you take setups

5622
02:21:16,230 --> 02:21:16,240
you're oversized, when you take setups
 

5623
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:19,030
you're oversized, when you take setups
which are not in your wheelhouse. Let's

5624
02:21:19,030 --> 02:21:19,040
which are not in your wheelhouse. Let's
 

5625
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:21,910
which are not in your wheelhouse. Let's
say,

5626
02:21:21,910 --> 02:21:21,920
say,
 

5627
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:23,349
say,
am I one and done? At the moment, I'm

5628
02:21:23,349 --> 02:21:23,359
am I one and done? At the moment, I'm
 

5629
02:21:23,359 --> 02:21:25,030
am I one and done? At the moment, I'm
done with it. I will happily reload like

5630
02:21:25,030 --> 02:21:25,040
done with it. I will happily reload like
 

5631
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:27,670
done with it. I will happily reload like
I talked about. If I see right

5632
02:21:27,670 --> 02:21:27,680
I talked about. If I see right
 

5633
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:29,590
I talked about. If I see right
aggressive selling coming in here and no

5634
02:21:29,590 --> 02:21:29,600
aggressive selling coming in here and no
 

5635
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:32,710
aggressive selling coming in here and no
acceptance, if I see passive buyers

5636
02:21:32,710 --> 02:21:32,720
acceptance, if I see passive buyers
 

5637
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:34,550
acceptance, if I see passive buyers
holding price here and absorbing, I'm

5638
02:21:34,550 --> 02:21:34,560
holding price here and absorbing, I'm
 

5639
02:21:34,560 --> 02:21:36,070
holding price here and absorbing, I'm
willing to take this. What I'm aware of

5640
02:21:36,070 --> 02:21:36,080
willing to take this. What I'm aware of
 

5641
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:38,550
willing to take this. What I'm aware of
is that we can do a look above. We can

5642
02:21:38,550 --> 02:21:38,560
is that we can do a look above. We can
 

5643
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:40,469
is that we can do a look above. We can
fail. We do have weakness on the ES. So,

5644
02:21:40,469 --> 02:21:40,479
fail. We do have weakness on the ES. So,
 

5645
02:21:40,479 --> 02:21:43,030
fail. We do have weakness on the ES. So,
I'm just aware of it. If I see passive

5646
02:21:43,030 --> 02:21:43,040
I'm just aware of it. If I see passive
 

5647
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:45,110
I'm just aware of it. If I see passive
buying holding price like right now, we

5648
02:21:45,110 --> 02:21:45,120
buying holding price like right now, we
 

5649
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:46,630
buying holding price like right now, we
just had aggressive selling step in

5650
02:21:46,630 --> 02:21:46,640
just had aggressive selling step in
 

5651
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:49,110
just had aggressive selling step in
underneath 79 and 80. So, if we can't

5652
02:21:49,110 --> 02:21:49,120
underneath 79 and 80. So, if we can't
 

5653
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:50,309
underneath 79 and 80. So, if we can't
move under that, I'm going to know that

5654
02:21:50,309 --> 02:21:50,319
move under that, I'm going to know that
 

5655
02:21:50,319 --> 02:21:52,150
move under that, I'm going to know that
they're going to start to get stuck. But

5656
02:21:52,150 --> 02:21:52,160
they're going to start to get stuck. But
 

5657
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:53,590
they're going to start to get stuck. But
you know, we've got about 30 minutes

5658
02:21:53,590 --> 02:21:53,600
you know, we've got about 30 minutes
 

5659
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:55,830
you know, we've got about 30 minutes
left and I think, you know, we didn't

5660
02:21:55,830 --> 02:21:55,840
left and I think, you know, we didn't
 

5661
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:57,990
left and I think, you know, we didn't
get much, but there wasn't much to get.

5662
02:21:57,990 --> 02:21:58,000
get much, but there wasn't much to get.
 

5663
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,950
get much, but there wasn't much to get.
So, we got

5664
02:22:00,950 --> 02:22:00,960
So, we got
 

5665
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:05,190
So, we got
the reclaim.

5666
02:22:05,190 --> 02:22:05,200

 

5667
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:06,950

That's what we fought fought over today.

5668
02:22:06,950 --> 02:22:06,960
That's what we fought fought over today.
 

5669
02:22:06,960 --> 02:22:09,110
That's what we fought fought over today.
Like 25 30 points. That's all that's all

5670
02:22:09,110 --> 02:22:09,120
Like 25 30 points. That's all that's all
 

5671
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:11,270
Like 25 30 points. That's all that's all
we got to play with at the moment. Can

5672
02:22:11,270 --> 02:22:11,280
we got to play with at the moment. Can
 

5673
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:13,030
we got to play with at the moment. Can
we hold above this low volume node? If

5674
02:22:13,030 --> 02:22:13,040
we hold above this low volume node? If
 

5675
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:14,309
we hold above this low volume node? If
the answer is no, it's going to be a

5676
02:22:14,309 --> 02:22:14,319
the answer is no, it's going to be a
 

5677
02:22:14,319 --> 02:22:15,590
the answer is no, it's going to be a
problem. We can wash right back down.

5678
02:22:15,590 --> 02:22:15,600
problem. We can wash right back down.
 

5679
02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:17,110
problem. We can wash right back down.
Like I said, there there isn't much

5680
02:22:17,110 --> 02:22:17,120
Like I said, there there isn't much
 

5681
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:19,510
Like I said, there there isn't much
volume. I want you to understand, guys,

5682
02:22:19,510 --> 02:22:19,520
volume. I want you to understand, guys,
 

5683
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:22,309
volume. I want you to understand, guys,
when I'm looking at this,

5684
02:22:22,309 --> 02:22:22,319
when I'm looking at this,
 

5685
02:22:22,319 --> 02:22:25,429
when I'm looking at this,
right? I'm not seeing a huge amount of

5686
02:22:25,429 --> 02:22:25,439
right? I'm not seeing a huge amount of
 

5687
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:27,670
right? I'm not seeing a huge amount of
bid support here. All right, if we look

5688
02:22:27,670 --> 02:22:27,680
bid support here. All right, if we look
 

5689
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:29,110
bid support here. All right, if we look
at the amount of support here, we're

5690
02:22:29,110 --> 02:22:29,120
at the amount of support here, we're
 

5691
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:31,510
at the amount of support here, we're
looking at nine lots, 16 lots, right?

5692
02:22:31,510 --> 02:22:31,520
looking at nine lots, 16 lots, right?
 

5693
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:33,910
looking at nine lots, 16 lots, right?
I'm not seeing good bid support. I can

5694
02:22:33,910 --> 02:22:33,920
I'm not seeing good bid support. I can
 

5695
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:35,429
I'm not seeing good bid support. I can
see someone soaking because we've got a

5696
02:22:35,429 --> 02:22:35,439
see someone soaking because we've got a
 

5697
02:22:35,439 --> 02:22:37,670
see someone soaking because we've got a
64 lot on the cell. I might have to move

5698
02:22:37,670 --> 02:22:37,680
64 lot on the cell. I might have to move
 

5699
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:40,150
64 lot on the cell. I might have to move
this over. You can see that this area

5700
02:22:40,150 --> 02:22:40,160
this over. You can see that this area
 

5701
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:41,990
this over. You can see that this area
here, they are trying to absorb into

5702
02:22:41,990 --> 02:22:42,000
here, they are trying to absorb into
 

5703
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:45,429
here, they are trying to absorb into
these 77s, but I'm not seeing like us

5704
02:22:45,429 --> 02:22:45,439
these 77s, but I'm not seeing like us
 

5705
02:22:45,439 --> 02:22:47,510
these 77s, but I'm not seeing like us
walk up. And what I want to see is all

5706
02:22:47,510 --> 02:22:47,520
walk up. And what I want to see is all
 

5707
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:50,710
walk up. And what I want to see is all
of this disappear. I don't want any bids

5708
02:22:50,710 --> 02:22:50,720
of this disappear. I don't want any bids
 

5709
02:22:50,720 --> 02:22:52,150
of this disappear. I don't want any bids
underneath. I want to see them walk

5710
02:22:52,150 --> 02:22:52,160
underneath. I want to see them walk
 

5711
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:54,389
underneath. I want to see them walk
price up like they're trying to do now.

5712
02:22:54,389 --> 02:22:54,399
price up like they're trying to do now.
 

5713
02:22:54,399 --> 02:22:56,550
price up like they're trying to do now.
I want them to start moving their limits

5714
02:22:56,550 --> 02:22:56,560
I want them to start moving their limits
 

5715
02:22:56,560 --> 02:22:58,870
I want them to start moving their limits
up and up and up and up. And I want to

5716
02:22:58,870 --> 02:22:58,880
up and up and up and up. And I want to
 

5717
02:22:58,880 --> 02:23:01,110
up and up and up and up. And I want to
see these start to lift and disappear or

5718
02:23:01,110 --> 02:23:01,120
see these start to lift and disappear or
 

5719
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:04,870
see these start to lift and disappear or
get run over, which we are arguably have

5720
02:23:04,870 --> 02:23:04,880
get run over, which we are arguably have
 

5721
02:23:04,880 --> 02:23:05,990
get run over, which we are arguably have
a shot of doing. But what I don't want

5722
02:23:05,990 --> 02:23:06,000
a shot of doing. But what I don't want
 

5723
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,230
a shot of doing. But what I don't want
to see is this these these big gaps when

5724
02:23:08,230 --> 02:23:08,240
to see is this these these big gaps when
 

5725
02:23:08,240 --> 02:23:09,990
to see is this these these big gaps when
they're just removing themselves, right?

5726
02:23:09,990 --> 02:23:10,000
they're just removing themselves, right?
 

5727
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:11,110
they're just removing themselves, right?
Because it's not going to take a lot to

5728
02:23:11,110 --> 02:23:11,120
Because it's not going to take a lot to
 

5729
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:14,230
Because it's not going to take a lot to
sell through.

5730
02:23:14,230 --> 02:23:14,240
sell through.
 

5731
02:23:14,240 --> 02:23:15,670
sell through.
This is what I say, what I mean when I'm

5732
02:23:15,670 --> 02:23:15,680
This is what I say, what I mean when I'm
 

5733
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:17,190
This is what I say, what I mean when I'm
saying I'm I'm looking I'm watching the

5734
02:23:17,190 --> 02:23:17,200
saying I'm I'm looking I'm watching the
 

5735
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:19,429
saying I'm I'm looking I'm watching the
tape, right? When people say I'm tape

5736
02:23:19,429 --> 02:23:19,439
tape, right? When people say I'm tape
 

5737
02:23:19,439 --> 02:23:20,710
tape, right? When people say I'm tape
reading and they're looking at a candle,

5738
02:23:20,710 --> 02:23:20,720
reading and they're looking at a candle,
 

5739
02:23:20,720 --> 02:23:22,389
reading and they're looking at a candle,
just tell them to [\h__\h] off, right?

5740
02:23:22,389 --> 02:23:22,399
just tell them to [\h__\h] off, right?
 

5741
02:23:22,399 --> 02:23:24,950
just tell them to [\h__\h] off, right?
They're just conning you. That is not

5742
02:23:24,950 --> 02:23:24,960
They're just conning you. That is not
 

5743
02:23:24,960 --> 02:23:27,670
They're just conning you. That is not
tape reading. The word tape reading

5744
02:23:27,670 --> 02:23:27,680
tape reading. The word tape reading
 

5745
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:29,510
tape reading. The word tape reading
actually comes from not even looking at

5746
02:23:29,510 --> 02:23:29,520
actually comes from not even looking at
 

5747
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:31,510
actually comes from not even looking at
bookmap. It will come from looking at

5748
02:23:31,510 --> 02:23:31,520
bookmap. It will come from looking at
 

5749
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:34,309
bookmap. It will come from looking at
time and sales. That's tape reading. Can

5750
02:23:34,309 --> 02:23:34,319
time and sales. That's tape reading. Can
 

5751
02:23:34,319 --> 02:23:37,510
time and sales. That's tape reading. Can
I tape read? [\h__\h] no. I cannot read the

5752
02:23:37,510 --> 02:23:37,520
I tape read? [\h__\h] no. I cannot read the
 

5753
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:38,870
I tape read? [\h__\h] no. I cannot read the
time and sales. If you give me a time

5754
02:23:38,870 --> 02:23:38,880
time and sales. If you give me a time
 

5755
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:40,469
time and sales. If you give me a time
and sales, I can see when it's flashing

5756
02:23:40,469 --> 02:23:40,479
and sales, I can see when it's flashing
 

5757
02:23:40,479 --> 02:23:42,950
and sales, I can see when it's flashing
red and see when it's flashing green.

5758
02:23:42,950 --> 02:23:42,960
red and see when it's flashing green.
 

5759
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:44,870
red and see when it's flashing green.
Uh, but I wouldn't be able to tell you

5760
02:23:44,870 --> 02:23:44,880
Uh, but I wouldn't be able to tell you
 

5761
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:46,150
Uh, but I wouldn't be able to tell you
like a big order that went through

5762
02:23:46,150 --> 02:23:46,160
like a big order that went through
 

5763
02:23:46,160 --> 02:23:48,950
like a big order that went through
unless I have some kind of filter on it.

5764
02:23:48,950 --> 02:23:48,960
unless I have some kind of filter on it.
 

5765
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:51,030
unless I have some kind of filter on it.
Very hard, especially in a market like

5766
02:23:51,030 --> 02:23:51,040
Very hard, especially in a market like
 

5767
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:53,349
Very hard, especially in a market like
NQ to read read the tape that quickly,

5768
02:23:53,349 --> 02:23:53,359
NQ to read read the tape that quickly,
 

5769
02:23:53,359 --> 02:23:55,429
NQ to read read the tape that quickly,
which is why I use bookmap because it

5770
02:23:55,429 --> 02:23:55,439
which is why I use bookmap because it
 

5771
02:23:55,439 --> 02:23:57,670
which is why I use bookmap because it
leaves the orders on there for me to see

5772
02:23:57,670 --> 02:23:57,680
leaves the orders on there for me to see
 

5773
02:23:57,680 --> 02:24:11,830
leaves the orders on there for me to see
historical orders.

5774
02:24:11,830 --> 02:24:11,840

 

5775
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:14,230

What time frame do I use for uh what do

5776
02:24:14,230 --> 02:24:14,240
What time frame do I use for uh what do
 

5777
02:24:14,240 --> 02:24:16,630
What time frame do I use for uh what do
you mean random channel? I I start on a

5778
02:24:16,630 --> 02:24:16,640
you mean random channel? I I start on a
 

5779
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:19,190
you mean random channel? I I start on a
daily, right? We go from weekly to daily

5780
02:24:19,190 --> 02:24:19,200
daily, right? We go from weekly to daily
 

5781
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:21,510
daily, right? We go from weekly to daily
to for me, I normally skip four 4 hour

5782
02:24:21,510 --> 02:24:21,520
to for me, I normally skip four 4 hour
 

5783
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:23,270
to for me, I normally skip four 4 hour
because I can see it on an hourly bar,

5784
02:24:23,270 --> 02:24:23,280
because I can see it on an hourly bar,
 

5785
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:26,630
because I can see it on an hourly bar,
right? To hourly to 5 to one. And when

5786
02:24:26,630 --> 02:24:26,640
right? To hourly to 5 to one. And when
 

5787
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:27,990
right? To hourly to 5 to one. And when
I'm looking at the tape, there is no

5788
02:24:27,990 --> 02:24:28,000
I'm looking at the tape, there is no
 

5789
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:29,510
I'm looking at the tape, there is no
time frame. I'm just looking at where

5790
02:24:29,510 --> 02:24:29,520
time frame. I'm just looking at where
 

5791
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:39,190
time frame. I'm just looking at where
orders are placed.

5792
02:24:39,190 --> 02:24:39,200

 

5793
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:41,190

I actually compressed the delta profile

5794
02:24:41,190 --> 02:24:41,200
I actually compressed the delta profile
 

5795
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:43,190
I actually compressed the delta profile
by like four ticks. Two two ticks, mate.

5796
02:24:43,190 --> 02:24:43,200
by like four ticks. Two two ticks, mate.
 

5797
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:48,150
by like four ticks. Two two ticks, mate.
Two ticks for me.

5798
02:24:48,150 --> 02:24:48,160

 

5799
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:49,590

That's it. When they used to literally

5800
02:24:49,590 --> 02:24:49,600
That's it. When they used to literally
 

5801
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:51,349
That's it. When they used to literally
print trades. That's it. That's the time

5802
02:24:51,349 --> 02:24:51,359
print trades. That's it. That's the time
 

5803
02:24:51,359 --> 02:24:52,790
print trades. That's it. That's the time
and sales. It's like the receipt being

5804
02:24:52,790 --> 02:24:52,800
and sales. It's like the receipt being
 

5805
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:54,230
and sales. It's like the receipt being
printed. That's exactly what I'm talking

5806
02:24:54,230 --> 02:24:54,240
printed. That's exactly what I'm talking
 

5807
02:24:54,240 --> 02:24:55,670
printed. That's exactly what I'm talking
about. Now we have a digital time in

5808
02:24:55,670 --> 02:24:55,680
about. Now we have a digital time in
 

5809
02:24:55,680 --> 02:24:59,190
about. Now we have a digital time in
sales.

5810
02:24:59,190 --> 02:24:59,200

 

5811
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:01,429

Yeah, it's it's in the course um

5812
02:25:01,429 --> 02:25:01,439
Yeah, it's it's in the course um
 

5813
02:25:01,439 --> 02:25:02,870
Yeah, it's it's in the course um
technique, but I'll tell you now, I

5814
02:25:02,870 --> 02:25:02,880
technique, but I'll tell you now, I
 

5815
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:04,790
technique, but I'll tell you now, I
don't have any um there's no magic

5816
02:25:04,790 --> 02:25:04,800
don't have any um there's no magic
 

5817
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:07,270
don't have any um there's no magic
settings. Thank you. Yeah, it's all

5818
02:25:07,270 --> 02:25:07,280
settings. Thank you. Yeah, it's all
 

5819
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:09,750
settings. Thank you. Yeah, it's all
right. That's the fresh one. Thank you.

5820
02:25:09,750 --> 02:25:09,760
right. That's the fresh one. Thank you.
 

5821
02:25:09,760 --> 02:25:12,870
right. That's the fresh one. Thank you.
Um I don't have any magic settings,

5822
02:25:12,870 --> 02:25:12,880
Um I don't have any magic settings,
 

5823
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:16,790
Um I don't have any magic settings,
right? All I'm looking at is

5824
02:25:16,790 --> 02:25:16,800
right? All I'm looking at is
 

5825
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:19,429
right? All I'm looking at is
standard bookmap. The more important

5826
02:25:19,429 --> 02:25:19,439
standard bookmap. The more important
 

5827
02:25:19,439 --> 02:25:20,950
standard bookmap. The more important
thing for bookmap for me is the level

5828
02:25:20,950 --> 02:25:20,960
thing for bookmap for me is the level
 

5829
02:25:20,960 --> 02:25:24,309
thing for bookmap for me is the level
two uh where I want to look at the

5830
02:25:24,309 --> 02:25:24,319
two uh where I want to look at the
 

5831
02:25:24,319 --> 02:25:35,349
two uh where I want to look at the
volume profile delta.

5832
02:25:35,349 --> 02:25:35,359

 

5833
02:25:35,359 --> 02:25:37,110

By the way, what can you say about the

5834
02:25:37,110 --> 02:25:37,120
By the way, what can you say about the
 

5835
02:25:37,120 --> 02:25:38,790
By the way, what can you say about the
concepts of understanding the market in

5836
02:25:38,790 --> 02:25:38,800
concepts of understanding the market in
 

5837
02:25:38,800 --> 02:25:41,270
concepts of understanding the market in
the way that ICT teaches? Look, the way

5838
02:25:41,270 --> 02:25:41,280
the way that ICT teaches? Look, the way
 

5839
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:44,070
the way that ICT teaches? Look, the way
ICT teaches is good. There's no way of

5840
02:25:44,070 --> 02:25:44,080
ICT teaches is good. There's no way of
 

5841
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:47,349
ICT teaches is good. There's no way of
like I I'm not going to deny his his

5842
02:25:47,349 --> 02:25:47,359
like I I'm not going to deny his his
 

5843
02:25:47,359 --> 02:25:48,870
like I I'm not going to deny his his
teachings are not bad. You have to

5844
02:25:48,870 --> 02:25:48,880
teachings are not bad. You have to
 

5845
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:51,110
teachings are not bad. You have to
understand that most of them come from

5846
02:25:51,110 --> 02:25:51,120
understand that most of them come from
 

5847
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:53,030
understand that most of them come from
WOFF. All right? the theory like the

5848
02:25:53,030 --> 02:25:53,040
WOFF. All right? the theory like the
 

5849
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:55,110
WOFF. All right? the theory like the
algorith you understand him saying that

5850
02:25:55,110 --> 02:25:55,120
algorith you understand him saying that
 

5851
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:57,270
algorith you understand him saying that
one algo controls the market that is the

5852
02:25:57,270 --> 02:25:57,280
one algo controls the market that is the
 

5853
02:25:57,280 --> 02:25:59,270
one algo controls the market that is the
same as wov saying one man controls the

5854
02:25:59,270 --> 02:25:59,280
same as wov saying one man controls the
 

5855
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:00,630
same as wov saying one man controls the
market it's the way of viewing the

5856
02:26:00,630 --> 02:26:00,640
market it's the way of viewing the
 

5857
02:26:00,640 --> 02:26:02,630
market it's the way of viewing the
market it's how I view the market I

5858
02:26:02,630 --> 02:26:02,640
market it's how I view the market I
 

5859
02:26:02,640 --> 02:26:04,230
market it's how I view the market I
don't actually believe a single

5860
02:26:04,230 --> 02:26:04,240
don't actually believe a single
 

5861
02:26:04,240 --> 02:26:06,309
don't actually believe a single
algorithm controls the market what

5862
02:26:06,309 --> 02:26:06,319
algorithm controls the market what
 

5863
02:26:06,319 --> 02:26:07,990
algorithm controls the market what
actually controls the market are

5864
02:26:07,990 --> 02:26:08,000
actually controls the market are
 

5865
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,670
actually controls the market are
institutions and volume that's what

5866
02:26:09,670 --> 02:26:09,680
institutions and volume that's what
 

5867
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:11,429
institutions and volume that's what
controls the market real buyers real

5868
02:26:11,429 --> 02:26:11,439
controls the market real buyers real
 

5869
02:26:11,439 --> 02:26:15,510
controls the market real buyers real
sellers um the idea of a fair value gap

5870
02:26:15,510 --> 02:26:15,520
sellers um the idea of a fair value gap
 

5871
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:17,510
sellers um the idea of a fair value gap
is just an imbalance it's an aggressive

5872
02:26:17,510 --> 02:26:17,520
is just an imbalance it's an aggressive
 

5873
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:19,830
is just an imbalance it's an aggressive
engulfing candle that moves away from an

5874
02:26:19,830 --> 02:26:19,840
engulfing candle that moves away from an
 

5875
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:22,550
engulfing candle that moves away from an
area and leaves a gap in price. Can you

5876
02:26:22,550 --> 02:26:22,560
area and leaves a gap in price. Can you
 

5877
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:24,070
area and leaves a gap in price. Can you
actually see the gap in price? Well, I

5878
02:26:24,070 --> 02:26:24,080
actually see the gap in price? Well, I
 

5879
02:26:24,080 --> 02:26:27,190
actually see the gap in price? Well, I
can tell you now this gap here. I'd much

5880
02:26:27,190 --> 02:26:27,200
can tell you now this gap here. I'd much
 

5881
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:29,750
can tell you now this gap here. I'd much
rather look to see if there's actually a

5882
02:26:29,750 --> 02:26:29,760
rather look to see if there's actually a
 

5883
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:31,270
rather look to see if there's actually a
genuine imbalance. And look where the

5884
02:26:31,270 --> 02:26:31,280
genuine imbalance. And look where the
 

5885
02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:33,990
genuine imbalance. And look where the
imbalance is. It's actually up at 90 to

5886
02:26:33,990 --> 02:26:34,000
imbalance is. It's actually up at 90 to
 

5887
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,870
imbalance is. It's actually up at 90 to
94. If we come over to here, what's it

5888
02:26:36,870 --> 02:26:36,880
94. If we come over to here, what's it
 

5889
02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:39,750
94. If we come over to here, what's it
showing? 90 to 94. So, the imbalance is

5890
02:26:39,750 --> 02:26:39,760
showing? 90 to 94. So, the imbalance is
 

5891
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:41,750
showing? 90 to 94. So, the imbalance is
actually higher, not where you would see

5892
02:26:41,750 --> 02:26:41,760
actually higher, not where you would see
 

5893
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:44,230
actually higher, not where you would see
it on a fair value gap. So, the

5894
02:26:44,230 --> 02:26:44,240
it on a fair value gap. So, the
 

5895
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:45,910
it on a fair value gap. So, the
teachings are good, but they wouldn't

5896
02:26:45,910 --> 02:26:45,920
teachings are good, but they wouldn't
 

5897
02:26:45,920 --> 02:26:48,070
teachings are good, but they wouldn't
they're not necessarily accurate, right?

5898
02:26:48,070 --> 02:26:48,080
they're not necessarily accurate, right?
 

5899
02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:49,910
they're not necessarily accurate, right?
That's best way of putting it. Well, I

5900
02:26:49,910 --> 02:26:49,920
That's best way of putting it. Well, I
 

5901
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:51,030
That's best way of putting it. Well, I
would actually say the imbalance is

5902
02:26:51,030 --> 02:26:51,040
would actually say the imbalance is
 

5903
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:55,110
would actually say the imbalance is
actually 90 to 92. Um, teachings are

5904
02:26:55,110 --> 02:26:55,120
actually 90 to 92. Um, teachings are
 

5905
02:26:55,120 --> 02:26:57,510
actually 90 to 92. Um, teachings are
good, but uh, lots of it is made overly

5906
02:26:57,510 --> 02:26:57,520
good, but uh, lots of it is made overly
 

5907
02:26:57,520 --> 02:27:00,150
good, but uh, lots of it is made overly
complicated. Order block, I'd call that

5908
02:27:00,150 --> 02:27:00,160
complicated. Order block, I'd call that
 

5909
02:27:00,160 --> 02:27:02,309
complicated. Order block, I'd call that
flip block. What is it? It's SNR.

5910
02:27:02,309 --> 02:27:02,319
flip block. What is it? It's SNR.
 

5911
02:27:02,319 --> 02:27:03,670
flip block. What is it? It's SNR.
Resistance becomes support. Support

5912
02:27:03,670 --> 02:27:03,680
Resistance becomes support. Support
 

5913
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:08,070
Resistance becomes support. Support
comes resistance. That's all it is.

5914
02:27:08,070 --> 02:27:08,080

 

5915
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:09,590

How many rows do you use in your

5916
02:27:09,590 --> 02:27:09,600
How many rows do you use in your
 

5917
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:11,830
How many rows do you use in your
anchored session volume? Uh, yeah, you

5918
02:27:11,830 --> 02:27:11,840
anchored session volume? Uh, yeah, you
 

5919
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:13,510
anchored session volume? Uh, yeah, you
can use a thousand or I've actually got

5920
02:27:13,510 --> 02:27:13,520
can use a thousand or I've actually got
 

5921
02:27:13,520 --> 02:27:15,830
can use a thousand or I've actually got
it set to tick, right? So, I have it

5922
02:27:15,830 --> 02:27:15,840
it set to tick, right? So, I have it
 

5923
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:19,270
it set to tick, right? So, I have it
ticks per row set to two. But you if not

5924
02:27:19,270 --> 02:27:19,280
ticks per row set to two. But you if not
 

5925
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:20,870
ticks per row set to two. But you if not
I would have numbers of rows and I'd

5926
02:27:20,870 --> 02:27:20,880
I would have numbers of rows and I'd
 

5927
02:27:20,880 --> 02:27:22,870
I would have numbers of rows and I'd
have it set to a th00and. Okay, have it

5928
02:27:22,870 --> 02:27:22,880
have it set to a th00and. Okay, have it
 

5929
02:27:22,880 --> 02:27:24,790
have it set to a th00and. Okay, have it
set to a th00and. So you can see we came

5930
02:27:24,790 --> 02:27:24,800
set to a th00and. So you can see we came
 

5931
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:26,389
set to a th00and. So you can see we came
right up to the top of that imbalance.

5932
02:27:26,389 --> 02:27:26,399
right up to the top of that imbalance.
 

5933
02:27:26,399 --> 02:27:28,950
right up to the top of that imbalance.
All right, right up to 90. Not into this

5934
02:27:28,950 --> 02:27:28,960
All right, right up to 90. Not into this
 

5935
02:27:28,960 --> 02:27:30,790
All right, right up to 90. Not into this
low part. Right up into 90. And the

5936
02:27:30,790 --> 02:27:30,800
low part. Right up into 90. And the
 

5937
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:34,230
low part. Right up into 90. And the
imbalance goes to 91.75.

5938
02:27:34,230 --> 02:27:34,240
imbalance goes to 91.75.
 

5939
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:41,190
imbalance goes to 91.75.
Right. So this is a prime example.

5940
02:27:41,190 --> 02:27:41,200

 

5941
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:42,710

No, right now you're looking at a one

5942
02:27:42,710 --> 02:27:42,720
No, right now you're looking at a one
 

5943
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:45,910
No, right now you're looking at a one
minute chart.

5944
02:27:45,910 --> 02:27:45,920
minute chart.
 

5945
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:55,510
minute chart.
Auction market theory. Yeah, correct.

5946
02:27:55,510 --> 02:27:55,520

 

5947
02:27:55,520 --> 02:27:58,790

Uh, you're probably right there. Um,

5948
02:27:58,790 --> 02:27:58,800
Uh, you're probably right there. Um,
 

5949
02:27:58,800 --> 02:28:00,950
Uh, you're probably right there. Um,
dubia dub dubia. Have I said it right?

02:28:09,030 --> 02:28:09,040
You're probably right.

You're probably right.

And we have a pretty good track record
 

5983
02:28:36,399 --> 02:28:38,150
And we have a pretty good track record
on stream. I don't think I've had too

5984
02:28:38,150 --> 02:28:38,160
on stream. I don't think I've had too
 

5985
02:28:38,160 --> 02:28:40,710
on stream. I don't think I've had too
many red days this year. There's been

5986
02:28:40,710 --> 02:28:40,720
many red days this year. There's been
 

5987
02:28:40,720 --> 02:28:42,309
many red days this year. There's been
definitely been some obviously, but

5988

definitely been some obviously, but
 

5989
02:28:42,319 --> 02:28:43,750
definitely been some obviously, but
there hasn't been too many. And the ones

5990
02:28:43,750 --> 02:28:43,760
there hasn't been too many. And the ones
 

5991
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:45,590
there hasn't been too many. And the ones
that have happened where it's been big

5992
02:28:45,590 --> 02:28:45,600
that have happened where it's been big
 

5993
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:48,070
that have happened where it's been big
red. The ones that stand out in mind is

5994
02:28:48,070 --> 02:28:48,080
red. The ones that stand out in mind is
 

5995
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:50,309
red. The ones that stand out in mind is
when I had Ninja Trader fail on me and

5996
02:28:50,309 --> 02:28:50,319
when I had Ninja Trader fail on me and
 

5997
02:28:50,319 --> 02:28:52,710
when I had Ninja Trader fail on me and
start reversing my uh positions, which

start reversing my uh positions, which
 

5999
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:54,309
start reversing my uh positions, which
was

6000
02:28:54,309 --> 02:28:54,319
was
 

6001
02:28:54,319 --> 02:28:56,230
was
deeply upsetting, but I battled out of

6002
02:28:56,230 --> 02:28:56,240
deeply upsetting, but I battled out of
 

6003
02:28:56,240 --> 02:28:58,150
deeply upsetting, but I battled out of
it over a twoe period, which is good.

6004
02:28:58,150 --> 02:28:58,160
it over a twoe period, which is good.

And if they get through this, they get

6034
02:29:36,309 --> 02:29:36,319
And if they get through this, they get
 

6035

Right, we could look for a trade from

6090
02:30:50,870 --> 02:30:50,880
Right, we could look for a trade from
 

6091
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:53,429
Right, we could look for a trade from
here down to 50% if we get lucky right

6092
02:30:53,429 --> 02:30:53,439
here down to 50% if we get lucky right
 

6093
02:30:53,439 --> 02:30:55,830
here down to 50% if we get lucky right
back into this pocket. And then normally

6094
02:30:55,830 --> 02:30:55,840
back into this pocket. And then normally
 

6095
02:30:55,840 --> 02:30:58,230
back into this pocket. And then normally
what happens in on golds and silver and

6096
02:30:58,230 --> 02:30:58,240
what happens in on golds and silver and
 

6097

copper is this consolidation can happen
 

6099
02:31:00,160 --> 02:31:02,230
copper is this consolidation can happen
over months. So in here we might well do

6100
02:31:02,230 --> 02:31:02,240
over months. So in here we might well do
 

6101
02:31:02,240 --> 02:31:04,870
over months. So in here we might well do
this and have a reattempt later into

6102
02:31:04,870 --> 02:31:04,880
this and have a reattempt later into
 

6103
02:31:04,880 --> 02:31:07,510
this and have a reattempt later into
March. Really depends

6104
02:31:07,510 --> 02:31:07,520
March. Really depends
 

6105
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:09,990

knowing who's trapped in a market. And
 

6207
02:34:03,359 --> 02:34:04,630
knowing who's trapped in a market. And
uh you're not always going to get that

6208
02:34:04,630 --> 02:34:04,640
uh you're not always going to get that
 

6209
02:34:04,640 --> 02:34:06,790
uh you're not always going to get that

So, really, this is all I'm looking at

6296
02:35:57,910 --> 02:35:57,920
So, really, this is all I'm looking at
 

6297
02:35:57,920 --> 02:36:00,630
So, really, this is all I'm looking at
and volume. I don't necessarily need

6298
02:36:00,630 --> 02:36:00,640
and volume. I don't necessarily need
 

6299
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:04,150
and volume. I don't necessarily need
this, but it just for me, this keeps me

6300
02:36:04,150 --> 02:36:04,160
this, but it just for me, this keeps me
 

6301
02:36:04,160 --> 02:36:05,990
this, but it just for me, this keeps me
the right side of of the trade. Like, if

6302
02:36:05,990 --> 02:36:06,000
the right side of of the trade. Like, if
 

6303
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:07,590
the right side of of the trade. Like, if
we're in a trend, I want to fade it.

6304
02:36:07,590 --> 02:36:07,600
we're in a trend, I want to fade it.
 

6305
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:09,670
we're in a trend, I want to fade it.
Like, you can argue today like, should I

6306
02:36:09,670 --> 02:36:09,680
Like, you can argue today like, should I
 

6307
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:11,670
Like, you can argue today like, should I
have just listened to my indicator? I

6308
02:36:11,670 --> 02:36:11,680
have just listened to my indicator? I
 

6309
02:36:11,680 --> 02:36:13,349
have just listened to my indicator? I
mean, it gave me a sell signal. We

6310
02:36:13,349 --> 02:36:13,359
mean, it gave me a sell signal. We
 

6311
02:36:13,359 --> 02:36:15,910
mean, it gave me a sell signal. We
rejected point of control. We rejected

6312
02:36:15,910 --> 02:36:15,920
rejected point of control. We rejected
 

6313
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:17,910
rejected point of control. We rejected
this. Should I have just faded the

6314
02:36:17,910 --> 02:36:17,920
this. Should I have just faded the
 

6315
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:20,070
this. Should I have just faded the
opening drive? Well, the answer is

6316
02:36:20,070 --> 02:36:20,080
opening drive? Well, the answer is
 

6317
02:36:20,080 --> 02:36:22,389
opening drive? Well, the answer is
clearly yes. I didn't feel comfortable

6318
02:36:22,389 --> 02:36:22,399
clearly yes. I didn't feel comfortable
 

6319
02:36:22,399 --> 02:36:24,230
clearly yes. I didn't feel comfortable
putting size on in a low volume market

6320
02:36:24,230 --> 02:36:24,240
putting size on in a low volume market
 

6321
02:36:24,240 --> 02:36:26,870
putting size on in a low volume market
on the opening drive today. But we

6322
02:36:26,870 --> 02:36:26,880
on the opening drive today. But we
 

6323
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:28,630
on the opening drive today. But we
talked about what did we talk about

6324
02:36:28,630 --> 02:36:28,640
talked about what did we talk about
 

6325
02:36:28,640 --> 02:36:30,710
talked about what did we talk about
having to hold? If it didn't hold 680s,

6326
02:36:30,710 --> 02:36:30,720
having to hold? If it didn't hold 680s,
 

6327
02:36:30,720 --> 02:36:33,510
having to hold? If it didn't hold 680s,
we were going to rotate

6328
02:36:33,510 --> 02:36:33,520
we were going to rotate
 

6329
02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:36,150
we were going to rotate
to 630s. And if we didn't hold that, we

6330
02:36:36,150 --> 02:36:36,160
to 630s. And if we didn't hold that, we
 

6331
02:36:36,160 --> 02:36:38,150
to 630s. And if we didn't hold that, we
were going to rotate to 520s. And we did

6332
02:36:38,150 --> 02:36:38,160
were going to rotate to 520s. And we did
 

6333
02:36:38,160 --> 02:36:41,510
were going to rotate to 520s. And we did
all of them. One, two. I mean, we've

6334
02:36:41,510 --> 02:36:41,520
all of them. One, two. I mean, we've
 

6335
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:43,429
all of them. One, two. I mean, we've
just missed this.

6336
02:36:43,429 --> 02:36:43,439
just missed this.
 

6337
02:36:43,439 --> 02:36:45,510
just missed this.
So maybe

6338
02:36:45,510 --> 02:36:45,520
So maybe
 

6339
02:36:45,520 --> 02:36:48,630
So maybe
ignoring it was foolish of me today. But

6340
02:36:48,630 --> 02:36:48,640
ignoring it was foolish of me today. But
 

6341
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:52,870
ignoring it was foolish of me today. But
there we go.

6342

6347
02:36:57,200 --> 02:37:04,309
at least I didn't fight it the other
way.

So now they're going to try and produce

6574
02:43:04,230 --> 02:43:04,240
So now they're going to try and produce
 

6575

So now they're going to try and produce
a higher low and complete this squeeze

6576
02:43:06,550 --> 02:43:06,560
a higher low and complete this squeeze
 

6577
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:08,309

6607
02:43:52,319 --> 02:43:53,750
trying to get up to 6604. All right,
this is where they're trying to get up

6608
02:43:53,750 --> 02:43:53,760
this is where they're trying to get up
 

6609

this is where they're trying to get up
to at the moment. So those of you who

6610
02:43:55,429 --> 02:43:55,439
to at the moment. So those of you who
 

6611
02:43:55,439 --> 02:43:56,870
to at the moment. So those of you who
are still long, that's where you're

6612
02:43:56,870 --> 02:43:56,880
are still long, that's where you're
 

6613
02:43:56,880 --> 02:43:59,750
are still long, that's where you're
trying to get up to 600 604 and this

6614
02:43:59,750 --> 02:43:59,760
trying to get up to 600 604 and this
 

6615
02:43:59,760 --> 02:44:01,750
trying to get up to 600 604 and this
kind of level here 602. So you want to

6616
02:44:01,750 --> 02:44:01,760
kind of level here 602. So you want to
 

6617
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:03,190
kind of level here 602. So you want to
get through this node, through the low

6618
02:44:03,190 --> 02:44:03,200
get through this node, through the low
 

6619
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:05,269
get through this node, through the low
low volume node up into 602. So if

6620
02:44:05,269 --> 02:44:05,279
low volume node up into 602. So if
 

6621
02:44:05,279 --> 02:44:07,349
low volume node up into 602. So if
you're still long from this gray box,

6622
02:44:07,349 --> 02:44:07,359
you're still long from this gray box,
 

6623
02:44:07,359 --> 02:44:08,309
you're still long from this gray box,
this is what you're looking for. This is

6624
02:44:08,309 --> 02:44:08,319
this is what you're looking for. This is
 

6625
02:44:08,319 --> 02:44:10,550
this is what you're looking for. This is
the higher low now being set. Right? So

6626
02:44:10,550 --> 02:44:10,560
the higher low now being set. Right? So
 

6627
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:12,389
the higher low now being set. Right? So
they did one, two. This is the failed

6628
02:44:12,389 --> 02:44:12,399
they did one, two. This is the failed
 

6629
02:44:12,399 --> 02:44:14,469
they did one, two. This is the failed
attempt to move lower. We should come up

6630
02:44:14,469 --> 02:44:14,479
attempt to move lower. We should come up
 

6631
02:44:14,479 --> 02:44:17,110
attempt to move lower. We should come up
into here. And if they if you get lucky,

6632
02:44:17,110 --> 02:44:17,120
into here. And if they if you get lucky,
 

6633
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:19,110
into here. And if they if you get lucky,
you get this. So if you are long, you

6634
02:44:19,110 --> 02:44:19,120
you get this. So if you are long, you
 

6635
02:44:19,120 --> 02:44:20,710
you get this. So if you are long, you
want to be trimming some into this and

6636
02:44:20,710 --> 02:44:20,720
want to be trimming some into this and
 

6637
02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:22,790
want to be trimming some into this and
hoping you complete the move. There is

6638
02:44:22,790 --> 02:44:22,800
hoping you complete the move. There is
 

6639
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:24,710
hoping you complete the move. There is
absolutely no guarantee in this market

6640
02:44:24,710 --> 02:44:24,720
absolutely no guarantee in this market
 

6641
02:44:24,720 --> 02:44:26,630
absolutely no guarantee in this market
that you will get up into here. So you

6642
02:44:26,630 --> 02:44:26,640
that you will get up into here. So you
 

6643
02:44:26,640 --> 02:44:29,590
that you will get up into here. So you
will pay yourself into this move.

6644
02:44:29,590 --> 02:44:29,600
will pay yourself into this move.
 

6645
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:30,870
will pay yourself into this move.
All right. Maybe if I wasn't doing the

6646
02:44:30,870 --> 02:44:30,880
All right. Maybe if I wasn't doing the
 

6647
02:44:30,880 --> 02:44:32,070
All right. Maybe if I wasn't doing the
giveaway, I should have been a little

6648
02:44:32,070 --> 02:44:32,080
giveaway, I should have been a little
 

6649
02:44:32,080 --> 02:44:33,830
giveaway, I should have been a little
bit more focused in here to grab some of

6650
02:44:33,830 --> 02:44:33,840
bit more focused in here to grab some of
 

6651
02:44:33,840 --> 02:44:35,190
bit more focused in here to grab some of
this. It's probably going to work quite

6652
02:44:35,190 --> 02:44:35,200
this. It's probably going to work quite
 

6653
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:39,429
this. It's probably going to work quite
nicely.

6654
02:44:39,429 --> 02:44:39,439

 

6655
02:44:39,439 --> 02:44:41,670

Would you agree? Um, like I said,
 

6669
02:45:00,399 --> 02:45:02,790
Would you agree? Um, like I said,
this part of it is, but what I would say

6670
02:45:02,790 --> 02:45:02,800
this part of it is, but what I would say
 

6671
02:45:02,800 --> 02:45:05,590
this part of it is, but what I would say
is context. All right. Yes, I would say

6672
02:45:05,590 --> 02:45:05,600
is context. All right. Yes, I would say
 

6673
02:45:05,600 --> 02:45:07,510
is context. All right. Yes, I would say
that's B. The problem that you're going

6674
02:45:07,510 --> 02:45:07,520
that's B. The problem that you're going
 

6675
02:45:07,520 --> 02:45:09,830
that's B. The problem that you're going
to have is this part of the move

6676
02:45:09,830 --> 02:45:09,840
to have is this part of the move
 

6677
02:45:09,840 --> 02:45:12,150
to have is this part of the move
happened very early. Most of this, if

6678
02:45:12,150 --> 02:45:12,160
happened very early. Most of this, if
 

6679
02:45:12,160 --> 02:45:14,309
happened very early. Most of this, if
you ignore the opening, how many minutes

6680
02:45:14,309 --> 02:45:14,319
you ignore the opening, how many minutes
 

6681
02:45:14,319 --> 02:45:16,710
you ignore the opening, how many minutes
is this? You ignore the opening three

6682
02:45:16,710 --> 02:45:16,720
is this? You ignore the opening three
 

6683
02:45:16,720 --> 02:45:18,150
is this? You ignore the opening three
minutes, four minutes, what are we

6684
02:45:18,150 --> 02:45:18,160
minutes, four minutes, what are we
 

6685
02:45:18,160 --> 02:45:20,950
minutes, four minutes, what are we
actually in? More of a D. All right,

6686
02:45:20,950 --> 02:45:20,960
actually in? More of a D. All right,
 

6687
02:45:20,960 --> 02:45:23,190
actually in? More of a D. All right,
more of a D shape. So, the question for

6688
02:45:23,190 --> 02:45:23,200
more of a D shape. So, the question for
 

6689
02:45:23,200 --> 02:45:25,670
more of a D shape. So, the question for
me would be, do they respect this or

6690
02:45:25,670 --> 02:45:25,680
me would be, do they respect this or
 

6691
02:45:25,680 --> 02:45:27,349
me would be, do they respect this or
not? This is why I'm saying pay yourself

6692
02:45:27,349 --> 02:45:27,359
not? This is why I'm saying pay yourself
 

6693
02:45:27,359 --> 02:45:29,590
not? This is why I'm saying pay yourself
into this and you just [\h__\h] don't

6694
02:45:29,590 --> 02:45:29,600
into this and you just [\h__\h] don't
 

6695
02:45:29,600 --> 02:45:33,110
into this and you just [\h__\h] don't
know because we're such low volume.

6696
02:45:33,110 --> 02:45:33,120
know because we're such low volume.
 

6697
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:34,550
know because we're such low volume.
I would agree with you that we have

6698
02:45:34,550 --> 02:45:34,560
I would agree with you that we have
 

6699
02:45:34,560 --> 02:45:37,429
I would agree with you that we have
reacted all right from previous week and

6700
02:45:37,429 --> 02:45:37,439
reacted all right from previous week and
 

6701
02:45:37,439 --> 02:45:39,429
reacted all right from previous week and
previous day, right? We've left previous

6702
02:45:39,429 --> 02:45:39,439
previous day, right? We've left previous
 

6703
02:45:39,439 --> 02:45:42,710
previous day, right? We've left previous
day. We've left current week. We reacted

6704
02:45:42,710 --> 02:45:42,720
day. We've left current week. We reacted
 

6705
02:45:42,720 --> 02:45:44,790
day. We've left current week. We reacted
and came down. But we're finding a bid

6706
02:45:44,790 --> 02:45:44,800
and came down. But we're finding a bid
 

6707
02:45:44,800 --> 02:45:47,590
and came down. But we're finding a bid
where we just zoom out here. We go to

6708
02:45:47,590 --> 02:45:47,600
where we just zoom out here. We go to
 

6709
02:45:47,600 --> 02:45:53,349
where we just zoom out here. We go to
like a 30 minute

6710
02:45:53,349 --> 02:45:53,359

 

6711
02:45:53,359 --> 02:45:55,590

in front of this old balance, right? And

6712
02:45:55,590 --> 02:45:55,600
in front of this old balance, right? And
 

6713
02:45:55,600 --> 02:46:01,990
in front of this old balance, right? And
this big old fat node.

6714
02:46:01,990 --> 02:46:02,000

 

6715
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,070

Old range.

6716
02:46:04,070 --> 02:46:04,080
Old range.
 

6717
02:46:04,080 --> 02:46:06,630
Old range.
Old range.

6718
02:46:06,630 --> 02:46:06,640
Old range.
 

6719
02:46:06,640 --> 02:46:08,630
Old range.
Old range. This is why I'm saying I

6720
02:46:08,630 --> 02:46:08,640
Old range. This is why I'm saying I
 

6721
02:46:08,640 --> 02:46:12,870
Old range. This is why I'm saying I
don't want to be uber biased because if

6722
02:46:12,870 --> 02:46:12,880
don't want to be uber biased because if
 

6723
02:46:12,880 --> 02:46:15,030
don't want to be uber biased because if
we do this, I will be biased for this

6724
02:46:15,030 --> 02:46:15,040
we do this, I will be biased for this
 

6725
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:18,309
we do this, I will be biased for this
move, right? Cuz I know we will want to

6726
02:46:18,309 --> 02:46:18,319
move, right? Cuz I know we will want to
 

6727
02:46:18,319 --> 02:46:22,070
move, right? Cuz I know we will want to
repric that. This is your old naked PC.

6728
02:46:22,070 --> 02:46:22,080
repric that. This is your old naked PC.
 

6729
02:46:22,080 --> 02:46:23,429
repric that. This is your old naked PC.
That's when I'll start thinking, okay,

6730
02:46:23,429 --> 02:46:23,439
That's when I'll start thinking, okay,
 

6731
02:46:23,439 --> 02:46:25,269
That's when I'll start thinking, okay,
we can break down, right? And once we

6732
02:46:25,269 --> 02:46:25,279
we can break down, right? And once we
 

6733
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:26,790
we can break down, right? And once we
get down here, this is what I'll be

6734
02:46:26,790 --> 02:46:26,800
get down here, this is what I'll be
 

6735
02:46:26,800 --> 02:46:28,150
get down here, this is what I'll be
looking for early next year or this

6736
02:46:28,150 --> 02:46:28,160
looking for early next year or this
 

6737
02:46:28,160 --> 02:46:29,670
looking for early next year or this
year. If we want to do this, that's

6738
02:46:29,670 --> 02:46:29,680
year. If we want to do this, that's
 

6739
02:46:29,680 --> 02:46:31,670
year. If we want to do this, that's
fine. If we do something like this,

6740
02:46:31,670 --> 02:46:31,680
fine. If we do something like this,
 

6741
02:46:31,680 --> 02:46:33,670
fine. If we do something like this,
right, then I'll bid back up, right? If

6742
02:46:33,670 --> 02:46:33,680
right, then I'll bid back up, right? If
 

6743
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:35,190
right, then I'll bid back up, right? If
we fail this, then I'll play the

6744
02:46:35,190 --> 02:46:35,200
we fail this, then I'll play the
 

6745
02:46:35,200 --> 02:46:38,070
we fail this, then I'll play the
continuation back down into here and

6746
02:46:38,070 --> 02:46:38,080
continuation back down into here and
 

6747
02:46:38,080 --> 02:46:40,710
continuation back down into here and
here. I don't want to be uber biased at

6748
02:46:40,710 --> 02:46:40,720
here. I don't want to be uber biased at
 

6749
02:46:40,720 --> 02:46:41,990
here. I don't want to be uber biased at
this point of the range because we think

6750
02:46:41,990 --> 02:46:42,000
this point of the range because we think
 

6751
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:45,190
this point of the range because we think
about swing low, swing high can still be

6752
02:46:45,190 --> 02:46:45,200
about swing low, swing high can still be
 

6753
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:47,190
about swing low, swing high can still be
pulled back for a continuation. I know

6754
02:46:47,190 --> 02:46:47,200
pulled back for a continuation. I know
 

6755
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:48,710
pulled back for a continuation. I know
everyone's looking for this, but until

6756
02:46:48,710 --> 02:46:48,720
everyone's looking for this, but until
 

6757
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:50,550
everyone's looking for this, but until
we really show acceptance into this

6758
02:46:50,550 --> 02:46:50,560
we really show acceptance into this
 

6759
02:46:50,560 --> 02:46:53,670
we really show acceptance into this
range, I want to be cautious.

6760
02:46:53,670 --> 02:46:53,680
range, I want to be cautious.
 

6761
02:46:53,680 --> 02:46:55,190
range, I want to be cautious.
Here we go. So, you're lifting. You look

6762
02:46:55,190 --> 02:46:55,200
Here we go. So, you're lifting. You look
 

6763
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:57,110
Here we go. So, you're lifting. You look
really good. Anyone who took that, you

6764
02:46:57,110 --> 02:46:57,120
really good. Anyone who took that, you
 

6765
02:46:57,120 --> 02:46:59,830
really good. Anyone who took that, you
look fantastic here. So, it's the 603

6766
02:46:59,830 --> 02:46:59,840
look fantastic here. So, it's the 603
 

6767
02:46:59,840 --> 02:47:02,630
look fantastic here. So, it's the 603
604s. I think I said uh 608 is the next

6768
02:47:02,630 --> 02:47:02,640
604s. I think I said uh 608 is the next
 

6769
02:47:02,640 --> 02:47:05,990
604s. I think I said uh 608 is the next
level. And I would be trimming a good

6770
02:47:05,990 --> 02:47:06,000
level. And I would be trimming a good
 

6771
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:07,830
level. And I would be trimming a good
chunk of your position. If you took the

6772
02:47:07,830 --> 02:47:07,840
chunk of your position. If you took the
 

6773
02:47:07,840 --> 02:47:10,070
chunk of your position. If you took the
long out the gray box we talked about

6774
02:47:10,070 --> 02:47:10,080
long out the gray box we talked about
 

6775
02:47:10,080 --> 02:47:12,309
long out the gray box we talked about
pulling back into and holding or if you

6776
02:47:12,309 --> 02:47:12,319
pulling back into and holding or if you
 

6777
02:47:12,319 --> 02:47:14,070
pulling back into and holding or if you
took this break here for the higher low

6778
02:47:14,070 --> 02:47:14,080
took this break here for the higher low
 

6779
02:47:14,080 --> 02:47:16,950
took this break here for the higher low
creation, right? Trim into here. Hold

6780
02:47:16,950 --> 02:47:16,960
creation, right? Trim into here. Hold
 

6781
02:47:16,960 --> 02:47:18,790
creation, right? Trim into here. Hold
your runners. You never know. You might

6782
02:47:18,790 --> 02:47:18,800
your runners. You never know. You might
 

6783
02:47:18,800 --> 02:47:21,110
your runners. You never know. You might
get lucky. You don't know. I would be

6784
02:47:21,110 --> 02:47:21,120
get lucky. You don't know. I would be
 

6785
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:37,990
get lucky. You don't know. I would be
trimming a good chunk of my change.

6786
02:47:37,990 --> 02:47:38,000

 

6787
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:44,790

So you got from 550.

6788
02:47:44,790 --> 02:47:44,800

 

6789
02:47:44,800 --> 02:47:47,190

Oh, nice, man. So you took the false

6790
02:47:47,190 --> 02:47:47,200
Oh, nice, man. So you took the false
 

6791
02:47:47,200 --> 02:47:49,349
Oh, nice, man. So you took the false
break of GlobeEx. So I'm assuming you

6792
02:47:49,349 --> 02:47:49,359
break of GlobeEx. So I'm assuming you
 

6793
02:47:49,359 --> 02:47:51,110
break of GlobeEx. So I'm assuming you
took the break. You didn't buy there.

6794
02:47:51,110 --> 02:47:51,120
took the break. You didn't buy there.
 

6795
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:52,630
took the break. You didn't buy there.
You bro, hopefully you bought the break

6796
02:47:52,630 --> 02:47:52,640
You bro, hopefully you bought the break
 

6797
02:47:52,640 --> 02:47:55,670
You bro, hopefully you bought the break
back above. That's really nice. I mean

6798
02:47:55,670 --> 02:47:55,680
back above. That's really nice. I mean
 

6799
02:47:55,680 --> 02:47:58,870
back above. That's really nice. I mean
that is a fantastic trade and we expect

6800
02:47:58,870 --> 02:47:58,880
that is a fantastic trade and we expect
 

6801
02:47:58,880 --> 02:48:02,150
that is a fantastic trade and we expect
some sort of resistance up here. Uh ES

6802
02:48:02,150 --> 02:48:02,160
some sort of resistance up here. Uh ES
 

6803
02:48:02,160 --> 02:48:05,030
some sort of resistance up here. Uh ES
also into VW up here and VIX also into a

6804
02:48:05,030 --> 02:48:05,040
also into VW up here and VIX also into a
 

6805
02:48:05,040 --> 02:48:07,830
also into VW up here and VIX also into a
demand block down here. All right. So we

6806
02:48:07,830 --> 02:48:07,840
demand block down here. All right. So we
 

6807
02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:10,230
demand block down here. All right. So we
expect here I'd be trimming a good

6808
02:48:10,230 --> 02:48:10,240
expect here I'd be trimming a good
 

6809
02:48:10,240 --> 02:48:13,590
expect here I'd be trimming a good
chunk. Right. Trim. Do not be greedy. If

6810
02:48:13,590 --> 02:48:13,600
chunk. Right. Trim. Do not be greedy. If
 

6811
02:48:13,600 --> 02:48:15,590
chunk. Right. Trim. Do not be greedy. If
you got this or some if you got that

6812
02:48:15,590 --> 02:48:15,600
you got this or some if you got that
 

6813
02:48:15,600 --> 02:48:18,870
you got this or some if you got that
it's fantastic. Right. Trim. You never

6814
02:48:18,870 --> 02:48:18,880
it's fantastic. Right. Trim. You never
 

6815
02:48:18,880 --> 02:48:20,469
it's fantastic. Right. Trim. You never
know. You might get lucky on your

6816
02:48:20,469 --> 02:48:20,479
know. You might get lucky on your
 

6817
02:48:20,479 --> 02:48:23,110
know. You might get lucky on your
runner. You'd never know. It's uh last

6818
02:48:23,110 --> 02:48:23,120
runner. You'd never know. It's uh last
 

6819
02:48:23,120 --> 02:48:28,070
runner. You'd never know. It's uh last

range rotation. Right. So, technically

6846
02:49:10,150 --> 02:49:10,160
range rotation. Right. So, technically
 

6847
02:49:10,160 --> 02:49:11,990
range rotation. Right. So, technically
speaking, let me just check on Ninja.

6848
02:49:11,990 --> 02:49:12,000
speaking, let me just check on Ninja.
 

6849
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,630
speaking, let me just check on Ninja.
Technically speaking, the edge of range,

6850
02:49:14,630 --> 02:49:14,640
Technically speaking, the edge of range,
 

6851
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:16,150
Technically speaking, the edge of range,
right? If I was going to look to sell

6852
02:49:16,150 --> 02:49:16,160
right? If I was going to look to sell
 

6853
02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:19,269
right? If I was going to look to sell
range, I'd need it to be up here, not

6854
02:49:19,269 --> 02:49:19,279
range, I'd need it to be up here, not
 

6855
02:49:19,279 --> 02:49:21,110
range, I'd need it to be up here, not
here. I know. I know there's a node

6856
02:49:21,110 --> 02:49:21,120
here. I know. I know there's a node
 

6857
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:24,070
here. I know. I know there's a node
there, but the momentum where have we

6858
02:49:24,070 --> 02:49:24,080
there, but the momentum where have we
 

6859
02:49:24,080 --> 02:49:25,750
there, but the momentum where have we
trapped,

6860
02:49:25,750 --> 02:49:25,760
trapped,
 

6861
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:27,830
trapped,
right? We've trapped sellers here. Low

6862
02:49:27,830 --> 02:49:27,840
right? We've trapped sellers here. Low
 

6863
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:29,269
right? We've trapped sellers here. Low
hanging fruit's gone. Maybe there's a

6864
02:49:29,269 --> 02:49:29,279
hanging fruit's gone. Maybe there's a
 

6865
02:49:29,279 --> 02:49:31,110
hanging fruit's gone. Maybe there's a
sell down to here, but I would be uh

6866
02:49:31,110 --> 02:49:31,120
sell down to here, but I would be uh
 

6867
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:33,190
sell down to here, but I would be uh
somewhat skeptical. Like I said, it's

6868
02:49:33,190 --> 02:49:33,200
somewhat skeptical. Like I said, it's
 

6869
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:34,870
somewhat skeptical. Like I said, it's
very thin. It would actually not take

6870
02:49:34,870 --> 02:49:34,880
very thin. It would actually not take
 

6871
02:49:34,880 --> 02:49:37,110
very thin. It would actually not take
very much. Imagine they run the this

6872
02:49:37,110 --> 02:49:37,120
very much. Imagine they run the this
 

6873
02:49:37,120 --> 02:49:38,710
very much. Imagine they run the this
this group of stops. If they don't

6874
02:49:38,710 --> 02:49:38,720
this group of stops. If they don't
 

6875
02:49:38,720 --> 02:49:40,070
this group of stops. If they don't
protect it, it wouldn't take very much

6876
02:49:40,070 --> 02:49:40,080
protect it, it wouldn't take very much
 

6877
02:49:40,080 --> 02:49:42,550
protect it, it wouldn't take very much
to do that move. So, like for me

6878
02:49:42,550 --> 02:49:42,560
to do that move. So, like for me
 

6879
02:49:42,560 --> 02:49:44,309
to do that move. So, like for me
personally, if I'm going to trade range

6880
02:49:44,309 --> 02:49:44,319
personally, if I'm going to trade range
 

6881
02:49:44,319 --> 02:49:45,990
personally, if I'm going to trade range
rotation, I really want to trade the

6882
02:49:45,990 --> 02:49:46,000
rotation, I really want to trade the
 

6883
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,389
rotation, I really want to trade the
extreme edge. I can see that there's a

6884
02:49:48,389 --> 02:49:48,399
extreme edge. I can see that there's a
 

6885
02:49:48,399 --> 02:49:49,429
extreme edge. I can see that there's a
node here. I know what you're looking

6886
02:49:49,429 --> 02:49:49,439
node here. I know what you're looking
 

6887
02:49:49,439 --> 02:49:51,990
node here. I know what you're looking
at, but I'd rather almost have it do

6888
02:49:51,990 --> 02:49:52,000
at, but I'd rather almost have it do
 

6889
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,389
at, but I'd rather almost have it do
that and this move here, right? If I was

6890
02:49:54,389 --> 02:49:54,399
that and this move here, right? If I was
 

6891
02:49:54,399 --> 02:49:57,429
that and this move here, right? If I was
going to trade an edge,

6892
02:49:57,429 --> 02:49:57,439
going to trade an edge,
 

6893
02:49:57,439 --> 02:50:12,230
going to trade an edge,
let me set up this.

6960
02:51:57,110 --> 02:51:57,120

 

6961

So, I look for a break and retest model.
Uh, not always.

6966
02:52:11,910 --> 02:52:11,920
Uh, not always.
 

6967
02:52:11,920 --> 02:52:14,389
Uh, not always.
Not always. Depends on the setup I'm

6968
02:52:14,389 --> 02:52:14,399
Not always. Depends on the setup I'm
 

6969
02:52:14,399 --> 02:52:16,630
Not always. Depends on the setup I'm
looking at. Sometimes it's a straight

6970
02:52:16,630 --> 02:52:16,640
looking at. Sometimes it's a straight
 

6971
02:52:16,640 --> 02:52:17,910
looking at. Sometimes it's a straight
reclaim and I'm not looking for the

6972
02:52:17,910 --> 02:52:17,920
reclaim and I'm not looking for the
 

6973

7279
02:58:28,399 --> 02:58:30,630
good? Yeah. Do I believe 20 hours and an
indicator and a Discord for currently

7280
02:58:30,630 --> 02:58:30,640
indicator and a Discord for currently
 

7281
02:58:30,640 --> 02:58:32,630
indicator and a Discord for currently
520 bucks until tonight is good? Yeah,

7282
02:58:32,630 --> 02:58:32,640
520 bucks until tonight is good? Yeah,
 

7283
02:58:32,640 --> 02:58:34,790
520 bucks until tonight is good? Yeah,
it's insane value. But I'm going to say

7284
02:58:34,790 --> 02:58:34,800
it's insane value. But I'm going to say
 

7285
02:58:34,800 --> 02:58:36,550
it's insane value. But I'm going to say
that I built it. You might think it's

7286
02:58:36,550 --> 02:58:36,560
that I built it. You might think it's
 

7287
02:58:36,560 --> 02:58:44,070
that I built it. You might think it's
[\h__\h] and that's okay.

7288
02:58:44,070 --> 02:58:44,080

 

7289
02:58:44,080 --> 02:58:46,150

No, the orderflow. Yeah, the orderflow

7290
02:58:46,150 --> 02:58:46,160
No, the orderflow. Yeah, the orderflow
 

7291
02:58:46,160 --> 02:58:48,150
No, the orderflow. Yeah, the orderflow
course does not include the Discord. I'm

7292
02:58:48,150 --> 02:58:48,160
course does not include the Discord. I'm
 

7293
02:58:48,160 --> 02:58:49,510
course does not include the Discord. I'm
really sorry. It doesn't include the

7294
02:58:49,510 --> 02:58:49,520
really sorry. It doesn't include the
 

7295
02:58:49,520 --> 02:58:52,469
really sorry. It doesn't include the
Discord. We I actually put it to a vote

7296
02:58:52,469 --> 02:58:52,479
Discord. We I actually put it to a vote
 

7297
02:58:52,479 --> 02:58:54,630
Discord. We I actually put it to a vote
to a couple of guys um who've been with

7298
02:58:54,630 --> 02:58:54,640
to a couple of guys um who've been with
 

7299
02:58:54,640 --> 02:58:57,110
to a couple of guys um who've been with
me in a long time and we all made the

7300
02:58:57,110 --> 02:58:57,120
me in a long time and we all made the
 

7301
02:58:57,120 --> 02:58:58,790
me in a long time and we all made the
decision that what might happen is

7302
02:58:58,790 --> 02:58:58,800
decision that what might happen is
 

7303
02:58:58,800 --> 02:59:00,550
decision that what might happen is
you're still going to get guys trading

7304
02:59:00,550 --> 02:59:00,560
you're still going to get guys trading
 

7305
02:59:00,560 --> 02:59:02,469
you're still going to get guys trading
slightly different ways. And that's the

7306
02:59:02,469 --> 02:59:02,479
slightly different ways. And that's the
 

7307
02:59:02,479 --> 02:59:05,190
slightly different ways. And that's the
only I've been at this a lot a long

7308
02:59:05,190 --> 02:59:05,200
only I've been at this a lot a long
 

7309
02:59:05,200 --> 02:59:08,070
only I've been at this a lot a long
time. Been in many many many discords.

7310
02:59:08,070 --> 02:59:08,080
time. Been in many many many discords.
 

7311
02:59:08,080 --> 02:59:10,550
time. Been in many many many discords.
Okay. Where it goes wrong is when you

7312
02:59:10,550 --> 02:59:10,560
Okay. Where it goes wrong is when you
 

7313
02:59:10,560 --> 02:59:12,230
Okay. Where it goes wrong is when you
start getting traders trading in

7314
02:59:12,230 --> 02:59:12,240
start getting traders trading in
 

7315
02:59:12,240 --> 02:59:14,469
start getting traders trading in
different ways. It's fine to look at the

7316
02:59:14,469 --> 02:59:14,479
different ways. It's fine to look at the
 

7317
02:59:14,479 --> 02:59:15,830
different ways. It's fine to look at the
market in different ways, but when they

7318
02:59:15,830 --> 02:59:15,840
market in different ways, but when they
 

7319
02:59:15,840 --> 02:59:17,990
market in different ways, but when they
start when one's looking short and the

7320
02:59:17,990 --> 02:59:18,000
start when one's looking short and the
 

7321
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:19,429
start when one's looking short and the
other one's looking long at the same

7322
02:59:19,429 --> 02:59:19,439
other one's looking long at the same
 

7323
02:59:19,439 --> 02:59:20,950
other one's looking long at the same
level and they don't agree and then it

7324
02:59:20,950 --> 02:59:20,960
level and they don't agree and then it
 

7325
02:59:20,960 --> 02:59:22,950
level and they don't agree and then it
just blows up. Before you know it,

7326
02:59:22,950 --> 02:59:22,960
just blows up. Before you know it,
 

7327
02:59:22,960 --> 02:59:24,790
just blows up. Before you know it,
you've got this cascading effect. Like

7328
02:59:24,790 --> 02:59:24,800
you've got this cascading effect. Like
 

7329
02:59:24,800 --> 02:59:26,389
you've got this cascading effect. Like
that's what we're trying to avoid.

7330
02:59:26,389 --> 02:59:26,399
that's what we're trying to avoid.
 

7331
02:59:26,399 --> 02:59:27,830
that's what we're trying to avoid.
Positive reinforcement of everyone

7332
02:59:27,830 --> 02:59:27,840
Positive reinforcement of everyone
 

7333
02:59:27,840 --> 02:59:30,230
Positive reinforcement of everyone
looking at the market in the same way or

7334
02:59:30,230 --> 02:59:30,240
looking at the market in the same way or
 

7335
02:59:30,240 --> 02:59:31,750
looking at the market in the same way or
at least a very similar way. And then

7336
02:59:31,750 --> 02:59:31,760
at least a very similar way. And then
 

7337
02:59:31,760 --> 02:59:33,190
at least a very similar way. And then
when they've got a question, it's easier

7338
02:59:33,190 --> 02:59:33,200
when they've got a question, it's easier
 

7339
02:59:33,200 --> 02:59:43,190
when they've got a question, it's easier
for people to answer to help.

For the trading course, right, if you

For the trading course, right, if you

03:00:10,080 --> 03:00:12,389
For the trading course, right, if you
want 20% off the beginner to advance

that ends tonight at midnight. They both

7366
03:00:17,510 --> 03:00:17,520
that ends tonight at midnight. They both
 

7367
03:00:17,520 --> 03:00:19,190
that ends tonight at midnight. They both
work. I've just double checked them just

7368
03:00:19,190 --> 03:00:19,200
work. I've just double checked them just
 

7369
03:00:19,200 --> 03:00:32,070
work. I've just double checked them just
in case.

7370
03:00:32,070 --> 03:00:32,080

 

7371
03:00:32,080 --> 03:00:40,550

All

7372
03:00:40,550 --> 03:00:40,560

 

7373
03:00:40,560 --> 03:00:41,990

right, back to that gray box. You can

7374
03:00:41,990 --> 03:00:42,000
right, back to that gray box. You can
 

7375
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:43,429
right, back to that gray box. You can
see the key levels, right? You can see

7376
03:00:43,429 --> 03:00:43,439
see the key levels, right? You can see
 

7377
03:00:43,439 --> 03:00:44,790
see the key levels, right? You can see
the key levels. So, what would I be

7378
03:00:44,790 --> 03:00:44,800
the key levels. So, what would I be
 

7379
03:00:44,800 --> 03:00:46,550
the key levels. So, what would I be
looking at the rest of the day? Like we

7380
03:00:46,550 --> 03:00:46,560
looking at the rest of the day? Like we
 

7381
03:00:46,560 --> 03:00:49,269
looking at the rest of the day? Like we
talked about, if you rewind this to

7382
03:00:49,269 --> 03:00:49,279
talked about, if you rewind this to
 

7383
03:00:49,279 --> 03:00:50,710
talked about, if you rewind this to
somewhere around here, one of you was

7384
03:00:50,710 --> 03:00:50,720
somewhere around here, one of you was
 

7385
03:00:50,720 --> 03:00:52,150
somewhere around here, one of you was
asking, can we get back up to the highs

7386
03:00:52,150 --> 03:00:52,160
asking, can we get back up to the highs
 

7387
03:00:52,160 --> 03:00:54,550
asking, can we get back up to the highs
of day? And I said, the rotation is from

7388
03:00:54,550 --> 03:00:54,560
of day? And I said, the rotation is from
 

7389
03:00:54,560 --> 03:00:57,429
of day? And I said, the rotation is from
here to here. And the next rotation will

7390
03:00:57,429 --> 03:00:57,439
here to here. And the next rotation will
 

7391
03:00:57,439 --> 03:00:59,670
here to here. And the next rotation will
probably be here to here or maybe if

7392
03:00:59,670 --> 03:00:59,680
probably be here to here or maybe if
 

7393
03:00:59,680 --> 03:01:01,429
probably be here to here or maybe if
you're lucky, here to here. And if we

7394
03:01:01,429 --> 03:01:01,439
you're lucky, here to here. And if we
 

7395
03:01:01,439 --> 03:01:02,950
you're lucky, here to here. And if we
get above that, then we can rotate

7396
03:01:02,950 --> 03:01:02,960
get above that, then we can rotate
 

7397
03:01:02,960 --> 03:01:05,590
get above that, then we can rotate
higher. But most of the dense volume has

7398
03:01:05,590 --> 03:01:05,600
higher. But most of the dense volume has
 

7399
03:01:05,600 --> 03:01:07,429
higher. But most of the dense volume has
been done here. These are the rotations.

7400
03:01:07,429 --> 03:01:07,439
been done here. These are the rotations.
 

7401
03:01:07,439 --> 03:01:09,830
been done here. These are the rotations.
I avoid, as you well know, I avoid

7402
03:01:09,830 --> 03:01:09,840
I avoid, as you well know, I avoid
 

7403
03:01:09,840 --> 03:01:11,670
I avoid, as you well know, I avoid
rotational markets. I don't like trading

7404
03:01:11,670 --> 03:01:11,680
rotational markets. I don't like trading
 

7405
03:01:11,680 --> 03:01:15,349
rotational markets. I don't like trading
in them. All right? So, they're not a a

7406
03:01:15,349 --> 03:01:15,359
in them. All right? So, they're not a a
 

7407
03:01:15,359 --> 03:01:17,110
in them. All right? So, they're not a a
favored market for me. But one of you

7408
03:01:17,110 --> 03:01:17,120
favored market for me. But one of you
 

7409
03:01:17,120 --> 03:01:18,550
favored market for me. But one of you
was asking about that short. It did work

7410
03:01:18,550 --> 03:01:18,560
was asking about that short. It did work
 

7411
03:01:18,560 --> 03:01:20,309
was asking about that short. It did work
out for you. You left volume trap, then

7412
03:01:20,309 --> 03:01:20,319
out for you. You left volume trap, then
 

7413
03:01:20,319 --> 03:01:21,510
out for you. You left volume trap, then
you came straight back down to this

7414
03:01:21,510 --> 03:01:21,520
you came straight back down to this
 

7415
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:23,429
you came straight back down to this
side. Now, if they do the same thing

7416
03:01:23,429 --> 03:01:23,439
side. Now, if they do the same thing
 

7417
03:01:23,439 --> 03:01:25,590
side. Now, if they do the same thing
here and they can't reclaim, you might

7418
03:01:25,590 --> 03:01:25,600
here and they can't reclaim, you might
 

7419
03:01:25,600 --> 03:01:29,269
here and they can't reclaim, you might
see the auction resume lower. But like I

7420
03:01:29,269 --> 03:01:29,279
see the auction resume lower. But like I
 

7421
03:01:29,279 --> 03:01:31,269
see the auction resume lower. But like I
said, such low volume, guys. I'd be

7422
03:01:31,269 --> 03:01:31,279
said, such low volume, guys. I'd be
 

7423
03:01:31,279 --> 03:01:33,429
said, such low volume, guys. I'd be
very, very, very careful trading into

7424
03:01:33,429 --> 03:01:33,439
very, very, very careful trading into
 

7425
03:01:33,439 --> 03:01:34,790
very, very, very careful trading into
close today, especially on that

7426
03:01:34,790 --> 03:01:34,800
close today, especially on that
 

7427
03:01:34,800 --> 03:01:37,590
close today, especially on that
imbalance, on that MOC.

7428
03:01:37,590 --> 03:01:37,600
imbalance, on that MOC.
 

7429
03:01:37,600 --> 03:01:39,190
imbalance, on that MOC.
All right, any last questions before I

7430
03:01:39,190 --> 03:01:39,200
All right, any last questions before I
 

7431
03:01:39,200 --> 03:01:41,030
All right, any last questions before I
