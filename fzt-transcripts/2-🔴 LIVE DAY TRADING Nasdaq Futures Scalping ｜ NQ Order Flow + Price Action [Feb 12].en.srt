right. Tight range this week, folks.
 

9
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,510
right. Tight range this week, folks.
Nothing's changed yet, right? Nothing

has changed yet. We looking uh what
 

13
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,189
has changed yet. We looking uh what
we're starting to build out. We talked

14
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
we're starting to build out. We talked
 

15
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,950
we're starting to build out. We talked
about this weekly range. Fortunately,

16
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
about this weekly range. Fortunately,
 

17
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,629
about this weekly range. Fortunately,
it's not really playing out. We haven't

18
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639
it's not really playing out. We haven't
 

19
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,550
it's not really playing out. We haven't
left this range. So, other than Monday,

20
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
left this range. So, other than Monday,
 

21
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,790
left this range. So, other than Monday,
right? Monday set the low of week and I

22
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
right? Monday set the low of week and I
 

23
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,870
right? Monday set the low of week and I
mean Tuesday

24
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880

 

25
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,990

Monday Monday set the low of week. Come

26
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
Monday Monday set the low of week. Come
 

27
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,150
Monday Monday set the low of week. Come
on Alex. Uh Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday

28
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
on Alex. Uh Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
 

29
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,430
on Alex. Uh Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
all set high of weeks which we've not

30
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
all set high of weeks which we've not
 

31
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,950
all set high of weeks which we've not
been able to break out of and we are

32
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
been able to break out of and we are
 

33
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,189
been able to break out of and we are
just transversing in this range here.

34
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:05,199
just transversing in this range here.
 

35
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,270
just transversing in this range here.
Right. So we're about 400 point range.

36
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
Right. So we're about 400 point range.
 

37
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,990
Right. So we're about 400 point range.
400 4 500 point range. You can see we've

38
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
400 4 500 point range. You can see we've
 

39
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,070
400 4 500 point range. You can see we've
reclaimed lower Ballinger band 5day

40
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
reclaimed lower Ballinger band 5day
 

41
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,830
reclaimed lower Ballinger band 5day
started to curl back up. We are probably

42
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
started to curl back up. We are probably
 

43
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,749
started to curl back up. We are probably
looking for a back test up here at some

44
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
looking for a back test up here at some
 

45
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,670
looking for a back test up here at some
point. All right. 20-day and the 50-day

46
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680
point. All right. 20-day and the 50-day
 

47
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,990
point. All right. 20-day and the 50-day
and you know in here is where we broke

48
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
and you know in here is where we broke
 

49
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,909
and you know in here is where we broke
down from. All right, there is a big

50
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919
down from. All right, there is a big
 

51
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,790
down from. All right, there is a big
call uh call wall up here. All right,

52
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
call uh call wall up here. All right,
 

53
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,029
call uh call wall up here. All right,
and we will have to see how we act into

54
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
and we will have to see how we act into
 

55
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,590
and we will have to see how we act into
that. We get more information out of

56
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
that. We get more information out of
 

57
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,390
that. We get more information out of
this as always in the hourlys and we're

58
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
this as always in the hourlys and we're
 

59
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,670
this as always in the hourlys and we're
looking at the same kind of thing as we

60
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
looking at the same kind of thing as we
 

61
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,029
looking at the same kind of thing as we
were looking at yesterday and the day

62
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039
were looking at yesterday and the day
 

63
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,790
were looking at yesterday and the day
before. All right, nothing's changed.

64
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
before. All right, nothing's changed.
 

65
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,590
before. All right, nothing's changed.
All right, I am very very very aware of

66
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
All right, I am very very very aware of
 

67
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,670
All right, I am very very very aware of
these stops here. All right. I'm very

68
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
these stops here. All right. I'm very
 

69
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,070
these stops here. All right. I'm very
aware of these stops here dating back to

70
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
aware of these stops here dating back to
 

71
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,350
aware of these stops here dating back to
the 4th of Feb. So, what I'm thinking

72
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
the 4th of Feb. So, what I'm thinking
 

73
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,510
the 4th of Feb. So, what I'm thinking
is there an echo on my mic? Not that I'm

74
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
is there an echo on my mic? Not that I'm
 

75
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,670
is there an echo on my mic? Not that I'm
aware of.

76
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
aware of.
 

77
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,590
aware of.
It's coming from my webcam. Okay, hang

78
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:57,600
It's coming from my webcam. Okay, hang
 

79
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,749

on.
Hang on, folks.

82
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319

 

83
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,909

There should only be one mic.

84
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919
There should only be one mic.
 

85
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:16,710
There should only be one mic.
All

86
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720

 

87
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,430

right, guys. I'm just

88
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440

Jesus.

00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
Jesus.
 

91
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,589
Jesus.
There's an echo. Is there

92
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599

 

93
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,110

not what we needed to start the day

94
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
not what we needed to start the day
 

95
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,350
not what we needed to start the day
here?

96
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360

 

97
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,629

I don't know what to do here, folks,

98
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
I don't know what to do here, folks,
 

99
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,830
I don't know what to do here, folks,
because it's not giving me another

100
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
because it's not giving me another
 

101
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,150
because it's not giving me another
option.

102
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
option.
 

103
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:54,869
option.
Is that any better?

104
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879

 

105
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:03,029

Okay. Worse. How about now?

106
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039

 

107
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,589

Better now.

108
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
Better now.
 

109
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,189
Better now.
Much better. Okay. Good. Good. Good. All

112
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160

 

113
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,670

figure out later. Yeah, let's figure out

114
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
figure out later. Yeah, let's figure out
 

115
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,189
figure out later. Yeah, let's figure out
later. Let's just get through this team,

116
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
later. Let's just get through this team,
 

117
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,270
later. Let's just get through this team,
do the best we can, and then see if OBS

118
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
do the best we can, and then see if OBS
 

119
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,710
do the best we can, and then see if OBS
wants to stop being annoying. Otherwise,

120
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
wants to stop being annoying. Otherwise,
 

121
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,990
wants to stop being annoying. Otherwise,
I have to close the stream and reopen

122
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000
I have to close the stream and reopen
 

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,670
I have to close the stream and reopen
it. Okay, so this is the current weekly

124
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680
it. Okay, so this is the current weekly
 

125
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,510
it. Okay, so this is the current weekly
profile,

126
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520
profile,
 

127
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,270
profile,
right? This is the weekly profile. We've

128
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
right? This is the weekly profile. We've
 

129
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,670
right? This is the weekly profile. We've
dipped under it uh overnight and

130
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,680
dipped under it uh overnight and
 

131
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,029
dipped under it uh overnight and
absorbed straight back inside. All

132
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
absorbed straight back inside. All
 

133
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,310
absorbed straight back inside. All
right. And we dipped under it and we

134
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320
right. And we dipped under it and we
 

135
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,870
right. And we dipped under it and we
came down to this area, this node we

136
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:34,880
came down to this area, this node we
 

137
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,070
came down to this area, this node we
talked about yesterday where we said,

138
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
talked about yesterday where we said,
 

139
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,110
talked about yesterday where we said,
"Well, we're probably going to see

140
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
"Well, we're probably going to see
 

141
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,709
"Well, we're probably going to see
absorption if we can get down there."

142
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
absorption if we can get down there."
 

143
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,990
absorption if we can get down there."
All right. That's probably a buying

144
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
All right. That's probably a buying
 

145
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,670
All right. That's probably a buying
opportunity. We eventually did that

146
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
opportunity. We eventually did that
 

147
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,269
opportunity. We eventually did that
yesterday. So, we did a failed breakout,

148
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
yesterday. So, we did a failed breakout,
 

149
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,030
yesterday. So, we did a failed breakout,
eventually came all the way down to

150
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
eventually came all the way down to
 

151
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,110
eventually came all the way down to
there before bidding all the way back

152
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
there before bidding all the way back
 

153
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,949
there before bidding all the way back
up, and we're now stuck in this again.

154
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
up, and we're now stuck in this again.
 

155
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,470
up, and we're now stuck in this again.
Nothing's changed, folks. There's quite

156
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
Nothing's changed, folks. There's quite
 

157
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,790
Nothing's changed, folks. There's quite
literally nothing has changed since

158
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
literally nothing has changed since
 

159
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,870
literally nothing has changed since

160
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
coming to the charts uh really Monday
 

161
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,389
coming to the charts uh really Monday
morning. All right. From New York

162
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
morning. All right. From New York
 

163
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,910
morning. All right. From New York
session, we are stuck in here. So, this

164
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
session, we are stuck in here. So, this
 

165
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,230
session, we are stuck in here. So, this
is the buildout of liquidity, right? In

166
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
is the buildout of liquidity, right? In
 

167
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,230
is the buildout of liquidity, right? In
ranges, you tend to want to fade the

168
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
ranges, you tend to want to fade the
 

169
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,870
ranges, you tend to want to fade the
edges and buy the edges back inside. We

170
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
edges and buy the edges back inside. We
 

171
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,110
edges and buy the edges back inside. We
have been here so many times. One, two,

172
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
have been here so many times. One, two,
 

173
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,630
have been here so many times. One, two,
three. This is the fourth attempt at the

174
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
three. This is the fourth attempt at the
 

175
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,470
three. This is the fourth attempt at the
high. I'd say down here, one 2 3 4 5,

176
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,480
high. I'd say down here, one 2 3 4 5,
 

177
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,990
high. I'd say down here, one 2 3 4 5,
right? We're really, really stuck. There

178
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
right? We're really, really stuck. There
 

179
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,509
right? We're really, really stuck. There
are lots and lots of stops being

180
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
are lots and lots of stops being
 

181
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,350
are lots and lots of stops being
developed. My thought process on this is

182
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
developed. My thought process on this is
 

183
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,670
developed. My thought process on this is
we want to take these stops out here and

184
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
we want to take these stops out here and
 

185
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,670
we want to take these stops out here and
I think there is chance for a bull trap

186
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
I think there is chance for a bull trap
 

187
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,350
I think there is chance for a bull trap
to live in here somewhere. There is a

188
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
to live in here somewhere. There is a
 

189
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,350
to live in here somewhere. There is a
chance. That is what I've been aware of

190
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
chance. That is what I've been aware of
 

191
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,670
chance. That is what I've been aware of
all week. Okay. So, I'm wondering if

192
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
all week. Okay. So, I'm wondering if
 

193
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,110
all week. Okay. So, I'm wondering if
we're going to do something like this

194
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
we're going to do something like this
 

195
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,870
we're going to do something like this
and then see some form of failure up

196
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
and then see some form of failure up
 

197
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,110
and then see some form of failure up
here back down. Maybe six, maybe seven,

198
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
here back down. Maybe six, maybe seven,
 

199
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,870
here back down. Maybe six, maybe seven,
maybe eight. Why those levels? All

200
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
maybe eight. Why those levels? All
 

201
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,990
maybe eight. Why those levels? All
right. Six cuz it's an old node. Uh

202
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
right. Six cuz it's an old node. Uh
 

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,750
right. Six cuz it's an old node. Uh
seven whole number, but eight old point

204
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
seven whole number, but eight old point
 

205
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,430
seven whole number, but eight old point
of control. All right. So, I'm really

206
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
of control. All right. So, I'm really
 

207
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,829
of control. All right. So, I'm really
watching six and eight. 6 and 8 is a

208
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
watching six and eight. 6 and 8 is a
 

209
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,670
watching six and eight. 6 and 8 is a
level where I think the market might get

210
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680
level where I think the market might get
 

211
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,829
level where I think the market might get
stuck if we get up there. If we just do

212
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
stuck if we get up there. If we just do
 

213
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,430
stuck if we get up there. If we just do
this and we base there is a long

214
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440
this and we base there is a long
 

215
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,910
this and we base there is a long
opportunity from let's say 440s 500s up

216
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
opportunity from let's say 440s 500s up
 

217
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,430
opportunity from let's say 440s 500s up
and towards the sixes. All right. And

218
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
and towards the sixes. All right. And
 

219
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,790
and towards the sixes. All right. And
then maybe if you get lucky get seven

220
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
then maybe if you get lucky get seven
 

221
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,949
then maybe if you get lucky get seven
and eight. Uh the fade will come

222
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:02,959
and eight. Uh the fade will come
 

223
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,110
and eight. Uh the fade will come
somewhere up there. I would imagine we

224
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
somewhere up there. I would imagine we
 

225
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,350
somewhere up there. I would imagine we
would go uber uber bullish if we start

226
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360
would go uber uber bullish if we start
 

227
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,350
would go uber uber bullish if we start
reclaiming all of this. Okay. Because we

228
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
reclaiming all of this. Okay. Because we
 

229
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,070
reclaiming all of this. Okay. Because we
will be looking at this side of the move

230
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,080
will be looking at this side of the move
 

231
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,230
will be looking at this side of the move
then. All right. So we are technically

232
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
then. All right. So we are technically
 

233
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,069
then. All right. So we are technically
coming buy side of the curve. But I

234
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
coming buy side of the curve. But I
 

235
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,829
coming buy side of the curve. But I
think up here is dangerous. I really

236
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
think up here is dangerous. I really
 

237
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,750
think up here is dangerous. I really
want to be buying down here. This is

238
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
want to be buying down here. This is
 

239
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,190
want to be buying down here. This is
where I want to be buying for this move

240
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
where I want to be buying for this move
 

241
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,790
where I want to be buying for this move
back up. Otherwise, if they do this

242
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
back up. Otherwise, if they do this
 

243
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,269
back up. Otherwise, if they do this
move, I think reliable for that coming

244
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
move, I think reliable for that coming
 

245
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,790
move, I think reliable for that coming
back down. So, that's what I'm watching

246
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
back down. So, that's what I'm watching
 

247
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,670
back down. So, that's what I'm watching
today. If we fail this edge again and

248
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:29,680
today. If we fail this edge again and
 

249
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,190
today. If we fail this edge again and
keep selling underneath previous day's

250
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200
keep selling underneath previous day's
 

251
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,790
keep selling underneath previous day's
value area low, then I will look for

252
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
value area low, then I will look for
 

253
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,350
value area low, then I will look for
that fade back down to the 800s. I don't

254
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
that fade back down to the 800s. I don't
 

255
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,350
that fade back down to the 800s. I don't
really want to trade inside yesterday's

256
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
really want to trade inside yesterday's
 

257
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,030
really want to trade inside yesterday's
value area. All right. I really don't

258
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
value area. All right. I really don't
 

259
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,269
value area. All right. I really don't
want to trade inside here. And ideally,

260
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:41,279
want to trade inside here. And ideally,
 

261
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,630
want to trade inside here. And ideally,
I don't want to trade inside here. So,

262
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
I don't want to trade inside here. So,
 

263
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,949
I don't want to trade inside here. So,
I'm going to have to be extra extra

264
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:44,959
I'm going to have to be extra extra
 

265
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,430
I'm going to have to be extra extra
patient today to get that move outside

266
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
patient today to get that move outside
 

267
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,790
patient today to get that move outside
of it. All right. All right, we're going

268
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
of it. All right. All right, we're going
 

269
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,470
of it. All right. All right, we're going
to have to get a real move on here and

270
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,480
to have to get a real move on here and
 

271
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,509
to have to get a real move on here and
go through everything else. We're

272
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
go through everything else. We're
 

273
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,910
go through everything else. We're
looking exactly the same thing on the ES

274
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
looking exactly the same thing on the ES
 

275
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,750
looking exactly the same thing on the ES
and spiders. There is no change. You can

276
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
and spiders. There is no change. You can
 

277
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,230
and spiders. There is no change. You can
see inside yesterday's range. Here's

278
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
see inside yesterday's range. Here's
 

279
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,670
see inside yesterday's range. Here's
your initial balance from yesterday. All

280
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
your initial balance from yesterday. All
 

281
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,350
your initial balance from yesterday. All
right, you are pinned inside. There is a

282
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
right, you are pinned inside. There is a
 

283
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,190
right, you are pinned inside. There is a
slight gap up. All right, there's your

284
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
slight gap up. All right, there's your
 

285
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,190
slight gap up. All right, there's your
gap. All right, maybe they fade the gap

286
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
gap. All right, maybe they fade the gap
 

287
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,710
gap. All right, maybe they fade the gap
and dip it. I don't know, but we are

288
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
and dip it. I don't know, but we are
 

289
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,550
and dip it. I don't know, but we are
still pinned. There's no edge in here.

290
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
still pinned. There's no edge in here.
 

291
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,150
still pinned. There's no edge in here.
For me personally, how I trade, there's

292
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
For me personally, how I trade, there's
 

293
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,310
For me personally, how I trade, there's
no edge in here. Spiders, same thing.

294
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320
no edge in here. Spiders, same thing.
 

295
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,030
no edge in here. Spiders, same thing.
You can see three days worth of price

296
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
You can see three days worth of price
 

297
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,870
You can see three days worth of price
action in here. QQ, you're going to see

298
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:16,880
action in here. QQ, you're going to see
 

299
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,829
action in here. QQ, you're going to see
the same thing. All right,

300
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
the same thing. All right,
 

301
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,269
the same thing. All right,
that's where we're pinned. All right,

302
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
that's where we're pinned. All right,
 

303
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,790
that's where we're pinned. All right,
this could could be the spring to go

304
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
this could could be the spring to go
 

305
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,630
this could could be the spring to go
back upside. It's arguable that we can

306
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
back upside. It's arguable that we can
 

307
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,790
back upside. It's arguable that we can
do that. Dixie still trying to find an

308
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:26,800
do that. Dixie still trying to find an
 

309
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,310
do that. Dixie still trying to find an
area where it can catch a bid. Right, it

310
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,320
area where it can catch a bid. Right, it
 

311
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,150
area where it can catch a bid. Right, it
tried. We are also in a range here.

312
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
tried. We are also in a range here.
 

313
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,829
tried. We are also in a range here.
They're still making their mind up. They

314
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
They're still making their mind up. They
 

315
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,069
They're still making their mind up. They
probably see the same on metals. VIX,

316
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
probably see the same on metals. VIX,
 

317
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,590
probably see the same on metals. VIX,
same kind of thing. We're floating under

318
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
same kind of thing. We're floating under
 

319
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,069
same kind of thing. We're floating under
the underside of this. I think this

320
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
the underside of this. I think this
 

321
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,910
the underside of this. I think this
might be need to be adjusted because my

322
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
might be need to be adjusted because my
 

323
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,350
might be need to be adjusted because my
computer wanted to do an update last

324
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
computer wanted to do an update last
 

325
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,590
computer wanted to do an update last
night. It's very annoying.

326
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600

 

327
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,630

Uh let's broaden this out a little bit.

328
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,640
Uh let's broaden this out a little bit.
 

329
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,269
Uh let's broaden this out a little bit.
Bring this in a bit. There we go. So,

330
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
Bring this in a bit. There we go. So,
 

331
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,829
Bring this in a bit. There we go. So,
still sort of hanging on, watching the

332
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
still sort of hanging on, watching the
 

333
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,910
still sort of hanging on, watching the
VIX to see if it retests 17 uh sorry, 16

334
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920
VIX to see if it retests 17 uh sorry, 16
 

335
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,389
VIX to see if it retests 17 uh sorry, 16
75s or not. If we start to get over this

336
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
75s or not. If we start to get over this
 

337
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,910
75s or not. If we start to get over this
gap for a push. Let's go through the MAC

338
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
gap for a push. Let's go through the MAC
 

339
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,790
gap for a push. Let's go through the MAC
very, very quickly.

340
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
very, very quickly.
 

341
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,230
very, very quickly.
You're going to see the same story here,

342
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
You're going to see the same story here,
 

343
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,310
You're going to see the same story here,
folks. All right, range. Here's the

344
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
folks. All right, range. Here's the
 

345
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,389
folks. All right, range. Here's the
range is what Alex tries to avoid.

346
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
range is what Alex tries to avoid.
 

347
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,870
range is what Alex tries to avoid.
Here's the range. Look below and fail.

348
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
Here's the range. Look below and fail.
 

349
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,269
Here's the range. Look below and fail.
Look above and fail. Apple opening up

350
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
Look above and fail. Apple opening up
 

351
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,509
Look above and fail. Apple opening up
slight gap down.

352
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
slight gap down.
 

353
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,110
slight gap down.
Amazon

354
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120

 

355
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,389

starting to look a bit more bearish

356
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
starting to look a bit more bearish
 

357
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,790
starting to look a bit more bearish
here. Rolling over. Uh this gap here is

358
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
here. Rolling over. Uh this gap here is
 

359
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,470
here. Rolling over. Uh this gap here is
important. Do they want to close this

360
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,480
important. Do they want to close this
 

361
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,030
important. Do they want to close this
gap? All right. So somewhat of a range

362
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
gap? All right. So somewhat of a range
 

363
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,030
gap? All right. So somewhat of a range
fail breakout above. Never got back up

364
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
fail breakout above. Never got back up
 

365
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,470
fail breakout above. Never got back up
into this. They had the opportunity to

366
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
into this. They had the opportunity to
 

367
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,829
into this. They had the opportunity to
try and base. They couldn't. They've

368
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:33,839
try and base. They couldn't. They've
 

369
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,829
try and base. They couldn't. They've
rolled back down. Do they fill this gap

370
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
rolled back down. Do they fill this gap
 

371
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,509
rolled back down. Do they fill this gap
now? And if they fill it, are we going

372
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
now? And if they fill it, are we going
 

373
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,230
now? And if they fill it, are we going
bare flag for deeper on Amazon? Uh, Goo

374
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
bare flag for deeper on Amazon? Uh, Goo
 

375
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,590
bare flag for deeper on Amazon? Uh, Goo
doesn't look great out there for stocks

376
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
doesn't look great out there for stocks
 

377
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,550
doesn't look great out there for stocks
right now. I will say that. Goo, same

378
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,560
right now. I will say that. Goo, same
 

379
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,110
right now. I will say that. Goo, same
kind of story. There's the range after

380
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
kind of story. There's the range after
 

381
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,990
kind of story. There's the range after
breaking down. So, Tuesday, Wednesday,

382
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
breaking down. So, Tuesday, Wednesday,
 

383
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,990
breaking down. So, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Wednesday fail. Now, we're trapped

384
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,000
Wednesday fail. Now, we're trapped
 

385
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,389
Wednesday fail. Now, we're trapped
underneath Tuesday's low, right? That's

386
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
underneath Tuesday's low, right? That's
 

387
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,350
underneath Tuesday's low, right? That's
your pivot. So, 14s. If we can't reclaim

388
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,360
your pivot. So, 14s. If we can't reclaim
 

389
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,430
your pivot. So, 14s. If we can't reclaim
15s, let's call it, we're going to fail

390
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
15s, let's call it, we're going to fail
 

391
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,790
15s, let's call it, we're going to fail
further on Google. Meta, this is one of

392
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
further on Google. Meta, this is one of
 

393
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,430
further on Google. Meta, this is one of
the better looking stocks at the moment.

394
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
the better looking stocks at the moment.
 

395
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,350
the better looking stocks at the moment.
It's uh a bit more undervalued than some

396
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
It's uh a bit more undervalued than some
 

397
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,030
It's uh a bit more undervalued than some
of the others, but really we're watching

398
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
of the others, but really we're watching
 

399
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,670
of the others, but really we're watching
this pin down here, right? Where this

400
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
this pin down here, right? Where this
 

401
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,350
this pin down here, right? Where this
big buy came in, they're repricing the

402
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
big buy came in, they're repricing the
 

403
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,350
big buy came in, they're repricing the
whole thing. And yet again, this range

404
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
whole thing. And yet again, this range
 

405
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,509
whole thing. And yet again, this range
now has been developing since last

406
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
now has been developing since last
 

407
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,750
now has been developing since last
Tuesday. All right, so we're not moving.

408
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
Tuesday. All right, so we're not moving.
 

409
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,590
Tuesday. All right, so we're not moving.
This is tech not moving while we start

410
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
This is tech not moving while we start
 

411
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,350
This is tech not moving while we start
to rotate.

412
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:25,360
to rotate.
 

413
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,350
to rotate.
Microsoft,

414
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,360
Microsoft,
 

415
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,670
Microsoft,
right? Softy tried to reclaim. We can

416
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
right? Softy tried to reclaim. We can
 

417
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,470
right? Softy tried to reclaim. We can
talk about this big downtrend failed to

418
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:32,480
talk about this big downtrend failed to
 

419
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,069
talk about this big downtrend failed to
break lower had the push above the pivot

420
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
break lower had the push above the pivot
 

421
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,470
break lower had the push above the pivot
head and shoulders failed back down into

422
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:38,480
head and shoulders failed back down into
 

423
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,990
head and shoulders failed back down into
here. So this is where buyers are

424
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
here. So this is where buyers are
 

425
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,310
here. So this is where buyers are
hanging out. So softy buyers are hanging

426
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,320
hanging out. So softy buyers are hanging
 

427
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,470
hanging out. So softy buyers are hanging
out at 400 and below. If they can hold

428
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,480
out at 400 and below. If they can hold
 

429
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,910
out at 400 and below. If they can hold
that they will have another attempt to

430
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:45,920
that they will have another attempt to
 

431
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,590
that they will have another attempt to
reclaim 20s and 30s or 20s and 25s.

432
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:49,600
reclaim 20s and 30s or 20s and 25s.
 

433
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,790
reclaim 20s and 30s or 20s and 25s.
Again a bit of a range really 400 to

434
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
Again a bit of a range really 400 to
 

435
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,710
Again a bit of a range really 400 to
420s 20 $20 range there on softy. Nvidia

436
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
420s 20 $20 range there on softy. Nvidia
 

437
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,189
420s 20 $20 range there on softy. Nvidia
is the one where possible it can get a

438
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199
is the one where possible it can get a
 

439
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,710
is the one where possible it can get a
breakout. All right, it's looking a

440
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,720
breakout. All right, it's looking a
 

441
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,710
breakout. All right, it's looking a
little bit better. Gapping up slightly.

442
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
little bit better. Gapping up slightly.
 

443
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,150
little bit better. Gapping up slightly.
We can see we've built out all this

444
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160
We can see we've built out all this
 

445
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,069
We can see we've built out all this
liquidity for this downtrend. All right,

446
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,079
liquidity for this downtrend. All right,
 

447
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,470
liquidity for this downtrend. All right,
left shoulder, head, right shoulder. If

448
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:08,480
left shoulder, head, right shoulder. If
 

449
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,910
left shoulder, head, right shoulder. If
we can get going, you can see I've got

450
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
we can get going, you can see I've got
 

451
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,829
we can get going, you can see I've got
price alerts here. If we can get going

452
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839
price alerts here. If we can get going
 

453
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,350
price alerts here. If we can get going
over that, there's a chance we need to

454
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
over that, there's a chance we need to
 

455
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,870
over that, there's a chance we need to
be very careful with the fail breakout

456
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:14,880
be very careful with the fail breakout
 

457
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,350
be very careful with the fail breakout
as always. And Tesla's trying to get

458
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
as always. And Tesla's trying to get
 

459
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,110
as always. And Tesla's trying to get
that recovery. Same kind of story. All

460
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
that recovery. Same kind of story. All
 

461
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,430
that recovery. Same kind of story. All
right, built out some liquidity here. We

462
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,440
right, built out some liquidity here. We
 

463
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,069
right, built out some liquidity here. We
see this here as you look below. There's

464
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:24,079
see this here as you look below. There's
 

465
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,910
see this here as you look below. There's
your shoulder line. There's your

466
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:25,920
your shoulder line. There's your
 

467

00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,080

 

623
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,870

somewhat

624
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
somewhat
 

625
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,110
somewhat
upsetting that it's not seeing that mic

626
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,120
upsetting that it's not seeing that mic
 

627
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,390
upsetting that it's not seeing that mic
properly.

628
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,400

 

629
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,990

Let's try.

630
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,000

 

631
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,909

Probably need to shut OBS down and start

632
00:17:59,909 --> 00:17:59,919
Probably need to shut OBS down and start
 

633
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,150
Probably need to shut OBS down and start
again. Unfortunately,

634
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
again. Unfortunately,
 

635
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,230
again. Unfortunately,
I can't, guys. And some of you are

636
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,240
I can't, guys. And some of you are
 

637
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,830
I can't, guys. And some of you are
probably joining late that can't see my

638
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:05,840
probably joining late that can't see my
 

639
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,430
probably joining late that can't see my
mic. Oh, it's just found my mic, I

640
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,440
mic. Oh, it's just found my mic, I
 

641
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,950
mic. Oh, it's just found my mic, I
think.

642
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
think.
 

643
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,549
think.
There we go. Back to normal now, I

644
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:10,559
There we go. Back to normal now, I
 

645
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,110
There we go. Back to normal now, I
think. There we go.

646
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,120
think. There we go.
 

647
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,430
think. There we go.
Yes. Perfect. That little unplug worked.

648
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,440
Yes. Perfect. That little unplug worked.
 

649
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,590
Yes. Perfect. That little unplug worked.
Okay.

650
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600
Okay.
 

651
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,350
Okay.
Got to love technology. All right. You

652
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
Got to love technology. All right. You
 

653
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:28,230
Got to love technology. All right. You
have to love technology.

654
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,240

 

655
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,750

Let's see then. Let's see how we go

656
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
Let's see then. Let's see how we go
 

657
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,470
Let's see then. Let's see how we go
here.

658
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,480
here.
 

659
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,230
here.
So, at the moment can dip down towards

660
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,240
So, at the moment can dip down towards
 

661
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,909
So, at the moment can dip down towards
the gray box. Previous day value high

662
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:35,919
the gray box. Previous day value high
 

663
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,470
the gray box. Previous day value high
has caught a bid. Come up to the current

664
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:38,480
has caught a bid. Come up to the current
 

665
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,070
has caught a bid. Come up to the current
developing week point of control. So,

666
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
developing week point of control. So,
 

667
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,590
developing week point of control. So,
we're just like trapping between the two

668
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:41,600
we're just like trapping between the two
 

669
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,909
we're just like trapping between the two
like we tal about. Let this get through

670
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
like we tal about. Let this get through
 

671
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,750
like we tal about. Let this get through
the uh opening range for a bit. I have

672
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760
the uh opening range for a bit. I have
 

673
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,270
the uh opening range for a bit. I have
left my glasses next door overnight. All

674
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
left my glasses next door overnight. All
 

675
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,630
left my glasses next door overnight. All
right, let me just grab my glasses

676
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:48,640
right, let me just grab my glasses
 

677
00:18:48,640 --> 00:19:19,830
right, let me just grab my glasses
quick, but I can't see it.

678
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840

 

679
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,990

Sorry folks, nothing like a blind man

680
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
Sorry folks, nothing like a blind man
 

681
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,110
Sorry folks, nothing like a blind man
trying to watch a uh a screen.

682
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,120
trying to watch a uh a screen.
 

683
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,190
trying to watch a uh a screen.
Not a good start. I'm sorry, Tim. Not a

684
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,200
Not a good start. I'm sorry, Tim. Not a
 

685
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,029
Not a good start. I'm sorry, Tim. Not a
good start. Yeah. Yes, he's burnt out

686
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
good start. Yeah. Yes, he's burnt out
 

687
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,310
good start. Yeah. Yes, he's burnt out
right now. All right. Couldn't get his

688
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,320
right now. All right. Couldn't get his
 

689
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:42,630
right now. All right. Couldn't get his
mic working. Couldn't see properly.

690
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:42,640

 

691
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,070

You're saying it's worse now. It

692
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,080
You're saying it's worse now. It
 

693
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:55,990
You're saying it's worse now. It
shouldn't be worse now.

694
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,000

 

695
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,590

Good, good, good, good. All right. Still

696
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:57,600
Good, good, good, good. All right. Still
 

697
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,190
Good, good, good, good. All right. Still
catching a bit of previous day's value

698
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
catching a bit of previous day's value
 

699
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,870
catching a bit of previous day's value
area high. This we're getting very tight

700
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:00,880
area high. This we're getting very tight
 

701
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,110
area high. This we're getting very tight
down here. I'm just watching all the

702
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,120
down here. I'm just watching all the
 

703
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,549
down here. I'm just watching all the
liquidity come in this area. I'm not

704
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:04,559
liquidity come in this area. I'm not
 

705
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,310
liquidity come in this area. I'm not
interested in trading right now. Like as

706
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,320
interested in trading right now. Like as
 

707
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,789
interested in trading right now. Like as
you can see, I'm quite genuinely not

708
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:08,799
you can see, I'm quite genuinely not
 

709
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,190
you can see, I'm quite genuinely not
interested in trading right now. We have

710
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,200
interested in trading right now. We have
 

711
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,190
interested in trading right now. We have
to start moving away from these areas

712
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,200
to start moving away from these areas
 

713
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,750
to start moving away from these areas
one way or another.

714
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:15,760
one way or another.
 

715
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,270
one way or another.
Give you a quick read out on the MAG.

716
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
Give you a quick read out on the MAG.
 

717
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,710
Give you a quick read out on the MAG.
And you can see even on the MAG, we've

718
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
And you can see even on the MAG, we've
 

719
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,310
And you can see even on the MAG, we've
got a split book. So Tesla 1.23% up,

720
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,320
got a split book. So Tesla 1.23% up,
 

721
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,350
got a split book. So Tesla 1.23% up,
Nvidia 1.21% up, Microsoft pretty much

722
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,360
Nvidia 1.21% up, Microsoft pretty much
 

723
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,950
Nvidia 1.21% up, Microsoft pretty much
flat, Meta 0.62% up, Google slightly

724
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:28,960
flat, Meta 0.62% up, Google slightly
 

725
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,630
flat, Meta 0.62% up, Google slightly
down, uh like pretty much flat, Amazon

726
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:32,640
down, uh like pretty much flat, Amazon
 

727
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,190
down, uh like pretty much flat, Amazon
half a percent down, Apple 1% down. We

728
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
half a percent down, Apple 1% down. We
 

729
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,310
half a percent down, Apple 1% down. We
are a complete mixed bag. Complete mixed

730
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320
are a complete mixed bag. Complete mixed
 

731
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:49,270
are a complete mixed bag. Complete mixed
bag right now.

732
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,280

 

733
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,029

Think we will want to try and lift into

734
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:51,039
Think we will want to try and lift into
 

735
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,190
Think we will want to try and lift into
600 today. That's what my gut says, but

736
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,200
600 today. That's what my gut says, but
 

737
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,549
600 today. That's what my gut says, but
it's just whether they've got the juice

738
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:54,559
it's just whether they've got the juice
 

739
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,710
it's just whether they've got the juice
to do it. And then it's making the

740
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:56,720
to do it. And then it's making the
 

741
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,390
to do it. And then it's making the
decision. Do I want to play long up to

742
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
decision. Do I want to play long up to
 

743
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,149
decision. Do I want to play long up to
the sixes or do I want to let them do

744
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:00,159
the sixes or do I want to let them do
 

745
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,470
the sixes or do I want to let them do
all their nonsense and then fade them

746
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:02,480
all their nonsense and then fade them
 

747
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,230
all their nonsense and then fade them
back down for the fail breakout and the

748
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,240
back down for the fail breakout and the
 

749
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,110
back down for the fail breakout and the
trap? That's where my mind's at. That's

750
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,120
trap? That's where my mind's at. That's
 

751
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,630
trap? That's where my mind's at. That's
what I was looking for yesterday as

752
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:08,640
what I was looking for yesterday as
 

753
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,149
what I was looking for yesterday as
well. I think we are really going to

754
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:10,159
well. I think we are really going to
 

755
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,230
well. I think we are really going to
struggle that if we do get through

756
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,240
struggle that if we do get through
 

757
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,230
struggle that if we do get through
sixes, we will probably go eights pretty

758
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,240
sixes, we will probably go eights pretty
 

759
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,830
sixes, we will probably go eights pretty
quick. All right. The reason I'm saying

760
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:15,840
quick. All right. The reason I'm saying
 

761
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,510
quick. All right. The reason I'm saying
that when we look at here on the hourly,

762
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,520
that when we look at here on the hourly,
 

763
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,149
that when we look at here on the hourly,
right, I am watching to see is today

764
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:22,159
right, I am watching to see is today
 

765
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,789
right, I am watching to see is today
willing to move outside of this range

766
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:24,799
willing to move outside of this range
 

767
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,230
willing to move outside of this range
and run these stops and come up to here,

768
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,240
and run these stops and come up to here,
 

769
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,190
and run these stops and come up to here,
right? Where we have this and this. Are

770
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
right? Where we have this and this. Are
 

771
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,950
right? Where we have this and this. Are
we going to fade that? If not, if we get

772
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:32,960
we going to fade that? If not, if we get
 

773
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,710
we going to fade that? If not, if we get
through that, look how thin we are. We

774
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
through that, look how thin we are. We
 

775
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,590
through that, look how thin we are. We
can go straight up to eight. So, I

776
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:37,600
can go straight up to eight. So, I
 

777
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,350
can go straight up to eight. So, I
really don't want to be long at the top

778
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,360
really don't want to be long at the top
 

779
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,789
really don't want to be long at the top
here. I don't want to be short at the

780
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:40,799
here. I don't want to be short at the
 

781
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,070
here. I don't want to be short at the
bottom down here. We need to see a

782
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,080
bottom down here. We need to see a
 

783
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,830
bottom down here. We need to see a
breakout hold. Maybe there's a long

784
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:43,840
breakout hold. Maybe there's a long
 

785
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,590
breakout hold. Maybe there's a long
opportunity up to here which we then get

786
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
opportunity up to here which we then get
 

787
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,750
opportunity up to here which we then get
out of. We see money take money. If

788
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:47,760
out of. We see money take money. If
 

789
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,350
out of. We see money take money. If
we're going to stay in the range, Alex

790
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,360
we're going to stay in the range, Alex
 

791
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,710
we're going to stay in the range, Alex
is probably not going to do anything

792
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:50,720
is probably not going to do anything
 

793
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,789
is probably not going to do anything
today. Alex does not like trading ranges

794
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:52,799
today. Alex does not like trading ranges
 

795
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,070
today. Alex does not like trading ranges
as we all know.

796
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
as we all know.
 

797
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:28,390
as we all know.
So trying to be extremely patient today.

798
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:28,400

 

799
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,070

We're quite literally not moving here.

800
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,080
We're quite literally not moving here.
 

801
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,390
We're quite literally not moving here.
Market's stuck since the open. Let's get

802
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
Market's stuck since the open. Let's get
 

803
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,470
Market's stuck since the open. Let's get
some volume on.

804
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,480
some volume on.
 

805
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,190
some volume on.
Nothing to do, folks. In my mind, we're

806
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,200
Nothing to do, folks. In my mind, we're
 

807
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,270
Nothing to do, folks. In my mind, we're
not doing anything yet. Back down to

808
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,280
not doing anything yet. Back down to
 

809
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,190
not doing anything yet. Back down to
value area high from previous day again.

810
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,200
value area high from previous day again.
 

811
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:52,549
value area high from previous day again.
What is going on here? [\h__\h] hell.

812
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:52,559

 

813
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,950

That's better.

814
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:56,960

 

815
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,390

Tech on one right now. Clearly my tech

816
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,400
Tech on one right now. Clearly my tech
 

817
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,909
Tech on one right now. Clearly my tech
inputs.

818
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:01,919
inputs.
 

819
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,549
inputs.
Make sure there's 20. There we go. All

820
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:04,559
Make sure there's 20. There we go. All
 

821
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,590
Make sure there's 20. There we go. All
right. So, they're still holding

822
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:05,600
right. So, they're still holding
 

823
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,070
right. So, they're still holding
previous day value area

824
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,080
previous day value area
 

825
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,830
previous day value area
for now. Uh I'm just watching these

826
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:09,840
for now. Uh I'm just watching these
 

827
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,430
for now. Uh I'm just watching these
blocks I trade backwards and forwards.

828
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:11,440
blocks I trade backwards and forwards.
 

829
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:18,630
blocks I trade backwards and forwards.
There's not much going on here.

830
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:18,640

 

831
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,390

I'm too soft compared to other streams

832
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:20,400
I'm too soft compared to other streams
 

833
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,669
I'm too soft compared to other streams
opens. I don't know what that means,

834
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:21,679
opens. I don't know what that means,
 

835
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,830
opens. I don't know what that means,
mate. Uh I'm not looking to attack when

836
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:23,840
mate. Uh I'm not looking to attack when
 

837
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,510
mate. Uh I'm not looking to attack when
the market doesn't know what it wants to

838
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:25,520
the market doesn't know what it wants to
 

839
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,549
the market doesn't know what it wants to
do.

840
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:28,559

 

841
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,310

Thoughts on or strap? Yeah, I mean orb

00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:30,320
Thoughts on or strap? Yeah, I mean orb
 

843
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,149
Thoughts on or strap? Yeah, I mean orb
strat is good strategy. If you want to

844
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:32,159
strat is good strategy. If you want to
 

845
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,870
strat is good strategy. If you want to
play 5minute orb or a 15-minute orb,

play 5minute orb or a 15-minute orb,
won't work every day. You've got to

848
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:36,159
won't work every day. You've got to
 

849
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,350
won't work every day. You've got to
understand the conditions that you're in

850
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:37,360
understand the conditions that you're in
 

851
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:50,230
understand the conditions that you're in
for it.

852
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240

 

853
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,789

Yeah, volume pro. I think Trading View

854
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
Yeah, volume pro. I think Trading View
 

855
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:58,789
Yeah, volume pro. I think Trading View
has just been on one.

856
00:23:58,789 --> 00:23:58,799

 

857
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,310

They want me to do something. I can't do

858
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,320
They want me to do something. I can't do
 

859
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,510
They want me to do something. I can't do
something if there's no trade here,

860
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
something if there's no trade here,
 

861
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,149
something if there's no trade here,
folks. Like all you noobs who are

862
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:04,159
folks. Like all you noobs who are
 

863
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,669
folks. Like all you noobs who are
turning up for the first time, there's

864
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:05,679
turning up for the first time, there's
 

865
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,149
turning up for the first time, there's
no setup right here right now. Not in my

866
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:08,159
no setup right here right now. Not in my
 

867
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,510
no setup right here right now. Not in my
mind. We have to wait. Let's take this

868
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
mind. We have to wait. Let's take this
 

869
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,350
mind. We have to wait. Let's take this
histogram box down. Don't want that.

870
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,360
histogram box down. Don't want that.
 

871
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,990
histogram box down. Don't want that.
There we go. All right. We have to wait.

872
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
There we go. All right. We have to wait.
 

873
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,430
There we go. All right. We have to wait.
Currently, dips are holding previous day

874
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,440
Currently, dips are holding previous day
 

875
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,990
Currently, dips are holding previous day
value high, but you'd have to be fairly

876
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,000
value high, but you'd have to be fairly
 

877
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,590
value high, but you'd have to be fairly
brave to be buying that. Looking for a

878
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
brave to be buying that. Looking for a
 

879
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,830
brave to be buying that. Looking for a
rotation up up top. I haven't seen

880
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:23,840
rotation up up top. I haven't seen
 

881
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,510
rotation up up top. I haven't seen
enough shorts get trapped down here yet.

882
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:25,520
enough shorts get trapped down here yet.
 

883
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,870
enough shorts get trapped down here yet.
So, we're watching it. I mean, there are

884
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:26,880
So, we're watching it. I mean, there are
 

885
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,789
So, we're watching it. I mean, there are
sellers coming in under 47s,

886
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:30,799
sellers coming in under 47s,
 

887
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,310
sellers coming in under 47s,
but there is a buying block that got

888
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,320
but there is a buying block that got
 

889
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,630
but there is a buying block that got
caught at 65.

890
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:34,640
caught at 65.
 

891
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,630
caught at 65.
So, basically, we're trading 50s to 70s

892
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:36,640
So, basically, we're trading 50s to 70s
 

893
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,669
So, basically, we're trading 50s to 70s
and that's it since the open.

894
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:39,679
and that's it since the open.
 

895
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,070
and that's it since the open.
I'm not just going to uh click a button

00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
I'm not just going to uh click a button
 

897

what I will be doing,
right? You make money where you don't

906
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:50,880
right? You make money where you don't
 

907
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,190
right? You make money where you don't
lose it. Just remember that.

908
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200

 

909
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,190

It's like going to casino. If you play

910
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,200
It's like going to casino. If you play
 

911
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,430
It's like going to casino. If you play
like poker and you see someone's you

912
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
like poker and you see someone's you
 

913
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,950
like poker and you see someone's you
notice their tail playing poker, you

914
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:00,960
notice their tail playing poker, you
 

915
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,029
notice their tail playing poker, you
want to sit on that table. You don't

916
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:03,039
want to sit on that table. You don't
 

917
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,710
want to sit on that table. You don't
want to sit on a table where a guy's

918
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:06,720
want to sit on a table where a guy's
 

919
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,789
want to sit on a table where a guy's
not really doing anything. When you're

920
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:08,799
not really doing anything. When you're
 

921
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,230
not really doing anything. When you're
just going around in a circle, there's

922
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:10,240
just going around in a circle, there's
 

923
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:17,590
just going around in a circle, there's
no edge.

924
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:17,600

 

925
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,350

Blew my 50k account yesterday. Managed

926
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,360
Blew my 50k account yesterday. Managed
 

927
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,190
Blew my 50k account yesterday. Managed
to get 9k profit from it. Now I'm back

928
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:21,200
to get 9k profit from it. Now I'm back
 

929
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,630
to get 9k profit from it. Now I'm back
on the horse and go again. Would you

930
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:22,640
on the horse and go again. Would you
 

931
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,430
on the horse and go again. Would you
recommend 100k over a 50k or vice versa?

932
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:25,440
recommend 100k over a 50k or vice versa?
 

933
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,870
recommend 100k over a 50k or vice versa?
50k is fine, especially if you've

934
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:26,880
50k is fine, especially if you've
 

935
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,110
50k is fine, especially if you've
already made n grand out of it. I don't

936
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,120
already made n grand out of it. I don't
 

937
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,950
already made n grand out of it. I don't
think you need to be uh giving yourself

938
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:30,960
think you need to be uh giving yourself
 

939
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,669
think you need to be uh giving yourself
a harder task in passing an eval, but

940
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:33,679
a harder task in passing an eval, but
 

941
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,029
a harder task in passing an eval, but
know if you want the bigger draw down,

942
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:35,039
know if you want the bigger draw down,
 

943
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:35,990
know if you want the bigger draw down,
then obviously you're going to have to

944
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,000
then obviously you're going to have to
 

945
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,510
then obviously you're going to have to
go up.

946
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:39,520

 

947
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,190

Ain't this a bull flag? Someone says,

948
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:41,200
Ain't this a bull flag? Someone says,
 

949
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,950
Ain't this a bull flag? Someone says,
"Well, I mean, you could argue it is a

950
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:42,960
"Well, I mean, you could argue it is a
 

951
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,110
"Well, I mean, you could argue it is a
bull flag, but where are you placed?"

952
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,120
bull flag, but where are you placed?"
 

953
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,310
bull flag, but where are you placed?"
Zoom out. Zoom out. Look at where you

954
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,320
Zoom out. Zoom out. Look at where you
 

955
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,149
Zoom out. Zoom out. Look at where you
would be trying to do a bull flag if you

956
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:50,159
would be trying to do a bull flag if you
 

957
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,390
would be trying to do a bull flag if you
were trying to take this. Right. Look at

958
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
were trying to take this. Right. Look at
 

959
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,110
were trying to take this. Right. Look at
this. This has been a grind up the whole

960
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,120
this. This has been a grind up the whole
 

961
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,549
this. This has been a grind up the whole
time. Grind up.

962
00:25:58,549 --> 00:25:58,559
time. Grind up.
 

963
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,230
time. Grind up.
And you are thinking about taking a bull

964
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,240
And you are thinking about taking a bull
 

965
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,190
And you are thinking about taking a bull
flag right at the top of the range

966
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,200
flag right at the top of the range
 

967
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,310
flag right at the top of the range
right where we think we're going to have

968
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:04,320
right where we think we're going to have
 

969
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,630
right where we think we're going to have
fail breakout 20-day there as well 5day

970
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:06,640
fail breakout 20-day there as well 5day
 

971
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,390
fail breakout 20-day there as well 5day
we are just trapped this is a big

972
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:08,400
we are just trapped this is a big
 

973
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,909
we are just trapped this is a big
liquidity building zone it might very

974
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:09,919
liquidity building zone it might very
 

975
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,269
liquidity building zone it might very
well be like we talked about that we're

976
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:11,279
well be like we talked about that we're
 

977
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,549
well be like we talked about that we're
going to start breaking out but I would

978
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:12,559
going to start breaking out but I would
 

979
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,710
going to start breaking out but I would
rather see it do this and hold and try

980
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:14,720
rather see it do this and hold and try
 

981
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,710
rather see it do this and hold and try
and risk down here when it's in a range

982
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:16,720
and risk down here when it's in a range
 

983
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,070
and risk down here when it's in a range
and doesn't really know what it wants to

984
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,080
and doesn't really know what it wants to
 

985
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,830
and doesn't really know what it wants to
do so let's see okay got to watch the

986
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:19,840
do so let's see okay got to watch the
 

987
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,990
do so let's see okay got to watch the
tape here can't answer so many questions

988
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,000
tape here can't answer so many questions
 

989
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,149
tape here can't answer so many questions
buys came in here at 70s again so are we

990
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:24,159
buys came in here at 70s again so are we
 

991
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,990
buys came in here at 70s again so are we
going to find acceptance over 70s to get

992
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,000
going to find acceptance over 70s to get
 

993
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,789
going to find acceptance over 70s to get
to 2420 20s is the question now. So,

994
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:28,799
to 2420 20s is the question now. So,
 

995
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,950
to 2420 20s is the question now. So,
watching now, here comes the fours. Can

996
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
watching now, here comes the fours. Can
 

997
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,029
watching now, here comes the fours. Can
they dip down and hold 70s for me or

998
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:33,039
they dip down and hold 70s for me or
 

999
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,310
they dip down and hold 70s for me or
something? Can they show me that they're

1000
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,320
something? Can they show me that they're
 

1001
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,230
something? Can they show me that they're
willing to hold 70s? So, here we go back

1002
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:36,240
willing to hold 70s? So, here we go back
 

1003
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,870
willing to hold 70s? So, here we go back
to 70s. Are they willing to bid here is

1004
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:38,880
to 70s. Are they willing to bid here is
 

1005
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,630
to 70s. Are they willing to bid here is
the question. If they are, I'll consider

1006
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640
the question. If they are, I'll consider
 

1007
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,990
the question. If they are, I'll consider
the long. If they're not, which they're

1008
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,000
the long. If they're not, which they're
 

1009
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,510
the long. If they're not, which they're
not right now, we go right back down

1010
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:43,520
not right now, we go right back down
 

1011
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,470
not right now, we go right back down
into range. No trade. They have to hold

1012
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:46,480
into range. No trade. They have to hold
 

1013
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,750
into range. No trade. They have to hold
70s there. So, we're back down to

1014
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
70s there. So, we're back down to
 

1015
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,909
70s there. So, we're back down to
towards VPO at 50s again. So, that's a

1016
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:49,919
towards VPO at 50s again. So, that's a
 

1017
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,470
towards VPO at 50s again. So, that's a
failed breakout and a clear out now. And

1018
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:52,480
failed breakout and a clear out now. And
 

1019
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,230
failed breakout and a clear out now. And
we're coming back down to the 50s. And I

1020
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,240
we're coming back down to the 50s. And I
 

1021
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,830
we're coming back down to the 50s. And I
will tell you, a big seller last came in

1022
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:55,840
will tell you, a big seller last came in
 

1023
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,909
will tell you, a big seller last came in
at 46es. So buyers now need to protect

1024
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
at 46es. So buyers now need to protect
 

1025
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,390
at 46es. So buyers now need to protect
46es to keep that seller stuck at the

1026
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,400
46es to keep that seller stuck at the
 

1027
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,870
46es to keep that seller stuck at the
lows. These guys need to make their mind

1028
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:02,880
lows. These guys need to make their mind
 

1029
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:14,310
lows. These guys need to make their mind
up what we're doing.

1030
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:14,320

 

1031
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,909

Do I keep positions overnight only on

1032
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:15,919
Do I keep positions overnight only on
 

1033
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:29,269
Do I keep positions overnight only on
swing accounts?

1034
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:29,279

 

1035
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,510

Okay, back into current day's profile.

1036
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:31,520
Okay, back into current day's profile.
 

1037
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,269
Okay, back into current day's profile.
You can see very, very tight here,

1038
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
You can see very, very tight here,
 

1039
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,110
You can see very, very tight here,
folks.

1040
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,120
folks.
 

1041
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,789
folks.
So, just failed that breakout to the

1042
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:36,799
So, just failed that breakout to the
 

1043
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,029
So, just failed that breakout to the
gray zone. Failed the 400s, failed to

1044
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:39,039
gray zone. Failed the 400s, failed to
 

1045
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,870
gray zone. Failed the 400s, failed to
hold 70s. We're right back into this guy

1046
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:40,880
hold 70s. We're right back into this guy
 

1047
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,430
hold 70s. We're right back into this guy
at 46 who last got stuck here, and

1048
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:43,440
at 46 who last got stuck here, and
 

1049
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,870
at 46 who last got stuck here, and
they're trying to absorb versus him at

1050
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:44,880
they're trying to absorb versus him at
 

1051
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,029
they're trying to absorb versus him at
46. This rotation is going to keep

1052
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,039
46. This rotation is going to keep
 

1053
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,789
46. This rotation is going to keep
happening. I'm not interested in taking

1054
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:48,799
happening. I'm not interested in taking
 

1055
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,269
happening. I'm not interested in taking
this until this market makes it mind up.

1056
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:51,279
this until this market makes it mind up.
 

1057
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,549
this until this market makes it mind up.
All right. Maybe this is something that

1058
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:52,559
All right. Maybe this is something that
 

1059
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,389
All right. Maybe this is something that
you like playing. Definitely is not

1060
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:54,399
you like playing. Definitely is not
 

1061
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:02,950
you like playing. Definitely is not
something I like playing.

1062
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:02,960

 

1063
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,870

Do I trade ICT concepts? I do not.

1064
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:06,880
Do I trade ICT concepts? I do not.
 

1065
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,110
Do I trade ICT concepts? I do not.
I do not. Unless you want to talk about

1066
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,120
I do not. Unless you want to talk about
 

1067
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,590
I do not. Unless you want to talk about
something like a failed breakout, which

1068
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:11,600
something like a failed breakout, which
 

1069
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,990
something like a failed breakout, which
he would call a Judas swing, right? If

1070
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,000
he would call a Judas swing, right? If
 

1071
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,590
he would call a Judas swing, right? If
you want to call that his concept, it's

1072
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:15,600
you want to call that his concept, it's
 

1073
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,510
you want to call that his concept, it's
just a failed breakout.

1074
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:17,520
just a failed breakout.
 

1075
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,870
just a failed breakout.
Then yes, I would say I guess I guess I

1076
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:20,880
Then yes, I would say I guess I guess I
 

1077
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,789
Then yes, I would say I guess I guess I
do if I trade in and bounce. Okay, back

1078
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:22,799
do if I trade in and bounce. Okay, back
 

1079
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,149
do if I trade in and bounce. Okay, back
to these 90s. So they protected that

1080
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:24,159
to these 90s. So they protected that
 

1081
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,389
to these 90s. So they protected that
seller at the low. Back to these 90s.

1082
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:26,399
seller at the low. Back to these 90s.
 

1083
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,470
seller at the low. Back to these 90s.
Big buyer just came in there. 70 lot at

1084
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:28,480
Big buyer just came in there. 70 lot at
 

1085
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,549
Big buyer just came in there. 70 lot at
the high is now caught at 87s. All

1086
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:30,559
the high is now caught at 87s. All
 

1087
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,110
the high is now caught at 87s. All
right, so 70 lot is now caught at 87's

1088
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,120
right, so 70 lot is now caught at 87's
 

1089
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,510
right, so 70 lot is now caught at 87's
buy side. Buyers I still think we need

1090
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:35,520
buy side. Buyers I still think we need
 

1091
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,750
buy side. Buyers I still think we need
to protect 65s here if they're going to

1092
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:37,760
to protect 65s here if they're going to
 

1093
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,430
to protect 65s here if they're going to
get a continuation move higher otherwise

1094
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,440
get a continuation move higher otherwise
 

1095
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,110
get a continuation move higher otherwise
they're going to get caught again. Yes,

have a big uh sell lot caught at 58. So,
we're trading between 58 and 90 right

1114
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,000
we're trading between 58 and 90 right
 

1115
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,990
we're trading between 58 and 90 right
now. while they make their mind up. Can

1116
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,000
now. while they make their mind up. Can
 

1117
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,549
now. while they make their mind up. Can
the buyers protect 58s and look to take

1118
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:08,559
the buyers protect 58s and look to take
 

1119
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,750
the buyers protect 58s and look to take
out this high or not? That is what

1120
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:11,760
out this high or not? That is what
 

1121
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,029
out this high or not? That is what
they're trying to do. They've got to get

1122
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:13,039
they're trying to do. They've got to get
 

1123
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,110
they're trying to do. They've got to get
back above 90. If they get back above

1124
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,120
back above 90. If they get back above
 

1125
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,269
back above 90. If they get back above
90, they have the squeeze on to get to

1126
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:17,279
90, they have the squeeze on to get to
 

1127
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,269
90, they have the squeeze on to get to
420s here. Big buyer coming in trying to

1128
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:19,279
420s here. Big buyer coming in trying to
 

1129
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,710
420s here. Big buyer coming in trying to
step on the tape to force here. Here we

1130
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:20,720
step on the tape to force here. Here we
 

1131
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,549
step on the tape to force here. Here we
go. Back to 90. They've got to get back

1132
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:22,559
go. Back to 90. They've got to get back
 

1133
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,149
go. Back to 90. They've got to get back
above this now. Very, very important

1134
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:24,159
above this now. Very, very important
 

1135
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,909
above this now. Very, very important
these buyers get above this now for this

1136
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:25,919
these buyers get above this now for this
 

1137
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,870
these buyers get above this now for this
squeeze. We can consider this if we do

1138
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:28,880
squeeze. We can consider this if we do
 

1139
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,070
squeeze. We can consider this if we do
it. It'll get back above this for a

1140
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,080
it. It'll get back above this for a
 

1141
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:38,149
it. It'll get back above this for a
squeeze up to 440s probably.

1142
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:38,159

 

1143
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,149

So far, you can see we're just building

1144
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:40,159
So far, you can see we're just building
 

1145
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,389
So far, you can see we're just building
liquidity out up here where this player

1146
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:42,399
liquidity out up here where this player
 

1147
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,149
liquidity out up here where this player
keeps getting trapped. All right, this

1148
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:44,159
keeps getting trapped. All right, this
 

1149
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,549
keeps getting trapped. All right, this
player right here keeps getting trapped

1150
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:46,559
player right here keeps getting trapped
 

1151
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,950
player right here keeps getting trapped
at 88. So 87. You can see every time

1152
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:48,960
at 88. So 87. You can see every time
 

1153
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,350
at 88. So 87. You can see every time
he's adding market size up here. Guy

1154
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:51,360
he's adding market size up here. Guy
 

1155
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,789
he's adding market size up here. Guy
stepped in at 80. We're not getting

1156
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:52,799
stepped in at 80. We're not getting
 

1157
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,710
stepped in at 80. We're not getting
acceptance higher, right? We keep

1158
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:54,720
acceptance higher, right? We keep
 

1159
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,990
acceptance higher, right? We keep
getting stuck up here. this where the

1160
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,000
getting stuck up here. this where the
 

1161
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,590
getting stuck up here. this where the
buyers caught a seller is caught down

1162
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:57,600
buyers caught a seller is caught down
 

1163
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,590
buyers caught a seller is caught down
here at 47 and a little bit at 58.

1164
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:01,600
here at 47 and a little bit at 58.
 

1165
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,669
here at 47 and a little bit at 58.
So it's just a rotation until we see

1166
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:03,679
So it's just a rotation until we see
 

1167
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,510
So it's just a rotation until we see
otherwise. So still no trade for me.

1168
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:05,520
otherwise. So still no trade for me.
 

1169
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,669
otherwise. So still no trade for me.
Still waiting. So fail breakout of 90.

1170
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:07,679
Still waiting. So fail breakout of 90.
 

1171
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,350
Still waiting. So fail breakout of 90.
Buyers caught up at 90s. They're going

1172
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:09,360
Buyers caught up at 90s. They're going
 

1173
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,590
Buyers caught up at 90s. They're going
to trade downside. We're losing BPO now.

1174
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:11,600
to trade downside. We're losing BPO now.
 

1175
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,430
to trade downside. We're losing BPO now.
And then probably if we lose this, we're

1176
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:13,440
And then probably if we lose this, we're
 

1177
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,070
And then probably if we lose this, we're
going to trade to 47s and test to see if

1178
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,080
going to trade to 47s and test to see if
 

1179
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,710
going to trade to 47s and test to see if
that seller stays stuck. So the rotation

1180
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:18,720
that seller stays stuck. So the rotation
 

1181
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,830
that seller stays stuck. So the rotation
just keeps moving.

1182
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:25,840

 

1183
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,870

CVD selling. Yeah, CVD is selling, but

1184
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:28,880
CVD selling. Yeah, CVD is selling, but
 

1185
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,310
CVD selling. Yeah, CVD is selling, but
we're not selling. So, what does that

1186
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:30,320
we're not selling. So, what does that
 

1187
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,070
we're not selling. So, what does that
mean? I mean, we are in the opening few

1188
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,080
mean? I mean, we are in the opening few
 

1189
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,430
mean? I mean, we are in the opening few
minutes, so you got to be careful. We're

1190
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:33,440
minutes, so you got to be careful. We're
 

1191
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,470
minutes, so you got to be careful. We're
only 12 minutes into the day. But if CVD

1192
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:36,480
only 12 minutes into the day. But if CVD
 

1193
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,310
only 12 minutes into the day. But if CVD
is selling and we're not moving lower,

1194
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,320
is selling and we're not moving lower,
 

1195
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,909
is selling and we're not moving lower,
it means there's buying uh absorption on

1196
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:41,919
it means there's buying uh absorption on
 

1197
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,269
it means there's buying uh absorption on
the tape. Someone is absorbing it

1198
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:43,279
the tape. Someone is absorbing it
 

1199
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,870
the tape. Someone is absorbing it
because CBD is breaking down and the

1200
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:44,880
because CBD is breaking down and the
 

1201
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,630
because CBD is breaking down and the
market isn't. So, you've got very

1202
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:46,640
market isn't. So, you've got very
 

1203
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,149
market isn't. So, you've got very
aggressive selling here and someone

1204
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:48,159
aggressive selling here and someone
 

1205
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,230
aggressive selling here and someone
trying to absorb the tape. So, until

1206
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,240
trying to absorb the tape. So, until
 

1207
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,750
trying to absorb the tape. So, until
this guy who's absorbing the tape gets

1208
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:51,760
this guy who's absorbing the tape gets
 

1209
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,590
this guy who's absorbing the tape gets
out of the way, well, if if and when he

1210
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:53,600
out of the way, well, if if and when he
 

1211
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,789
out of the way, well, if if and when he
gets out the way, you might get a big

1212
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:54,799
gets out the way, you might get a big
 

1213
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,029
gets out the way, you might get a big
sell. But if he doesn't, you're going to

1214
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:57,039
sell. But if he doesn't, you're going to
 

1215
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,269
sell. But if he doesn't, you're going to
get divergence with CVD where we can

1216
00:30:59,269 --> 00:30:59,279
get divergence with CVD where we can
 

1217
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,630
get divergence with CVD where we can
potentially squeeze higher. And that's

1218
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:00,640
potentially squeeze higher. And that's
 

1219
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,310
potentially squeeze higher. And that's
what I'm aware of right now. But we have

1220
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,320
what I'm aware of right now. But we have
 

1221
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,909
what I'm aware of right now. But we have
buyers stepping in here again, being

1222
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:03,919
buyers stepping in here again, being
 

1223
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,870
buyers stepping in here again, being
aggressive, trying to protect the 47s.

1224
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:06,880
aggressive, trying to protect the 47s.
 

1225
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,269
aggressive, trying to protect the 47s.
If we start breaking under 47s and under

1226
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:09,279
If we start breaking under 47s and under
 

1227
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,870
If we start breaking under 47s and under
VWAP, there's probably going to be a

1228
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:10,880
VWAP, there's probably going to be a
 

1229
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,909
VWAP, there's probably going to be a
sell and we can watch under previous day

1230
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:13,919
sell and we can watch under previous day
 

1231
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,070
sell and we can watch under previous day
value high for this rotation for gap

1232
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,080
value high for this rotation for gap
 

1233
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,070
value high for this rotation for gap
fill, I guess. Right. So, here they go.

1234
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,080
fill, I guess. Right. So, here they go.
 

1235
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,830
fill, I guess. Right. So, here they go.
So the sellers coming in here aggressive

1236
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:19,840
So the sellers coming in here aggressive
 

1237

00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:28,240
waiting to see if we get back inside
 

1243
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,950
waiting to see if we get back inside
yesterday's range. Don't really want to

1244
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:30,960
yesterday's range. Don't really want to
 

1245
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,870
yesterday's range. Don't really want to
sell in front of that. So the sell for

1246
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:32,880
sell in front of that. So the sell for
 

1247
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,389
sell in front of that. So the sell for
me, if we're really going to take the

1249
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,470
me, if we're really going to take the
range, which is very dangerous, would

1250
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:36,480
range, which is very dangerous, would
 

1251
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,789
range, which is very dangerous, would
have to be like this. Partials into

1252
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:38,799

1253
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,350

this move up here. I'm more keen on
 

1259
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,509
this move up here. I'm more keen on
taking it when we let these buys out.

1260
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:47,519
taking it when we let these buys out.
 

1261
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,509
taking it when we let these buys out.

much he can absorb is
 

1273
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,710
much he can absorb is
only he knows how much size he's got

1274

only he knows how much size he's got
 

1275

previous day valuary high. We can look
 

1283
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,789
previous day valuary high. We can look

back up and reject now. Now that we've

1296
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:26,640
back up and reject now. Now that we've
 

1297
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,590

traded inside it,

1298
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:29,600
traded inside it,
 

1299
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,470
traded inside it,
got to come up for me. Cannot chase this

1300
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:32,480
got to come up for me. Cannot chase this
 

1301
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,630
got to come up for me. Cannot chase this
down here.

1302
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:34,640
down here.
 

1303
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,110
down here.
Right, watching to see if we come back

1304
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,120
Right, watching to see if we come back
 

1305

Right, watching to see if we come back

1306
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:39,519
up. Be very very careful. ES now at
 

1307
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,750
up. Be very very careful. ES now at
VWAP. So, waiting to see if we come up

1308
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:41,760
VWAP. So, waiting to see if we come up
 

1309
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,070
VWAP. So, waiting to see if we come up
and offer a rejection. Anywhere up to

1310
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,080
and offer a rejection. Anywhere up to
 

1311
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,269
and offer a rejection. Anywhere up to
46es, anywhere from 28s to 46es. I would

1312
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:47,279
46es, anywhere from 28s to 46es. I would
 

1313
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,110
46es, anywhere from 28s to 46es. I would
be interested in the short if we trap

1314
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,120
be interested in the short if we trap
 

1315
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,029
be interested in the short if we trap
buyers and reject it. If we reclaim it,

1316
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:51,039
buyers and reject it. If we reclaim it,
 

1317
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,950
buyers and reject it. If we reclaim it,
this would be a look below and fail,

1318
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:52,960
this would be a look below and fail,
 

1319
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,870
this would be a look below and fail,
especially if we fill the gap and hit

1320
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:54,880
especially if we fill the gap and hit
 

1321
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,029
especially if we fill the gap and hit
280s already.

1322
00:32:57,029 --> 00:32:57,039
280s already.
 

1323
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,549
280s already.
So, you have to be willing to play both

1324
00:32:58,549 --> 00:32:58,559
So, you have to be willing to play both
 

1325
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,549
So, you have to be willing to play both
sides right now. So, we are watching for

1326
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:00,559
sides right now. So, we are watching for
 

1327
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,269
sides right now. So, we are watching for
something like this down to here or this

1328
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:03,279
something like this down to here or this
 

1329
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,750
something like this down to here or this
down to here. All right, we need to see

1330
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:05,760
down to here. All right, we need to see
 

1331
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,350
down to here. All right, we need to see
that pop down to there. If we reclaim

1332
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:07,360
that pop down to there. If we reclaim
 

1333
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,029
that pop down to there. If we reclaim
this, I will not play short because it

1334
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:09,039
this, I will not play short because it
 

1335
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,149
this, I will not play short because it
means this will be a look below.

1336
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:10,159
means this will be a look below.
 

1337
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,630
means this will be a look below.
Especially if we do this first means we

1338
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:12,640
Especially if we do this first means we
 

1339
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,149
Especially if we do this first means we
will be efficient and then reclaim and

1340
00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:14,159
will be efficient and then reclaim and
 

1341
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,990
will be efficient and then reclaim and
go. So waiting to see if this drive up

1342
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,000
go. So waiting to see if this drive up
 

1343
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,630
go. So waiting to see if this drive up
is resold into or not.

1344
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:20,640

 

1345
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,389

Needs to come up a bit higher there.

1346
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:22,399
Needs to come up a bit higher there.
 

1347
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,470
Needs to come up a bit higher there.
We've definitely caught shorts at 310s.

1348
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:24,480
We've definitely caught shorts at 310s.

Previous day point of control. And if we

Previous day point of control. And if we
 

1377
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,990
Previous day point of control. And if we
lose this, your next cover is 33s.

1387
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,030

But you can look for covers into here.

1388
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,040
But you can look for covers into here.
 

1389
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,030
But you can look for covers into here.
All right, 30s and then all the way down

1390
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,040
All right, 30s and then all the way down
 

1391
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,790
All right, 30s and then all the way down
here. If we're going to rotate the whole

1392
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:16,800
here. If we're going to rotate the whole
 

1393
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,190
here. If we're going to rotate the whole
of yesterday's value, all right, then

1394
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,200
of yesterday's value, all right, then
 

1395
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,470
of yesterday's value, all right, then
that's what we're going to do. You need

1396
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:20,480
that's what we're going to do. You need
 

1397
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,790
that's what we're going to do. You need
to be paying yourself some now already.

1398
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:22,800
to be paying yourself some now already.
 

1399
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,909
to be paying yourself some now already.
All right, because you're at previous

1400
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:23,919
All right, because you're at previous
 

1401
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:25,909
All right, because you're at previous
day open, you're at previous day point

1402
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:25,919
day open, you're at previous day point
 

1403
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:27,190
day open, you're at previous day point
control, you're under previous day

1404
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,200
control, you're under previous day
 

1405
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:36,710
control, you're under previous day
close.

1406
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:36,720

 

1407
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,669

Okay, here's the rip back up back into

1408
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:39,679
Okay, here's the rip back up back into
 

1409
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,510
Okay, here's the rip back up back into
the orb. We have a shelf here at tens.

1410
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:41,520
the orb. We have a shelf here at tens.
 

1411
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,190
the orb. We have a shelf here at tens.
So sellers need to reject tens if we're

1412
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,200
So sellers need to reject tens if we're
 

1413
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,909
So sellers need to reject tens if we're
going to get follow through. Tens to

1414
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:45,919
going to get follow through. Tens to
 

1415
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,310
going to get follow through. Tens to
18s. Basically tens to 18s need to be

1416
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:48,320
18s. Basically tens to 18s need to be
 

1417
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,389
18s. Basically tens to 18s need to be
rejected. Basically this this gray box,

rejected. Basically this this gray box,
 

1419
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,909
rejected. Basically this this gray box,
it's this node above it though. It's

1420
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:51,919
it's this node above it though. It's
 

1421
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:53,990
it's this node above it though. It's
right here. This needs to be rejected if

right here. This needs to be rejected if
 

1423
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,910

sellers are going to get follow through.

1424
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:57,920
sellers are going to get follow through.

next cover point here into sort of 30s,
 

1503
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,630
next cover point here into sort of 30s,
please. Why into 30s? That is your value

1504
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:28,640
please. Why into 30s? That is your value
 

1505
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,470

area low on the developing week since

1506
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:30,480
area low on the developing week since
 

1507
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,150
area low on the developing week since
the Sunday open. Once you get under

1508
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:32,160
the Sunday open. Once you get under
 

1509
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,790
the Sunday open. Once you get under
that, you can look for this move into

1510
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:34,800
that, you can look for this move into
 

1511
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,829
that, you can look for this move into
141s. I would say even down into the

1512
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:37,839
141s. I would say even down into the
 

1513
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,230
141s. I would say even down into the
110s again, right? Yesterday. So this

1514
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:40,240
110s again, right? Yesterday. So this
 

1515
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,589
110s again, right? Yesterday. So this
move here to 110s again. 110s. This gray

1516
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:43,599
move here to 110s again. 110s. This gray
 

1517
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,030
move here to 110s again. 110s. This gray
box. Same same trade as yesterday,

1518
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,040
box. Same same trade as yesterday,
 

1519
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,589
box. Same same trade as yesterday,
right? So partial here. And if you get

1520
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:47,599
right? So partial here. And if you get
 

1521
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,109
right? So partial here. And if you get
follow through, we're looking for here.

1522
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:49,119
follow through, we're looking for here.
 

1523
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,829
follow through, we're looking for here.
And then we can see if today they really

1524
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:51,839
And then we can see if today they really
 

1525
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,349
And then we can see if today they really
want to let go and get down to that

1526
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:53,359
want to let go and get down to that
 

1527
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,670
want to let go and get down to that
previous weak point of control. The fact

1528
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:55,680
previous weak point of control. The fact
 

1529
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,950
previous weak point of control. The fact
that we still haven't taken out this

1530
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:56,960
that we still haven't taken out this
 

1531
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,550
that we still haven't taken out this
block here, though makes it a little bit

1532
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:58,560
block here, though makes it a little bit
 

1533
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,630
block here, though makes it a little bit
tricky cuz we haven't run all the stops

1534
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:00,640
tricky cuz we haven't run all the stops
 

1535
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,470
tricky cuz we haven't run all the stops
yet.

1536
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:02,480
yet.
 

1537
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,069
yet.
So, this is the trade I'm still looking

1538
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:04,079

1665
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,910
Tens would be better if we can lift in
towards 10 somewhere up here. We need to

towards 10 somewhere up here. We need to
 

1667
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,270
towards 10 somewhere up here. We need to
be very careful if we're going to hold

00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:01,280
be very careful if we're going to hold

to get short at the moment. That's a

1672
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:05,119
to get short at the moment. That's a
 

1673
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:10,230
to get short at the moment. That's a
good rejection of 90s.

1674
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:10,240

 

1675
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,550

Buyer just got caught at 70 there on

1676
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:12,560
Buyer just got caught at 70 there on
 

1677
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,310
Buyer just got caught at 70 there on
that last lift. Definite buyer got

1678
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:14,320
that last lift. Definite buyer got
 

1679
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,829
that last lift. Definite buyer got
caught at 70. So, we're watching him

1680
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:15,839
caught at 70. So, we're watching him
 

1681
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,230
caught at 70. So, we're watching him
right now.

1683
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,470

See, right here, buyer just got caught

1684
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:22,480
See, right here, buyer just got caught
 

1685
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,390
See, right here, buyer just got caught
here at 70. So, if we're over that, he

1686
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:24,400
here at 70. So, if we're over that, he
 

1687
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,670
here at 70. So, if we're over that, he
becomes comfortable and they can squeeze

1688
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:25,680
becomes comfortable and they can squeeze
 

1689
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,750
becomes comfortable and they can squeeze
up to 10. If he keeps getting stuck

1690
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:27,760
up to 10. If he keeps getting stuck
 

1691
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,750
up to 10. If he keeps getting stuck
here, we've got a chance to move lower.

1692
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:29,760
here, we've got a chance to move lower.
 

1693
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:43,109
here, we've got a chance to move lower.
So, I'm watching this level.

1694
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:43,119

 

1695
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,430

It's going to trap the sellers. I mean,

1696
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:45,440
It's going to trap the sellers. I mean,
 

1697
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,349
It's going to trap the sellers. I mean,
it's a very heavy take at the moment. I

1698
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:47,359
it's a very heavy take at the moment. I
 

1699
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,349
it's a very heavy take at the moment. I
don't think so, but we It's possible.

1700
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:49,359
don't think so, but we It's possible.
 

1701
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,710
don't think so, but we It's possible.
I'm just looking for a bigger retest

1702
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:50,720
I'm just looking for a bigger retest
 

1703
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,190
I'm just looking for a bigger retest
before we go lower. We start breaking

1704
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:53,200
before we go lower. We start breaking
 

1705
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,550
before we go lower. We start breaking
down here, I'm going to be forced to put

1706
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:54,560
down here, I'm going to be forced to put
 

1707
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,870
down here, I'm going to be forced to put
some on, which is not what I want to do.

1708
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:56,880
some on, which is not what I want to do.
 

1709
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:05,109
some on, which is not what I want to do.
Maybe under this, I can add heavier.

1710
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:05,119

 

1711
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,750

Still at 70s and it's lifted to 80s now.

1712
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:07,760
Still at 70s and it's lifted to 80s now.
 

1713
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,790
Still at 70s and it's lifted to 80s now.
Here they go. They're going to look for

1714
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:08,800
Here they go. They're going to look for
 

1715
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,069
Here they go. They're going to look for
the squeeze back up now. So, maybe we're

1716
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:12,079
the squeeze back up now. So, maybe we're
 

1717
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,510
the squeeze back up now. So, maybe we're
going to get the 10 test.

1718
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:15,520
going to get the 10 test.
 

1719
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,109
going to get the 10 test.
Maybe we can get this 10 test. We want

1720
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:17,119
Maybe we can get this 10 test. We want
 

1721
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,190
Maybe we can get this 10 test. We want
to be careful if it reclaims this level

1722
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:19,200
to be careful if it reclaims this level
 

1723
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,470
to be careful if it reclaims this level
here. We're going to go squeeze straight

1724
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:20,480
here. We're going to go squeeze straight
 

1725
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,950
here. We're going to go squeeze straight
the way back up. Right.

1726
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:22,960
the way back up. Right.
 

1727
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,069
the way back up. Right.
So 90s again.

1728
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:26,079
So 90s again.
 

1729
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,950
So 90s again.
ES back to to VWAP. So it just poked

1730
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:28,960
ES back to to VWAP. So it just poked
 

1731
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,109
ES back to to VWAP. So it just poked
back to VWAP and got sold into there.

1732
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:31,119
back to VWAP and got sold into there.
 

1733
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,470

See how they act back there if they

1734
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:32,480
See how they act back there if they
 

1735
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,630
See how they act back there if they
reclaim. Very washy here. A bit like

1736
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:34,640
reclaim. Very washy here. A bit like
 

1737
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,990
reclaim. Very washy here. A bit like
yesterday, right? We're just still in a

1738
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,000
yesterday, right? We're just still in a
 

1739
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,510
yesterday, right? We're just still in a
range. Need to be very careful. This is

1740
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:37,520
range. Need to be very careful. This is
 

1741
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,270
range. Need to be very careful. This is
the value area low on the developing

1742
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:39,280
the value area low on the developing
 

1743
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,870
the value area low on the developing
week. So we need to be careful here.

1744
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:40,880
week. So we need to be careful here.
 

1745
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,870
week. So we need to be careful here.
Looking for a retest for them to trap

1746
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:42,880
Looking for a retest for them to trap
 

1747
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,030
Looking for a retest for them to trap
buyers that we can sell into. If they

1748
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,040
buyers that we can sell into. If they
 

1749
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,790
buyers that we can sell into. If they
don't trap buyers, this thing will just

1750
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:46,800
don't trap buyers, this thing will just
 

1751
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,390
don't trap buyers, this thing will just
squeeze all the way back up and there's

1752
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:48,400
squeeze all the way back up and there's
 

1753
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,150
squeeze all the way back up and there's
nothing we can do. This is nice into

1754
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,160
nothing we can do. This is nice into
 

1755
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,910
nothing we can do. This is nice into
90s.

1756
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:51,920
90s.
 

1757
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,910

00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:55,440
for sure, but it's still stacking
 

1761
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,589
for sure, but it's still stacking
sellers above all the way to 300. So,

1762
00:41:57,589 --> 00:41:57,599
sellers above all the way to 300. So,
 

1763
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,349
sellers above all the way to 300. So,
still waiting here to see if I can see

1787
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,470
like that tape. Wait for the retest of
90s again and we'll see. Maybe they fade

1788
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:28,480
90s again and we'll see. Maybe they fade
 

1789
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,150
90s again and we'll see. Maybe they fade
this again. Maybe they go to two to

1790
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,160
this again. Maybe they go to two to
 

1791
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,390
this again. Maybe they go to two to
310s.

1792

was uncomfortable at 70s. He got back
 

1797
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,550
was uncomfortable at 70s. He got back
above it. I will consider trying again

1798
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:38,560
above it. I will consider trying again
 

1799
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,349
above it. I will consider trying again
here. The same move.

1800

under 64 will be a very good close.

1810
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:52,800
under 64 will be a very good close.
 

1811

need to be very careful about if we're
 

1815
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,750
need to be very careful about if we're

stay heavy though. Second attempt here.

1836
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:27,280

210. So any break over 220s or

1988
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:30,240
210. So any break over 220s or
 

1989
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,990
210. So any break over 220s or
definitely over 230s, I will cut this

1990
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:32,000
definitely over 230s, I will cut this
 

1991
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,870
definitely over 230s, I will cut this
now. Now that I've seen that,

1992
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:34,880
now. Now that I've seen that,
 

1993
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,550
now. Now that I've seen that,
do not want these big sellers caught the

1994
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:36,560
do not want these big sellers caught the
 

1995
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,790
do not want these big sellers caught the
lows. So still a chance to break lower,

1996
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:38,800
lows. So still a chance to break lower,
 

1997
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,030
lows. So still a chance to break lower,
but if we break over 220s, I'll cut. Get

1998
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:41,040
but if we break over 220s, I'll cut. Get
 

1999
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,870

short if it rejects 222s, but I just
 

2133
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,270
short if it rejects 222s, but I just
didn't want to give too much back. So,

2134
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:23,280
didn't want to give too much back. So,
 

2135
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,670
didn't want to give too much back. So,
here's into the 222s. If they reclaim

2136
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:25,680
here's into the 222s. If they reclaim
 

2137
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,910
here's into the 222s. If they reclaim
222s, they can go straight up to 64.

2138
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:27,920
222s, they can go straight up to 64.
 

2139
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,030
222s, they can go straight up to 64.
This is what I did not want to get

2140
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:29,040
This is what I did not want to get
 

2141
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,109
This is what I did not want to get
caught in is why I'm being careful.

2142
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:31,119
caught in is why I'm being careful.
 

2143
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,549
caught in is why I'm being careful.
Great trade, guys. All right, I'm going

2144
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:32,559
Great trade, guys. All right, I'm going
 

2145
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,510
Great trade, guys. All right, I'm going
to have like a two-minute break here.

2146
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:35,520
to have like a two-minute break here.
 

2147
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,630
to have like a two-minute break here.
Mentally, I mean a two-minut break here.

2148
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:38,640
Mentally, I mean a two-minut break here.
 

2149
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,230
Mentally, I mean a two-minut break here.
Mentally, just let this do what it

2150
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:40,240
Mentally, just let this do what it
 

2151
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,950
Mentally, just let this do what it
wants. After news, we are coming.

2152
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:42,960
wants. After news, we are coming.
 

2153
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,390
wants. After news, we are coming.
Nothing's changed. I want you to

2154
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:44,400
Nothing's changed. I want you to
 

2155
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,990
Nothing's changed. I want you to
understand one thing.

2156
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:46,000
understand one thing.
 

2157
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,230
understand one thing.
Current week's value is here. Current

2158
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:48,240
Current week's value is here. Current
 

2159
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,990
Current week's value is here. Current
previous days value is here that we

2160
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:50,000
previous days value is here that we
 

2161
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,510
previous days value is here that we
talked about. Current day's value is

2162
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:51,520
talked about. Current day's value is
 

2163
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,670
talked about. Current day's value is
here. All right.

2164
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:53,680
here. All right.
 

2165
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,069
here. All right.
All we're doing is ranging between this

2166
00:49:56,069 --> 00:49:56,079
All we're doing is ranging between this
 

2167
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,630
All we're doing is ranging between this
and this. I just didn't want to buy up

2168
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:58,640
and this. I just didn't want to buy up
 

2169
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,630
and this. I just didn't want to buy up
here. All right. And I didn't really

2170
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:00,640
here. All right. And I didn't really
 

2171
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,069
here. All right. And I didn't really
want to sell like yesterday. Unless we

2172
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:02,079
want to sell like yesterday. Unless we
 

2173
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,910
want to sell like yesterday. Unless we
clear that out would be the idea. But

2174
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:03,920
clear that out would be the idea. But
 

2175
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,910
clear that out would be the idea. But
once we trap enough, all right, you can

2176
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:05,920
once we trap enough, all right, you can
 

2177
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,829
once we trap enough, all right, you can
see this flush. I'm looking for a retest

2178
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:07,839
see this flush. I'm looking for a retest
 

2179
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,349
see this flush. I'm looking for a retest
to get short. It just didn't quite fill

2180
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:09,359
to get short. It just didn't quite fill
 

2181
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,190
to get short. It just didn't quite fill
me up here when I'm waiting. So, we had

2182
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:11,200
me up here when I'm waiting. So, we had
 

2183
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,109
me up here when I'm waiting. So, we had
to play this one here. All right. So if

2184
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:13,119
to play this one here. All right. So if
 

2185
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,510
to play this one here. All right. So if
we think about structurally bare flag

2186
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:15,520
we think about structurally bare flag
 

2187
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,230
we think about structurally bare flag
breakdown, bare flag breakdown, and we

2188
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:18,240
breakdown, bare flag breakdown, and we
 

2189
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,390
breakdown, bare flag breakdown, and we
use a buyer who's trapped for their

2190
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:20,400
use a buyer who's trapped for their
 

2191
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,470
use a buyer who's trapped for their
pain. All right, so there's the lift

2192
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:22,480
pain. All right, so there's the lift
 

2193
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,230
pain. All right, so there's the lift
back up. So hopefully you guys should be

2194
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:24,240
back up. So hopefully you guys should be
 

2195
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,829
back up. So hopefully you guys should be
pretty much out of this, and you could

2196
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:25,839
pretty much out of this, and you could
 

2197
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,670
pretty much out of this, and you could
think about a reshort here into 64s, but

2198
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:27,680
think about a reshort here into 64s, but
 

2199
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,510
think about a reshort here into 64s, but
obviously the news has just come out. We

2200
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:29,520
obviously the news has just come out. We
 

2201
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,309
obviously the news has just come out. We
now have lots of sellers caught at 200

2202
00:50:32,309 --> 00:50:32,319
now have lots of sellers caught at 200
 

2203
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,150
now have lots of sellers caught at 200
and 187. So remember, we said these

2204
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:34,160
and 187. So remember, we said these
 

2205
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,589
and 187. So remember, we said these
selling at the low. Look at these big

2206
00:50:35,589 --> 00:50:35,599
selling at the low. Look at these big
 

2207
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,510
selling at the low. Look at these big
blocks down here. You can see them here,

2208
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:37,520
blocks down here. You can see them here,
 

2209
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,950
blocks down here. You can see them here,
200, 187. You can even argue at 210. All

2210
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:40,960
200, 187. You can even argue at 210. All
 

2211
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,190
200, 187. You can even argue at 210. All
right. So, back probably towards value

2212
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:43,200
right. So, back probably towards value
 

2213
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,030
right. So, back probably towards value
area low here, 260 and then make a

2214
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:45,040
area low here, 260 and then make a
 

2215
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,390
area low here, 260 and then make a
decision. So, just let this do what it

2216
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:46,400
decision. So, just let this do what it
 

2217
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,710
decision. So, just let this do what it
wants a bit because we are in a range,

2218
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:48,720
wants a bit because we are in a range,
 

2219
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,230
wants a bit because we are in a range,
right? If we trap enough sellers at the

2220
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:50,240
right? If we trap enough sellers at the
 

2221
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,150
right? If we trap enough sellers at the
lows and we take low hanging fruit out

2222
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:52,160
lows and we take low hanging fruit out
 

2223
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,349
lows and we take low hanging fruit out
of the lows, we can always think about

2224
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:53,359
of the lows, we can always think about
 

2225
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:57,430
of the lows, we can always think about
the long back up.

2226
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:57,440

 

2227
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,670

Rob Miller, great job, Alex. Another

2228
00:50:59,670 --> 00:50:59,680
Rob Miller, great job, Alex. Another
 

2229
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,950
Rob Miller, great job, Alex. Another
payout for me. Nice.

2230
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:02,960
payout for me. Nice.
 

2231
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,230
payout for me. Nice.
Nice.

2232
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:08,240

 

2233
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,990

Can I go long now? Um,

2234
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:12,000
Can I go long now? Um,
 

2235
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,710
Can I go long now? Um,
it's a good question. I would say you're

2236
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:14,720
it's a good question. I would say you're
 

2237
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,630
it's a good question. I would say you're
fishing, right? If you hold 210,

2238
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:18,640
fishing, right? If you hold 210,
 

2239
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,990
fishing, right? If you hold 210,
you could argue there's this move back

2240
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:20,000
you could argue there's this move back
 

2241
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,150
you could argue there's this move back
up. The one thing I'd say is this is a

2242
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:22,160
up. The one thing I'd say is this is a
 

2243
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,390
up. The one thing I'd say is this is a
lowhanging fruit down here. All right,

2244
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:24,400
lowhanging fruit down here. All right,
 

2245
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,790
lowhanging fruit down here. All right,
this here is previous week close and

2246
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:26,800
this here is previous week close and
 

2247
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,630
this here is previous week close and
this here is previous day's value area

2248
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:28,640
this here is previous day's value area
 

2249
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,589
this here is previous day's value area
low. We haven't taken it out, but uh

2250
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:31,599
low. We haven't taken it out, but uh
 

2251
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,230
low. We haven't taken it out, but uh
it's possible, but currently the trend

2252
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:34,240
it's possible, but currently the trend
 

2253
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,069
it's possible, but currently the trend
is this, right? So we kind of you would

2254
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:36,079
is this, right? So we kind of you would
 

2255
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,309
is this, right? So we kind of you would
kind of need a fail to break lower and

2256
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:38,319
kind of need a fail to break lower and
 

2257
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,030
kind of need a fail to break lower and
then a reclaim to get long. Otherwise,

2258
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:41,040
then a reclaim to get long. Otherwise,
 

2259
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,630
then a reclaim to get long. Otherwise,
this can still happen. Remember this

2260
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:42,640
this can still happen. Remember this
 

2261
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,390
this can still happen. Remember this
build liquidity. This can be a liquidity

2262
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:44,400
build liquidity. This can be a liquidity
 

2263
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,910
build liquidity. This can be a liquidity
build to come back down to here. It can

2264
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:45,920
build to come back down to here. It can
 

2265
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,710
build to come back down to here. It can
still do it. So I don't love the longs

2266
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:48,720
still do it. So I don't love the longs
 

2267
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,990
still do it. So I don't love the longs
at the moment. This is a bit like what

2268
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:50,000
at the moment. This is a bit like what
 

2269
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,069
at the moment. This is a bit like what
we had up here, right? Once the sellers

2270
00:51:52,069 --> 00:51:52,079
we had up here, right? Once the sellers
 

2271
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,230
we had up here, right? Once the sellers
got caught, right, we've moved away from

2272
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:54,240
got caught, right, we've moved away from
 

2273
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,990
got caught, right, we've moved away from
them. Once the buyers got caught, we

2274
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:56,000
them. Once the buyers got caught, we
 

2275
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,270
them. Once the buyers got caught, we
moved away from them. We've not come

2276
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:57,280
moved away from them. We've not come
 

2277
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,430
moved away from them. We've not come
down and retest and held. We didn't come

2278
00:51:59,430 --> 00:51:59,440
down and retest and held. We didn't come
 

2279
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,829
down and retest and held. We didn't come
up and retest and hold. All right? So

2280
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:01,839
up and retest and hold. All right? So
 

2281
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:05,030
up and retest and hold. All right? So
it's tough. uh unless you love if you

2282
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,040
it's tough. uh unless you love if you
 

2283
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,589
it's tough. uh unless you love if you
like trading breakout inside ranges. I

2284
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:07,599
like trading breakout inside ranges. I
 

2285
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,990
like trading breakout inside ranges. I
mean

2286
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:10,000
mean
 

2287
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,510
mean
it would it's never something I would

2288
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:11,520
it would it's never something I would
 

2289
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,710
it would it's never something I would
ever do inside a range. But um if that's

2290
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:14,720
ever do inside a range. But um if that's
 

2291
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,390
ever do inside a range. But um if that's
your strategy then you could argue

2292
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:16,400
your strategy then you could argue
 

2293
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,910
your strategy then you could argue
there's uh positions for you.

2294
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:19,920
there's uh positions for you.
 

2295
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,549
there's uh positions for you.
Okay. So if you're looking long you need

2296
00:52:22,549 --> 00:52:22,559
Okay. So if you're looking long you need
 

2297
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,630
Okay. So if you're looking long you need
a hold of 220 and 200s. All right. And

2298
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:26,640
a hold of 220 and 200s. All right. And
 

2299
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,390
a hold of 220 and 200s. All right. And
you would be looking for a relief. You

2300
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:28,400
you would be looking for a relief. You
 

2301
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,950
you would be looking for a relief. You
haven't got much room here to 260s and

2302
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:30,960
haven't got much room here to 260s and
 

2303
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,109
haven't got much room here to 260s and
280s. I personally would not be looking

2304
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:33,119
280s. I personally would not be looking
 

2305
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,790
280s. I personally would not be looking
long here. I think we can still move

2306
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:34,800
long here. I think we can still move
 

2307
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,589
long here. I think we can still move
lower first into this personally, but it

2308
00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:37,599
lower first into this personally, but it
 

2309
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,349
lower first into this personally, but it
is up to you. Like I say, it's up to you

2310
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:39,359
is up to you. Like I say, it's up to you
 

2311
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,710
is up to you. Like I say, it's up to you
to manage your risk.

2312
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:42,720
to manage your risk.
 

2313
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,230
to manage your risk.
The short air was better. Yeah, I would

2314
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:44,240
The short air was better. Yeah, I would
 

2315
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,750
The short air was better. Yeah, I would
say look at the node, right? Think about

2316
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:45,760
say look at the node, right? Think about
 

2317
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,750
say look at the node, right? Think about
the node.

2318
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:47,760
the node.
 

2319
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,510
the node.
Where did we just reject? Where those

2320
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:49,520
Where did we just reject? Where those
 

2321
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,870
Where did we just reject? Where those
buyers got caught? All right, so the

2322
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:50,880
buyers got caught? All right, so the
 

2323
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,069
buyers got caught? All right, so the
short here is better. And you'd be

2324
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:52,079
short here is better. And you'd be
 

2325
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,549
short here is better. And you'd be
covering some into 220 and 200, wouldn't

2326
00:52:54,549 --> 00:52:54,559
covering some into 220 and 200, wouldn't
 

2327
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,150
covering some into 220 and 200, wouldn't
you? So, if you just took this short up

2328
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:56,160
you? So, if you just took this short up
 

2329
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,510
you? So, if you just took this short up
here where the buyers just got caught in

2330
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:57,520
here where the buyers just got caught in
 

2331
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,270
here where the buyers just got caught in
this node, you can see buyers got caught

2332
00:52:59,270 --> 00:52:59,280
this node, you can see buyers got caught
 

2333
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,910
this node, you can see buyers got caught
topside. I'd be covering some into here

2334
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:01,920
topside. I'd be covering some into here
 

2335
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,950
topside. I'd be covering some into here
now 200 and 186. And if we break down

2336
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:04,960
now 200 and 186. And if we break down
 

2337
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,030
now 200 and 186. And if we break down
lower, you're still looking for 145. So

2338
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:07,040
lower, you're still looking for 145. So
 

2339
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,710
lower, you're still looking for 145. So
this level here is massive. This 200

2340
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:08,720
this level here is massive. This 200
 

2341
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,390
this level here is massive. This 200
level is massive. You can see they're

2342
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:10,400
level is massive. You can see they're
 

2343
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,549
level is massive. You can see they're
covering into that 200. Exactly what I

2344
00:53:12,549 --> 00:53:12,559
covering into that 200. Exactly what I
 

2345
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,349
covering into that 200. Exactly what I
would be doing.

2346
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:15,359
would be doing.
 

2347
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,510
would be doing.
All right. So you won't see this unless

2348
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:17,520
All right. So you won't see this unless
 

2349
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,270
All right. So you won't see this unless
you are using orderflow. All right. So

2350
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:19,280
you are using orderflow. All right. So
 

2351
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,750
you are using orderflow. All right. So
I'm the reason I'm specific with my

2352
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:21,760
I'm the reason I'm specific with my
 

2353
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,150
I'm the reason I'm specific with my
levels is it's it's not a guess based on

2354
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:24,160
levels is it's it's not a guess based on
 

2355
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,630
levels is it's it's not a guess based on
a candle. It's an actual level where we

2356
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:26,640
a candle. It's an actual level where we
 

2357
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,230
a candle. It's an actual level where we
have people caught. All right? Where we

2358
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:28,240
have people caught. All right? Where we
 

2359
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,510
have people caught. All right? Where we
have people caught. You don't have to

2360
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:29,520
have people caught. You don't have to
 

2361
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,270
have people caught. You don't have to
use footprint. You can use bookmap. You

2362
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:31,280
use footprint. You can use bookmap. You
 

2363
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,549
use footprint. You can use bookmap. You
can use whatever you want. You can just

2364
00:53:32,549 --> 00:53:32,559
can use whatever you want. You can just
 

2365
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,309
can use whatever you want. You can just
use the tape and if you can read uh

2366
00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:36,319
use the tape and if you can read uh
 

2367
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,470
use the tape and if you can read uh
this right here. All right. You will see

2368
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:38,480
this right here. All right. You will see
 

2369
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,510
this right here. All right. You will see
that if we came up to or down to I

2370
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:41,520
that if we came up to or down to I
 

2371
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,510
that if we came up to or down to I
should say down to 200s. Right. You see

2372
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:43,520
should say down to 200s. Right. You see
 

2373
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,430
should say down to 200s. Right. You see
this guy here.

2374
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:45,440
this guy here.
 

2375
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,950
this guy here.
If it will just stop jumping around. We

2376
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:46,960
If it will just stop jumping around. We
 

2377
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,309
If it will just stop jumping around. We
have a 231 lot seller caught at 200. And

2378
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:50,319
have a 231 lot seller caught at 200. And
 

2379
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:55,750
have a 231 lot seller caught at 200. And
if we come up a little bit,

2380
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:55,760

 

2381
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,470

we're jumping around. Sorry.

2382
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:58,480
we're jumping around. Sorry.
 

2383
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,230
we're jumping around. Sorry.
Two. We're jumping so much. I can't move

2384
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:00,240
Two. We're jumping so much. I can't move
 

2385
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,630
Two. We're jumping so much. I can't move
it fast enough.

2386
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:04,640

 

2387
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,270

There. There. 210. All right. 210 as

2388
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:07,280
There. There. 210. All right. 210 as
 

2389
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,710
There. There. 210. All right. 210 as
well. All right. So, there's lots of

2390
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:08,720
well. All right. So, there's lots of
 

2391
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,109
well. All right. So, there's lots of
ways to see it. Find a way that works

2392
00:54:11,109 --> 00:54:11,119
ways to see it. Find a way that works
 

2393
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,710
ways to see it. Find a way that works
for you. I have all three up. In case I

2394
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:12,720
for you. I have all three up. In case I
 

2395
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,870
for you. I have all three up. In case I
miss one, right? So, it's like in case I

2396
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:14,880
miss one, right? So, it's like in case I
 

2397
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,230
miss one, right? So, it's like in case I
don't see it on one, I probably see it

2398
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:16,240
don't see it on one, I probably see it
 

2399
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,390
don't see it on one, I probably see it
on another.

2400
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:18,400
on another.
 

2401
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,990
on another.
What's the other chart I pull up? Ninja

2402
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:20,000
What's the other chart I pull up? Ninja
 

2403
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,309
What's the other chart I pull up? Ninja
Trader. Ninja Trader. Um, I use

2404
00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:22,319
Trader. Ninja Trader. Um, I use
 

2405
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:23,910
Trader. Ninja Trader. Um, I use
something called Twin Peaks. It's just

2406
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:23,920
something called Twin Peaks. It's just
 

2407
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,750
something called Twin Peaks. It's just
an orderflow tool. It's just footprint.

2408
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:25,760
an orderflow tool. It's just footprint.
 

2409
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,990
an orderflow tool. It's just footprint.
It's all it is with delta down the side.

2410
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:28,000
It's all it is with delta down the side.
 

2411
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,030
It's all it is with delta down the side.
So I have delta on the vertical axis. So

2412
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:31,040
So I have delta on the vertical axis. So
 

2413
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,670
So I have delta on the vertical axis. So
right here I have delta. Okay. So they

2414
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:33,680
right here I have delta. Okay. So they
 

2415
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,670
right here I have delta. Okay. So they
held look what they just held 200s,

2416
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:35,680
held look what they just held 200s,
 

2417
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,069
held look what they just held 200s,
right? They held 200s, right? So we're

2418
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:38,079
right? They held 200s, right? So we're
 

2419
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,470
right? They held 200s, right? So we're
coming back up to value area low on the

2420
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:40,480
coming back up to value area low on the
 

2421
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,470
coming back up to value area low on the
day. We have a node here. If we move

2422
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:42,480
day. We have a node here. If we move
 

2423
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,309
day. We have a node here. If we move
this up, right? We have a node here,

2424
00:54:46,309 --> 00:54:46,319
this up, right? We have a node here,
 

2425
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,630
this up, right? We have a node here,
don't we? So we just held this node

2426
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:48,640
don't we? So we just held this node
 

2427
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,390
don't we? So we just held this node
here. In this node here, like we just

2428
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:50,400
here. In this node here, like we just
 

2429
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,150
here. In this node here, like we just
showed you, there are shorts trapped.

2430
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:52,160
showed you, there are shorts trapped.
 

2431
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,349
showed you, there are shorts trapped.
All right? So buyers have tried to

2432
00:54:53,349 --> 00:54:53,359
All right? So buyers have tried to
 

2433
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:55,589
All right? So buyers have tried to
absorb this. This can still be a

2434
00:54:55,589 --> 00:54:55,599
absorb this. This can still be a
 

2435
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,349
absorb this. This can still be a
liquidity bill to go lower. This is what

2436
00:54:57,349 --> 00:54:57,359
liquidity bill to go lower. This is what
 

2437
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,030
liquidity bill to go lower. This is what
I'm trying to say to you. So maybe some

2438
00:54:59,030 --> 00:54:59,040
I'm trying to say to you. So maybe some
 

2439
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,790
I'm trying to say to you. So maybe some
of you bought that 200s like we just

2440
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:00,800
of you bought that 200s like we just
 

2441
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,710
of you bought that 200s like we just
talked about. You better be selling some

2442
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:02,720
talked about. You better be selling some
 

2443
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,270
talked about. You better be selling some
into 40s and then you can see if you can

2444
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:05,280
into 40s and then you can see if you can
 

2445
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,270
into 40s and then you can see if you can
get up to 60s and you can see if you can

2446
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:07,280
get up to 60s and you can see if you can
 

2447
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,150
get up to 60s and you can see if you can
get up to 80s. But just know this can be

2448
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:10,160
get up to 80s. But just know this can be
 

2449
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,230
get up to 80s. But just know this can be
built out. All right, this could be a

2450
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:12,240
built out. All right, this could be a
 

2451
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,030
built out. All right, this could be a
one two to come lower. This is all I'm

2452
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:15,040
one two to come lower. This is all I'm
 

2453
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,910
one two to come lower. This is all I'm
telling you. Manage your risk. If you

2454
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:17,920
telling you. Manage your risk. If you
 

2455
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,990
telling you. Manage your risk. If you
are taking longs today, you are counter

2456
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:20,000
are taking longs today, you are counter
 

2457
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,750
are taking longs today, you are counter
trend long on what we've seen this

2458
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:21,760
trend long on what we've seen this
 

2459
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,750
trend long on what we've seen this
morning. But technically, you are

2460
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:23,760
morning. But technically, you are
 

2461
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,510
morning. But technically, you are
playing value, so it's not the worst.

2462
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:25,520
playing value, so it's not the worst.
 

2463
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,030
playing value, so it's not the worst.
You are trying to play discount back up

2464
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:27,040
You are trying to play discount back up
 

2465
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,710
You are trying to play discount back up
inside. But I still think there's a

2466
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:28,720
inside. But I still think there's a
 

2467
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,390
inside. But I still think there's a
chance to come back down here first. But

2468
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:30,400
chance to come back down here first. But
 

2469
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:40,630
chance to come back down here first. But
we will see, folks.

2470
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:40,640

 

2471
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,750

Will there be a third push to the

2472
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:41,760
Will there be a third push to the
 

2473
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,589
Will there be a third push to the
downside? Very possible. I think the uh

2474
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:43,599
downside? Very possible. I think the uh
 

2475
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,430
downside? Very possible. I think the uh
we have low hanging fruit to go for, but

2476
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:45,440
we have low hanging fruit to go for, but
 

2477
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,990
we have low hanging fruit to go for, but
like again, you can be short here at 40s

2478
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:48,000
like again, you can be short here at 40s
 

2479
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,150
like again, you can be short here at 40s
and you can be long here at sort of 210,

2480
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:50,160
and you can be long here at sort of 210,
 

2481
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,829
and you can be long here at sort of 210,
200s. Right now this is look at the

2482
00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:51,839
200s. Right now this is look at the
 

2483
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:53,430
200s. Right now this is look at the
nodes right this is where we're building

2484
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:53,440
nodes right this is where we're building
 

2485
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,230
nodes right this is where we're building
liquidity. If they get under 200s right

2486
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:56,240
liquidity. If they get under 200s right
 

2487
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,549
liquidity. If they get under 200s right
all right we will revisit 185 and under

2488
00:55:58,549 --> 00:55:58,559
all right we will revisit 185 and under
 

2489
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,789
all right we will revisit 185 and under
that we will make a new low. All right

2490
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:00,799
that we will make a new low. All right
 

2491
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,069
that we will make a new low. All right
under 185 there is a seller at 185. So

2492
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:04,079
under 185 there is a seller at 185. So
 

2493
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,230
under 185 there is a seller at 185. So
back towards the 10ens again. All right

2494
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:06,240
back towards the 10ens again. All right
 

2495
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,230
back towards the 10ens again. All right
under this under tens we go 200s. If

2496
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:08,240
under this under tens we go 200s. If
 

2497
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,789
under this under tens we go 200s. If
they don't hold 200s we will probably go

2498
00:56:10,789 --> 00:56:10,799
they don't hold 200s we will probably go
 

2499
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,789
they don't hold 200s we will probably go
185 and then see a new low. So if you're

2500
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:12,799
185 and then see a new low. So if you're
 

2501
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,870
185 and then see a new low. So if you're
short from this gray box you're covering

2502
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:14,880
short from this gray box you're covering
 

2503
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,710
short from this gray box you're covering
a piece here because you're short near

2504
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:16,720
a piece here because you're short near
 

2505
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,470
a piece here because you're short near
the low. Right? So if you're short here,

2506
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:18,480
the low. Right? So if you're short here,
 

2507
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,950
the low. Right? So if you're short here,
you're covering a piece here and 85s and

2508
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:20,960
you're covering a piece here and 85s and
 

2509
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,470
you're covering a piece here and 85s and
then holding for this. Here you go. So

2510
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:22,480
then holding for this. Here you go. So
 

2511
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:28,630
then holding for this. Here you go. So
in towards 85s now.

2512
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:28,640

 

2513
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,309

See if they can get you down to the 85.

2514
00:56:30,309 --> 00:56:30,319
See if they can get you down to the 85.
 

2515
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,390
See if they can get you down to the 85.
So you're holding 200s, 200, 200. You

2516
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:32,400
So you're holding 200s, 200, 200. You
 

2517
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,549
So you're holding 200s, 200, 200. You
want 200s and two 10s to stay heavy. And

2518
00:56:34,549 --> 00:56:34,559
want 200s and two 10s to stay heavy. And
 

2519
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,630
want 200s and two 10s to stay heavy. And
you want to be covering into 85 and then

2520
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:36,640
you want to be covering into 85 and then
 

2521
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,589
you want to be covering into 85 and then
holding for a new low of day into uh

2522
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:39,599
holding for a new low of day into uh
 

2523
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,349
holding for a new low of day into uh
145.

2524
00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:41,359
145.
 

2525
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:44,069
145.
Here you go. So here's towards 85s. You

2526
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,079
Here you go. So here's towards 85s. You
 

2527
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,069
Here you go. So here's towards 85s. You
need a new low of day. Now here it comes

2528
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:46,079
need a new low of day. Now here it comes
 

2529
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,230
need a new low of day. Now here it comes
under 85. That's your new low of day.

2530
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:48,240
under 85. That's your new low of day.
 

2531
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,390
under 85. That's your new low of day.
And now you're looking for 145s.

2532
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:52,400
And now you're looking for 145s.
 

2533
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,390
And now you're looking for 145s.
But I don't know what I'm talking about.

2534
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:54,400
But I don't know what I'm talking about.
 

2535
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:59,990
But I don't know what I'm talking about.
Don't worry about it.

2536
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:00,000

 

2537
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,910

Am I planning entering? No, I'm I'm just

2538
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:01,920
Am I planning entering? No, I'm I'm just
 

2539
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,270
Am I planning entering? No, I'm I'm just
taking a chill for a moment. It's not

2540
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:03,280
taking a chill for a moment. It's not
 

2541
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,710
taking a chill for a moment. It's not
cuz it's not a good setup, guys. It's

2542
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:04,720
cuz it's not a good setup, guys. It's
 

2543
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,510
cuz it's not a good setup, guys. It's
cuz I'm also like having to deal with my

2544
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:07,520
cuz I'm also like having to deal with my
 

2545
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,349
cuz I'm also like having to deal with my
own uh let's call it stress right now.

2546
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:11,359
own uh let's call it stress right now.
 

2547
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,950
own uh let's call it stress right now.
So, I'm just like trying to manage how I

2548
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:14,960
So, I'm just like trying to manage how I
 

2549
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,950
So, I'm just like trying to manage how I
trade. I'm trading much smaller size

2550
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:16,960
trade. I'm trading much smaller size
 

2551
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,390
trade. I'm trading much smaller size
without my accounts linked at the

2552
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:18,400
without my accounts linked at the
 

2553
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,470
without my accounts linked at the
moment. Not because the charts aren't

2554
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:20,480
moment. Not because the charts aren't
 

2555
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,150
moment. Not because the charts aren't
good. The charts are amazing. The reason

2556
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:22,160
good. The charts are amazing. The reason
 

2557
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,390
good. The charts are amazing. The reason
I am doing that is because I don't fully

2558
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:24,400
I am doing that is because I don't fully
 

2559
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,549
I am doing that is because I don't fully
trust myself right now because I have a

2560
00:57:26,549 --> 00:57:26,559
trust myself right now because I have a
 

2561
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,710
trust myself right now because I have a
huge amount going on. The biggest stress

2562
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:28,720
huge amount going on. The biggest stress
 

2563
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,470
huge amount going on. The biggest stress
I've ever had in my whole entire life,

2564
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:30,480
I've ever had in my whole entire life,
 

2565
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,789
I've ever had in my whole entire life,
my 40 years on earth going on off the

2566
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:32,799
my 40 years on earth going on off the
 

2567
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,470
my 40 years on earth going on off the
screens, which means I need to be

2568
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:34,480
screens, which means I need to be
 

2569
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,190
screens, which means I need to be
careful on the screens. Right.

2570
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:39,200

 

2571
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,270

Okay. So, you need a 200 rejection here.

2572
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:41,280
Okay. So, you need a 200 rejection here.
 

2573
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,750
Okay. So, you need a 200 rejection here.
If you're short, you want to see 200

2574
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:43,760
If you're short, you want to see 200
 

2575
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,270
If you're short, you want to see 200
sort of 202 or 200 to 209 must reject.

2576
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:47,280
sort of 202 or 200 to 209 must reject.
 

2577
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,750
sort of 202 or 200 to 209 must reject.
200 rejects, then you are good to look

2578
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:49,760
200 rejects, then you are good to look
 

2579
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,589
200 rejects, then you are good to look
for this down here to hold onto this

2580
00:57:51,589 --> 00:57:51,599
for this down here to hold onto this
 

2581
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,030
for this down here to hold onto this
short. So, if you're short in a gray

2582
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:53,040
short. So, if you're short in a gray
 

2583
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,270
short. So, if you're short in a gray
box, you need 200 to stay heavy. This

2584
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:55,280
box, you need 200 to stay heavy. This
 

2585
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,829
box, you need 200 to stay heavy. This
level here must now stay heavy, right?

2586
00:57:57,829 --> 00:57:57,839
level here must now stay heavy, right?
 

2587
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,990
level here must now stay heavy, right?
You want that to stay heavy. All right,

2588
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:00,000
You want that to stay heavy. All right,
 

2589
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,470
You want that to stay heavy. All right,
to keep those sellers comfortable, you

2590
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:02,480
to keep those sellers comfortable, you
 

2591
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,390
to keep those sellers comfortable, you
must now see this. All right, and you're

2592
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:04,400
must now see this. All right, and you're
 

2593
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,950
must now see this. All right, and you're
covering here and then down into here.

2594
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:06,960
covering here and then down into here.
 

2595
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,789
covering here and then down into here.
If they reclaim 200, I'd be very

2596
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:08,799
If they reclaim 200, I'd be very
 

2597
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:10,390
If they reclaim 200, I'd be very
cautious because you can see an

2598
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:10,400
cautious because you can see an
 

2599
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,430
cautious because you can see an
imbalance at 220s to 230s be filled

2600
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:13,440
imbalance at 220s to 230s be filled
 

2601
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,150
imbalance at 220s to 230s be filled
quick. So, I wouldn't really want 200

2602
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:16,160
quick. So, I wouldn't really want 200
 

2603
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,710
quick. So, I wouldn't really want 200
and 210s uh reclaimed at the moment. You

2604
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:18,720
and 210s uh reclaimed at the moment. You
 

2605
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,630
and 210s uh reclaimed at the moment. You
look good. Look, it's rejecting 200

2606
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:20,640
look good. Look, it's rejecting 200
 

2607
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,910
look good. Look, it's rejecting 200
pretty good at the moment, but you just

2608
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:21,920
pretty good at the moment, but you just
 

2609
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,910
pretty good at the moment, but you just
need to make sure I would I would have

2610
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:23,920
need to make sure I would I would have
 

2611
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,390
need to make sure I would I would have
my, you know, if I was short from that

2612
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:26,400
my, you know, if I was short from that
 

2613
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,710
my, you know, if I was short from that
gray box, I wouldn't want a 210 reclaim

2614
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:28,720
gray box, I wouldn't want a 210 reclaim
 

2615
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,589
gray box, I wouldn't want a 210 reclaim
or let's call it 214 to give yourself a

2616
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:31,599
or let's call it 214 to give yourself a
 

2617
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,349
or let's call it 214 to give yourself a
bit of room based on the node I'm

2618
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:33,359
bit of room based on the node I'm
 

2619
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:36,309
bit of room based on the node I'm
looking at.

2620
00:58:36,309 --> 00:58:36,319
looking at.
 

2621
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:38,630
looking at.
There's a seller up at 220, a 300 loss.

2622
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:38,640
There's a seller up at 220, a 300 loss.
 

2623
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,750
There's a seller up at 220, a 300 loss.
So, he's looking for the imbalance. So,

2624
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:39,760
So, he's looking for the imbalance. So,
 

2625
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,030
So, he's looking for the imbalance. So,
I wouldn't be give letting it come all

2626
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:41,040
I wouldn't be give letting it come all
 

2627
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,109
I wouldn't be give letting it come all
the way back up there. So, here's 200.

2628
00:58:43,109 --> 00:58:43,119
the way back up there. So, here's 200.
 

2629
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,870
the way back up there. So, here's 200.
They're testing 200 over and over and

2630
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:44,880
They're testing 200 over and over and
 

2631
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,789
They're testing 200 over and over and
over again. You want them to step back

2632
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:46,799
over again. You want them to step back
 

2633
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,470
over again. You want them to step back
on the gas and trap these bulls here

2634
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:48,480
on the gas and trap these bulls here
 

2635
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:56,710
on the gas and trap these bulls here
now, which they're trying to do.

2636
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:56,720

 

2637
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,349

Can I explain how to identify whether a

2638
00:58:59,349 --> 00:58:59,359
Can I explain how to identify whether a
 

2639
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:00,630
Can I explain how to identify whether a
buyer or seller is trapped on the

2640
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:00,640
buyer or seller is trapped on the
 

2641
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,950
buyer or seller is trapped on the
footprint? Yeah, just use the delta. The

2642
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:02,960
footprint? Yeah, just use the delta. The
 

2643
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,230
footprint? Yeah, just use the delta. The
delta on the footprint. So, they're

2644
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:04,240
delta on the footprint. So, they're
 

2645
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,750
delta on the footprint. So, they're
trying to lift. Look at this spoofer.

2646
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:05,760
trying to lift. Look at this spoofer.
 

2647
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,630
trying to lift. Look at this spoofer.
Spoofer at 220 has just left. Big buyers

2648
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:08,640
Spoofer at 220 has just left. Big buyers
 

2649
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,870
Spoofer at 220 has just left. Big buyers
coming up here into 210. So this is the

2650
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:10,880
coming up here into 210. So this is the
 

2651
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,190
coming up here into 210. So this is the
level, right? 200 to 210s. You do not

2652
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:13,200
level, right? 200 to 210s. You do not
 

2653
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,950
level, right? 200 to 210s. You do not
want them to rebid 200s now because we

2654
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:14,960
want them to rebid 200s now because we
 

2655
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,230
want them to rebid 200s now because we
just traded through it. Good rejection

2656
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:16,240
just traded through it. Good rejection
 

2657
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,630
just traded through it. Good rejection
of 210. You're okay. You're still okay.

2658
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:18,640
of 210. You're okay. You're still okay.
 

2659
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,630
of 210. You're okay. You're still okay.
So they just trapped a big buyer up

2660
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:20,640
So they just trapped a big buyer up
 

2661
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,950
So they just trapped a big buyer up
here. 100 lot just got trapped into 210s

2662
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:22,960
here. 100 lot just got trapped into 210s
 

2663
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,109
here. 100 lot just got trapped into 210s
up here. All right. 100 lot just got

2664
00:59:25,109 --> 00:59:25,119
up here. All right. 100 lot just got
 

2665
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:29,430
up here. All right. 100 lot just got
trapped. Let me see if I can get it up.

2666
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:29,440
trapped. Let me see if I can get it up.
 

2667
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,430
trapped. Let me see if I can get it up.
Right. Look at this squeeze back up.

2668
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:31,440
Right. Look at this squeeze back up.
 

2669
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,870
Right. Look at this squeeze back up.
This buyer just caught caught. Someone

2670
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:32,880
This buyer just caught caught. Someone
 

2671
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,950
This buyer just caught caught. Someone
just asked how do you see them? Uh this

2672
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:34,960
just asked how do you see them? Uh this
 

2673
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,789
just asked how do you see them? Uh this
is buying. This is aggressive market

2674
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:36,799
is buying. This is aggressive market
 

2675
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:39,109
is buying. This is aggressive market
ordering buying, right? Same as here.

2676
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:39,119
ordering buying, right? Same as here.
 

2677
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,789
ordering buying, right? Same as here.
Aggressive buying. Aggressive buying. We

2678
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:40,799
Aggressive buying. Aggressive buying. We
 

2679
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:42,390
Aggressive buying. Aggressive buying. We
use their pain to move lower. This guy

2680
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:42,400
use their pain to move lower. This guy
 

2681
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,390
use their pain to move lower. This guy
just got caught. You now need to trade

2682
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:44,400
just got caught. You now need to trade
 

2683
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,710
just got caught. You now need to trade
under 85s again. This guy here, you want

2684
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:46,720
under 85s again. This guy here, you want
 

2685
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,870
under 85s again. This guy here, you want
to trade under this guy and you should

2686
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:48,880
to trade under this guy and you should
 

2687
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,870
to trade under this guy and you should
see a collapse.

2688
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:50,880
see a collapse.
 

2689
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,430
see a collapse.
So 85 still a big big level. I think you

2690
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:53,440
So 85 still a big big level. I think you
 

2691
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,030
So 85 still a big big level. I think you
look good now to hold because we just

2692
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:55,040
look good now to hold because we just
 

2693
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,910
look good now to hold because we just
rejected the 210s. So the gray box just

2694
00:59:57,910 --> 00:59:57,920
rejected the 210s. So the gray box just
 

2695
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,990
rejected the 210s. So the gray box just
rejected. As long as you trade back

2696
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:00,000
rejected. As long as you trade back
 

2697
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,190
rejected. As long as you trade back
under 85s now, you should come to 75 and

2698
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:03,200
under 85s now, you should come to 75 and
 

2699
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,430
under 85s now, you should come to 75 and
then you should see a new low of day. So

2700
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:05,440
then you should see a new low of day. So
 

2701
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,390
then you should see a new low of day. So
under 85 now you should come 75 and if

2702
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:08,400
under 85 now you should come 75 and if
 

2703
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,230
under 85 now you should come 75 and if
they get under 75 you'll see a lower

2704
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:10,240
they get under 75 you'll see a lower
 

2705
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,030
they get under 75 you'll see a lower
day. You do not now want 200 reclaim

2706
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:13,040
day. You do not now want 200 reclaim
 

2707
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,789
day. You do not now want 200 reclaim
again. It's been too many times. I would

2708
01:00:14,789 --> 01:00:14,799
again. It's been too many times. I would
 

2709
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,309
again. It's been too many times. I would
be starting to considering getting out

2710
01:00:16,309 --> 01:00:16,319
be starting to considering getting out
 

2711
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:18,150
be starting to considering getting out
of this fully if it start to reclaim

2712
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:18,160
of this fully if it start to reclaim
 

2713
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,230
of this fully if it start to reclaim
this.

2714
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:20,240
this.
 

2715
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,910
this.
I'll probably be out now at this point.

2716
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:23,920
I'll probably be out now at this point.
 

2717
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,349
I'll probably be out now at this point.
Doesn't mean it can't move lower. Look

2718
01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:25,359
Doesn't mean it can't move lower. Look
 

2719
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,430
Doesn't mean it can't move lower. Look
at these even on the tape. But you just

2720
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:27,440
at these even on the tape. But you just
 

2721
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,589
at these even on the tape. But you just

Where's he stepped in again? 200. This
 

2729
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,589
Where's he stepped in again? 200. This
is a huge level, right? And we had a

is a huge level, right? And we had a
 

2731
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,150
is a huge level, right? And we had a
spoofer up here at 220, right? So we got

2732
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:40,160
spoofer up here at 220, right? So we got
 

2733
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,150
spoofer up here at 220, right? So we got
this these big guys stepping in. They're

this these big guys stepping in. They're
starting to hold 200. All right. If they

2736
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:43,680
starting to hold 200. All right. If they
 

2737
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,150
starting to hold 200. All right. If they
break through 210s, if we zoom out,

2738
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:46,160
break through 210s, if we zoom out,
 

2739
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,750
break through 210s, if we zoom out,
right? If we break through 210s, we're

2740
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:47,760
right? If we break through 210s, we're
 

2741
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,349
right? If we break through 210s, we're
going to visit this guy who's trapped up

2742
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:49,359
going to visit this guy who's trapped up
 

2743
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:51,190
going to visit this guy who's trapped up
at 230. All right. And if we break

2744
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:51,200
at 230. All right. And if we break
 

2745
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,030
at 230. All right. And if we break
through 230, we're going to start

2746
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:53,040
through 230, we're going to start
 

2747
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:59,109
through 230, we're going to start
revisiting these guys at 250.

2748
01:00:59,109 --> 01:00:59,119

 

2749
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,670

Do I consider fair value gaps? I do not.

2750
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:01,680
Do I consider fair value gaps? I do not.
 

2751
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,990
Do I consider fair value gaps? I do not.
I I do, but I I don't use them in the

2752
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:04,000
I I do, but I I don't use them in the
 

2753
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,789
I I do, but I I don't use them in the
same way as as you guys using ICT. Um,

2754
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:06,799
same way as as you guys using ICT. Um,
 

2755
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:09,109
same way as as you guys using ICT. Um,
so if I tell you there's an imbalance,

2756
01:01:09,109 --> 01:01:09,119
so if I tell you there's an imbalance,
 

2757
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:10,710
so if I tell you there's an imbalance,
all right, for me, there doesn't have to

2758
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:10,720
all right, for me, there doesn't have to
 

2759
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,390
all right, for me, there doesn't have to
be a gap on the screen. All right, it's

2760
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:12,400
be a gap on the screen. All right, it's
 

2761
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,630
be a gap on the screen. All right, it's
it's a quite genuine imbalance, right?

2762
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:14,640
it's a quite genuine imbalance, right?
 

2763
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,230
it's a quite genuine imbalance, right?
So, I've got some imbalances up here on

2764
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:16,240
So, I've got some imbalances up here on
 

2765
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,150
So, I've got some imbalances up here on
a five minute, right? But these are

2766
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:18,160
a five minute, right? But these are
 

2767
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,910
a five minute, right? But these are
actual volume imbalances. So, they might

2768
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:19,920
actual volume imbalances. So, they might
 

2769
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,510
actual volume imbalances. So, they might
line up with your fair value gaps, but

2770
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:21,520
line up with your fair value gaps, but
 

2771
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,430
line up with your fair value gaps, but
sometimes they don't. Sometimes the

2772
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:23,440
sometimes they don't. Sometimes the
 

2773
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,109
sometimes they don't. Sometimes the
imbalance will be in what you call an

2774
01:01:25,109 --> 01:01:25,119
imbalance will be in what you call an
 

2775
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,470
imbalance will be in what you call an
order block because it's a true

2776
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:26,480
order block because it's a true
 

2777
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,710
order block because it's a true
imbalance. It's not that fair value gaps

2778
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:28,720
imbalance. It's not that fair value gaps
 

2779
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,630
imbalance. It's not that fair value gaps
don't work. They do. They work. I'll

2780
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:30,640
don't work. They do. They work. I'll
 

2781
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,990
don't work. They do. They work. I'll
tell you when they work. When there's a

2782
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:32,000
tell you when they work. When there's a
 

2783
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,910
tell you when they work. When there's a
natural imbalance there. When they don't

2784
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:33,920
natural imbalance there. When they don't
 

2785
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,510
natural imbalance there. When they don't
work is when there's a gap on your

2786
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:35,520
work is when there's a gap on your
 

2787
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,030
work is when there's a gap on your
screen, but in the order flow there's

2788
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:37,040
screen, but in the order flow there's
 

2789
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,710
screen, but in the order flow there's
actually no imbalance. That's when your

2790
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:38,720
actually no imbalance. That's when your
 

2791
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:43,589
actually no imbalance. That's when your
fair value gaps will fail.

2792
01:01:43,589 --> 01:01:43,599

 

2793
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,589

footprints. I'm going to pop it in chat.
Where is chat?

2848
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:46,880
Where is chat?
 

2849
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,270
Where is chat?
So, whoever just asked that is uh this

2850
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:49,280
So, whoever just asked that is uh this
 

2851
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,950
So, whoever just asked that is uh this
link here I've just popped in chat that

01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:50,960
link here I've just popped in chat that
 

2853
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,549
link here I've just popped in chat that
shows you how to set up footprint in

2854
01:02:52,549 --> 01:02:52,559
shows you how to set up footprint in
 

2855
01:02:52,559 --> 01:03:01,430
shows you how to set up footprint in
Trading View.

2856
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:01,440

 

2857
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,430

Can we short now? I wouldn't be as keen

2858
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:03,440
Can we short now? I wouldn't be as keen
 

2859
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,710
Can we short now? I wouldn't be as keen
for the short now. Buyers are starting

2860
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:04,720
for the short now. Buyers are starting
 

2861
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,990
for the short now. Buyers are starting
to step in, aren't they? You're coming

2862
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:06,000
to step in, aren't they? You're coming
 

2863
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,670
to step in, aren't they? You're coming
back to this same level to the 50s,

2864
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:07,680
back to this same level to the 50s,
 

2865
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,230
back to this same level to the 50s,
right? So, I would now say shorts are

2866
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,240
right? So, I would now say shorts are
 

2867
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,990
right? So, I would now say shorts are
caught at the lows. Shorts are caught at

2868
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:12,000
caught at the lows. Shorts are caught at
 

2869
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,510
caught at the lows. Shorts are caught at
285

2870
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:13,520
285
 

2871
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,349
285
and 75, right? So that you had one

2872
01:03:15,349 --> 01:03:15,359
and 75, right? So that you had one
 

2873
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,510
and 75, right? So that you had one
opportunity, right? You had your first

2874
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:17,520
opportunity, right? You had your first
 

2875
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,190
opportunity, right? You had your first
opportunity. It doesn't mean we can't

2876
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:19,200
opportunity. It doesn't mean we can't
 

2877
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,309
opportunity. It doesn't mean we can't
trade lower, but I would need to see

2878
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:20,319
trade lower, but I would need to see
 

2879
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,990
trade lower, but I would need to see
more buyers caught, right? So you had

2880
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:22,000
more buyers caught, right? So you had
 

2881
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,309
more buyers caught, right? So you had
this and this down to here. You want to

2882
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:24,319
this and this down to here. You want to
 

2883
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:26,230
this and this down to here. You want to
be very careful now. You now know under

2884
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:26,240
be very careful now. You now know under
 

2885
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,829
be very careful now. You now know under
here shorts are caught, right? So if

2886
01:03:27,829 --> 01:03:27,839
here shorts are caught, right? So if
 

2887
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,549
here shorts are caught, right? So if
buyers keeping these shorts caught, we

2888
01:03:30,549 --> 01:03:30,559
buyers keeping these shorts caught, we
 

2889
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,990
buyers keeping these shorts caught, we
can drift back up. So we've got this

2890
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:32,000
can drift back up. So we've got this
 

2891
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,390
can drift back up. So we've got this
node here. If we get through 40s, we're

2892
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:34,400
node here. If we get through 40s, we're
 

2893
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,069
node here. If we get through 40s, we're
going to visit this node here at 70s.

2894
01:03:36,069 --> 01:03:36,079
going to visit this node here at 70s.
 

2895
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,029
going to visit this node here at 70s.
And by the time we get there, we

2896
01:03:37,029 --> 01:03:37,039
And by the time we get there, we
 

2897
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:38,870
And by the time we get there, we
probably got VWAPs. All right. I would

2898
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:38,880
probably got VWAPs. All right. I would
 

2899
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,589
probably got VWAPs. All right. I would
say over 80s, look at this low volume

2900
01:03:41,589 --> 01:03:41,599
say over 80s, look at this low volume
 

2901
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,589
say over 80s, look at this low volume
node. You want to be very careful. So if

2902
01:03:43,589 --> 01:03:43,599
node. You want to be very careful. So if
 

2903
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:45,270
node. You want to be very careful. So if
they reject this here and we see buyers

2904
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:45,280
they reject this here and we see buyers
 

2905
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,349
they reject this here and we see buyers
caught here, which arguably might be

2906
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:47,359
caught here, which arguably might be
 

2907
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:49,029
caught here, which arguably might be
starting to happen, we could think about

2908
01:03:49,029 --> 01:03:49,039
starting to happen, we could think about
 

2909
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:51,750
starting to happen, we could think about
a reshort for the lows, we just the

2910
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:51,760
a reshort for the lows, we just the
 

2911
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,750
a reshort for the lows, we just the
difference is now the first time we came

2912
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:53,760
difference is now the first time we came
 

2913
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,109
difference is now the first time we came
down, think about the structure now,

2914
01:03:57,109 --> 01:03:57,119
down, think about the structure now,
 

2915
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:58,870
down, think about the structure now,
right? If I make this make sense. The

2916
01:03:58,870 --> 01:03:58,880
right? If I make this make sense. The
 

2917
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,390
right? If I make this make sense. The
first time we came down here, was there

2918
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:00,400
first time we came down here, was there
 

2919
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,910
first time we came down here, was there
any structure? Is there anything down

2920
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:01,920
any structure? Is there anything down
 

2921
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,750
any structure? Is there anything down
here? No. The second time we came down,

2922
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:03,760
here? No. The second time we came down,
 

2923
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,029
here? No. The second time we came down,
is there any structure? There's a little

2924
01:04:05,029 --> 01:04:05,039
is there any structure? There's a little
 

2925
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:07,349
is there any structure? There's a little
bit here. We broke below. Now if we

2926
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:07,359
bit here. We broke below. Now if we
 

2927
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,190
bit here. We broke below. Now if we
short, is there any structure? Yes. All

2928
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:09,200
short, is there any structure? Yes. All
 

2929
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,950
short, is there any structure? Yes. All
right. We have this structure here now.

2930
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:10,960
right. We have this structure here now.
 

2931
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,150
right. We have this structure here now.
All right. So now if we short, we have

2932
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:14,160
All right. So now if we short, we have
 

2933
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,910
All right. So now if we short, we have
sellers caught underneath us for the

2934
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:15,920
sellers caught underneath us for the
 

2935
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,150
sellers caught underneath us for the
first time today. Right? So you need to

2936
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:18,160
first time today. Right? So you need to
 

2937
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,029
first time today. Right? So you need to
think about that.

2938
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:21,039
think about that.
 

2939
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:22,870
think about that.
Same as when we looked for this short

2940
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:22,880
Same as when we looked for this short
 

2941
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,589
Same as when we looked for this short
here. All right. Think about this. When

2942
01:04:25,589 --> 01:04:25,599
here. All right. Think about this. When
 

2943
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,069
here. All right. Think about this. When
we're shorting under this, do we have

2944
01:04:28,069 --> 01:04:28,079
we're shorting under this, do we have
 

2945
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:30,390
we're shorting under this, do we have
structure that we can use? Yeah. If we

2946
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:30,400
structure that we can use? Yeah. If we
 

2947
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,829
structure that we can use? Yeah. If we
can get back into there, we can use

2948
01:04:31,829 --> 01:04:31,839
can get back into there, we can use
 

2949
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:33,670
can get back into there, we can use
these buyers trap to move lower. This is

2950
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:33,680
these buyers trap to move lower. This is
 

2951
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,950
these buyers trap to move lower. This is
what I was looking for. The retest when

2952
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:34,960
what I was looking for. The retest when
 

2953
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,230
what I was looking for. The retest when
the guy was like, "This is bullshit."

2954
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:36,240
the guy was like, "This is bullshit."
 

2955
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,150
the guy was like, "This is bullshit."
Whoever said that in chat, it isn't.

2956
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:38,160
Whoever said that in chat, it isn't.
 

2957
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,390
Whoever said that in chat, it isn't.
This is how you play proper trading,

2958
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:40,400
This is how you play proper trading,
 

2959
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,950
This is how you play proper trading,
right? We don't guess if you are taking

2960
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:42,960
right? We don't guess if you are taking
 

2961
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,150
right? We don't guess if you are taking
a breakout short here. For me, inside a

2962
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:46,160
a breakout short here. For me, inside a
 

2963
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,470
a breakout short here. For me, inside a
range, a breakout there is very

2964
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:48,480
range, a breakout there is very
 

2965
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,549
range, a breakout there is very
dangerous. Very dangerous that that

2966
01:04:50,549 --> 01:04:50,559
dangerous. Very dangerous that that
 

2967
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:51,990
dangerous. Very dangerous that that
doesn't happen to you, which is why I

2968
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:52,000
doesn't happen to you, which is why I
 

2969
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,190
doesn't happen to you, which is why I
wanted it to lift and show me. I

2970
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:55,200
wanted it to lift and show me. I
 

2971
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,390
wanted it to lift and show me. I
wouldn't be thinking short at this

2972
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:56,400
wouldn't be thinking short at this
 

2973
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,910
wouldn't be thinking short at this
point. We're starting to curl. We're

2974
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:57,920
point. We're starting to curl. We're
 

2975
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,470
point. We're starting to curl. We're
probably going to go sideways for a bit,

2976
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:00,480
probably going to go sideways for a bit,
 

2977
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,390
probably going to go sideways for a bit,
right? It's possible. It depends how far

2978
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:02,400
right? It's possible. It depends how far
 

2979
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,230
right? It's possible. It depends how far
they relief. It's possible that we

2980
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:04,240
they relief. It's possible that we
 

2981
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,789
they relief. It's possible that we
develop in here for a bit, right? And

2982
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:06,799
develop in here for a bit, right? And
 

2983
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:08,549
develop in here for a bit, right? And
then we can see who gets caught. If they

2984
01:05:08,549 --> 01:05:08,559
then we can see who gets caught. If they
 

2985
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:10,309
then we can see who gets caught. If they
catch buyers up here, we can think about

2986
01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:10,319
catch buyers up here, we can think about
 

2987
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,069
catch buyers up here, we can think about
that sell back down. If they catch

2988
01:05:12,069 --> 01:05:12,079
that sell back down. If they catch
 

2989
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:13,589
that sell back down. If they catch
sellers down here, we can think about

2990
01:05:13,589 --> 01:05:13,599
sellers down here, we can think about
 

2991
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:16,309
sellers down here, we can think about
that rip back up.

2992
01:05:16,309 --> 01:05:16,319
that rip back up.
 

2993
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:17,829
that rip back up.
I don't want to trade sideways. All

2994
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:17,839
I don't want to trade sideways. All
 

2995
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:19,270
I don't want to trade sideways. All
right, this is what I'm saying. Let me

2996
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:19,280
right, this is what I'm saying. Let me
 

2997
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,630
right, this is what I'm saying. Let me
just back off the charts for a minute.

2998
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:20,640
just back off the charts for a minute.
 

2999
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,789
just back off the charts for a minute.
Let it decide. 250 is rejecting. Well,

3000
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:22,799
Let it decide. 250 is rejecting. Well,
 

3001
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:25,430
Let it decide. 250 is rejecting. Well,
there we have this node here. Let's just

3002
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:25,440
there we have this node here. Let's just
 

3003
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,190
there we have this node here. Let's just
make sure these are all accurate for you

3004
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:27,200
make sure these are all accurate for you
 

3005
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,789
make sure these are all accurate for you
guys.

3006
01:05:30,789 --> 01:05:30,799

 

3007
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:36,230

And this should be great.

3008
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:36,240

 

3009
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,670

So, I didn't get this one.

3010
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:37,680
So, I didn't get this one.
 

3011
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,029
So, I didn't get this one.
Unfortunately, maybe some of you got

3012
01:05:39,029 --> 01:05:39,039
Unfortunately, maybe some of you got
 

3013
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:40,309
Unfortunately, maybe some of you got
this one. This is the only one I got

3014
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:40,319
this one. This is the only one I got
 

3015
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:51,029
this one. This is the only one I got
today.

3016
01:05:51,029 --> 01:05:51,039

 

3017
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:52,710

Which software do I use for using the

3018
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:52,720
Which software do I use for using the
 

3019
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,950
Which software do I use for using the
trait? Are have you applied my any

3020
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:56,960
trait? Are have you applied my any
 

3021
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,109
trait? Are have you applied my any
contract volume filters on the tape? Uh,

3022
01:05:59,109 --> 01:05:59,119
contract volume filters on the tape? Uh,
 

3023
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:03,430
contract volume filters on the tape? Uh,
no. Uh actually there's a filter on my

3024
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:03,440
no. Uh actually there's a filter on my
 

3025

Um but yeah, I use footprint on Ninja
 

3031
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,950
Um but yeah, I use footprint on Ninja
via Twin Peaks. I use Footprint on

3032
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:16,960

3040
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:29,680

 

3041
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,589

Yes. So JB, what does it mean when you

3042
01:06:31,589 --> 01:06:31,599
Yes. So JB, what does it mean when you
 

3043
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,750
Yes. So JB, what does it mean when you
say fair values gap gaps work when

3044
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:33,760
say fair values gap gaps work when
 

3045
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,990
say fair values gap gaps work when
there's an imbalance? I thought the gap

3046
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:36,000
there's an imbalance? I thought the gap
 

3047
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,990
there's an imbalance? I thought the gap
was the imbalance. So this this is what

3048
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:38,000
was the imbalance. So this this is what
 

3049
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,990
was the imbalance. So this this is what
I'm talking about with order flow. Okay.

3050
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:40,000
I'm talking about with order flow. Okay.
 

3051
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,349
I'm talking about with order flow. Okay.
So how can I give you an example of

3052
01:06:41,349 --> 01:06:41,359
So how can I give you an example of
 

3053
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:44,230
So how can I give you an example of
this?

3054
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:44,240
this?
 

3055
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,230
this?
If you were to look at the candle at 957

3056
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:48,240
If you were to look at the candle at 957
 

3057
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:52,069
If you were to look at the candle at 957
957 uh where's that? Is it this one?

3058
01:06:52,069 --> 01:06:52,079
957 uh where's that? Is it this one?
 

3059
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:53,190
957 uh where's that? Is it this one?
Make sure this is the right one because

3060
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:53,200
Make sure this is the right one because
 

3061
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,829
Make sure this is the right one because
it's going to 957. It might be 58 on

3062
01:06:55,829 --> 01:06:55,839
it's going to 957. It might be 58 on
 

3063
01:06:55,839 --> 01:07:00,230
it's going to 957. It might be 58 on
here. 9.

3064
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:00,240

 

3065
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,549

Okay, this this candle here, right? This

3066
01:07:02,549 --> 01:07:02,559
Okay, this this candle here, right? This
 

3067
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,950
Okay, this this candle here, right? This
candle here. So, it's 56 on it, 57 on

3068
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:04,960
candle here. So, it's 56 on it, 57 on
 

3069
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,549
candle here. So, it's 56 on it, 57 on
Ninja. If you were going to draw out a

3070
01:07:06,549 --> 01:07:06,559
Ninja. If you were going to draw out a
 

3071
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,390
Ninja. If you were going to draw out a
gap, right, you would draw it out like

3072
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:08,400
gap, right, you would draw it out like
 

3073
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,750
gap, right, you would draw it out like
this, wouldn't you? If you were doing

3074
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:09,760
this, wouldn't you? If you were doing
 

3075
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,270
this, wouldn't you? If you were doing
doing a fair value gap, let's just do

3076
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:11,280
doing a fair value gap, let's just do
 

3077
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,829
doing a fair value gap, let's just do
this as uh red, right? That would be

3078
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:13,839
this as uh red, right? That would be
 

3079
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:15,910
this as uh red, right? That would be
your fair value gap. The truth of the

3080
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:15,920
your fair value gap. The truth of the
 

3081
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,950
your fair value gap. The truth of the
matter is the gap in there was at 30,

3082
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:18,960
matter is the gap in there was at 30,
 

3083
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,029
matter is the gap in there was at 30,
right? So, the gap in here, the only gap

3084
01:07:21,029 --> 01:07:21,039
right? So, the gap in here, the only gap
 

3085
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:23,829
right? So, the gap in here, the only gap
that actually existed was down here. Was

3086
01:07:23,829 --> 01:07:23,839
that actually existed was down here. Was
 

3087
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:26,230
that actually existed was down here. Was
this, right? There wasn't a gap up here.

3088
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:26,240
this, right? There wasn't a gap up here.
 

3089
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,589
this, right? There wasn't a gap up here.
They There were orders were filled.

3090
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:27,599
They There were orders were filled.
 

3091
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,430
They There were orders were filled.
There's no imbalance up there. That's

3092
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:29,440
There's no imbalance up there. That's
 

3093
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,510
There's no imbalance up there. That's
what I mean. So, I know where the actual

3094
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:31,520
what I mean. So, I know where the actual
 

3095
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,549
what I mean. So, I know where the actual
gap is. It's not like, "Oh, I know. I'm

3096
01:07:34,549 --> 01:07:34,559
gap is. It's not like, "Oh, I know. I'm
 

3097
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:36,470
gap is. It's not like, "Oh, I know. I'm
not It's not like I'm a genius or

3098
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:36,480
not It's not like I'm a genius or
 

3099
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,430
not It's not like I'm a genius or
magic." Footprint's showing me where

3100
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:39,440
magic." Footprint's showing me where
 

3101
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,829
magic." Footprint's showing me where
that gap actually is is what I'm trying

3102
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:41,839
that gap actually is is what I'm trying
 

3103
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:46,789
that gap actually is is what I'm trying
to tell you. Um, so here,

3104
01:07:46,789 --> 01:07:46,799
to tell you. Um, so here,
 

3105
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:49,190
to tell you. Um, so here,
can I move this over here? Right. So,

3106
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:49,200
can I move this over here? Right. So,
 

3107
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,789
can I move this over here? Right. So,
this is just on a five minute. These are

3108
01:07:50,789 --> 01:07:50,799
this is just on a five minute. These are
 

3109
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,549
this is just on a five minute. These are
imbalances. These are true imbalances.

3110
01:07:52,549 --> 01:07:52,559
imbalances. These are true imbalances.
 

3111
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:54,069
imbalances. These are true imbalances.
We have some old imbalances under

3112
01:07:54,069 --> 01:07:54,079
We have some old imbalances under
 

3113
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:55,589
We have some old imbalances under
underneath us. You see how we come down

3114
01:07:55,589 --> 01:07:55,599
underneath us. You see how we come down
 

3115
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,309
underneath us. You see how we come down
to true imbalances, we find a bid. All

3116
01:07:58,309 --> 01:07:58,319
to true imbalances, we find a bid. All
 

3117
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,549
to true imbalances, we find a bid. All
right, true imbalances. We find a bid.

3118
01:08:00,549 --> 01:08:00,559
right, true imbalances. We find a bid.
 

3119
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,470
right, true imbalances. We find a bid.
These are not you would not even see

3120
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:02,480
These are not you would not even see
 

3121
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,789
These are not you would not even see
these on your chart on a five-minute

3122
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:04,799
these on your chart on a five-minute
 

3123
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:06,470
these on your chart on a five-minute
chart. All right, because you don't you

3124
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:06,480
chart. All right, because you don't you
 

3125
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,390
chart. All right, because you don't you
don't have that data unless you're using

3126
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:08,400
don't have that data unless you're using
 

3127
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,390
don't have that data unless you're using
footprint. All right, that's all I'm

3128
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:10,400
footprint. All right, that's all I'm
 

3129
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,190
footprint. All right, that's all I'm
saying. It the the the concept of fair

3130
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:13,200
saying. It the the the concept of fair
 

3131
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,190
saying. It the the the concept of fair
value gaps is a good concept, but

3132
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:15,200
value gaps is a good concept, but
 

3133
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,870
value gaps is a good concept, but
sometimes there's not actually an

3134
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:16,880
sometimes there's not actually an
 

3135
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,390
sometimes there's not actually an
imbalance in that bar.

3136
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:20,400
imbalance in that bar.
 

3137
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,309
imbalance in that bar.
More precise. Yeah. more more and

3138
01:08:22,309 --> 01:08:22,319
More precise. Yeah. more more and
 

3139
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:23,669
More precise. Yeah. more more and
they're not mine. I don't want you to

3140
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:23,679
they're not mine. I don't want you to
 

3141
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,309
they're not mine. I don't want you to
think that, oh, I made this. I did not

3142
01:08:26,309 --> 01:08:26,319
think that, oh, I made this. I did not
 

3143
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:29,430
think that, oh, I made this. I did not
make footprint. I have I did not create

3144
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:29,440
make footprint. I have I did not create
 

3145
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:33,669
make footprint. I have I did not create
imbalances. All right? This is not my I

3146
01:08:33,669 --> 01:08:33,679
imbalances. All right? This is not my I
 

3147
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:35,189
imbalances. All right? This is not my I
don't own this. I'm just trying to teach

3148
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:35,199
don't own this. I'm just trying to teach
 

3149
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,349
don't own this. I'm just trying to teach
you the difference between a true

3150
01:08:37,349 --> 01:08:37,359
you the difference between a true
 

3151
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:40,229
you the difference between a true
imbalance and not. Okay? So, they just

3152
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:40,239
imbalance and not. Okay? So, they just
 

3153
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:42,390
imbalance and not. Okay? So, they just
bid again off what level? What level did

3154
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:42,400
bid again off what level? What level did
 

3155
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,269
bid again off what level? What level did
we just bid off again? 200. All right.

3156
01:08:45,269 --> 01:08:45,279
we just bid off again? 200. All right.
 

3157
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:47,349
we just bid off again? 200. All right.
200, which is now point of control,

3158
01:08:47,349 --> 01:08:47,359
200, which is now point of control,
 

3159
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,189
200, which is now point of control,
which is where that seller is stuck.

3160
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:49,199
which is where that seller is stuck.
 

3161
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:50,309
which is where that seller is stuck.
This is what I talked about. would be

3162
01:08:50,309 --> 01:08:50,319
This is what I talked about. would be
 

3163
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:52,309
This is what I talked about. would be
less inclined in the short now because

3164
01:08:52,309 --> 01:08:52,319
less inclined in the short now because
 

3165
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:54,870
less inclined in the short now because
we know sellers are caught under 200.

3166
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:54,880
we know sellers are caught under 200.
 

3167
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,550
we know sellers are caught under 200.
We've talked about it numerous times.

3168
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:56,560
We've talked about it numerous times.
 

3169
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,229
We've talked about it numerous times.
Sellers are caught at 200 and at 85. If

3170
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:00,239
Sellers are caught at 200 and at 85. If
 

3171
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:02,309
Sellers are caught at 200 and at 85. If
they can get a lift through 40 here,

3172
01:09:02,309 --> 01:09:02,319
they can get a lift through 40 here,
 

3173
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:04,390
they can get a lift through 40 here,
they can come and test 64. But I'm not

3174
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:04,400
they can come and test 64. But I'm not
 

3175
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,070
they can come and test 64. But I'm not
going to trade what I think is very

3176
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:06,080
going to trade what I think is very
 

3177
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,669
going to trade what I think is very
possible to be a sideways range down

3178
01:09:07,669 --> 01:09:07,679
possible to be a sideways range down
 

3179
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,229
possible to be a sideways range down
here for a bit. We'll avoid that and let

3180
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:10,239
here for a bit. We'll avoid that and let
 

3181
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:15,189
here for a bit. We'll avoid that and let
it let it develop.

3182
01:09:15,189 --> 01:09:15,199

 

3183
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:17,349

Let it develop. We're just going

3184
01:09:17,349 --> 01:09:17,359
Let it develop. We're just going
 

3185
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,349
Let it develop. We're just going
sideways, right? it. This can be a

3186
01:09:19,349 --> 01:09:19,359
sideways, right? it. This can be a
 

3187
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:21,110
sideways, right? it. This can be a
sideways build. I want all you guys that

3188
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:21,120
sideways build. I want all you guys that
 

3189
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,030
sideways build. I want all you guys that
are saying is it long now? This can be a

3190
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:23,040
are saying is it long now? This can be a
 

3191
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,030
are saying is it long now? This can be a
sideways build to go lower. I don't know

3192
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:25,040
sideways build to go lower. I don't know
 

3193
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,709
sideways build to go lower. I don't know
what it's going to be. I want to make

3194
01:09:26,709 --> 01:09:26,719
what it's going to be. I want to make
 

3195
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:29,349
what it's going to be. I want to make
that clear. Main trend is down. This can

3196
01:09:29,349 --> 01:09:29,359
that clear. Main trend is down. This can
 

3197
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:31,189
that clear. Main trend is down. This can
be a sideways build to go lower. But we

3198
01:09:31,189 --> 01:09:31,199
be a sideways build to go lower. But we
 

3199
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:33,829
be a sideways build to go lower. But we
will go lower when we get under 200,

3200
01:09:33,829 --> 01:09:33,839
will go lower when we get under 200,
 

3201
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:36,229
will go lower when we get under 200,
under 85 for this move down into here.

3202
01:09:36,229 --> 01:09:36,239
under 85 for this move down into here.
 

3203
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:37,749
under 85 for this move down into here.
But ask yourself, what's the riskreward

3204
01:09:37,749 --> 01:09:37,759
But ask yourself, what's the riskreward
 

3205
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:40,070
But ask yourself, what's the riskreward
here? Not great. If we get down to here,

3206
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:40,080
here? Not great. If we get down to here,
 

3207
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,550
here? Not great. If we get down to here,
it's pretty good, right? The best move

3208
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:42,560
it's pretty good, right? The best move
 

3209
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,709
it's pretty good, right? The best move
here, if we're going to go short, the

3210
01:09:44,709 --> 01:09:44,719
here, if we're going to go short, the
 

3211
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:46,709
here, if we're going to go short, the
best move, which ENQ just feels

3212
01:09:46,709 --> 01:09:46,719
best move, which ENQ just feels
 

3213
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:49,269
best move, which ENQ just feels
unwilling to do today, would be to swipe

3214
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:49,279
unwilling to do today, would be to swipe
 

3215
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:51,749
unwilling to do today, would be to swipe
up, trap breakout buys here. Think about

3216
01:09:51,749 --> 01:09:51,759
up, trap breakout buys here. Think about
 

3217
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:53,189
up, trap breakout buys here. Think about
how many breakout buys would come in

3218
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:53,199
how many breakout buys would come in
 

3219
01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:55,350
how many breakout buys would come in
here and reject that. This would be your

3220
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:55,360
here and reject that. This would be your
 

3221
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,510
here and reject that. This would be your
spring, right? And we could use this

3222
01:09:57,510 --> 01:09:57,520
spring, right? And we could use this
 

3223
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,830
spring, right? And we could use this
then to move lower. That would be the

3224
01:09:59,830 --> 01:09:59,840
then to move lower. That would be the
 

3225
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,550
then to move lower. That would be the
easiest and best move. I don't think NQ

3226
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:02,560
easiest and best move. I don't think NQ
 

3227
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,830
easiest and best move. I don't think NQ
is going to do it because it hasn't done

3228
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:03,840
is going to do it because it hasn't done
 

3229
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,189
is going to do it because it hasn't done
it the high for us, which we've waited

3230
01:10:05,189 --> 01:10:05,199
it the high for us, which we've waited
 

3231
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:07,590
it the high for us, which we've waited
two days for. But you never know, folks.

You never know. We might get lucky and

You never know. We might get lucky and
 

3235
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:17,270
You never know. We might get lucky and
get it.

trap big buys. Oh, hello Mr. Buyer. Mr.
383 lot at 350s. Let's just see how

3270
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:07,280
383 lot at 350s. Let's just see how
 

3271
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,350
383 lot at 350s. Let's just see how
trapped you get up there. All right. So,

3272
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:09,360
trapped you get up there. All right. So,
 

3273
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,630
trapped you get up there. All right. So,
we just caught someone 334 lot at 850s

3274
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:12,640
we just caught someone 334 lot at 850s
 

3275
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,669
we just caught someone 334 lot at 850s
just got caught right at 850. So, if he

3276
01:11:15,669 --> 01:11:15,679
just got caught right at 850. So, if he
 

3277
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:17,350
just got caught right at 850. So, if he
becomes the breakout buyer, we can use

3278
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:17,360
becomes the breakout buyer, we can use
 

3279
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,430
becomes the breakout buyer, we can use
his pain to move lower. So, if we retest

3280
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:19,440
his pain to move lower. So, if we retest
 

3281
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,229
his pain to move lower. So, if we retest
him and we stay heavy, there is a chance

3282
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:22,239
him and we stay heavy, there is a chance
 

3283
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:23,669
him and we stay heavy, there is a chance
here that we're going to use his pain to

3284
01:11:23,669 --> 01:11:23,679
here that we're going to use his pain to
 

3285
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,070
here that we're going to use his pain to
go lower. And that's ES rejecting VW up

3286
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:26,080
go lower. And that's ES rejecting VW up
 

3287
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,830
go lower. And that's ES rejecting VW up
as well. So, let's see here. It's too

3288
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:27,840
as well. So, let's see here. It's too
 

3289
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,830
as well. So, let's see here. It's too
early yet, but we are watching this.

3290
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:29,840
early yet, but we are watching this.
 

3291
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,430
early yet, but we are watching this.
This guy might end up being the

3292
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:31,440
This guy might end up being the
 

3293
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,910
This guy might end up being the
liquidity we need to move lower. Yeah,

3294
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:33,920
liquidity we need to move lower. Yeah,
 

3295
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,189
liquidity we need to move lower. Yeah,
at 250. at 250 right here. All right, at

3296
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:37,199
at 250. at 250 right here. All right, at
 

3297
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:40,470
at 250. at 250 right here. All right, at
250. If we look at bookmap

3298
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:40,480
250. If we look at bookmap
 

3299
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:44,390
250. If we look at bookmap
at 250, 250. Look at this guy here. 334

3300
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:44,400
at 250, 250. Look at this guy here. 334
 

3301
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,149
at 250, 250. Look at this guy here. 334
lot. He just got caught up there. All

3302
01:11:46,149 --> 01:11:46,159
lot. He just got caught up there. All
 

3303
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:48,149
lot. He just got caught up there. All
right, he just got caught up there. So,

3304
01:11:48,149 --> 01:11:48,159
right, he just got caught up there. So,
 

3305
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:50,790
right, he just got caught up there. So,
if we keep him stuck, we can trade lower

3306
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:50,800
if we keep him stuck, we can trade lower
 

3307
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,870
if we keep him stuck, we can trade lower
because he will start stopping out,

3308
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:52,880
because he will start stopping out,
 

3309
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,070
because he will start stopping out,
right? And that's what we're looking for

3310
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:54,080
right? And that's what we're looking for
 

3311
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,590
right? And that's what we're looking for
now. We're looking to see if we can use

3312
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:55,600
now. We're looking to see if we can use
 

3313
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,910
now. We're looking to see if we can use
his pain very well. This is what I was

3314
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:57,920
his pain very well. This is what I was
 

3315
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,350
his pain very well. This is what I was
talking about. We might poke through,

3316
01:11:59,350 --> 01:11:59,360
talking about. We might poke through,
 

3317
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:02,070
talking about. We might poke through,
run these stops, trap a breakout buyer.

3318
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:02,080
run these stops, trap a breakout buyer.
 

3319
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,669
run these stops, trap a breakout buyer.
This is what we just had. a breakout

3320
01:12:03,669 --> 01:12:03,679
This is what we just had. a breakout
 

3321
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:05,910
This is what we just had. a breakout
buyer or a short sell stop. All right,

3322
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:05,920
buyer or a short sell stop. All right,
 

3323
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,550
buyer or a short sell stop. All right,
here. And if we then trade under 200,

3324
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:08,560
here. And if we then trade under 200,
 

3325
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,390
here. And if we then trade under 200,
this can really start puking back down

3326
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:10,400
this can really start puking back down
 

3327
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,790
this can really start puking back down
because now we've got some size caught.

3328
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:12,800
because now we've got some size caught.
 

3329
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:18,790
because now we've got some size caught.
Now we've got some size caught,

3330
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:18,800

 

3331
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,110

but we need to stay heavy versus 250.

3332
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:21,120
but we need to stay heavy versus 250.
 

3333
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,110
but we need to stay heavy versus 250.
All right. So, watching this to see if

3334
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,120
All right. So, watching this to see if
 

3335
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:26,070
All right. So, watching this to see if
we stay heavy versus 250 and if we see

3336
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:26,080
we stay heavy versus 250 and if we see
 

3337
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,830
we stay heavy versus 250 and if we see
more buyers get caught and we reject it,

3338
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:27,840
more buyers get caught and we reject it,
 

3339
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,590
more buyers get caught and we reject it,
if there's some selling up there and

3340
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:29,600
if there's some selling up there and
 

3341
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,430
if there's some selling up there and
then if we can break under 200 and start

3342
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:31,440
then if we can break under 200 and start
 

3343
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,470
then if we can break under 200 and start
puking.

3344
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:34,480

 

3345
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,030

So, anyone who does like a a woff this

3346
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:37,040
So, anyone who does like a a woff this
 

3347
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,110
So, anyone who does like a a woff this
could could potentially be a woff fail

3348
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:39,120
could could potentially be a woff fail
 

3349
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,110
could could potentially be a woff fail
breakout right under 200. This move

3350
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:41,120
breakout right under 200. This move
 

3351
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:49,189
breakout right under 200. This move
here, this is what we're looking for.

3352
01:12:49,189 --> 01:12:49,199

 

3353
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,630

I don't always wait for the retest of

3354
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:50,640
I don't always wait for the retest of
 

3355
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,390
I don't always wait for the retest of
the trap buyer. No, it's just that we're

3356
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:52,400
the trap buyer. No, it's just that we're
 

3357
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,550
the trap buyer. No, it's just that we're
holding 200s or 210s right now. So, I'm

3358
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:54,560
holding 200s or 210s right now. So, I'm
 

3359
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,830
holding 200s or 210s right now. So, I'm
assuming we're going to come and fill in

3360
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:55,840
assuming we're going to come and fill in
 

3361
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,830
assuming we're going to come and fill in
imbalance up there and see if they keep

3362
01:12:57,830 --> 01:12:57,840
imbalance up there and see if they keep
 

3363
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,830
imbalance up there and see if they keep
him stuck. If we come straight under 200

3364
01:12:59,830 --> 01:12:59,840
him stuck. If we come straight under 200
 

3365
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,270
him stuck. If we come straight under 200
and stay heavy there, I can join there

3366
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:01,280
and stay heavy there, I can join there
 

3367
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,110
and stay heavy there, I can join there
if I want. It's not ideal. The

3368
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:03,120
if I want. It's not ideal. The
 

3369
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,709
if I want. It's not ideal. The
location's not ideal down there, but the

3370
01:13:04,709 --> 01:13:04,719
location's not ideal down there, but the
 

3371
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,510
location's not ideal down there, but the
momentum would be good. So, let's see.

3372
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:07,520
momentum would be good. So, let's see.
 

3373
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,709
momentum would be good. So, let's see.
Do they let this guy out or not?

3374
01:13:10,709 --> 01:13:10,719
Do they let this guy out or not?
 

3375
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,630
Do they let this guy out or not?
At the moment, no is the answer. They

3376
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:12,640
At the moment, no is the answer. They
 

3377
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,149
At the moment, no is the answer. They
can't get back on into there at the

3378
01:13:14,149 --> 01:13:14,159
can't get back on into there at the
 

3379
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:19,430
can't get back on into there at the
moment.

3380
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:19,440

 

3381
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,110

trading right at point of control. Don't

3382
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:21,120
trading right at point of control. Don't
 

3383
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,470
trading right at point of control. Don't
want to enter around point of control.

3384
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:22,480
want to enter around point of control.
 

3385
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,390
want to enter around point of control.
That's for sure.

3386
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:24,400
That's for sure.
 

3387
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,669
That's for sure.
So, we're either looking for them to

3388
01:13:25,669 --> 01:13:25,679
So, we're either looking for them to
 

3389
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:28,390
So, we're either looking for them to
trade up and reject it to show us or to

3390
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:28,400
trade up and reject it to show us or to
 

3391
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,790
trade up and reject it to show us or to
trade under 200 and show us. Either way,

3392
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:30,800
trade under 200 and show us. Either way,
 

3393
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,470
trade under 200 and show us. Either way,
we don't want to trade in this location

3394
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:32,480
we don't want to trade in this location
 

3395
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,830
we don't want to trade in this location
here because we're still building

3396
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:33,840
here because we're still building
 

3397
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,430
here because we're still building
liquidity. It's possible that we get

3398
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:35,440
liquidity. It's possible that we get
 

3399
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,750
liquidity. It's possible that we get
back above 250 and we squeeze all the

3400
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:37,760
back above 250 and we squeeze all the
 

3401
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,590
back above 250 and we squeeze all the
way up towards 300. So, we don't want to

3402
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:39,600
way up towards 300. So, we don't want to
 

3403
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,910
way up towards 300. So, we don't want to
be early here.

3404
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:41,920
be early here.
 

3405
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,189
be early here.
We don't want to be early here. We want

3406
01:13:43,189 --> 01:13:43,199
We don't want to be early here. We want
 

3407
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:45,350
We don't want to be early here. We want
to see this reject and this ideally and

3408
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:45,360
to see this reject and this ideally and
 

3409
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,870
to see this reject and this ideally and
then we can probably get this move here.

3410
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:46,880
then we can probably get this move here.
 

3411
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,070
then we can probably get this move here.
This is what I'm going to look for if

3412
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:48,080
This is what I'm going to look for if
 

3413
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,270
This is what I'm going to look for if
we're going to do it. Want to be very

3414
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:49,280
we're going to do it. Want to be very
 

3415
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,790
we're going to do it. Want to be very
careful because if they reclaim this,

3416
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:50,800
careful because if they reclaim this,
 

3417
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,390
careful because if they reclaim this,
this squeeze up here can happen very

3418
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:52,400
this squeeze up here can happen very
 

3419
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,950
this squeeze up here can happen very
quick.

3420
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:54,960
quick.
 

3421
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,870
quick.
That's the first imbalance filmed. The

3422
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:56,880
That's the first imbalance filmed. The
 

3423
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,430
That's the first imbalance filmed. The
next imbalance here is at 41s. So again,

3424
01:13:59,430 --> 01:13:59,440
next imbalance here is at 41s. So again,
 

3425
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,790
next imbalance here is at 41s. So again,
you would not have an imbalance here if

3426
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:00,800
you would not have an imbalance here if
 

3427
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,630
you would not have an imbalance here if
you're trading ICT. I have an imbalance

3428
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:02,640
you're trading ICT. I have an imbalance
 

3429
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:11,430
you're trading ICT. I have an imbalance
here up to well 40 or 41s here.

3430
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:11,440

 

3431
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:15,910

Back to VPO. back to these tens maybe.

3432
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:15,920
Back to VPO. back to these tens maybe.
 

3433
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,910
Back to VPO. back to these tens maybe.
Can we get under the 200s is the big

3434
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:17,920
Can we get under the 200s is the big
 

3435
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,390
Can we get under the 200s is the big
question and we can start selling. So

3436
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:20,400
question and we can start selling. So
 

3437
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,990
question and we can start selling. So
that's a good rejection so far. We

3438
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:22,000
that's a good rejection so far. We
 

3439
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,669
that's a good rejection so far. We
haven't let that player out. I want to

3440
01:14:23,669 --> 01:14:23,679
haven't let that player out. I want to
 

3441
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:26,310
haven't let that player out. I want to
see us move under the 200s for a big

3442
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:26,320
see us move under the 200s for a big
 

3443
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:35,750
see us move under the 200s for a big
confirmation here.

3444
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:35,760

 

3445
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,030

Still holding it. I want to be very

3446
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:37,040
Still holding it. I want to be very
 

3447
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,550
Still holding it. I want to be very
careful because we're building. There is

3448
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:38,560
careful because we're building. There is
 

3449
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,390
careful because we're building. There is
an uptrend starting to develop here. So,

3450
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:40,400
an uptrend starting to develop here. So,
 

3451
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,070
an uptrend starting to develop here. So,
we're just trying to see if we use this

3452
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:42,080
we're just trying to see if we use this
 

3453
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,149
we're just trying to see if we use this
big player and come under 200s and then

3454
01:14:44,149 --> 01:14:44,159
big player and come under 200s and then
 

3455
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:50,709
big player and come under 200s and then
we can snap.

3456
01:14:50,709 --> 01:14:50,719

 

3457
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:53,430

Remember, we must remember these 200s,

3458
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:53,440
Remember, we must remember these 200s,
 

3459
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,870
Remember, we must remember these 200s,
right? Because we have big sellers

3460
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:54,880
right? Because we have big sellers
 

3461
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,950
right? Because we have big sellers
caught down there. So, if I show you

3462
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:56,960
caught down there. So, if I show you
 

3463
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,430
caught down there. So, if I show you
here, this player up here, I know it

3464
01:14:59,430 --> 01:14:59,440
here, this player up here, I know it
 

3465
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,149
here, this player up here, I know it
says 79 lot. He's actually 350 lot up

3466
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:02,159
says 79 lot. He's actually 350 lot up
 

3467
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:03,750
says 79 lot. He's actually 350 lot up
here. So, this is the guy that we're

3468
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:03,760
here. So, this is the guy that we're
 

3469
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,270
here. So, this is the guy that we're
trying to see if we're going to use him.

3470
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:05,280
trying to see if we're going to use him.
 

3471
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,790
trying to see if we're going to use him.
We must get under these guys for

3472
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:06,800
We must get under these guys for
 

3473
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,470
We must get under these guys for
confirmation. These sellers are stuck

3474
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:08,480
confirmation. These sellers are stuck
 

3475
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,390
confirmation. These sellers are stuck
right here at 200. Maybe I've got to

3476
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:10,400
right here at 200. Maybe I've got to
 

3477
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,630
right here at 200. Maybe I've got to
move this up. I don't know. Right. These

3478
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:12,640
move this up. I don't know. Right. These
 

3479
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,310
move this up. I don't know. Right. These
sellers here are stuck at 200. This

3480
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:14,320
sellers here are stuck at 200. This
 

3481
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,229
sellers here are stuck at 200. This
buyer here is stuck at 250. So, a 50

3482
01:15:16,229 --> 01:15:16,239
buyer here is stuck at 250. So, a 50
 

3483
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:18,070
buyer here is stuck at 250. So, a 50
point range here being developed. Once

3484
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:18,080
point range here being developed. Once
 

3485
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,669
point range here being developed. Once
we get either side of that, we can see

3486
01:15:19,669 --> 01:15:19,679
we get either side of that, we can see
 

3487
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,550
we get either side of that, we can see
what happens.

3488
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:22,560
what happens.
 

3489
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,030
what happens.
There's that imbalance tag. Back to

3490
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:25,040
There's that imbalance tag. Back to
 

3491
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,790
There's that imbalance tag. Back to
point of control. So, imbalance just got

3492
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:26,800
point of control. So, imbalance just got
 

3493
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:34,229
point of control. So, imbalance just got
tagged. Sort of 39 into 41 there.

3494
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:34,239

 

3495
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:39,350

And we're still holding point control.

3496
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:39,360

 

3497
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,030

Uh, it's just the way it's calculated

3498
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:41,040
Uh, it's just the way it's calculated
 

3499
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,110
Uh, it's just the way it's calculated
it. I don't know why, but I know for a

3500
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:43,120
it. I don't know why, but I know for a
 

3501
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,110
it. I don't know why, but I know for a
fact there's a 300 lot up there that got

3502
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:45,120
fact there's a 300 lot up there that got
 

3503
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,630
fact there's a 300 lot up there that got
filled because I can see in my book

3504
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:46,640
filled because I can see in my book
 

3505
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:50,070
filled because I can see in my book
bookmap it's 334 lot was the buyer, but

3506
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:50,080
bookmap it's 334 lot was the buyer, but
 

3507
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,669
bookmap it's 334 lot was the buyer, but
it probably just paired off um in terms

3508
01:15:53,669 --> 01:15:53,679
it probably just paired off um in terms
 

3509
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:56,630
it probably just paired off um in terms
of size, but I know he was a 334 lot. I

3510
01:15:56,630 --> 01:15:56,640
of size, but I know he was a 334 lot. I
 

3511
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,550
of size, but I know he was a 334 lot. I
can see him.

3512
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:00,560

 

3513
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,110

Are we bullish on structure? Uh, for me,

3514
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:03,120
Are we bullish on structure? Uh, for me,
 

3515
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,510
Are we bullish on structure? Uh, for me,
no. Uh, you're sideways on structure.

3516
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:05,520
no. Uh, you're sideways on structure.
 

3517
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,709
no. Uh, you're sideways on structure.
are probably bearish overall uh because

3518
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:08,719
are probably bearish overall uh because
 

3519
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:10,390
are probably bearish overall uh because
this is your swing high. We have not

3520
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:10,400
this is your swing high. We have not
 

3521
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,149
this is your swing high. We have not
been able to get over it. It's a failed

3522
01:16:12,149 --> 01:16:12,159
been able to get over it. It's a failed
 

3523
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,070
been able to get over it. It's a failed
break. This guy here is who we're using,

3524
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:14,080
break. This guy here is who we're using,
 

3525
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,149
break. This guy here is who we're using,
right? So, if we think about structure,

3526
01:16:16,149 --> 01:16:16,159
right? So, if we think about structure,
 

3527
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:18,310
right? So, if we think about structure,
this high made this low. This is a

3528
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:18,320
this high made this low. This is a
 

3529
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,990
this high made this low. This is a
failed break right now, right? This is

3530
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:20,000
failed break right now, right? This is
 

3531
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,910
failed break right now, right? This is
where we trap the guy. So, all the time

3532
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:21,920
where we trap the guy. So, all the time
 

3533
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,750
where we trap the guy. So, all the time
we're doing this, this is possible. We

3534
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:23,760
we're doing this, this is possible. We
 

3535
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,990
we're doing this, this is possible. We
get over this structure can change, but

3536
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:26,000
get over this structure can change, but
 

3537
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,830
get over this structure can change, but
I'd be somewhat careful being bullish

3538
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:27,840
I'd be somewhat careful being bullish
 

3539
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,630
I'd be somewhat careful being bullish
today. You'd be better being bullish if

3540
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:30,640
today. You'd be better being bullish if
 

3541
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,310
today. You'd be better being bullish if
we do this and clean it out, I would

3542
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:32,320
we do this and clean it out, I would
 

3543
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,910
we do this and clean it out, I would
say. So, let's see. All right. imbalance

3544
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:33,920
say. So, let's see. All right. imbalance
 

3545
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:37,350
say. So, let's see. All right. imbalance
now fully filled into the 41s. So that

3546
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:37,360
now fully filled into the 41s. So that
 

3547
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,709
now fully filled into the 41s. So that
imbalance that you would not have seen

3548
01:16:38,709 --> 01:16:38,719
imbalance that you would not have seen
 

3549
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,070
imbalance that you would not have seen
like we just talked about, you do not

3550
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:40,080
like we just talked about, you do not
 

3551
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,430
like we just talked about, you do not
have that imbalance if you're not using

3552
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:41,440
have that imbalance if you're not using
 

3553
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,030
have that imbalance if you're not using
orderflow. We just filled that imbalance

3554
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:43,040
orderflow. We just filled that imbalance
 

3555
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,750
orderflow. We just filled that imbalance
into 41s. We still have this player call

3556
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:45,760
into 41s. We still have this player call
 

3557
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,149
into 41s. We still have this player call
at 50s right now. ES trying to find a

3558
01:16:48,149 --> 01:16:48,159
at 50s right now. ES trying to find a
 

3559
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:52,550
at 50s right now. ES trying to find a
bid off its 5day moving average.

3560
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:52,560
bid off its 5day moving average.
 

3561
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,870
bid off its 5day moving average.
Still no entry.

3562
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:54,880
Still no entry.
 

3563
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,149
Still no entry.
Here's the retest towards the 50s. If

3564
01:16:58,149 --> 01:16:58,159
Here's the retest towards the 50s. If
 

3565
01:16:58,159 --> 01:16:59,750
Here's the retest towards the 50s. If
they let him out, we can squeeze. I'm

3566
01:16:59,750 --> 01:16:59,760
they let him out, we can squeeze. I'm
 

3567
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,270
they let him out, we can squeeze. I'm
not going to play the long. There's

3568
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:01,280
not going to play the long. There's
 

3569
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,630
not going to play the long. There's
still no short cuz we're not under the

3570
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:02,640
still no short cuz we're not under the
 

3571
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,350
still no short cuz we're not under the
200s.

3572
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:05,360
200s.
 

3573
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:31,510
200s.
Still not letting him out of 50s.

3574
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:31,520

 

3575
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,430

3588
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:52,640

 

3589
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:58,310

Okay, back to the 20s. Back to Vpock.

3590
01:17:58,310 --> 01:17:58,320

 

3591
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:06,310

Why is it changed my VOT color as well?

3592
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:06,320

 

3593
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:19,110

Lipping annoying, mate.

3594
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:19,120

 

3595
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,790

I have to tell Trading View to remember

3596
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:20,800
I have to tell Trading View to remember
 

3597
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:24,070
I have to tell Trading View to remember
this chart. I'm worried it's gonna skip

3598
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:24,080
this chart. I'm worried it's gonna skip
 

3599
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:30,229
this chart. I'm worried it's gonna skip
it again. There we go.

3600
01:18:30,229 --> 01:18:30,239

 

3601
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,550

Uh it's like 399 or 499 for the

3602
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:32,560
Uh it's like 399 or 499 for the
 

3603
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,990
Uh it's like 399 or 499 for the
indicators on my website. Okay, 50 is

3604
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:36,000
indicators on my website. Okay, 50 is
 

3605
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,310
indicators on my website. Okay, 50 is
still trapped right now and we've got

3606
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:38,320
still trapped right now and we've got
 

3607
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,990
still trapped right now and we've got
some buy side imbalances now stepping

3608
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:40,000
some buy side imbalances now stepping
 

3609
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,110
some buy side imbalances now stepping
in. All right, so in this current

3610
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:41,120
in. All right, so in this current
 

3611
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,229
in. All right, so in this current
candle, they're getting quite aggressive

3612
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:42,239
candle, they're getting quite aggressive
 

3613
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:43,350
candle, they're getting quite aggressive
with the buys. They're trying to force

3614
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:43,360
with the buys. They're trying to force
 

3615
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:48,950
with the buys. They're trying to force
it up. So being very aggressive

3616
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:48,960

 

3617
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,709

back towards the 50s. We're testing this

3618
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:50,719
back towards the 50s. We're testing this
 

3619
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:53,189
back towards the 50s. We're testing this
guy at 50. Remember, if we let him out,

3620
01:18:53,189 --> 01:18:53,199
guy at 50. Remember, if we let him out,
 

3621
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:54,870
guy at 50. Remember, if we let him out,
there is a squeeze up to 80. I'm not

3622
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:54,880
there is a squeeze up to 80. I'm not
 

3623
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,870
there is a squeeze up to 80. I'm not
going to trade it. There's through the

3624
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:56,880
going to trade it. There's through the
 

3625
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,630
going to trade it. There's through the
50. So, he's potentially getting let out

3626
01:18:58,630 --> 01:18:58,640
50. So, he's potentially getting let out
 

3627
01:18:58,640 --> 01:18:59,990
50. So, he's potentially getting let out
unless they're going to trap more guys

3628
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:00,000
unless they're going to trap more guys
 

3629
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:08,149
unless they're going to trap more guys
here.

3630
01:19:08,149 --> 01:19:08,159

 

3631
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:09,990

Still stuck at 50. So, this guy's still

3632
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:10,000
Still stuck at 50. So, this guy's still
 

3633
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:22,390
Still stuck at 50. So, this guy's still
stuck.

3634
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:22,400

 

3635

Market slowing down here. That D 50

3636
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:25,280
Market slowing down here. That D 50
 

3637
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,910
Market slowing down here. That D 50
still caught.

3638
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:27,920
still caught.
 

3639
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:32,070
still caught.
Still caught

3640
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:32,080

 

3641
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:35,030

the technically the the delta on that is

3642
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:35,040
the technically the the delta on that is
 

3643
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,430
the technically the the delta on that is
118. But he was a big lot buyer. He was

3644
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:37,440
118. But he was a big lot buyer. He was
 

3645
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,830
118. But he was a big lot buyer. He was
a thill caught. He's still caught there.

3646
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:39,840
a thill caught. He's still caught there.
 

3647

Back to Vpo again. All right. So back to

3648
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:41,920
Back to Vpo again. All right. So back to
 

3649
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,070
Back to Vpo again. All right. So back to
23s again. So 50s to 20s is the

3650
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:44,080
23s again. So 50s to 20s is the
 

3651
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,310
23s again. So 50s to 20s is the
rotation. Under 200s is the

3652
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:46,320
rotation. Under 200s is the
 

3653
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,950
rotation. Under 200s is the
continuation. I would say

3654
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:48,960
continuation. I would say
 

3655
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,390
continuation. I would say
it's tempting here because he is

3656
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:50,400
it's tempting here because he is
 

3657
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,910
it's tempting here because he is
definitely caught up there. But we keep

3658
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:51,920
definitely caught up there. But we keep
 

3659
01:19:51,920 --> 01:20:04,950
definitely caught up there. But we keep
holding this BPO here.

3660
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:04,960

 

3661
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,110

Repo again. Do we let go of this and go

3662
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:07,120
Repo again. Do we let go of this and go
 

3663
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:10,550
Repo again. Do we let go of this and go
200s now? Is what I'm wondering.

3664
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:10,560
200s now? Is what I'm wondering.
 

3665
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,310
200s now? Is what I'm wondering.

01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,910
we're just stuck here. We got to get
under this and then start rejecting.

3680

down here. I think we're going to go
 

3687
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,910
down here. I think we're going to go
200s and then if we get under, we can

3688
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:41,920
200s and then if we get under, we can
 

3689
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,149
200s and then if we get under, we can
have some fun. Here we go. Is the move

3690
01:20:44,149 --> 01:20:44,159
have some fun. Here we go. Is the move

we want to stay heavy versus 85 now.
Ideally, this is the exact trade we just

talked about. The guy at 50 became the
 

3737
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,350

liquidity for us. We retested him at 50.

3738
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:37,360
liquidity for us. We retested him at 50.

We broke under 200. And now we're gonna

01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:39,520
We broke under 200. And now we're gonna
 

3741
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,950
We broke under 200. And now we're gonna
see if we can stay heavy for a new low

3742
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:40,960
see if we can stay heavy for a new low
 

3743
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:49,590
see if we can stay heavy for a new low
of day and get down into 140s.

3744
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:49,600

 

3745

3751
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:55,990
money. Comfortably in the money, these
sellers now. We should break lower.

3752
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:56,000
sellers now. We should break lower.
 

3753
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,830
sellers now. We should break lower.
There's no reason really for us to not

There's no reason really for us to not
 

3755
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,590
There's no reason really for us to not
break lower. ES just made a new low of

break lower. ES just made a new low of
 

3757
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,189
break lower. ES just made a new low of
day. Just be aware of that. ES has just

01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:08,790
closed its gap and made a new low of

3762
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:08,800

 

3763
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,950

Where are we at the cues? Coming into

3764
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:10,960
Where are we at the cues? Coming into
 

3765
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,709
Where are we at the cues? Coming into
the 10s. Maybe we need 200 to stay heavy

3766
01:22:12,709 --> 01:22:12,719
the 10s. Maybe we need 200 to stay heavy
 

3767
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,149
the 10s. Maybe we need 200 to stay heavy
here or I'll cut. I will not let a

3768
01:22:14,149 --> 01:22:14,159
here or I'll cut. I will not let a
 

3769
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:16,629
here or I'll cut. I will not let a
squeeze back over 200 happen. Did cover

3770
01:22:16,629 --> 01:22:16,639
squeeze back over 200 happen. Did cover
 

3771
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:19,430
squeeze back over 200 happen. Did cover
some into 85s like I talked about.

3772
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:19,440

01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,830
those 45s. Get me those 45s.
Get me those 45s and then let's tank.

3922
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:37,840
Get me those 45s and then let's tank.
 

3923
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,830
Get me those 45s and then let's tank.
Let's go. Watching ES very closely. It's

3924
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:39,840
Let's go. Watching ES very closely. It's
 

3925
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,229
Let's go. Watching ES very closely. It's
coming into its 20day SMA. Okay. Just be

3926
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:42,239
coming into its 20day SMA. Okay. Just be
 

3927
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:44,550
coming into its 20day SMA. Okay. Just be
careful there. We know that can be a bid

3928
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:44,560
careful there. We know that can be a bid
 

3929
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,790
careful there. We know that can be a bid
opportunity.

3930
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:46,800
opportunity.
 

3931
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,870
opportunity.
Let's go. Let's go. We're almost there,

3932
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:48,880
Let's go. Let's go. We're almost there,

01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:50,960
folks. We are almost [\h__\h] there for
 

3935
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,470
folks. We are almost [\h__\h] there for
the next TP. We should probably draw

3936
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:52,480
the next TP. We should probably draw
 

3937
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:57,189
the next TP. We should probably draw
this out, shouldn't we?

3938
01:25:57,189 --> 01:25:57,199

 

3939
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:59,510

3941
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,709
right here. 200's reject. I was in a
little bit earlier than that. I did tell

3942
01:26:00,709 --> 01:26:00,719
little bit earlier than that. I did tell
 

3943
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:03,030
little bit earlier than that. I did tell
you. Peace out into here. And we are

3947
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,310
going to look now to see if we can get
this. But we are peace out into here.

Okay. Be peace out into here. Here we

Here come the aggressive sellers.

3954

3955
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,950

Maybe Peter. Yeah, maybe. I mean, if we

3956
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:16,960
Maybe Peter. Yeah, maybe. I mean, if we
 

3957
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:20,790
Maybe Peter. Yeah, maybe. I mean, if we
get lucky, we will get those uh 24,800s

3958
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:20,800
get lucky, we will get those uh 24,800s
 

3959
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,390
get lucky, we will get those uh 24,800s
that we were looking for yesterday. It's

3960
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:22,400
that we were looking for yesterday. It's
 

3961
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,310
that we were looking for yesterday. It's
possible. All right. It's possible we

3962
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:24,320
possible. All right. It's possible we
 

3963
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,669
possible. All right. It's possible we
get this. It is possible. We're not

3964
01:26:25,669 --> 01:26:25,679
get this. It is possible. We're not
 

3965
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:27,669
get this. It is possible. We're not
going to rule it out. We want this

3966
01:26:27,669 --> 01:26:27,679
going to rule it out. We want this
 

3967
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:29,270
going to rule it out. We want this
ideally. If if you get this, there's

3968
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:29,280
ideally. If if you get this, there's
 

3969
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,110
ideally. If if you get this, there's
going to be 400 points, right? But we're

3970
01:26:31,110 --> 01:26:31,120
going to be 400 points, right? But we're
 

3971
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,229
going to be 400 points, right? But we're
looking for this now. This is the next

3972
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:32,239
looking for this now. This is the next
 

3973
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:33,590
looking for this now. This is the next
point we're looking for. So, we're TP1

3974
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:33,600
point we're looking for. So, we're TP1
 

3975
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,709
point we're looking for. So, we're TP1
in here. We will get uh 135 points down

3976
01:26:36,709 --> 01:26:36,719
in here. We will get uh 135 points down
 

3977
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:38,709
in here. We will get uh 135 points down
to here. All right. And we'll see if we

3978
01:26:38,709 --> 01:26:38,719
to here. All right. And we'll see if we
 

3979
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:41,270
to here. All right. And we'll see if we
let go of that.

3980
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:41,280
let go of that.
 

3981
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,669
let go of that.
We are going to respect uh 110s again.

3982
01:26:43,669 --> 01:26:43,679
We are going to respect uh 110s again.
 

3983
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:45,830
We are going to respect uh 110s again.
Okay. Uh these levels that we're at, we

3984
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:45,840
Okay. Uh these levels that we're at, we
 

3985
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,910
Okay. Uh these levels that we're at, we
must respect this. This is I'll show you

3986
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:47,920
must respect this. This is I'll show you

something, do something. All you've got
to do is wait. Like, you have to learn

4028
01:27:36,149 --> 01:27:36,159
to do is wait. Like, you have to learn
 

4029
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,950
to do is wait. Like, you have to learn
to wait for the setup. You have to

4030
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:38,960
to wait for the setup. You have to
 

4031
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,669
to wait for the setup. You have to
learn. All right? The whole principle of

4032
01:27:41,669 --> 01:27:41,679
learn. All right? The whole principle of
 

4033
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:43,430
learn. All right? The whole principle of
the market, this is not me preaching.

4034
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:43,440
the market, this is not me preaching.
 

4035
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:46,070
the market, this is not me preaching.
I'm trying to help you. All right? We

4036
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:46,080
I'm trying to help you. All right? We
 

4037
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,629
I'm trying to help you. All right? We
will get good moves when we build

4038
01:27:48,629 --> 01:27:48,639
will get good moves when we build
 

4039
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:51,590
will get good moves when we build
liquidity. When we build liquidity, when

4040
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:51,600
liquidity. When we build liquidity, when
 

4041
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,070
liquidity. When we build liquidity, when
we build liquidity, especially when we

4042
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:54,080
we build liquidity, especially when we
 

4043
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,470
we build liquidity, especially when we
do a failed breakout with someone

4044
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:56,480
do a failed breakout with someone
 

4045
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:59,270
do a failed breakout with someone
trapped, that's when we get good moves.

4046
01:27:59,270 --> 01:27:59,280
trapped, that's when we get good moves.
 

4047
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:02,229
trapped, that's when we get good moves.
We do not get good moves when we are

4048
01:28:02,229 --> 01:28:02,239
We do not get good moves when we are
 

4049
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:04,629
We do not get good moves when we are
building liquidity. We get moves when we

4050
01:28:04,629 --> 01:28:04,639
building liquidity. We get moves when we
 

4051
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:06,790
building liquidity. We get moves when we
use their liquidity. When we use their

4052
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:06,800
use their liquidity. When we use their
 

4053
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,790
use their liquidity. When we use their
liquidity, when we use their liquidity.

4054
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:08,800
liquidity, when we use their liquidity.
 

4055
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,550
liquidity, when we use their liquidity.
All right? That is the same on higher

4056
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:10,560
All right? That is the same on higher
 

4057
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,950
All right? That is the same on higher
time frame. It is the same principle. Do

4058
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:12,960
time frame. It is the same principle. Do
 

4059
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,350
time frame. It is the same principle. Do
not get caught into their [\h__\h] of

4060
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:15,360
not get caught into their [\h__\h] of
 

4061
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,430
not get caught into their [\h__\h] of
playing in here. Or look, if you're a

4062
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:17,440
playing in here. Or look, if you're a
 

4063
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:18,629
playing in here. Or look, if you're a
range trader and you want to do that, do

4064
01:28:18,629 --> 01:28:18,639
range trader and you want to do that, do
 

4065
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:20,310
range trader and you want to do that, do
what the bloody hell you want. But for

4066
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:20,320
what the bloody hell you want. But for
 

4067
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:23,350
what the bloody hell you want. But for
me, I would much rather be in this than

4068
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:23,360
me, I would much rather be in this than
 

4069
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,350
me, I would much rather be in this than

more about who's stuck where, right? So,

4118
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:20,480
more about who's stuck where, right? So,
 

4119
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,870
more about who's stuck where, right? So,
all the time we're under 21s, there's a

4120
01:29:22,870 --> 01:29:22,880
all the time we're under 21s, there's a
 

4121
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,790
all the time we're under 21s, there's a
seller, right? So, why am I comfortable

4122
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:24,800
seller, right? So, why am I comfortable
 

4123
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,590
seller, right? So, why am I comfortable

4125
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,910
right now? There's a seller here at the
21s. If we swipe through 21s, we have a

4126
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:29,920
21s. If we swipe through 21s, we have a
 

4127
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,750
21s. If we swipe through 21s, we have a
little bit of buyers and an imbalance

4128
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:31,760
little bit of buyers and an imbalance
 

4129
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,590
little bit of buyers and an imbalance
here. Again, an imbalance you might not

4130
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:33,600
here. Again, an imbalance you might not
 

4131
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,310
here. Again, an imbalance you might not
be able to see, but imbalance here. But

4132
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:36,320
be able to see, but imbalance here. But
 

4133
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:37,350
be able to see, but imbalance here. But
all the time we're under this. Look at

4134
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:37,360
all the time we're under this. Look at
 

4135
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:38,550
all the time we're under this. Look at
the aggressive sellers. They keep

4136
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:38,560
the aggressive sellers. They keep
 

4137
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,830
the aggressive sellers. They keep
stepping in. We're going to get this

4138
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:39,840
stepping in. We're going to get this
 

4139
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,950
stepping in. We're going to get this
fill, guys. We're going to keep

4142
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:42,480
stepping. Look at the aggressive sellers
 

4143
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,750
stepping. Look at the aggressive sellers
stepping in. And this is why I'm

4144
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:43,760
stepping in. And this is why I'm
 

4145
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,470
stepping in. And this is why I'm
comfortable because the tape is heavy.

4146
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:46,480
comfortable because the tape is heavy.
 

4147
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,270
comfortable because the tape is heavy.

4151
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,950
at the lows 150 into 100. So you could
cover some into the whole number here.

01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:52,960
cover some into the whole number here.

01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:49,360

 

4361
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:52,310

We're looking for 60s.

4362
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:52,320
We're looking for 60s.
 

4363
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,550
We're looking for 60s.
Come on, stay heavy. They can afford a

4364
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:54,560
Come on, stay heavy. They can afford a
 

4365
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,990
Come on, stay heavy. They can afford a
pop right up to 40. So, I'm not going to

4366
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:56,000
pop right up to 40. So, I'm not going to
 

4367
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,590
pop right up to 40. So, I'm not going to
let them do that. For me, it can stop me

4368
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:57,600
let them do that. For me, it can stop me
 

4369
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,110
let them do that. For me, it can stop me
out at 101's. If it's going to do it

4370
01:33:59,110 --> 01:33:59,120
out at 101's. If it's going to do it
 

4371
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,870
out at 101's. If it's going to do it
very tight to stop me, I'm out. Out on a

4372
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:00,880
very tight to stop me, I'm out. Out on a
 

4373
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:03,430
very tight to stop me, I'm out. Out on a
runner. That's fine. We tried, folks. It

4374
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:03,440
runner. That's fine. We tried, folks. It
 

4375
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,350
runner. That's fine. We tried, folks. It
was good. It was good. But there were

4376
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:05,360
was good. It was good. But there were
 

4377
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:07,110
was good. It was good. But there were
too many sellers down here. There's a

4378
01:34:07,110 --> 01:34:07,120
too many sellers down here. There's a
 

4379
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:10,950
too many sellers down here. There's a
big seller here at 115. 475 lot at 115.

4380
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:10,960
big seller here at 115. 475 lot at 115.
 

4381
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:13,189
big seller here at 115. 475 lot at 115.
I'm not going to sit through this. So,

4382
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:13,199
I'm not going to sit through this. So,
 

4383
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:14,950
I'm not going to sit through this. So,
we can wait. We can think about a

4384
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:14,960
we can wait. We can think about a
 

4385
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,350
we can wait. We can think about a
revisit up. But the reason I covered

4386
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:17,360
revisit up. But the reason I covered
 

4387
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,430
revisit up. But the reason I covered
here was that big lot down here getting

4388
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:19,440
here was that big lot down here getting
 

4389
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,750
here was that big lot down here getting
stuck. All right. This again, I can take

4390
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:21,760
stuck. All right. This again, I can take
 

4391
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,510
stuck. All right. This again, I can take
you to bookmarking

4392
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:23,520
you to bookmarking
 

4393
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:25,110
you to bookmarking
hell. If they do it now, I'll be upset.

4394
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:25,120
hell. If they do it now, I'll be upset.
 

4395
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:29,270
hell. If they do it now, I'll be upset.
But I'm going to miss my TP. Never mind.

4396
01:34:29,270 --> 01:34:29,280
But I'm going to miss my TP. Never mind.
 

4397
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,110
But I'm going to miss my TP. Never mind.
All right. So the reason I covered that

4398
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:31,120
All right. So the reason I covered that
 

4399
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,669
All right. So the reason I covered that
was just this guy here. All right. 186

4400
01:34:33,669 --> 01:34:33,679
was just this guy here. All right. 186
 

4401
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:37,350
was just this guy here. All right. 186
lot uh 87 lot 245 lot. All these sellers

4402
01:34:37,350 --> 01:34:37,360
lot uh 87 lot 245 lot. All these sellers
 

4403
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:38,870
lot uh 87 lot 245 lot. All these sellers
getting caught at these lows. We were

4404
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:38,880
getting caught at these lows. We were
 

4405
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,590
getting caught at these lows. We were
needed to see breakdown under 85. Right.

4406
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:41,600
needed to see breakdown under 85. Right.
 

4407
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,350
needed to see breakdown under 85. Right.
And they have just pulled all their bids

4408
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:43,360
And they have just pulled all their bids
 

4409
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,030
And they have just pulled all their bids
down here into 60s which is where I was

4410
01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:45,040
down here into 60s which is where I was
 

4411
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:47,030
down here into 60s which is where I was
looking to trade. So we can afford

4412
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:47,040
looking to trade. So we can afford
 

4413
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,870
looking to trade. So we can afford
relief right back up here which is why I

4414
01:34:48,870 --> 01:34:48,880
relief right back up here which is why I
 

4415
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,310
relief right back up here which is why I
do not want to sit in this and give too

4416
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:50,320
do not want to sit in this and give too
 

4417
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:53,030
do not want to sit in this and give too
much back. You guys are can hold here. I

4418
01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:53,040
much back. You guys are can hold here. I
 

4419
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:54,870
much back. You guys are can hold here. I
guess technically all the time we're

4420
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:54,880
guess technically all the time we're
 

4421
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,149
guess technically all the time we're
holding, but I just didn't want to give

4422
01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:56,159
holding, but I just didn't want to give
 

4423
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:58,629
holding, but I just didn't want to give
too much back on this spike cuz if we

4424
01:34:58,629 --> 01:34:58,639
too much back on this spike cuz if we
 

4425
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:02,390
too much back on this spike cuz if we
hold now over 85, they can revisit 122s.

4426
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:02,400
hold now over 85, they can revisit 122s.
 

4427
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,830
hold now over 85, they can revisit 122s.
If they redo that, they will probably

4428
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:03,840
If they redo that, they will probably
 

4429
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,629
If they redo that, they will probably
revisit 145s. And if they get through

4430
01:35:06,629 --> 01:35:06,639
revisit 145s. And if they get through
 

4431
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:10,149
revisit 145s. And if they get through
45s, they can revisit uh 180s. But you

4432
01:35:10,149 --> 01:35:10,159
45s, they can revisit uh 180s. But you
 

4433
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:11,830
45s, they can revisit uh 180s. But you
might you might get your move here.

4434
01:35:11,830 --> 01:35:11,840
might you might get your move here.
 

4435
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,430
might you might get your move here.
Let's see. You might get it. I'm out of

4436
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:13,440
Let's see. You might get it. I'm out of
 

4437
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,910
Let's see. You might get it. I'm out of
it though. I'm done with it.

4438
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:15,920
it though. I'm done with it.
 

4439
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,750
it though. I'm done with it.
I'm done with it. Too much selling at

4440
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:17,760
I'm done with it. Too much selling at
 

4441
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:27,910
I'm done with it. Too much selling at
the lows without moving lower for me.

4442
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:27,920

 

4443
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:29,669

All right.

4444
01:35:29,669 --> 01:35:29,679
All right.
 

4445
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:31,669
All right.
Sorry we didn't get all of it, folks. We

4446
01:35:31,669 --> 01:35:31,679
Sorry we didn't get all of it, folks. We
 

4447
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:34,709
Sorry we didn't get all of it, folks. We
uh my final cover here was uh here,

4448
01:35:34,709 --> 01:35:34,719
uh my final cover here was uh here,
 

4449
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:36,790
uh my final cover here was uh here,
wasn't it? So, we got 92 points. I mean,

4450
01:35:36,790 --> 01:35:36,800
wasn't it? So, we got 92 points. I mean,
 

4451
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,189
wasn't it? So, we got 92 points. I mean,
we if you covered the lows, you would

4452
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:39,199
we if you covered the lows, you would
 

4453
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:41,910
we if you covered the lows, you would
have got uh Oh, sorry. We got over 100

4454
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:41,920
have got uh Oh, sorry. We got over 100
 

4455
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:42,950
have got uh Oh, sorry. We got over 100
points. Well, I'm reading the wrong

4456
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:42,960
points. Well, I'm reading the wrong
 

4457
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:45,189
points. Well, I'm reading the wrong
thing. You would have got 120 points. I

4458
01:35:45,189 --> 01:35:45,199
thing. You would have got 120 points. I
 

4459
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:46,950
thing. You would have got 120 points. I
got 100 points out of that. We almost

4460
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:46,960
got 100 points out of that. We almost
 

4461
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,669
got 100 points out of that. We almost
got this move down here. We can watch

4462
01:35:49,669 --> 01:35:49,679
got this move down here. We can watch
 

4463
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:51,830
got this move down here. We can watch
for a revisit, but look how thin we are.

4464
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:51,840
for a revisit, but look how thin we are.
 

4465
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,550
for a revisit, but look how thin we are.
So, we're developing nodes here. We know

4466
01:35:54,550 --> 01:35:54,560
So, we're developing nodes here. We know
 

4467
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:55,910
So, we're developing nodes here. We know
they're starting to get some sellers

4468
01:35:55,910 --> 01:35:55,920
they're starting to get some sellers
 

4469
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:57,590
they're starting to get some sellers
caught down here, right? So, if we start

4470
01:35:57,590 --> 01:35:57,600
caught down here, right? So, if we start
 

4471
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,910
caught down here, right? So, if we start
reclaiming this, we're pretty thin up to

4472
01:35:59,910 --> 01:35:59,920
reclaiming this, we're pretty thin up to
 

4473
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,430
reclaiming this, we're pretty thin up to
here, right? You don't want to get

4474
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:01,440
here, right? You don't want to get
 

4475
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:02,709
here, right? You don't want to get
caught in this, which is why I've

4476
01:36:02,709 --> 01:36:02,719
caught in this, which is why I've
 

4477
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:04,870
caught in this, which is why I've
covered down here. It might be that they

4478
01:36:04,870 --> 01:36:04,880
covered down here. It might be that they
 

4479
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,790
covered down here. It might be that they
reflush it, but that's fine. I need to

4480
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:06,800
reflush it, but that's fine. I need to
 

4481
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,629
reflush it, but that's fine. I need to
manage my position how I'm comfortable

4482
01:36:08,629 --> 01:36:08,639
manage my position how I'm comfortable
 

4483
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:13,910

4514
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:50,400
the tape So
 

4515
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:51,830
the tape So
probably if I didn't see him, I would

4516
01:36:51,830 --> 01:36:51,840
probably if I didn't see him, I would
 

4517
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,669
probably if I didn't see him, I would
have been more willing to stay in it. So

4518
01:36:53,669 --> 01:36:53,679
have been more willing to stay in it. So
 

4519
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:55,990
have been more willing to stay in it. So
this spoofer here, this 520 lot, you can

4520
01:36:55,990 --> 01:36:56,000
this spoofer here, this 520 lot, you can
 

4521
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,550
this spoofer here, this 520 lot, you can
see he was here at 10. So once he came

4522
01:36:58,550 --> 01:36:58,560
see he was here at 10. So once he came
 

4523
01:36:58,560 --> 01:36:59,910
see he was here at 10. So once he came
on the tape, you can see no one was

4524
01:36:59,910 --> 01:36:59,920
on the tape, you can see no one was

4527
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,030
here. No one's here. No one's here. Once
we got to this point in the day, I don't

4528
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:03,040
we got to this point in the day, I don't
 

4529
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,990
we got to this point in the day, I don't
know what time this was. 10:46. We had a

4530
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:06,000
know what time this was. 10:46. We had a
 

4531
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,470
know what time this was. 10:46. We had a
400 or 500 lot come on the tape trying

4532
01:37:08,470 --> 01:37:08,480
400 or 500 lot come on the tape trying
 

4533
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,550
400 or 500 lot come on the tape trying
to trap price come up. Came up to me,

4534
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:10,560
to trap price come up. Came up to me,
 

4535
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,149
to trap price come up. Came up to me,
lifted. That made me think, no, I'm not

4536
01:37:12,149 --> 01:37:12,159
lifted. That made me think, no, I'm not
 

4537
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,229
lifted. That made me think, no, I'm not
sitting in this for sure. He's now up at

4538
01:37:14,229 --> 01:37:14,239
sitting in this for sure. He's now up at
 

4539
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:16,709
sitting in this for sure. He's now up at
520. He's trying to get them to lift

4540
01:37:16,709 --> 01:37:16,719
520. He's trying to get them to lift
 

4541
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:18,470
520. He's trying to get them to lift
price higher, which is not what I wanted

4542
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:18,480
price higher, which is not what I wanted
 

4543
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:21,109
price higher, which is not what I wanted
to see. If you get a rebreown under 85s

4544
01:37:21,109 --> 01:37:21,119
to see. If you get a rebreown under 85s
 

4545
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:22,950
to see. If you get a rebreown under 85s
here, you might get the full TP. Maybe

4546
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:22,960
here, you might get the full TP. Maybe
 

4547
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:24,709
here, you might get the full TP. Maybe
some of you are still in it. I'm out of

4548
01:37:24,709 --> 01:37:24,719
some of you are still in it. I'm out of
 

4549
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:29,510
some of you are still in it. I'm out of
it. Like I said, I'm done.

4550
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:29,520

 

4551
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:30,950

Does the course teach you the gray

4552
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:30,960
Does the course teach you the gray
 

4553
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,950
Does the course teach you the gray

4556
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:34,560
It does. The orderflow course teaches
 

4557
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:38,870
It does. The orderflow course teaches
you.

4558
01:37:38,870 --> 01:37:38,880

 

4559
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,310

You don't see the bookmap. It's right

4560
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:40,320
You don't see the bookmap. It's right
 

4561
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:41,510
You don't see the bookmap. It's right
above me. Did I have you on the wrong

4562
01:37:41,510 --> 01:37:41,520
above me. Did I have you on the wrong
 

4563
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,350
above me. Did I have you on the wrong
screen? Sorry. This one here. You see it

4564
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:43,360
screen? Sorry. This one here. You see it
 

4565
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,830
screen? Sorry. This one here. You see it
now? this guy here. So, he was on the

4566
01:37:45,830 --> 01:37:45,840
now? this guy here. So, he was on the
 

4567
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,270
now? this guy here. So, he was on the
tape here for a second. Once we came

4568
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:47,280
tape here for a second. Once we came
 

4569
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,590
tape here for a second. Once we came
into he lifted and he's added 500 lot

4570
01:37:49,590 --> 01:37:49,600
into he lifted and he's added 500 lot
 

4571
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,109
into he lifted and he's added 500 lot
higher, right? So, he's trying to

4572
01:37:51,109 --> 01:37:51,119
higher, right? So, he's trying to
 

4573
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:52,950
higher, right? So, he's trying to
attract price higher right now. And he

4574
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:52,960
attract price higher right now. And he
 

4575
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:54,709
attract price higher right now. And he
is a spoofer because when he was here,

4576
01:37:54,709 --> 01:37:54,719
is a spoofer because when he was here,
 

4577
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:56,709
is a spoofer because when he was here,
he lifted and went back on the book with

4578
01:37:56,709 --> 01:37:56,719
he lifted and went back on the book with
 

4579
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:58,629
he lifted and went back on the book with
the same size. So, he's on the book for

4580
01:37:58,629 --> 01:37:58,639
the same size. So, he's on the book for
 

4581
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:01,430
the same size. So, he's on the book for
I don't know a second maybe. Let's see

4582
01:38:01,430 --> 01:38:01,440
I don't know a second maybe. Let's see
 

4583
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:02,790
I don't know a second maybe. Let's see
when he came on the book. He came on the

4584
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:02,800
when he came on the book. He came on the
 

4585
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:07,189
when he came on the book. He came on the
book at 10:45 and 46 seconds.

4586
01:38:07,189 --> 01:38:07,199
book at 10:45 and 46 seconds.
 

4587
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:10,229
book at 10:45 and 46 seconds.
He was on the book for a second. Just a

4588
01:38:10,229 --> 01:38:10,239
He was on the book for a second. Just a
 

4589
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:12,870
He was on the book for a second. Just a
literal ten a tenth of a second. A

4590
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:12,880
literal ten a tenth of a second. A
 

4591
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,149
literal ten a tenth of a second. A
second. And then as soon as he came on,

4592
01:38:14,149 --> 01:38:14,159
second. And then as soon as he came on,
 

4593
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:16,310
second. And then as soon as he came on,
he lifted. Still think there's a chance

4594
01:38:16,310 --> 01:38:16,320
he lifted. Still think there's a chance
 

4595
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,070
he lifted. Still think there's a chance
to trade lower, but I can't get an entry

4596
01:38:18,070 --> 01:38:18,080
to trade lower, but I can't get an entry
 

4597
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:20,229
to trade lower, but I can't get an entry
here. We are trading far too low. So now

4598
01:38:20,229 --> 01:38:20,239
here. We are trading far too low. So now
 

4599
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:22,149
here. We are trading far too low. So now
I've lost location. Right, we have

4600
01:38:22,149 --> 01:38:22,159
I've lost location. Right, we have
 

4601
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:29,350
I've lost location. Right, we have
momentum. I've lost location.

4602
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:29,360

4624
01:38:54,390 --> 01:38:54,400
it is. I mean, you can argue he's a
 

4625
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:59,830
it is. I mean, you can argue he's a
liquidity provider.

4626
01:38:59,830 --> 01:38:59,840

 

4627
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,510

Spoofing never gets prosecuted, though.

4628
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:01,520
Spoofing never gets prosecuted, though.
 

4629

01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:02,880
They It's very hard for them to track
 

4631
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,510
They It's very hard for them to track
it. How can you track it? If you put an

order in and pull it off, how can you

4634
01:39:06,870 --> 01:39:06,880
order in and pull it off, how can you
 

4635
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,390
order in and pull it off, how can you
not? You could just say, "Oh, well, I

not? You could just say, "Oh, well, I
 

4637

can get five 600% gainers in swings in a
 

4723
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:58,149
can get five 600% gainers in swings in a
matter of months. We had the last big

4728
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:02,320
don't have any big movers this year
 

4729
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,070
don't have any big movers this year
because at the moment I'm positioned

4730
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:04,080
because at the moment I'm positioned
 

4731
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:05,990
because at the moment I'm positioned
mainly in mega cap. I'm mainly looking

4732
01:41:05,990 --> 01:41:06,000
mainly in mega cap. I'm mainly looking
 

4733
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,229
mainly in mega cap. I'm mainly looking
for this market to pull back

4734
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:08,239
for this market to pull back
 

4735
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:09,750
for this market to pull back
aggressively

4736
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:09,760
aggressively
 

4737
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,590
aggressively
for me to position in. So we made 20% uh

4738
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:13,600
for me to position in. So we made 20% uh
 

4739
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,550
for me to position in. So we made 20% uh
on Robin Hood from last Thursday to

4740
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:16,560
on Robin Hood from last Thursday to
 

4741

on Robin Hood from last Thursday to
before earnings. I'm just holding a

01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:18,320
before earnings. I'm just holding a
 

4743
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,070
before earnings. I'm just holding a
small piece of that left because I still

4744
01:41:20,070 --> 01:41:20,080
small piece of that left because I still
 

4745
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:22,790
small piece of that left because I still
think it's a bit of a pig, but there's a

4746
01:41:22,790 --> 01:41:22,800
think it's a bit of a pig, but there's a
 

4747
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,350
think it's a bit of a pig, but there's a
chance we're due uh a little bit more.

4748
01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:25,360
chance we're due uh a little bit more.
 

4749
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:26,709
chance we're due uh a little bit more.

4817
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:51,990
green line. So I'll be taking a good
chunk out here now folks. God dang it.

4818
01:42:51,990 --> 01:42:52,000

chunk out here now folks. God dang it.
Had to stop me out before doing it. It

4820
01:42:53,669 --> 01:42:53,679
Had to stop me out before doing it. It
 

4821
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:55,590
Had to stop me out before doing it. It
was that spoofer on the tape who got me

4822
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:55,600
was that spoofer on the tape who got me
 

4823
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:56,950
was that spoofer on the tape who got me
stopped. If he wasn't there, we would

4824
01:42:56,950 --> 01:42:56,960
stopped. If he wasn't there, we would
 

4825
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:59,270
stopped. If he wasn't there, we would
have done it in one go. What a pain in

4826
01:42:59,270 --> 01:42:59,280
have done it in one go. What a pain in
 

4827
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:01,669
have done it in one go. What a pain in
the butt. All right, there's your TP.

4828
01:43:01,669 --> 01:43:01,679
the butt. All right, there's your TP.

01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:05,750
the butt. All right, there's your TP.
So, there's your 140 pointer. Uh, what

4830
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:05,760
So, there's your 140 pointer. Uh, what
 

4831
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:09,350
So, there's your 140 pointer. Uh, what
is this gray box from?

4832
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:09,360
is this gray box from?
 

4833
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:12,149
is this gray box from?
Oh, this is a an old node. Okay, so

4834
01:43:12,149 --> 01:43:12,159
Oh, this is a an old node. Okay, so
 

4835
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:13,510
Oh, this is a an old node. Okay, so
there is some liquidity here previous

4836
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:13,520
there is some liquidity here previous
 

4837
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,189
there is some liquidity here previous
week under this. I wouldn't cover some

4838
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:15,199
week under this. I wouldn't cover some
 

4839
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:16,390
week under this. I wouldn't cover some
here. If you've covered here, don't

4840
01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:16,400
here. If you've covered here, don't
 

4841
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,709
here. If you've covered here, don't
cover more here. Don't bother. Wait and

4842
01:43:18,709 --> 01:43:18,719
cover more here. Don't bother. Wait and
 

4843
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:20,629
cover more here. Don't bother. Wait and
see. Now,

4844
01:43:20,629 --> 01:43:20,639
see. Now,
 

4845
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:23,510
see. Now,
next low I'd be looking for is here.

4846
01:43:23,510 --> 01:43:23,520
next low I'd be looking for is here.
 

4847
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:25,750
next low I'd be looking for is here.
All right. So, I'd be covering 80 90% of

4848
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:25,760
All right. So, I'd be covering 80 90% of
 

4849
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:27,270
All right. So, I'd be covering 80 90% of
the position and just hold it now. See

4850
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:27,280
the position and just hold it now. See
 

4851
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:29,750
the position and just hold it now. See
if you can get this blue box or ideally

4852
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:29,760
if you can get this blue box or ideally
 

4853
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:31,750
if you can get this blue box or ideally
you might get a 400 pointer down into

4854
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:31,760
you might get a 400 pointer down into
 

4855
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:38,790
you might get a 400 pointer down into
this. 800 would be your your best cover.

4856
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:38,800

 

4857
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,470

What do I think about CPI tomorrow? I

4858
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:40,480
What do I think about CPI tomorrow? I
 

4859
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:41,830
What do I think about CPI tomorrow? I
have no idea. If they cook the books,

4860
01:43:41,830 --> 01:43:41,840
have no idea. If they cook the books,
 

4861
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,350
have no idea. If they cook the books,
who [\h__\h] knows? Who cares? Doesn't

4862
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:43,360
who [\h__\h] knows? Who cares? Doesn't
 

4863
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,430
who [\h__\h] knows? Who cares? Doesn't
matter if uh the prints good or bad.

4864
01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:45,440
matter if uh the prints good or bad.
 

4865
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:46,390
matter if uh the prints good or bad.
They're going to do whatever they want

4866
01:43:46,390 --> 01:43:46,400
They're going to do whatever they want
 

4867
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:47,830
They're going to do whatever they want
with it. I really don't care what they

4868
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:47,840
with it. I really don't care what they
 

4869
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,830
with it. I really don't care what they
do with the prints, but uh it it's not

4870
01:43:49,830 --> 01:43:49,840
do with the prints, but uh it it's not
 

4871
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:52,070
do with the prints, but uh it it's not
looking good. But if you look at like

4872
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:52,080
looking good. But if you look at like
 

4873
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:53,669
looking good. But if you look at like
what's going on with the treasuries and

4874
01:43:53,669 --> 01:43:53,679
what's going on with the treasuries and
 

4875
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:55,750
what's going on with the treasuries and
bonds overnight yesterday, it really is

4876
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:55,760
bonds overnight yesterday, it really is
 

4877
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,430
bonds overnight yesterday, it really is
not looking good out there for this

4878
01:43:57,430 --> 01:43:57,440
not looking good out there for this
 

4879
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,590
not looking good out there for this
market. It could get very dangerous very

4880
01:43:59,590 --> 01:43:59,600
market. It could get very dangerous very
 

4881
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,950
market. It could get very dangerous very
quickly. I would have preferred if this

4882
01:44:02,950 --> 01:44:02,960
quickly. I would have preferred if this
 

4883
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:04,470
quickly. I would have preferred if this
market had done the fail breakout like

4884
01:44:04,470 --> 01:44:04,480
market had done the fail breakout like
 

4885
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:07,830
market had done the fail breakout like
we talked about. So for bigger moves

4886
01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:07,840
we talked about. So for bigger moves
 

4887
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:10,310
we talked about. So for bigger moves
this week, what I really wanted to see

4888
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:10,320
this week, what I really wanted to see
 

4889
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:12,550
this week, what I really wanted to see
was this move into here and a big sell

4890
01:44:12,550 --> 01:44:12,560
was this move into here and a big sell
 

4891
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,390
was this move into here and a big sell
and cover some here and see if we use

4892
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:14,400
and cover some here and see if we use
 

4893
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,390
and cover some here and see if we use
that and then we come lower. That would

4894
01:44:16,390 --> 01:44:16,400
that and then we come lower. That would
 

4895
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:17,750
that and then we come lower. That would
be really nice because we've now got

4896
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:17,760
be really nice because we've now got
 

4897
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,189
be really nice because we've now got
room on the daily Ballinger bands

4898
01:44:19,189 --> 01:44:19,199
room on the daily Ballinger bands
 

4899
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:21,270
room on the daily Ballinger bands
whereas last week we didn't have room.

4900
01:44:21,270 --> 01:44:21,280
whereas last week we didn't have room.
 

4901
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:22,709
whereas last week we didn't have room.
Right? So if we think about how we trade

4902
01:44:22,709 --> 01:44:22,719
Right? So if we think about how we trade
 

4903
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:25,510
Right? So if we think about how we trade
in flow zone now the Ballinger bands are

4904
01:44:25,510 --> 01:44:25,520
in flow zone now the Ballinger bands are
 

4905
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:27,030
in flow zone now the Ballinger bands are
expanding

4906
01:44:27,030 --> 01:44:27,040
expanding
 

4907
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:29,830
expanding
20-day 50-day cross. We're looking for

4908
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:29,840
20-day 50-day cross. We're looking for
 

4909
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,669
20-day 50-day cross. We're looking for
5day to come back down again. Ballinger

4910
01:44:31,669 --> 01:44:31,679
5day to come back down again. Ballinger
 

4911
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:33,590
5day to come back down again. Ballinger
bands to come back down and you know

4912
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:33,600
bands to come back down and you know
 

4913
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,709
bands to come back down and you know
traps in here to resell down to here and

4914
01:44:36,709 --> 01:44:36,719
traps in here to resell down to here and
 

4915
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:39,109
traps in here to resell down to here and
maybe start doing one of these for a bit

4916
01:44:39,109 --> 01:44:39,119
maybe start doing one of these for a bit
 

4917
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:44,470
maybe start doing one of these for a bit
until maybe the Q QQ hits 200 day. We we

4918
01:44:44,470 --> 01:44:44,480
until maybe the Q QQ hits 200 day. We we
 

4919
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:45,910
until maybe the Q QQ hits 200 day. We we
haven't undercut this yet. I'm still

4920
01:44:45,910 --> 01:44:45,920
haven't undercut this yet. I'm still
 

4921
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:47,830
haven't undercut this yet. I'm still
waiting to see an undercut there. A run

4922
01:44:47,830 --> 01:44:47,840
waiting to see an undercut there. A run
 

4923
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,510
waiting to see an undercut there. A run
of liquidity on this for a drop down

4924
01:44:49,510 --> 01:44:49,520
of liquidity on this for a drop down
 

4925
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:53,030
of liquidity on this for a drop down
into here

4926
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:53,040

 

4927
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,550

would be really good. All right. And if

4928
01:44:54,550 --> 01:44:54,560
would be really good. All right. And if
 

4929
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:56,149
would be really good. All right. And if
you like that's way too much. It's

4930
01:44:56,149 --> 01:44:56,159
you like that's way too much. It's
 

4931
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:58,149
you like that's way too much. It's
really not off the highs. That's really

4932
01:44:58,149 --> 01:44:58,159
really not off the highs. That's really
 

4933
01:44:58,159 --> 01:45:01,669
really not off the highs. That's really
not. It's only 12%. It's fine. It's

4934
01:45:01,669 --> 01:45:01,679
not. It's only 12%. It's fine. It's
 

4935
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:03,350
not. It's only 12%. It's fine. It's
absolutely fine. This market might do a

4936
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:03,360
absolutely fine. This market might do a
 

4937
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:04,950
absolutely fine. This market might do a
lot more than that if it starts to get

4938
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:04,960
lot more than that if it starts to get
 

4939
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:07,430
lot more than that if it starts to get
ugly. But that's what I'd like to do.

4940
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:07,440
ugly. But that's what I'd like to do.
 

4941
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,750
ugly. But that's what I'd like to do.
And um I've already positioned, if you

4942
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:09,760
And um I've already positioned, if you
 

4943
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:11,910
And um I've already positioned, if you
think about the stocks that I'm long in,

4944
01:45:11,910 --> 01:45:11,920
think about the stocks that I'm long in,
 

4945
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:14,149
think about the stocks that I'm long in,
right? I'm long in tech that's down here

4946
01:45:14,149 --> 01:45:14,159
right? I'm long in tech that's down here
 

4947
01:45:14,159 --> 01:45:16,629
right? I'm long in tech that's down here
right now, right? It's already puked all

4948
01:45:16,629 --> 01:45:16,639
right now, right? It's already puked all
 

4949
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:19,270
right now, right? It's already puked all
the way down there.

4950
01:45:19,270 --> 01:45:19,280
the way down there.
 

4951
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,709
the way down there.

01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:44,000

 

5107
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,950

Right. We have an imbalance

5108
01:48:48,950 --> 01:48:48,960

 

5109
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:53,510

on the cell here. See this imbalance?

5110
01:48:53,510 --> 01:48:53,520
on the cell here. See this imbalance?
 

5111
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:56,390
on the cell here. See this imbalance?
Right. We go sideways here for a long

5112
01:48:56,390 --> 01:48:56,400
Right. We go sideways here for a long
 

5113
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:59,510
Right. We go sideways here for a long
time.

5114
01:48:59,510 --> 01:48:59,520

 

5115
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,950

We failed to break higher. We sell. This

5116
01:49:02,950 --> 01:49:02,960
We failed to break higher. We sell. This
 

5117
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:04,950
We failed to break higher. We sell. This
is the first point of the sell. We sell

5118
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:04,960
is the first point of the sell. We sell
 

5119
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:09,270
is the first point of the sell. We sell
down the next part of the trade here.

5120
01:49:09,270 --> 01:49:09,280
down the next part of the trade here.
 

5121
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:10,629
down the next part of the trade here.
Let me just make sure I'm getting my

5122
01:49:10,629 --> 01:49:10,639
Let me just make sure I'm getting my
 

5123
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:12,390
Let me just make sure I'm getting my
timings right here. What time is this?

5124
01:49:12,390 --> 01:49:12,400
timings right here. What time is this?
 

5125
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,310
timings right here. What time is this?
10:30s. Yes, that was what we looked

5126
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:14,320
10:30s. Yes, that was what we looked
 

5127
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:18,149
10:30s. Yes, that was what we looked
for. So 10:30s. Yeah, this is the guy.

for. So 10:30s. Yeah, this is the guy.
 

5129
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:19,669
for. So 10:30s. Yeah, this is the guy.
So remember when we were going sideways

5130
01:49:19,669 --> 01:49:19,679
So remember when we were going sideways
 

5131
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:21,510
So remember when we were going sideways
here? So we caught this flush today. We

5132
01:49:21,510 --> 01:49:21,520
here? So we caught this flush today. We
 

5133
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:23,189
here? So we caught this flush today. We
played the We played this short today,

5134
01:49:23,189 --> 01:49:23,199
played the We played this short today,
 

5135
01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:26,390
played the We played this short today,
right? First short we played was

was here 300
 

5139
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:31,750
was here 300
and we add and we're out. Right? Once we

5140
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:31,760
and we add and we're out. Right? Once we
 

5141
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:34,470
and we add and we're out. Right? Once we
go sideways, this is your liquidity

5142
01:49:34,470 --> 01:49:34,480
go sideways, this is your liquidity
 

5143
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,070
go sideways, this is your liquidity
building stage because we know the

5144
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:36,080
building stage because we know the
 

5145
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:37,430
building stage because we know the
market doesn't go straight down. The

5146
01:49:37,430 --> 01:49:37,440
market doesn't go straight down. The
 

5147
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:40,310
market doesn't go straight down. The
market goes here, here, here. Correct?

5148

01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:48,400
if the liquidity building part if we
 

5155
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:50,390
if the liquidity building part if we
think about this as a range. All right.

5156

5189
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:25,830
They think we're going to squeeze
higher. What else happens? Shorts who

higher. What else happens? Shorts who
 

5191
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:27,750
higher. What else happens? Shorts who
are positioned here have their stops

short sellers who become market buyers

5200
01:50:38,390 --> 01:50:38,400
short sellers who become market buyers
 

5201
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:40,310

in here, what happens? This is where all
 

5223
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,750
in here, what happens? This is where all
those big buyers come in. Look at this

5224
01:51:07,750 --> 01:51:07,760
those big buyers come in. Look at this
 

5225
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:09,990
those big buyers come in. Look at this
delta. There's the failed break. And we

5226
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:10,000
delta. There's the failed break. And we
 

5227
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,430
delta. There's the failed break. And we
don't move higher, which means what?

There's a passive seller sitting here.
 

5231
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:16,070
There's a passive seller sitting here.
And then we move lower. How do we know

5232
01:51:16,070 --> 01:51:16,080
And then we move lower. How do we know
 

5233
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:18,790
And then we move lower. How do we know
he's stuck? We retest that level 250s.

5234
01:51:18,790 --> 01:51:18,800
he's stuck? We retest that level 250s.
 

5235
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:21,189
he's stuck? We retest that level 250s.
Remember, he was stuck at 250s. There is

5236
01:51:21,189 --> 01:51:21,199
Remember, he was stuck at 250s. There is
 

5237
01:51:21,199 --> 01:51:24,149
Remember, he was stuck at 250s. There is
his retest. We stay heavy. Okay, we know

5238
01:51:24,149 --> 01:51:24,159
his retest. We stay heavy. Okay, we know
 

5239
01:51:24,159 --> 01:51:26,070
his retest. We stay heavy. Okay, we know
there's a passive seller who's not going

5240
01:51:26,070 --> 01:51:26,080
there's a passive seller who's not going
 

5241
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:28,629
there's a passive seller who's not going
to let him out. We break down. We start

5242
01:51:28,629 --> 01:51:28,639
to let him out. We break down. We start
 

5243
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:30,790
to let him out. We break down. We start
looking for joins. All right, as we

5244
01:51:30,790 --> 01:51:30,800
looking for joins. All right, as we
 

5245
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:32,149
looking for joins. All right, as we
break down, I joined a little piece

5246
01:51:32,149 --> 01:51:32,159
break down, I joined a little piece
 

5247
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:34,310
break down, I joined a little piece
early, but where I really got heavy was

5248
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:34,320
early, but where I really got heavy was
 

5249
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:37,510
early, but where I really got heavy was
under 200 because I knew that the seller

5250
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:37,520
under 200 because I knew that the seller
 

5251
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:39,589
under 200 because I knew that the seller
was originally stuck at 200. There was a

01:51:39,589 --> 01:51:39,599
was originally stuck at 200. There was a
 

5253

was originally stuck at 200. There was a
seller here stuck at 200. Once he got

5254
01:51:42,629 --> 01:51:42,639
seller here stuck at 200. Once he got
 

5255
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:44,790
seller here stuck at 200. Once he got
out of the money, we got a break. We

5256
01:51:44,790 --> 01:51:44,800
out of the money, we got a break. We
 

5257
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:46,950
out of the money, we got a break. We
come to the other side of the range. All

5258
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:46,960
come to the other side of the range. All
 

5259
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:49,750
come to the other side of the range. All
these buyers now stop out and become

5260
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:49,760
these buyers now stop out and become
 

5261
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:52,709
these buyers now stop out and become
sellers in the market. All right. Same

5262
01:51:52,709 --> 01:51:52,719
sellers in the market. All right. Same
 

5263
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:54,149
sellers in the market. All right. Same
thing. This is the same thing here,

5264
01:51:54,149 --> 01:51:54,159
thing. This is the same thing here,
 

5265
01:51:54,159 --> 01:51:55,669
thing. This is the same thing here,
guys, where I stopped out except we've

5266
01:51:55,669 --> 01:51:55,679
guys, where I stopped out except we've
 

5267
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:58,709
guys, where I stopped out except we've
now done it. We go sideways. We fail to

5268
01:51:58,709 --> 01:51:58,719
now done it. We go sideways. We fail to
 

5269
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:00,870
now done it. We go sideways. We fail to
break higher. We trap buyers. We break

5270
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:00,880
break higher. We trap buyers. We break
 

5271
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:04,310
break higher. We trap buyers. We break
down. We go lower, right? We go lower.

5272
01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:04,320
down. We go lower, right? We go lower.
 

5273
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:07,109
down. We go lower, right? We go lower.
Hopefully that makes sense.

5274
01:52:07,109 --> 01:52:07,119
Hopefully that makes sense.
 

5275
01:52:07,119 --> 01:52:09,990
Hopefully that makes sense.
Uh but again, do the course, folks, if

5276
01:52:09,990 --> 01:52:10,000
Uh but again, do the course, folks, if
 

5277
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,109
Uh but again, do the course, folks, if
you want to learn more about this. So

5278
01:52:11,109 --> 01:52:11,119
you want to learn more about this. So
 

5279
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:14,310
you want to learn more about this. So
I'm I'm giving away they are not uh well

5280
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:14,320
I'm I'm giving away they are not uh well
 

5281
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:16,149
I'm I'm giving away they are not uh well
they are advanced principles I guess but

5282
01:52:16,149 --> 01:52:16,159
they are advanced principles I guess but
 

5283
01:52:16,159 --> 01:52:18,790
they are advanced principles I guess but
just do the course do the course you

5284
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:18,800
just do the course do the course you
 

5285
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:20,229
just do the course do the course you
you'll learn all of this I know Bart

5286
01:52:20,229 --> 01:52:20,239
you'll learn all of this I know Bart
 

5287
01:52:20,239 --> 01:52:25,990
you'll learn all of this I know Bart
you've done the course so

5288
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:26,000

 

5289
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,750

exactly Dean stock players become

5290
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:27,760
exactly Dean stock players become
 

5291
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:29,830
exactly Dean stock players become
liquidity Alex just joined it is it too

5292
01:52:29,830 --> 01:52:29,840
liquidity Alex just joined it is it too
 

5293
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:32,629
liquidity Alex just joined it is it too
late to short now uh oh we are let we

5294
01:52:32,629 --> 01:52:32,639
late to short now uh oh we are let we
 

5295
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:35,350
late to short now uh oh we are let we
still letting go I all it is is momentum

5296
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:35,360
still letting go I all it is is momentum
 

5297
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:37,430
still letting go I all it is is momentum
is great your location is is very very

5298
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:37,440
is great your location is is very very
 

5299
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,910
is great your location is is very very
poor now um you can maybe think about

5300
01:52:39,910 --> 01:52:39,920
poor now um you can maybe think about
 

5301
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:41,430
poor now um you can maybe think about
rejoining

5302
01:52:41,430 --> 01:52:41,440
rejoining
 

5303
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:43,990
rejoining
somewhere up here. All right. May maybe

5304
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:44,000
somewhere up here. All right. May maybe
 

5305
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,790
somewhere up here. All right. May maybe
there's a rejoin up here if they build

5306
01:52:46,790 --> 01:52:46,800
there's a rejoin up here if they build
 

5307
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:49,750
there's a rejoin up here if they build
out. Maybe they do a two-leg get stuck

5308
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:49,760
out. Maybe they do a two-leg get stuck
 

5309
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,589
out. Maybe they do a two-leg get stuck
roll if they're going to do this move.

5310
01:52:51,589 --> 01:52:51,599
roll if they're going to do this move.
 

5311
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:54,550
roll if they're going to do this move.
But I mean it it's much harder now.

5312
01:52:54,550 --> 01:52:54,560
But I mean it it's much harder now.
 

5313
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:55,990
But I mean it it's much harder now.
Remember the short the main short we

5314
01:52:55,990 --> 01:52:56,000
Remember the short the main short we
 

5315
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,350
Remember the short the main short we
wanted today was all the way up here. We

5316
01:52:57,350 --> 01:52:57,360
wanted today was all the way up here. We
 

5317
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:58,950
wanted today was all the way up here. We
wanted to short up here once we broke

5318
01:52:58,950 --> 01:52:58,960
wanted to short up here once we broke
 

5319
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:00,950
wanted to short up here once we broke
down. We were looking for a retest of

5320
01:53:00,950 --> 01:53:00,960
down. We were looking for a retest of
 

5321
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:02,550
down. We were looking for a retest of
350s.

5322
01:53:02,550 --> 01:53:02,560
350s.
 

5323
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:04,149
350s.
The guy was so impatient today. Oh,

5324
01:53:04,149 --> 01:53:04,159
The guy was so impatient today. Oh,
 

5325
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:07,189
The guy was so impatient today. Oh,
you're [\h__\h] Whatever he said. Just like

5326
01:53:07,189 --> 01:53:07,199
you're [\h__\h] Whatever he said. Just like
 

5327
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:08,870
you're [\h__\h] Whatever he said. Just like
all right. So, our first short today was

5328
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:08,880
all right. So, our first short today was
 

5329
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:11,350
all right. So, our first short today was
in and around these 270s and our second

5330
01:53:11,350 --> 01:53:11,360
in and around these 270s and our second
 

5331
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:13,589
in and around these 270s and our second
short today was in around the 200. So,

5332
01:53:13,589 --> 01:53:13,599
short today was in around the 200. So,
 

5333
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:17,030
short today was in around the 200. So,
we look good. Uh, let me check liquidity

5334
01:53:17,030 --> 01:53:17,040
we look good. Uh, let me check liquidity
 

5335
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,950
we look good. Uh, let me check liquidity
on the tape.

5336
01:53:18,950 --> 01:53:18,960
on the tape.
 

5337
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,470
on the tape.
Uh, really, you need to stay heavy

5338
01:53:20,470 --> 01:53:20,480
Uh, really, you need to stay heavy
 

5339
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:22,709
Uh, really, you need to stay heavy
versus sort of 18s and 20s here. There

5340
01:53:22,709 --> 01:53:22,719
versus sort of 18s and 20s here. There
 

5341
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:23,910
versus sort of 18s and 20s here. There
are some sellers starting to get

5342
01:53:23,910 --> 01:53:23,920
are some sellers starting to get
 

5343
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:26,709
are some sellers starting to get
aggressive under the 25,000. So, you can

5344
01:53:26,709 --> 01:53:26,719
aggressive under the 25,000. So, you can
 

5345
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:28,310
aggressive under the 25,000. So, you can
use that whole number. Like I said, I

5346
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:28,320
use that whole number. Like I said, I
 

5347
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,229
use that whole number. Like I said, I
think 800s is possible today. You can

5348
01:53:30,229 --> 01:53:30,239
think 800s is possible today. You can
 

5349
01:53:30,239 --> 01:53:32,870
think 800s is possible today. You can
cover some into this blue box, but this

5350
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:32,880
cover some into this blue box, but this
 

5351
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:35,750
cover some into this blue box, but this
is very possible today.

5352
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:35,760
is very possible today.
 

5353
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:45,109
is very possible today.
Very, very possible.

into an area of interest
 

5375
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:10,790
into an area of interest
and the tape's very heavy. Is there a

5376

5377
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:14,709

reaction? Have we changed changed state

5378
01:54:14,709 --> 01:54:14,719
reaction? Have we changed changed state
 

5379
01:54:14,719 --> 01:54:16,390

or are we just going to keep knifing

5380
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:16,400
or are we just going to keep knifing
 

5381
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,070
or are we just going to keep knifing
through? Like I said, it's very possible

5382
01:54:18,070 --> 01:54:18,080
through? Like I said, it's very possible
 

5383
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:19,990

we come down to here today. You would

5384
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:20,000
we come down to here today. You would
 

5385
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,910
we come down to here today. You would
need to see a reaction to get long. You

5386
01:54:21,910 --> 01:54:21,920
need to see a reaction to get long. You
 

5387
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:24,629
need to see a reaction to get long. You
would need to see this reclaim, hold,

5388
01:54:24,629 --> 01:54:24,639
would need to see this reclaim, hold,
 

5389
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:26,229
would need to see this reclaim, hold,
leave sellers trapped, reason to go

5390
01:54:26,229 --> 01:54:26,239
leave sellers trapped, reason to go
 

5391
01:54:26,239 --> 01:54:27,750
leave sellers trapped, reason to go
higher. You are not seeing that right

5392
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:27,760
higher. You are not seeing that right
 

5393
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:29,350
higher. You are not seeing that right
now. You are seeing a blue box thinking,

5394
01:54:29,350 --> 01:54:29,360
now. You are seeing a blue box thinking,
 

5395
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:30,629
now. You are seeing a blue box thinking,
"Oh, I'm just going to try it." Well,

5396
01:54:30,629 --> 01:54:30,639
"Oh, I'm just going to try it." Well,
 

5397
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:32,470
"Oh, I'm just going to try it." Well,
what happens when we do that? This is

5398
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:32,480
what happens when we do that? This is
 

5399
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:35,189
what happens when we do that? This is
where people go wrong. Just because we

5400
01:54:35,189 --> 01:54:35,199
where people go wrong. Just because we
 

5401
01:54:35,199 --> 01:54:37,669
where people go wrong. Just because we
come to an area does not mean anything.

5402
01:54:37,669 --> 01:54:37,679
come to an area does not mean anything.
 

5403
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:40,390
come to an area does not mean anything.
It is the reaction in that area that

5404
01:54:40,390 --> 01:54:40,400
It is the reaction in that area that
 

5405
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:45,109
It is the reaction in that area that
matters.

5406

5725
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:45,189

I took my P&L off the screens when

5726
02:00:45,189 --> 02:00:45,199
I took my P&L off the screens when
 

5727
02:00:45,199 --> 02:00:46,629
I took my P&L off the screens when
learning the process. Yeah, I think I

5728
02:00:46,629 --> 02:00:46,639
learning the process. Yeah, I think I
 

5729
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:47,750
learning the process. Yeah, I think I
think honestly I think that's a great

5730
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:47,760
think honestly I think that's a great
 

5731
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:50,709
think honestly I think that's a great
thing to do. Don't trade P&L because

5732
02:00:50,709 --> 02:00:50,719
thing to do. Don't trade P&L because
 

5733
02:00:50,719 --> 02:00:53,189
thing to do. Don't trade P&L because
it's not the winners as well, it's the

5734
02:00:53,189 --> 02:00:53,199
it's not the winners as well, it's the
 

5735
02:00:53,199 --> 02:00:56,229
it's not the winners as well, it's the
losers, right? One of here's another big

5736
02:00:56,229 --> 02:00:56,239
losers, right? One of here's another big
 

5737
02:00:56,239 --> 02:00:57,910
losers, right? One of here's another big
thing. You know I say size down all the

5738
02:00:57,910 --> 02:00:57,920
thing. You know I say size down all the
 

5739
02:00:57,920 --> 02:01:01,669
thing. You know I say size down all the
time. It's not just for like to sw stop

5740
02:01:01,669 --> 02:01:01,679
time. It's not just for like to sw stop
 

5741
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:05,830
time. It's not just for like to sw stop
the swings. Your mentality.

5742
02:01:05,830 --> 02:01:05,840
the swings. Your mentality.
 

5743
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:09,030
the swings. Your mentality.
If you are the wrong side of a trade, if

5744
02:01:09,030 --> 02:01:09,040
If you are the wrong side of a trade, if
 

5745
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:11,109
If you are the wrong side of a trade, if
you are the guy trying to get long here,

5746
02:01:11,109 --> 02:01:11,119
you are the guy trying to get long here,
 

5747
02:01:11,119 --> 02:01:13,189
you are the guy trying to get long here,
for example, right, and you are using

5748
02:01:13,189 --> 02:01:13,199
for example, right, and you are using
 

5749
02:01:13,199 --> 02:01:15,589
for example, right, and you are using
too big a size when this starts to drop,

5750
02:01:15,589 --> 02:01:15,599
too big a size when this starts to drop,
 

5751
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:18,310
too big a size when this starts to drop,
even though you know I'm wrong, right?

5752
02:01:18,310 --> 02:01:18,320
even though you know I'm wrong, right?
 

5753
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:20,070
even though you know I'm wrong, right?
If you look at your P&L here and it's

5754
02:01:20,070 --> 02:01:20,080
If you look at your P&L here and it's
 

5755
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:22,870
If you look at your P&L here and it's
down 3,000 bucks,

5756
02:01:22,870 --> 02:01:22,880
down 3,000 bucks,
 

5757
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:24,790
down 3,000 bucks,
right, you won't stop out. That's too

5758
02:01:24,790 --> 02:01:24,800
right, you won't stop out. That's too
 

5759
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:26,629
right, you won't stop out. That's too
much money for you. So, you'll add in

5760
02:01:26,629 --> 02:01:26,639
much money for you. So, you'll add in
 

5761
02:01:26,639 --> 02:01:28,790
much money for you. So, you'll add in
and then you'll be down here. This is

5762
02:01:28,790 --> 02:01:28,800
and then you'll be down here. This is
 

5763
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:30,629
and then you'll be down here. This is
again talking from experience. You'll be

5764
02:01:30,629 --> 02:01:30,639
again talking from experience. You'll be
 

5765
02:01:30,639 --> 02:01:33,350
again talking from experience. You'll be
down here and now you've added more size

5766
02:01:33,350 --> 02:01:33,360
down here and now you've added more size
 

5767
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:35,750
down here and now you've added more size
on like a [\h__\h] Now you're down 10,000

5768
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:35,760
on like a [\h__\h] Now you're down 10,000
 

5769
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:37,750
on like a [\h__\h] Now you're down 10,000
bucks. And now that's such an

5770
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:37,760
bucks. And now that's such an
 

5771
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:40,390
bucks. And now that's such an
unfathomable amount of money to you. You

5772
02:01:40,390 --> 02:01:40,400
unfathomable amount of money to you. You
 

5773
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:42,310
unfathomable amount of money to you. You
are completely unwilling to stop out

5774
02:01:42,310 --> 02:01:42,320
are completely unwilling to stop out
 

5775
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:44,390
are completely unwilling to stop out
even though your stop was up here. Your

5776
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:44,400
even though your stop was up here. Your
 

5777
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:45,910
even though your stop was up here. Your
first stop is the best stop. You didn't

5778
02:01:45,910 --> 02:01:45,920
first stop is the best stop. You didn't
 

5779
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:48,390
first stop is the best stop. You didn't
take it. So you add on more, right? You

5780
02:01:48,390 --> 02:01:48,400
take it. So you add on more, right? You
 

5781
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:50,229
take it. So you add on more, right? You
add to your loser more and now you're

5782
02:01:50,229 --> 02:01:50,239
add to your loser more and now you're
 

5783
02:01:50,239 --> 02:01:54,870
add to your loser more and now you're
down 25,000 bucks and maybe you know if

5784
02:01:54,870 --> 02:01:54,880
down 25,000 bucks and maybe you know if
 

5785
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:57,189
down 25,000 bucks and maybe you know if
you're trading stocks that's your PDT

5786
02:01:57,189 --> 02:01:57,199
you're trading stocks that's your PDT
 

5787
02:01:57,199 --> 02:01:59,830
you're trading stocks that's your PDT
and maybe Mr. Broker says, "Hey, you've

5788
02:01:59,830 --> 02:01:59,840
and maybe Mr. Broker says, "Hey, you've
 

5789
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:01,910
and maybe Mr. Broker says, "Hey, you've
been margin cooled. You're [\h__\h]

5790
02:02:01,910 --> 02:02:01,920
been margin cooled. You're [\h__\h]
 

5791
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:04,950
been margin cooled. You're [\h__\h]
done." And then what happens? You crawl

5792
02:02:04,950 --> 02:02:04,960
done." And then what happens? You crawl
 

5793
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:07,990
done." And then what happens? You crawl
in bed to your wife and you cry and you

5794
02:02:07,990 --> 02:02:08,000
in bed to your wife and you cry and you
 

5795
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,430
in bed to your wife and you cry and you
can't believe what you've done because

5796
02:02:09,430 --> 02:02:09,440
can't believe what you've done because
 

5797
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:11,830
can't believe what you've done because
this felt like a huge vortex and you

5798
02:02:11,830 --> 02:02:11,840
this felt like a huge vortex and you
 

5799
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,910
this felt like a huge vortex and you
knew you should have stopped out and you

5800
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:13,920
knew you should have stopped out and you
 

5801
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:16,229
knew you should have stopped out and you
didn't. And maybe you do that another

5802
02:02:16,229 --> 02:02:16,239
didn't. And maybe you do that another
 

5803
02:02:16,239 --> 02:02:18,070
didn't. And maybe you do that another
time and another time and another time

5804
02:02:18,070 --> 02:02:18,080
time and another time and another time
 

5805
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:20,070
time and another time and another time
and another time because you don't

5806
02:02:20,070 --> 02:02:20,080
and another time because you don't
 

5807
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:22,149
and another time because you don't
self-reflect. You just blame it on

5808
02:02:22,149 --> 02:02:22,159
self-reflect. You just blame it on
 

5809
02:02:22,159 --> 02:02:23,589
self-reflect. You just blame it on
something else. Oh, it's the market

5810
02:02:23,589 --> 02:02:23,599
something else. Oh, it's the market
 

5811
02:02:23,599 --> 02:02:25,030
something else. Oh, it's the market
makers. Oh, it should have done this.

5812
02:02:25,030 --> 02:02:25,040
makers. Oh, it should have done this.
 

5813
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:26,390
makers. Oh, it should have done this.
This is what I used to do. I'm telling

5814
02:02:26,390 --> 02:02:26,400
This is what I used to do. I'm telling
 

5815
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:27,510
This is what I used to do. I'm telling
you, it's what I used to do. That's

5816
02:02:27,510 --> 02:02:27,520
you, it's what I used to do. That's
 

5817
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:30,870
you, it's what I used to do. That's
[\h__\h] them. They [\h__\h] do this.

5818
02:02:30,870 --> 02:02:30,880
[\h__\h] them. They [\h__\h] do this.
 

5819
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:33,109
[\h__\h] them. They [\h__\h] do this.
Truth. Alex didn't have the discipline

5820
02:02:33,109 --> 02:02:33,119
Truth. Alex didn't have the discipline
 

5821
02:02:33,119 --> 02:02:37,109
Truth. Alex didn't have the discipline
to stop when his trade was wrong.

5822
02:02:37,109 --> 02:02:37,119
to stop when his trade was wrong.
 

5823
02:02:37,119 --> 02:02:39,109
to stop when his trade was wrong.
That's the truth. That's the truth.

5824
02:02:39,109 --> 02:02:39,119
That's the truth. That's the truth.
 

5825
02:02:39,119 --> 02:02:40,470
That's the truth. That's the truth.
There's no way of getting away from it

5826
02:02:40,470 --> 02:02:40,480
There's no way of getting away from it
 

5827
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:42,390
There's no way of getting away from it
until you can admit that to yourself.

5828
02:02:42,390 --> 02:02:42,400
until you can admit that to yourself.
 

5829
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:54,229
until you can admit that to yourself.
That's the truth.

5830
02:02:54,229 --> 02:02:54,239

 

5831
02:02:54,239 --> 02:02:56,390

To get good, you got to suck really bad.

5832
02:02:56,390 --> 02:02:56,400
To get good, you got to suck really bad.
 

5833
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:57,910
To get good, you got to suck really bad.
Once the fire burns you enough, you'll

5834
02:02:57,910 --> 02:02:57,920
Once the fire burns you enough, you'll
 

5835
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:59,510
Once the fire burns you enough, you'll
learn. That's it. Yeah. I always say

5836
02:02:59,510 --> 02:02:59,520
learn. That's it. Yeah. I always say
 

5837
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:00,790

you're going to ride a bike, you got to

5838
02:03:00,790 --> 02:03:00,800
you're going to ride a bike, you got to
 

5839
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:02,470
you're going to ride a bike, you got to
fall flat on your face, right? You have

5840
02:03:02,470 --> 02:03:02,480
fall flat on your face, right? You have
 

5841
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:05,189
fall flat on your face, right? You have
to fall flat on your face. I don't have

5842
02:03:05,189 --> 02:03:05,199
to fall flat on your face. I don't have
 

5843
02:03:05,199 --> 02:03:06,629
to fall flat on your face. I don't have
a wife. Well, then you're probably just

5844
02:03:06,629 --> 02:03:06,639
a wife. Well, then you're probably just
 

5845
02:03:06,639 --> 02:03:08,709
a wife. Well, then you're probably just
crying to yourself or your dog or maybe

5846
02:03:08,709 --> 02:03:08,719
crying to yourself or your dog or maybe
 

5847
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:10,629
crying to yourself or your dog or maybe
you got a fish. Maybe you're crying to

5848
02:03:10,629 --> 02:03:10,639
you got a fish. Maybe you're crying to
 

5849
02:03:10,639 --> 02:03:13,430
you got a fish. Maybe you're crying to
your goldfish. I don't know. But you you

your goldfish. I don't know. But you you
 

5851
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:18,709
your goldfish. I don't know. But you you
get the point, right? You get the point.

5852
02:03:18,709 --> 02:03:18,719

 

5853
02:03:18,719 --> 02:03:22,310

Is 860 final target? Uh 800 for me. I'm

02:03:27,990 --> 02:03:28,000
is down here. Right. It's not to say
 

5861
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,510

that we won't bounce before we get

5862
02:03:29,510 --> 02:03:29,520
that we won't bounce before we get
 

5863
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:31,669
that we won't bounce before we get
there. But I would think this is a naked

5864
02:03:31,669 --> 02:03:31,679
there. But I would think this is a naked
 

5865
02:03:31,679 --> 02:03:33,510
there. But I would think this is a naked
point of control. This is where I have

5866
02:03:33,510 --> 02:03:33,520
point of control. This is where I have
 

5867
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:35,589
point of control. This is where I have
thought we will trade to this week. This

5868
02:03:35,589 --> 02:03:35,599
thought we will trade to this week. This
 

5869
02:03:35,599 --> 02:03:37,830
thought we will trade to this week. This
is what we had in the weekly newsletter.

5870
02:03:37,830 --> 02:03:37,840
is what we had in the weekly newsletter.
 

5871
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:39,189
is what we had in the weekly newsletter.
This is what we tried to play for

5872
02:03:39,189 --> 02:03:39,199
This is what we tried to play for
 

5873
02:03:39,199 --> 02:03:40,950
This is what we tried to play for
yesterday. This is what we've been

5874
02:03:40,950 --> 02:03:40,960
yesterday. This is what we've been
 

5875
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:42,790
yesterday. This is what we've been
prepared for in Discord all week. I

5876
02:03:42,790 --> 02:03:42,800
prepared for in Discord all week. I
 

5877
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:43,910
prepared for in Discord all week. I
would have preferred to see a failed

5878
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:43,920
would have preferred to see a failed
 

5879
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:45,669
would have preferred to see a failed
breakout of the highs, the swing highs

5880
02:03:45,669 --> 02:03:45,679
breakout of the highs, the swing highs
 

5881
02:03:45,679 --> 02:03:47,510
breakout of the highs, the swing highs
on the hourly before we got here. But

5882
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:47,520
on the hourly before we got here. But
 

5883
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:49,589
on the hourly before we got here. But
this is what we are looking for. This is

5884
02:03:49,589 --> 02:03:49,599
this is what we are looking for. This is
 

5885
02:03:49,599 --> 02:03:52,070
this is what we are looking for. This is
the same like nothing's trade changed,

5886
02:03:52,070 --> 02:03:52,080
the same like nothing's trade changed,
 

5887
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:53,750
the same like nothing's trade changed,
guys, from this week. Anyone who's in

5888
02:03:53,750 --> 02:03:53,760
guys, from this week. Anyone who's in
 

5889
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:55,350
guys, from this week. Anyone who's in
Discord will know that we have been

5890
02:03:55,350 --> 02:03:55,360
Discord will know that we have been
 

5891
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:57,990
Discord will know that we have been
looking for this all week long, right?

5892
02:03:57,990 --> 02:03:58,000
looking for this all week long, right?
 

5893
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,310
looking for this all week long, right?
All week long. We we would have

5894
02:04:00,310 --> 02:04:00,320
All week long. We we would have
 

5895
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:01,669
All week long. We we would have
preferred the fail breakout. If we got

5896
02:04:01,669 --> 02:04:01,679
preferred the fail breakout. If we got
 

5897
02:04:01,679 --> 02:04:03,109
preferred the fail breakout. If we got
the fail breakout, I'm telling you now,

5898
02:04:03,109 --> 02:04:03,119
the fail breakout, I'm telling you now,
 

5899
02:04:03,119 --> 02:04:07,669
the fail breakout, I'm telling you now,
I would have taken SQQQ on a swing. Um,

5900
02:04:07,669 --> 02:04:07,679
I would have taken SQQQ on a swing. Um,
 

5901
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:09,350
I would have taken SQQQ on a swing. Um,
we looked at this same trade I showed

5902
02:04:09,350 --> 02:04:09,360
we looked at this same trade I showed
 

5903
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:10,470
we looked at this same trade I showed
you guys yesterday. We're looking for

5904
02:04:10,470 --> 02:04:10,480

you guys yesterday. We're looking for
the same thing. I will find it for you.

5906
02:04:12,550 --> 02:04:12,560
the same thing. I will find it for you.
 

5907
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:13,910
the same thing. I will find it for you.
It was I'm pretty sure I put it in the

5908
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:13,920
It was I'm pretty sure I put it in the
 

5909
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:16,149
It was I'm pretty sure I put it in the
newsletter. I'm fairly sure I put these

5910
02:04:16,149 --> 02:04:16,159
newsletter. I'm fairly sure I put these
 

5911
02:04:16,159 --> 02:04:17,830
newsletter. I'm fairly sure I put these
levels in the newsletter. Here we go.

5912
02:04:17,830 --> 02:04:17,840
levels in the newsletter. Here we go.
 

5913
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:20,390
levels in the newsletter. Here we go.
Same thing. Right. We started talking

5914
02:04:20,390 --> 02:04:20,400
Same thing. Right. We started talking
 

5915
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:21,830
Same thing. Right. We started talking
about this, reminding everyone on

5916
02:04:21,830 --> 02:04:21,840
about this, reminding everyone on
 

5917
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:23,910
about this, reminding everyone on
Discord. What's this on the 9th? So,

5918
02:04:23,910 --> 02:04:23,920
Discord. What's this on the 9th? So,
 

5919
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:25,830
Discord. What's this on the 9th? So,
like 3 days ago. Here's the play. Right.

5920
02:04:25,830 --> 02:04:25,840
like 3 days ago. Here's the play. Right.
 

5921
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:27,669
like 3 days ago. Here's the play. Right.
We're looking for a push fail break

5922
02:04:27,669 --> 02:04:27,679
We're looking for a push fail break
 

5923
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:29,750
We're looking for a push fail break
above here all the way potentially up to

5924
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:29,760
above here all the way potentially up to
 

5925
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:31,990
above here all the way potentially up to
800. But I think 600 would have held.

5926
02:04:31,990 --> 02:04:32,000
800. But I think 600 would have held.
 

5927
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,149
800. But I think 600 would have held.
We're looking for this trade back down

5928
02:04:34,149 --> 02:04:34,159
We're looking for this trade back down
 

5929
02:04:34,159 --> 02:04:36,310
We're looking for this trade back down
into the naked point of control. And you

5930
02:04:36,310 --> 02:04:36,320
into the naked point of control. And you
 

5931
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:38,709
into the naked point of control. And you
can see here if bears set another trap,

5932
02:04:38,709 --> 02:04:38,719
can see here if bears set another trap,
 

5933
02:04:38,719 --> 02:04:40,470
can see here if bears set another trap,
it will look like this. All right. So,

5934
02:04:40,470 --> 02:04:40,480
it will look like this. All right. So,
 

5935
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:42,229
it will look like this. All right. So,
this is what we were looking for. It's

5936
02:04:42,229 --> 02:04:42,239
this is what we were looking for. It's
 

5937
02:04:42,239 --> 02:04:44,629
this is what we were looking for. It's
been there the whole time.

5938
02:04:44,629 --> 02:04:44,639
been there the whole time.
 

5939
02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:46,709
been there the whole time.
So, this is your your covers should be

5940
02:04:46,709 --> 02:04:46,719
So, this is your your covers should be
 

5941
02:04:46,719 --> 02:04:48,310
So, this is your your covers should be
down into here. This would be what do we

5942
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:48,320
down into here. This would be what do we
 

5943
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:49,910
down into here. This would be what do we
say? It's a 400 point of those that got

5944
02:04:49,910 --> 02:04:49,920
say? It's a 400 point of those that got
 

5945
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:54,870
say? It's a 400 point of those that got
it. 400 points. I mean,

5946
02:04:54,870 --> 02:04:54,880

 

5947
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:57,270

400 points. And yet, there are still

5948
02:04:57,270 --> 02:04:57,280
400 points. And yet, there are still
 

5949
02:04:57,280 --> 02:04:59,669
400 points. And yet, there are still
people who are willing to come and

5950
02:04:59,669 --> 02:04:59,679
people who are willing to come and
 

5951
02:04:59,679 --> 02:05:02,310
people who are willing to come and
challenge me here every day.

5952
02:05:02,310 --> 02:05:02,320
challenge me here every day.
 

5953
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:04,709
challenge me here every day.
That's what I find upsetting, guys.

5954
02:05:04,709 --> 02:05:04,719
That's what I find upsetting, guys.
 

5955
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:07,189
That's what I find upsetting, guys.
That's what makes it hard for my ego.

5956
02:05:07,189 --> 02:05:07,199
That's what makes it hard for my ego.
 

5957
02:05:07,199 --> 02:05:09,030
That's what makes it hard for my ego.
For my ego, that's what I struggle with

5958
02:05:09,030 --> 02:05:09,040
For my ego, that's what I struggle with
 

5959
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:10,790
For my ego, that's what I struggle with
because I feel like I give a lot out for

5960
02:05:10,790 --> 02:05:10,800
because I feel like I give a lot out for
 

5961
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:12,790
because I feel like I give a lot out for
free to help.

5962
02:05:12,790 --> 02:05:12,800
free to help.
 

5963
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:15,669
free to help.
My ego struggles when people

5964
02:05:15,669 --> 02:05:15,679
My ego struggles when people
 

5965
02:05:15,679 --> 02:05:16,870
My ego struggles when people
say things like I don't know what I'm

5966
02:05:16,870 --> 02:05:16,880
say things like I don't know what I'm
 

5967
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:19,750
say things like I don't know what I'm
talking about. That hurts my ego. That's

5968
02:05:19,750 --> 02:05:19,760
talking about. That hurts my ego. That's
 

5969
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:23,189
talking about. That hurts my ego. That's
something I have to deal with.

5970
02:05:23,189 --> 02:05:23,199
something I have to deal with.
 

5971
02:05:23,199 --> 02:05:25,109
something I have to deal with.
Nathan Lee, appreciate your insight.

5972
02:05:25,109 --> 02:05:25,119
Nathan Lee, appreciate your insight.
 

5973
02:05:25,119 --> 02:05:28,310
Nathan Lee, appreciate your insight.
What What would you have to see to go

5974
02:05:28,310 --> 02:05:28,320
What What would you have to see to go
 

5975
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:29,830
What What would you have to see to go
long? Would you ever long or just play

5976
02:05:29,830 --> 02:05:29,840
long? Would you ever long or just play
 

5977
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:32,229
long? Would you ever long or just play
the rejections all day? Uh yes, you can

5978
02:05:32,229 --> 02:05:32,239
the rejections all day? Uh yes, you can
 

5979
02:05:32,239 --> 02:05:35,510
the rejections all day? Uh yes, you can
long once enough shorts get trapped.

5980
02:05:35,510 --> 02:05:35,520
long once enough shorts get trapped.
 

5981
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:39,030
long once enough shorts get trapped.
Right? So ideally, ideally at this

5982
02:05:39,030 --> 02:05:39,040
Right? So ideally, ideally at this
 

5983
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:40,790
Right? So ideally, ideally at this
point, right? Ideally, we want

5984
02:05:40,790 --> 02:05:40,800
point, right? Ideally, we want
 

5985
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:43,030
point, right? Ideally, we want
lowhanging fruit to be taken out. But

5986
02:05:43,030 --> 02:05:43,040
lowhanging fruit to be taken out. But
 

5987
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:45,350
lowhanging fruit to be taken out. But
like let's say we come down here, we

5988
02:05:45,350 --> 02:05:45,360
like let's say we come down here, we
 

5989
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:47,589
like let's say we come down here, we
build liquidity like this for a while,

5990
02:05:47,589 --> 02:05:47,599
build liquidity like this for a while,
 

5991
02:05:47,599 --> 02:05:49,430
build liquidity like this for a while,
right? And then we break down under this

5992
02:05:49,430 --> 02:05:49,440
right? And then we break down under this
 

5993
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,350
right? And then we break down under this
and shorts come flying in and then we

5994
02:05:51,350 --> 02:05:51,360
and shorts come flying in and then we
 

5995
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:53,430
and shorts come flying in and then we
reclaim this and do this. Okay? Then you

5996
02:05:53,430 --> 02:05:53,440
reclaim this and do this. Okay? Then you
 

5997
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:54,790
reclaim this and do this. Okay? Then you
can think about a long. You better know

5998
02:05:54,790 --> 02:05:54,800
can think about a long. You better know
 

5999
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:56,470
can think about a long. You better know
it's counter trend, but you can think

6000
02:05:56,470 --> 02:05:56,480
it's counter trend, but you can think
 

6001
02:05:56,480 --> 02:06:00,390
it's counter trend, but you can think
about long. So you'd be TP TP TP TP,

6002
02:06:00,390 --> 02:06:00,400
about long. So you'd be TP TP TP TP,
 

6003
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:01,589
about long. So you'd be TP TP TP TP,
right? And it wouldn't go straight up.

6004
02:06:01,589 --> 02:06:01,599
right? And it wouldn't go straight up.
 

6005
02:06:01,599 --> 02:06:05,750
right? And it wouldn't go straight up.
It would be like this, this, this, maybe

6006
02:06:05,750 --> 02:06:05,760
It would be like this, this, this, maybe
 

6007
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:07,669
It would be like this, this, this, maybe
a dunk. This all right, for example.

6008
02:06:07,669 --> 02:06:07,679
a dunk. This all right, for example.
 

6009
02:06:07,679 --> 02:06:10,070
a dunk. This all right, for example.
Right, this move here is the same thing.

6010
02:06:10,070 --> 02:06:10,080
Right, this move here is the same thing.
 

6011
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:12,629
Right, this move here is the same thing.
We build liquidity, we trap shorts, we

6012
02:06:12,629 --> 02:06:12,639
We build liquidity, we trap shorts, we
 

6013
02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:14,390
We build liquidity, we trap shorts, we
take out low hanging fruit, we reclaim,

6014
02:06:14,390 --> 02:06:14,400
take out low hanging fruit, we reclaim,
 

6015
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,390
take out low hanging fruit, we reclaim,
we go the other way until that point.

6016
02:06:16,390 --> 02:06:16,400
we go the other way until that point.
 

6017
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:18,229
we go the other way until that point.

This is the same play. Anyone who joined
 

6029
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:31,189
This is the same play. Anyone who joined
me yesterday, what did we look for

6030
02:06:31,189 --> 02:06:31,199
me yesterday, what did we look for
 

6031
02:06:31,199 --> 02:06:33,830

yesterday when I said if we leave trap

6032
02:06:33,830 --> 02:06:33,840
yesterday when I said if we leave trap
 

6033
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:35,270
yesterday when I said if we leave trap
volume, the volume yesterday was up

6034
02:06:35,270 --> 02:06:35,280
volume, the volume yesterday was up
 

6035
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:37,589
volume, the volume yesterday was up
here. If we leave trap volume, we're

6036
02:06:37,589 --> 02:06:37,599
here. If we leave trap volume, we're
 

6037
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:38,950
here. If we leave trap volume, we're
going to try and come down here. All

6038
02:06:38,950 --> 02:06:38,960
going to try and come down here. All
 

6039
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:40,310

joined me, we left the volume moved down
 

6043
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:44,390
joined me, we left the volume moved down
a bit unfortunately today to these sort

6044
02:06:44,390 --> 02:06:44,400
a bit unfortunately today to these sort
 

6045
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:46,229
a bit unfortunately today to these sort
of 200s. We've left trap volume. Where

6046
02:06:46,229 --> 02:06:46,239
of 200s. We've left trap volume. Where
 

6047
02:06:46,239 --> 02:06:47,910
of 200s. We've left trap volume. Where
is the trap volume on this week? There

6048
02:06:47,910 --> 02:06:47,920
is the trap volume on this week? There
 

6049
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:50,709
is the trap volume on this week? There
it is. This is all the participation

6050
02:06:50,709 --> 02:06:50,719
it is. This is all the participation
 

6051
02:06:50,719 --> 02:06:53,109
it is. This is all the participation
from Monday to now. So, if these are all

6052
02:06:53,109 --> 02:06:53,119
from Monday to now. So, if these are all
 

6053
02:06:53,119 --> 02:06:55,189
from Monday to now. So, if these are all
buyers, remember these buyers are all

looking to get up here. All right, I
 

6057
02:06:57,360 --> 02:06:59,109
looking to get up here. All right, I
wanted them to come flying in here to

6058
02:06:59,109 --> 02:06:59,119
wanted them to come flying in here to
 

6059
02:06:59,119 --> 02:07:00,470
wanted them to come flying in here to
then play that. This would have been a

6060
02:07:00,470 --> 02:07:00,480
then play that. This would have been a
 

6061
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:02,950
then play that. This would have been a
swing short position for me. Um,

6062
02:07:02,950 --> 02:07:02,960
swing short position for me. Um,
 

6063
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:04,310
swing short position for me. Um,
unfortunately, we didn't get that. Like

6064
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:04,320
unfortunately, we didn't get that. Like
 

6065
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:05,589
unfortunately, we didn't get that. Like
I said, we don't always get what we

6066
02:07:05,589 --> 02:07:05,599
I said, we don't always get what we
 

6067
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:07,669
I said, we don't always get what we
want, but we are getting this right

6068
02:07:07,669 --> 02:07:07,679
want, but we are getting this right
 

6069
02:07:07,679 --> 02:07:09,430
want, but we are getting this right
naked point of control from last week.

6070
02:07:09,430 --> 02:07:09,440
naked point of control from last week.
 

6071
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:11,910
naked point of control from last week.
Our expectation is to come here. Now, we

6072
02:07:11,910 --> 02:07:11,920
Our expectation is to come here. Now, we
 

6073
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:13,510
Our expectation is to come here. Now, we
might bounce back off there and revisit

6074
02:07:13,510 --> 02:07:13,520
might bounce back off there and revisit
 

6075
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:15,589
might bounce back off there and revisit
there. That might be the new range for

6076
02:07:15,589 --> 02:07:15,599
there. That might be the new range for
 

6077
02:07:15,599 --> 02:07:17,990
there. That might be the new range for
Friday next week. It might be that we

6078
02:07:17,990 --> 02:07:18,000
Friday next week. It might be that we
 

6079
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,310
Friday next week. It might be that we
puke and we start doing this now. I

6080
02:07:20,310 --> 02:07:20,320
puke and we start doing this now. I
 

6081
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:22,950
puke and we start doing this now. I
don't know, folks. I don't know. We can

6082
02:07:22,950 --> 02:07:22,960
don't know, folks. I don't know. We can
 

6083
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:24,310
don't know, folks. I don't know. We can
only trade what's in front of us. But

6084
02:07:24,310 --> 02:07:24,320
only trade what's in front of us. But
 

6085
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:26,950
only trade what's in front of us. But
the high probability move was from here

6086
02:07:26,950 --> 02:07:26,960
the high probability move was from here
 

6087
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:29,109
the high probability move was from here
to here. That's a very high probability

6088
02:07:29,109 --> 02:07:29,119
to here. That's a very high probability
 

6089
02:07:29,119 --> 02:07:41,669
to here. That's a very high probability
move.

6090
02:07:41,669 --> 02:07:41,679

 

6091
02:07:41,679 --> 02:07:43,669

Gold is on a crazy drop. Well, it looks

6092

Gold is on a crazy drop. Well, it looks
like they're just selling everything

6094
02:07:44,709 --> 02:07:44,719
like they're just selling everything
 

6095
02:07:44,719 --> 02:07:46,470
like they're just selling everything
right now. It looks like we're just

6096
02:07:46,470 --> 02:07:46,480
right now. It looks like we're just
 

6097
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:48,149
right now. It looks like we're just
we're d-risking in the whole market

6098
02:07:48,149 --> 02:07:48,159
we're d-risking in the whole market
 

6099
02:07:48,159 --> 02:07:49,510
we're d-risking in the whole market
right now. That's what it looks like to

6100
02:07:49,510 --> 02:07:49,520
right now. That's what it looks like to
 

6101
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:52,550
right now. That's what it looks like to
me. There's a full d-risk going on. Like

6102
02:07:52,550 --> 02:07:52,560
me. There's a full d-risk going on. Like
 

6103
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:55,589
me. There's a full d-risk going on. Like
everyone's out of everything right now.

6104

everyone's out of everything right now.
 

6105

everyone's out of everything right now.
That's the truth, right? So, we are

6106
02:07:58,310 --> 02:07:58,320
That's the truth, right? So, we are
 

6107
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:01,270
That's the truth, right? So, we are
riskoff environment at the moment. So,

6108
02:08:01,270 --> 02:08:01,280
riskoff environment at the moment. So,
 

6109
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:03,270
riskoff environment at the moment. So,

02:09:09,119 --> 02:09:10,870
over this. That's not silver.
You can see I've had it drawn back on.

6166
02:09:10,870 --> 02:09:10,880
You can see I've had it drawn back on.
 

6167

You can see I've had it drawn back on.
Same thing. It's the same principles,

02:09:13,990 --> 02:09:14,000
Same thing. It's the same principles,
 

6169
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,470
Same thing. It's the same principles,
folks. Draw this on. Where's everyone

6170
02:09:16,470 --> 02:09:16,480
folks. Draw this on. Where's everyone
 

6171
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:18,229
folks. Draw this on. Where's everyone
stuck? That we have a node up here. If

6172
02:09:18,229 --> 02:09:18,239
stuck? That we have a node up here. If
 

6173
02:09:18,239 --> 02:09:20,950
stuck? That we have a node up here. If
they can't get back over this node,

6174
02:09:20,950 --> 02:09:20,960
they can't get back over this node,
 

6175
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:23,109
they can't get back over this node,
all the buyers here are stuck. Here's

6176
02:09:23,109 --> 02:09:23,119
all the buyers here are stuck. Here's
 

6177
02:09:23,119 --> 02:09:25,430
all the buyers here are stuck. Here's
your sell. They can't even pivot up into

6178
02:09:25,430 --> 02:09:25,440
your sell. They can't even pivot up into
 

6179
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:27,430
your sell. They can't even pivot up into
that. That's how weak this is. You'd be

6180
02:09:27,430 --> 02:09:27,440
that. That's how weak this is. You'd be
 

6181
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:29,350
that. That's how weak this is. You'd be
covering some into here and you'd be

6182
02:09:29,350 --> 02:09:29,360
covering some into here and you'd be
 

6183
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:30,629
covering some into here and you'd be
looking for this now at this point.

6184
02:09:30,629 --> 02:09:30,639
looking for this now at this point.
 

6185
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:33,589
looking for this now at this point.
Honestly, that's why folks, this is how

6186
02:09:33,589 --> 02:09:33,599
Honestly, that's why folks, this is how
 

6187
02:09:33,599 --> 02:09:36,629
Honestly, that's why folks, this is how
the market moves. It is not some magic

6188
02:09:36,629 --> 02:09:36,639
the market moves. It is not some magic
 

6189
02:09:36,639 --> 02:09:39,270
the market moves. It is not some magic
thesis, right? It's just trap players.

All it is, it's an auction of trap

6192
02:09:41,109 --> 02:09:41,119
All it is, it's an auction of trap

6200
02:09:50,550 --> 02:09:50,560
points or so. Uh might be that they find
 

6201
02:09:50,560 --> 02:10:13,910
points or so. Uh might be that they find
a bid soon but we will see.

6202
02:10:13,910 --> 02:10:13,920

We've talked about it, right? We've
talked about this range on the cues.

6208
02:10:20,790 --> 02:10:20,800
talked about this range on the cues.
 

6209
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,069
talked about this range on the cues.
It's really important you guys get in

6210
02:10:22,069 --> 02:10:22,079
It's really important you guys get in
 

6211
02:10:22,079 --> 02:10:24,390
It's really important you guys get in
the habit of uh looking at higher time

6212
02:10:24,390 --> 02:10:24,400
the habit of uh looking at higher time
 

6213
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:27,510
the habit of uh looking at higher time
frames, right? We've talked about

6214
02:10:27,510 --> 02:10:27,520
frames, right? We've talked about
 

6215
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:30,390
frames, right? We've talked about
even here if we just measure out from

6216
02:10:30,390 --> 02:10:30,400
even here if we just measure out from
 

6217
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:32,629
even here if we just measure out from

this high,
 

6219
02:10:32,639 --> 02:10:35,750

right? Where is everyone stuck? Why does
 

6221
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:37,830

it keep changing my volume color? It's
 

6223
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:39,669

look who's trapped. All right. So, like

6244
02:11:15,270 --> 02:11:15,280
look who's trapped. All right. So, like
 

6245
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:16,709
look who's trapped. All right. So, like
someone just said, I' I've been calling

6246
02:11:16,709 --> 02:11:16,719
someone just said, I' I've been calling
 

6247
02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:19,030
someone just said, I' I've been calling
it from 5th of November, uh, which is

6248
02:11:19,030 --> 02:11:19,040
it from 5th of November, uh, which is
 

6249
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:20,790
it from 5th of November, uh, which is
like here from this high. This is where

6250
02:11:20,790 --> 02:11:20,800
like here from this high. This is where
 

6251
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:22,950
like here from this high. This is where
we failed, right? Here's all the trap

6252
02:11:22,950 --> 02:11:22,960
we failed, right? Here's all the trap
 

6253
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:25,430
we failed, right? Here's all the trap
volume. We've talked about this. The

6254
02:11:25,430 --> 02:11:25,440
volume. We've talked about this. The
 

6255
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:27,030
volume. We've talked about this. The
same principle we talked about today on

6256
02:11:27,030 --> 02:11:27,040
same principle we talked about today on
 

6257
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:28,950
same principle we talked about today on
the lower time frame. What is this right

6258
02:11:28,950 --> 02:11:28,960
the lower time frame. What is this right
 

6259
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:32,629
the lower time frame. What is this right
here? Hello. Guess what happened there?

6260
02:11:32,629 --> 02:11:32,639
here? Hello. Guess what happened there?
 

6261
02:11:32,639 --> 02:11:35,109
here? Hello. Guess what happened there?
Same principle. Okay, exactly the same

6262
02:11:35,109 --> 02:11:35,119
Same principle. Okay, exactly the same
 

6263
02:11:35,119 --> 02:11:37,589
Same principle. Okay, exactly the same
principle. Buyers move this down so you

6264
02:11:37,589 --> 02:11:37,599
principle. Buyers move this down so you
 

6265
02:11:37,599 --> 02:11:40,390
principle. Buyers move this down so you
can see it. Sorry. Buyers came flying in

6266
02:11:40,390 --> 02:11:40,400
can see it. Sorry. Buyers came flying in
 

6267
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:43,589
can see it. Sorry. Buyers came flying in
here. Did we hold? No. Failed breakout.

6268
02:11:43,589 --> 02:11:43,599
here. Did we hold? No. Failed breakout.
 

6269
02:11:43,599 --> 02:11:45,669
here. Did we hold? No. Failed breakout.
Rejection. Same level. We are trading

6270
02:11:45,669 --> 02:11:45,679
Rejection. Same level. We are trading
 

6271
02:11:45,679 --> 02:11:47,990
Rejection. Same level. We are trading
lower now. All right. We have buyers

6272
02:11:47,990 --> 02:11:48,000
lower now. All right. We have buyers
 

6273
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,589
lower now. All right. We have buyers
caught above us. Where are we going to

6274
02:11:49,589 --> 02:11:49,599
caught above us. Where are we going to
 

6275
02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:52,550
caught above us. Where are we going to
trade to? Well, we can

6276
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:52,560
trade to? Well, we can
 

6277
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:54,629
trade to? Well, we can
attempt to go for the last year. Can

6278
02:11:54,629 --> 02:11:54,639
attempt to go for the last year. Can
 

6279
02:11:54,639 --> 02:11:55,830
attempt to go for the last year. Can
always do it from the swing low. Let's

6280
02:11:55,830 --> 02:11:55,840
always do it from the swing low. Let's
 

6281
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:58,470
always do it from the swing low. Let's
see if it would develop it.

6282
02:11:58,470 --> 02:11:58,480
see if it would develop it.
 

6283
02:11:58,480 --> 02:12:01,270
see if it would develop it.
Uh, would it do it for us? We were about

6284
02:12:01,270 --> 02:12:01,280
Uh, would it do it for us? We were about
 

6285
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:11,430
Uh, would it do it for us? We were about
to find out.

6286
02:12:11,430 --> 02:12:11,440

 

6287
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:12,870

Get rid of this histogram. Give me a

6288
02:12:12,870 --> 02:12:12,880
Get rid of this histogram. Give me a
 

6289
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:19,189
Get rid of this histogram. Give me a
second.

6290
02:12:19,189 --> 02:12:19,199

 

6291
02:12:19,199 --> 02:12:22,229

Okay. So, if we are going to leave this,

6292
02:12:22,229 --> 02:12:22,239
Okay. So, if we are going to leave this,
 

6293
02:12:22,239 --> 02:12:24,310
Okay. So, if we are going to leave this,
we've talked about this again. We are

6294
02:12:24,310 --> 02:12:24,320
we've talked about this again. We are
 

6295
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:26,470
we've talked about this again. We are
very very thin in here, right? We are

6296
02:12:26,470 --> 02:12:26,480
very very thin in here, right? We are
 

6297
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:29,830
very very thin in here, right? We are
very very thin

6298
02:12:29,830 --> 02:12:29,840
very very thin
 

6299
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:32,550
very very thin
in here. So from I don't know what we

6300
02:12:32,550 --> 02:12:32,560
in here. So from I don't know what we
 

6301
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:36,709
in here. So from I don't know what we
call this July to September right if we

6302
02:12:36,709 --> 02:12:36,719
call this July to September right if we
 

6303
02:12:36,719 --> 02:12:38,390
call this July to September right if we
leave this right here which is where

6304
02:12:38,390 --> 02:12:38,400
leave this right here which is where
 

6305
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:39,910
leave this right here which is where
we're coming down to test and we get the

6306
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:39,920
we're coming down to test and we get the
 

6307
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:41,750
we're coming down to test and we get the
Ballinger bands expanding and the 5day

6308
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:41,760
Ballinger bands expanding and the 5day
 

6309
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:43,189
Ballinger bands expanding and the 5day
and the 20-day and everything trading

6310
02:12:43,189 --> 02:12:43,199
and the 20-day and everything trading
 

6311
02:12:43,199 --> 02:12:45,030
and the 20-day and everything trading
down we come back down to this 200. If

6312
02:12:45,030 --> 02:12:45,040
down we come back down to this 200. If
 

6313
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:47,430
down we come back down to this 200. If
we lose this 200 and we undercut this we

6314
02:12:47,430 --> 02:12:47,440
we lose this 200 and we undercut this we
 

6315
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:49,430
we lose this 200 and we undercut this we
will probably wash to this node here

6316
02:12:49,430 --> 02:12:49,440
will probably wash to this node here
 

6317
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:52,310
will probably wash to this node here
right sub 24,000. If we start losing

6318
02:12:52,310 --> 02:12:52,320
right sub 24,000. If we start losing
 

6319
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:54,470
right sub 24,000. If we start losing
that and we cannot hold these pivots

6320
02:12:54,470 --> 02:12:54,480
that and we cannot hold these pivots
 

6321
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:56,790
that and we cannot hold these pivots
here all the volume is way down here at

6322
02:12:56,790 --> 02:12:56,800
here all the volume is way down here at
 

6323
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:59,830
here all the volume is way down here at
22,600. So we are currently looking for

6324
02:12:59,830 --> 02:12:59,840
22,600. So we are currently looking for
 

6325
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:02,390
22,600. So we are currently looking for
a breakout underneath this swing point

6326
02:13:02,390 --> 02:13:02,400
a breakout underneath this swing point
 

6327
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:04,870
a breakout underneath this swing point
here from 25th of November. If we do

6328
02:13:04,870 --> 02:13:04,880
here from 25th of November. If we do
 

6329
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:06,950
here from 25th of November. If we do
that, we'll cover some in here and we'll

6330
02:13:06,950 --> 02:13:06,960
that, we'll cover some in here and we'll
 

6331
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:09,030
that, we'll cover some in here and we'll
then look for expansion into 23. We to

6332
02:13:09,030 --> 02:13:09,040
then look for expansion into 23. We to
 

6333
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:10,390
then look for expansion into 23. We to
go over this in the weekly news

6334
02:13:10,390 --> 02:13:10,400
go over this in the weekly news
 

6335
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:12,709
go over this in the weekly news
newsletter 23,500 and if we get very

6336
02:13:12,709 --> 02:13:12,719
newsletter 23,500 and if we get very
 

6337
02:13:12,719 --> 02:13:14,149
newsletter 23,500 and if we get very
heavy all the way down here. You might

6338
02:13:14,149 --> 02:13:14,159
heavy all the way down here. You might
 

6339
02:13:14,159 --> 02:13:16,069
heavy all the way down here. You might
say that this is impossible. Uh this is

6340
02:13:16,069 --> 02:13:16,079
say that this is impossible. Uh this is
 

6341
02:13:16,079 --> 02:13:18,950
say that this is impossible. Uh this is
very much not impossible breakout

6342
02:13:18,950 --> 02:13:18,960
very much not impossible breakout
 

6343
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:23,350
very much not impossible breakout
pullback. This is still very very very

6344
02:13:23,350 --> 02:13:23,360
pullback. This is still very very very
 

6345
02:13:23,360 --> 02:13:24,950
pullback. This is still very very very
possible. if they want to do the dirty

6346
02:13:24,950 --> 02:13:24,960
possible. if they want to do the dirty
 

6347
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:26,470
possible. if they want to do the dirty
undercut, they'll come and take these

6348
02:13:26,470 --> 02:13:26,480
undercut, they'll come and take these
 

6349
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:28,229
undercut, they'll come and take these
stops, turn inside, and then we'll see

6350
02:13:28,229 --> 02:13:28,239
stops, turn inside, and then we'll see
 

6351
02:13:28,239 --> 02:13:30,629
stops, turn inside, and then we'll see
how we go the rest of the year. It's

6352
02:13:30,629 --> 02:13:30,639
how we go the rest of the year. It's
 

6353
02:13:30,639 --> 02:13:34,390
how we go the rest of the year. It's
very, very, very possible.

6354
02:13:34,390 --> 02:13:34,400
very, very, very possible.
 

6355
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:36,790
very, very, very possible.
Same thing that we look at on every

6356
02:13:36,790 --> 02:13:36,800
Same thing that we look at on every
 

6357
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:38,310
Same thing that we look at on every
single time frame. Look at flow zones

6358
02:13:38,310 --> 02:13:38,320
single time frame. Look at flow zones
 

6359
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:40,149
single time frame. Look at flow zones
just selling us down. So, your your

6360
02:13:40,149 --> 02:13:40,159
just selling us down. So, your your
 

6361
02:13:40,159 --> 02:13:41,430
just selling us down. So, your your
final cover, remember, we are looking

6362
02:13:41,430 --> 02:13:41,440
final cover, remember, we are looking
 

6363
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:43,430
final cover, remember, we are looking
for 800s.

6364
02:13:43,430 --> 02:13:43,440
for 800s.
 

6365
02:13:43,440 --> 02:14:05,589
for 800s.
We're looking for 800s.

6366
02:14:05,589 --> 02:14:05,599

 

6367
02:14:05,599 --> 02:14:07,430

Sorry, there's so many questions here. I

6368
02:14:07,430 --> 02:14:07,440
Sorry, there's so many questions here. I
 

6369
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:10,149
Sorry, there's so many questions here. I
can't see all of them. What's my win win

6370
02:14:10,149 --> 02:14:10,159
can't see all of them. What's my win win
 

6371
02:14:10,159 --> 02:14:11,830
can't see all of them. What's my win win
rate? I always talk about this between

6372
02:14:11,830 --> 02:14:11,840
rate? I always talk about this between
 

6373
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:15,990
rate? I always talk about this between
sort of 68 and 74%. But I think that is

6374
02:14:15,990 --> 02:14:16,000
sort of 68 and 74%. But I think that is
 

6375
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,069
sort of 68 and 74%. But I think that is
skewed. All right, remember when I'm

6376
02:14:18,069 --> 02:14:18,079
skewed. All right, remember when I'm
 

6377
02:14:18,079 --> 02:14:19,430
skewed. All right, remember when I'm
trading, I'm looking for big winners

6378
02:14:19,430 --> 02:14:19,440
trading, I'm looking for big winners
 

6379
02:14:19,440 --> 02:14:23,510
trading, I'm looking for big winners
where possible. Lots of those wins are

6380
02:14:23,510 --> 02:14:23,520
where possible. Lots of those wins are
 

6381
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:26,390
where possible. Lots of those wins are
like break even plus one tick. It counts

6382
02:14:26,390 --> 02:14:26,400
like break even plus one tick. It counts
 

6383
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:28,390
like break even plus one tick. It counts
as a win for me. It's not a win. You

6384
02:14:28,390 --> 02:14:28,400
as a win for me. It's not a win. You
 

6385
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:30,229
as a win for me. It's not a win. You
will see me on stream, if you turn up,

6386
02:14:30,229 --> 02:14:30,239
will see me on stream, if you turn up,
 

6387
02:14:30,239 --> 02:14:32,709
will see me on stream, if you turn up,
you will see me numerous times take like

6388
02:14:32,709 --> 02:14:32,719
you will see me numerous times take like
 

6389
02:14:32,719 --> 02:14:35,030
you will see me numerous times take like
three attempts at the same trade. The

6390
02:14:35,030 --> 02:14:35,040
three attempts at the same trade. The
 

6391
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:36,470
three attempts at the same trade. The
first two might count as a win. They're

6392
02:14:36,470 --> 02:14:36,480
first two might count as a win. They're
 

6393
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:39,270
first two might count as a win. They're
not. They're break even. The third one

6394
02:14:39,270 --> 02:14:39,280
not. They're break even. The third one
 

6395
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:41,030
not. They're break even. The third one
goes for me. Or sometimes it doesn't and

6396
02:14:41,030 --> 02:14:41,040
goes for me. Or sometimes it doesn't and
 

6397
02:14:41,040 --> 02:14:43,350
goes for me. Or sometimes it doesn't and
then I miss it, you know. Yeah, I'm live

6398
02:14:43,350 --> 02:14:43,360
then I miss it, you know. Yeah, I'm live

Almost at 1,000. Let's get this up to

6410
02:14:57,750 --> 02:14:57,760
Almost at 1,000. Let's get this up to
 

6411

Almost at 1,000. Let's get this up to
1,000 likes if we can.

6412
02:15:02,950 --> 02:15:02,960

 

6413
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:05,030

Is this all CPI positioning? Lots of

6414
02:15:05,030 --> 02:15:05,040
Is this all CPI positioning? Lots of
 

6415
02:15:05,040 --> 02:15:07,589
Is this all CPI positioning? Lots of
stops to tear through tomorrow. I mean,

6416
02:15:07,589 --> 02:15:07,599
stops to tear through tomorrow. I mean,
 

6417
02:15:07,599 --> 02:15:10,149
stops to tear through tomorrow. I mean,
maybe. But like I said, we've just left

6418
02:15:10,149 --> 02:15:10,159
maybe. But like I said, we've just left
 

6419
02:15:10,159 --> 02:15:12,069
maybe. But like I said, we've just left
all the volume. I mean, even if we te

6420
02:15:12,069 --> 02:15:12,079
all the volume. I mean, even if we te
 

6421
02:15:12,079 --> 02:15:14,870
all the volume. I mean, even if we te
even if we hit this target today and

6422
02:15:14,870 --> 02:15:14,880
even if we hit this target today and
 

6423
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:16,550
even if we hit this target today and
turn around, where are we going to turn

6424
02:15:16,550 --> 02:15:16,560
turn around, where are we going to turn
 

6425
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:19,510
turn around, where are we going to turn
around to? 25,200. What do we expect to

6426
02:15:19,510 --> 02:15:19,520
around to? 25,200. What do we expect to
 

6427
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:23,750
around to? 25,200. What do we expect to
happen there? Sell, right? Sell. So, we

6428
02:15:23,750 --> 02:15:23,760
happen there? Sell, right? Sell. So, we
 

6429
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:25,109
happen there? Sell, right? Sell. So, we
can do exactly what you're saying,

6430
02:15:25,109 --> 02:15:25,119
can do exactly what you're saying,
 

6431
02:15:25,119 --> 02:15:27,350
can do exactly what you're saying,
controlled selling.

6432
02:15:27,350 --> 02:15:27,360
controlled selling.
 

6433
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:29,430
controlled selling.
Maybe today, maybe tomorrow. Right. They

6434
02:15:29,430 --> 02:15:29,440
Maybe today, maybe tomorrow. Right. They
 

6435
02:15:29,440 --> 02:15:32,550
Maybe today, maybe tomorrow. Right. They
might do this, but this is still a back

6436
02:15:32,550 --> 02:15:32,560
might do this, but this is still a back
 

6437
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:36,149
might do this, but this is still a back
test to sell then at that point. Right.

6438
02:15:36,149 --> 02:15:36,159
test to sell then at that point. Right.
 

6439
02:15:36,159 --> 02:15:37,669
test to sell then at that point. Right.
Right. Very, very close. Start moving

Right. Very, very close. Start moving
 

6441
02:15:37,679 --> 02:15:39,109
Right. Very, very close. Start moving
your stop down here a little bit. If I

6442
02:15:39,109 --> 02:15:39,119
your stop down here a little bit. If I
 

6443
02:15:39,119 --> 02:15:40,629
your stop down here a little bit. If I
was you, you were getting very, very

was you, you were getting very, very
 

6445
02:15:40,639 --> 02:15:42,069
was you, you were getting very, very
close. You don't want to give like too

6446
02:15:42,069 --> 02:15:42,079
close. You don't want to give like too
 

6447
02:15:42,079 --> 02:15:44,310
close. You don't want to give like too
much size back here. Oh, I wish it

6448
02:15:44,310 --> 02:15:44,320
much size back here. Oh, I wish it
 

6449
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:46,390
much size back here. Oh, I wish it
hadn't stopped me out on this. in his

hadn't stopped me out on this. in his
second day in a row

6452
02:15:53,589 --> 02:15:53,599

 

6453
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:56,229

the spy swings. Uh I mean VIX is still

02:15:56,229 --> 02:15:56,239
the spy swings. Uh I mean VIX is still
 

6455
02:15:56,239 --> 02:16:00,709
the spy swings. Uh I mean VIX is still
going. We're in the 20s. I mean

6456
02:16:00,709 --> 02:16:00,719
going. We're in the 20s. I mean
 

6457
02:16:00,719 --> 02:16:02,790
going. We're in the 20s. I mean
this market can really bleed guys. You

6458
02:16:02,790 --> 02:16:02,800
this market can really bleed guys. You
 

6459
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:04,950
this market can really bleed guys. You
have to understand that. Uh I wouldn't

6460
02:16:04,950 --> 02:16:04,960
have to understand that. Uh I wouldn't
 

6461
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:07,270
have to understand that. Uh I wouldn't
be Can there be a re rebalance? Yeah.

6462
02:16:07,270 --> 02:16:07,280
be Can there be a re rebalance? Yeah.
 

6463
02:16:07,280 --> 02:16:09,189
be Can there be a re rebalance? Yeah.
But what if CPI is bad and and we go

6464
02:16:09,189 --> 02:16:09,199
But what if CPI is bad and and we go
 

6465
02:16:09,199 --> 02:16:11,189
But what if CPI is bad and and we go
really risk off? A lot of you guys might

6466
02:16:11,189 --> 02:16:11,199
really risk off? A lot of you guys might
 

6467
02:16:11,199 --> 02:16:13,830
really risk off? A lot of you guys might

02:22:44,080 --> 02:22:47,110
come to here. And this can go gray.
It needs to be thinner technically, but

6774
02:22:47,110 --> 02:22:47,120
It needs to be thinner technically, but
 

6775
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:48,389
It needs to be thinner technically, but
I would not be bidding on this

6776
02:22:48,389 --> 02:22:48,399
I would not be bidding on this
 

6777
02:22:48,399 --> 02:22:51,750
I would not be bidding on this
personally.

6778
02:22:51,750 --> 02:22:51,760

 

6779
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:53,830

How do you set up runners on the stop

6780
02:22:53,830 --> 02:22:53,840
How do you set up runners on the stop
 

6781
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:56,630
How do you set up runners on the stop
strategy on NT? Uh if you go to the ATM

6782
02:22:56,630 --> 02:22:56,640
strategy on NT? Uh if you go to the ATM
 

6783
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:59,110
strategy on NT? Uh if you go to the ATM
strategy, you can split them into the

6784
02:22:59,110 --> 02:22:59,120
strategy, you can split them into the
 

6785
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:02,630
strategy, you can split them into the
amount of uh like TPS you have and you

6786
02:23:02,630 --> 02:23:02,640
amount of uh like TPS you have and you
 

6787
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:04,389
amount of uh like TPS you have and you
can set them to like 50 points, 75

6788
02:23:04,389 --> 02:23:04,399
can set them to like 50 points, 75
 

6789
02:23:04,399 --> 02:23:05,670
can set them to like 50 points, 75
points, 100 points and then you just

6790
02:23:05,670 --> 02:23:05,680
points, 100 points and then you just
 

6791
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:07,110
points, 100 points and then you just
drag them on your screen to where you

6792
02:23:07,110 --> 02:23:07,120
drag them on your screen to where you
 

6793
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:12,550
drag them on your screen to where you
see liquidity being

6794
02:23:12,550 --> 02:23:12,560

 

6795
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:16,070

6820
02:23:42,870 --> 02:23:42,880

 

6821
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:51,750

Tesla, how low can it go? Um,

6822
02:23:51,750 --> 02:23:51,760

 

6823
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:53,429

today, do you mean or in general? I

6824
02:23:53,429 --> 02:23:53,439
today, do you mean or in general? I
 

6825
02:23:53,439 --> 02:23:55,349
today, do you mean or in general? I
mean, you still look okay. You're still

6826
02:23:55,349 --> 02:23:55,359
mean, you still look okay. You're still
 

6827
02:23:55,359 --> 02:23:57,910
mean, you still look okay. You're still
holding 420s.

6828
02:23:57,910 --> 02:23:57,920
holding 420s.
 

6829
02:23:57,920 --> 02:23:59,590
holding 420s.
Remember that last pivot last week was

6830
02:23:59,590 --> 02:23:59,600
Remember that last pivot last week was
 

6831
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:01,590
Remember that last pivot last week was
down towards that 200 day. We still have

6832
02:24:01,590 --> 02:24:01,600
down towards that 200 day. We still have
 

6833
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:03,349
down towards that 200 day. We still have
not undercut, though. If you look at the

6834
02:24:03,349 --> 02:24:03,359
not undercut, though. If you look at the
 

6835
02:24:03,359 --> 02:24:05,750
not undercut, though. If you look at the
pivots on Tesla from November 21st,

6836
02:24:05,750 --> 02:24:05,760
pivots on Tesla from November 21st,
 

6837
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:07,510
pivots on Tesla from November 21st,
November 17th, you haven't undercut

6838
02:24:07,510 --> 02:24:07,520
November 17th, you haven't undercut
 

6839
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:09,830
November 17th, you haven't undercut
them. It might need to undercut those.

6840
02:24:09,830 --> 02:24:09,840
them. It might need to undercut those.
 

6841
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:12,230
them. It might need to undercut those.
If not, then you would need to see sort

6842
02:24:12,230 --> 02:24:12,240
If not, then you would need to see sort
 

6843
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:15,190
If not, then you would need to see sort
of 420s, 409s hold. So, I think if you

6844
02:24:15,190 --> 02:24:15,200
of 420s, 409s hold. So, I think if you
 

6845
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:16,389
of 420s, 409s hold. So, I think if you
start losing those, you're going to

6846
02:24:16,389 --> 02:24:16,399
start losing those, you're going to
 

6847
02:24:16,399 --> 02:24:20,550
start losing those, you're going to
undercut 385s and then you can fill down

6848
02:24:20,550 --> 02:24:20,560
undercut 385s and then you can fill down
 

6849
02:24:20,560 --> 02:24:24,630
undercut 385s and then you can fill down
to 370, 350 and lower. We have to just

6850
02:24:24,630 --> 02:24:24,640
to 370, 350 and lower. We have to just
 

6851
02:24:24,640 --> 02:24:26,630
to 370, 350 and lower. We have to just
see like it's just a sell day, folks.

6852
02:24:26,630 --> 02:24:26,640
see like it's just a sell day, folks.
 

6853
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:30,230
see like it's just a sell day, folks.

6856
02:24:32,710 --> 02:24:32,720
folks. It's just a sell day. It happens.
 

6857
02:24:32,720 --> 02:24:35,510
folks. It's just a sell day. It happens.

I will tell you
this thing

6874
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:03,280
this thing
 

6875
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:07,030
this thing
can come much much lower.

6876
02:25:07,030 --> 02:25:07,040
can come much much lower.
 

6877
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:10,230

and took a bit here. But this thing can
 

6883
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:19,270
and took a bit here. But this thing can
come down towards 30,000. And no, I am

you're new here, this is why thousand
 

6889
02:25:23,439 --> 02:25:25,510
you're new here, this is why thousand
day we we've done the thousand day plus

6890
02:25:25,510 --> 02:25:25,520
day we we've done the thousand day plus
 

6891
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:28,630
day we we've done the thousand day plus
cycle. We expect 70 to 80% pullback.

6892
02:25:28,630 --> 02:25:28,640
cycle. We expect 70 to 80% pullback.
 

6893
02:25:28,640 --> 02:25:31,910
cycle. We expect 70 to 80% pullback.
Thousand day cycle, 70 to 80% pullback.

6897
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:37,510
Thousand day cycle, 70 to 80% pullback.
Okay, this is why we've completed a,000

6898
02:25:37,510 --> 02:25:37,520
Okay, this is why we've completed a,000
 

6899
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:40,150
Okay, this is why we've completed a,000
day cycle. It is possible they do a 78

6900
02:25:40,150 --> 02:25:40,160
day cycle. It is possible they do a 78
 

6901
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:43,510
day cycle. It is possible they do a 78
to 80% pullback. Maybe they don't, maybe

6902
02:25:43,510 --> 02:25:43,520
to 80% pullback. Maybe they don't, maybe
 

6903
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:46,630
to 80% pullback. Maybe they don't, maybe
they don't, but I would not put it past

6904
02:25:46,630 --> 02:25:46,640
they don't, but I would not put it past
 

6905
02:25:46,640 --> 02:25:48,150
they don't, but I would not put it past
this thing being able to get down to

02:25:48,150 --> 02:25:48,160
this thing being able to get down to
 

6907
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:50,389
this thing being able to get down to
30,000. It might scare the [\h__\h] out of

6908
02:25:50,389 --> 02:25:50,399
30,000. It might scare the [\h__\h] out of
 

6909
02:25:50,399 --> 02:25:52,870
30,000. It might scare the [\h__\h] out of
you. It's very possible. Okay, it's

6913
02:25:58,479 --> 02:26:00,150

Market environments can change very

6914
02:26:00,150 --> 02:26:00,160
Market environments can change very
 

6915
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:04,070
Market environments can change very
quickly.

6916
02:26:04,070 --> 02:26:04,080

 

6917
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:06,309

Right, look at that bid off that red

6918
02:26:06,309 --> 02:26:06,319
Right, look at that bid off that red
 

6919
02:26:06,319 --> 02:26:09,510
Right, look at that bid off that red
line.

6920
02:26:09,510 --> 02:26:09,520

 

6921
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:11,830

Like I said, do not be a dick for a

6928
02:26:19,190 --> 02:26:19,200
Would I consider going long some stocks
 

6929
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:20,710
Would I consider going long some stocks
today? I mean, you could if you're

6930
02:26:20,710 --> 02:26:20,720
today? I mean, you could if you're
 

6931
02:26:20,720 --> 02:26:22,630
today? I mean, you could if you're
looking for a rebalance for tomorrow,

6932
02:26:22,630 --> 02:26:22,640
looking for a rebalance for tomorrow,
 

6933
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:25,429
looking for a rebalance for tomorrow,
but like I said, what happens if we're

6934
02:26:25,429 --> 02:26:25,439
but like I said, what happens if we're
 

6935
02:26:25,439 --> 02:26:26,710
but like I said, what happens if we're
if this is just the start of the

6936
02:26:26,710 --> 02:26:26,720
if this is just the start of the
 

6937
02:26:26,720 --> 02:26:29,429
if this is just the start of the
de-risking environment?

6938
02:26:29,429 --> 02:26:29,439
de-risking environment?
 

6939
02:26:29,439 --> 02:26:31,990
de-risking environment?
What happens? You're just fishing,

6940
02:26:31,990 --> 02:26:32,000
What happens? You're just fishing,
 

6941
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:37,270
What happens? You're just fishing,
right? Are you fishing off structure?

6942
02:26:37,270 --> 02:26:37,280

 

6943
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:40,710

We just faded value. So for me on uh

6944
02:26:40,710 --> 02:26:40,720
We just faded value. So for me on uh
 

6945
02:26:40,720 --> 02:26:42,710
We just faded value. So for me on uh
Ninja Trader, we just tap value area low

6946
02:26:42,710 --> 02:26:42,720
Ninja Trader, we just tap value area low
 

6947
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:46,469
Ninja Trader, we just tap value area low
and fail and we're failing it.

6948
02:26:46,469 --> 02:26:46,479
and fail and we're failing it.
 

6949
02:26:46,479 --> 02:26:47,990
and fail and we're failing it.

6950
02:26:47,990 --> 02:26:48,000
So you need to see a higher low here.
 

6951
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:49,510
So you need to see a higher low here.
You would need to see if you're adamant

6952
02:26:49,510 --> 02:26:49,520
You would need to see if you're adamant
 

6953
02:26:49,520 --> 02:26:52,150
You would need to see if you're adamant
on going long, which I am not. But if

6954
02:26:52,150 --> 02:26:52,160

6955
02:26:52,160 --> 02:26:53,750

6959
02:26:57,200 --> 02:27:00,309

that, I don't see how this holds up.

6960
02:27:00,309 --> 02:27:00,319
that, I don't see how this holds up.
 

6961
02:27:00,319 --> 02:27:01,590
that, I don't see how this holds up.

02:30:40,309 --> 02:30:40,319
We are pretty much right there. And move
 

7133
02:30:40,319 --> 02:30:41,990
We are pretty much right there. And move
you to a daily. We're very, very close.

7135
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,550

Right. We're very, very close. So, think

7136
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:44,560
Right. We're very, very close. So, think
 

7137
02:30:44,560 --> 02:30:46,950
Right. We're very, very close. So, think
about what we've done.

7138
02:30:46,950 --> 02:30:46,960
about what we've done.
 

7139

All right, mean reversion
fail Ballinger. Right, we don't expect

02:30:53,190 --> 02:30:53,200
fail Ballinger. Right, we don't expect
 

7143
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:55,110

this is a two standard deviation move.

7144
02:30:55,110 --> 02:30:55,120
this is a two standard deviation move.
 

7145
02:30:55,120 --> 02:30:57,030
this is a two standard deviation move.
We don't expect it to move down under

7146
02:30:57,030 --> 02:30:57,040
We don't expect it to move down under
 

7147
02:30:57,040 --> 02:30:59,429
We don't expect it to move down under
that. If we get black swan events, if

7148
02:30:59,429 --> 02:30:59,439
that. If we get black swan events, if
 

7149
02:30:59,439 --> 02:31:01,670
that. If we get black swan events, if
CPI, etc., etc. give us black swan

7151
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:03,910
CPI, etc., etc. give us black swan
events, we will do we will expand this

7152
02:31:03,910 --> 02:31:03,920
events, we will do we will expand this
 

7153
02:31:03,920 --> 02:31:05,429
events, we will do we will expand this
Ballinger band, right? We will we will

7154
02:31:05,429 --> 02:31:05,439
Ballinger band, right? We will we will
 

7155
02:31:05,439 --> 02:31:06,950
Ballinger band, right? We will we will
do this and we might undercut it first

7156
02:31:06,950 --> 02:31:06,960
do this and we might undercut it first
 

7157
02:31:06,960 --> 02:31:09,429
do this and we might undercut it first
and then do this in the 5day and 20-day

7158
02:31:09,429 --> 02:31:09,439
and then do this in the 5day and 20-day
 

7159
02:31:09,439 --> 02:31:11,030
and then do this in the 5day and 20-day
and we'll support this action down. All

7160
02:31:11,030 --> 02:31:11,040
and we'll support this action down. All
 

7161
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:12,469
and we'll support this action down. All
right, when's the last time we saw that?

7162
02:31:12,469 --> 02:31:12,479
right, when's the last time we saw that?
 

7163
02:31:12,479 --> 02:31:14,550
right, when's the last time we saw that?
We can have a look.

7164
02:31:14,550 --> 02:31:14,560
We can have a look.
 

7165
02:31:14,560 --> 02:31:20,230
We can have a look.

Okay, here. Same kind of thing. I'll
 

7171
02:31:26,800 --> 02:31:29,510
Okay, here. Same kind of thing. I'll
delete that for a second.

7172
02:31:29,510 --> 02:31:29,520

Ballinger to start supporting that kind

7186
02:31:45,750 --> 02:31:45,760
Ballinger to start supporting that kind
 

7187
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:48,230
Ballinger to start supporting that kind
of work here as well. Sometimes you get,

7188
02:31:48,230 --> 02:31:48,240
of work here as well. Sometimes you get,
 

7189
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:50,070
of work here as well. Sometimes you get,
you know, wicks underneath. We don't

7190
02:31:50,070 --> 02:31:50,080
you know, wicks underneath. We don't
 

7191
02:31:50,080 --> 02:31:51,830
you know, wicks underneath. We don't
expect to trade under it. Sometimes

7192
02:31:51,830 --> 02:31:51,840
expect to trade under it. Sometimes
 

7193
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:53,429
expect to trade under it. Sometimes
we'll get black swan. Co would have been

7194
02:31:53,429 --> 02:31:53,439
we'll get black swan. Co would have been
 

7195
02:31:53,439 --> 02:31:57,030
we'll get black swan. Co would have been
one. If we go back to 20,

7196
02:31:57,030 --> 02:31:57,040
one. If we go back to 20,
 

7197
02:31:57,040 --> 02:32:00,630
one. If we go back to 20,
was this it? Co. Yeah, that was probably

7198
02:32:00,630 --> 02:32:00,640
was this it? Co. Yeah, that was probably
 

7199
02:32:00,640 --> 02:32:02,710
was this it? Co. Yeah, that was probably
one. Even then, it held the bowl pretty

7200
02:32:02,710 --> 02:32:02,720
one. Even then, it held the bowl pretty
 

7201
02:32:02,720 --> 02:32:05,590
one. Even then, it held the bowl pretty
well.

7202
02:32:05,590 --> 02:32:05,600
well.
 

7203
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:08,469
well.
All right. Just undercut it. Just

7204
02:32:08,469 --> 02:32:08,479
All right. Just undercut it. Just
 

7205
02:32:08,479 --> 02:32:12,230
All right. Just undercut it. Just
undercut it. All right. So

7206
02:32:12,230 --> 02:32:12,240
undercut it. All right. So
 

7207
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:15,030
undercut it. All right. So
can happen but uh you'll see the bowls

7208
02:32:15,030 --> 02:32:15,040
can happen but uh you'll see the bowls
 

7209
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:17,349
can happen but uh you'll see the bowls
are very important. We don't like doing

7210
02:32:17,349 --> 02:32:17,359
are very important. We don't like doing
 

7211
02:32:17,359 --> 02:32:19,110
are very important. We don't like doing
more than two standard deviations. Even

7212
02:32:19,110 --> 02:32:19,120
more than two standard deviations. Even
 

7213
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:22,150
more than two standard deviations. Even
here 2018 even 08 I think we held the

7214
02:32:22,150 --> 02:32:22,160
here 2018 even 08 I think we held the
 

7215
02:32:22,160 --> 02:32:29,110
here 2018 even 08 I think we held the
bowls.

7216
02:32:29,110 --> 02:32:29,120

 

7217
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:31,910

Is this the bowls 08? Yeah. Right. Even

7218
02:32:31,910 --> 02:32:31,920
Is this the bowls 08? Yeah. Right. Even
 

7219
02:32:31,920 --> 02:32:34,630
Is this the bowls 08? Yeah. Right. Even
08 financial crash we held the bowls.

7220
02:32:34,630 --> 02:32:34,640
08 financial crash we held the bowls.
 

7221
02:32:34,640 --> 02:32:36,389
08 financial crash we held the bowls.
Right. Look at the bowls and 20 day.

7222
02:32:36,389 --> 02:32:36,399
Right. Look at the bowls and 20 day.
 

7223
02:32:36,399 --> 02:32:38,389
Right. Look at the bowls and 20 day.
It's always the same guys. It's always

7224
02:32:38,389 --> 02:32:38,399
It's always the same guys. It's always
 

7225
02:32:38,399 --> 02:32:40,469
It's always the same guys. It's always
the same. So, if it's always the same,

7226
02:32:40,469 --> 02:32:40,479
the same. So, if it's always the same,
 

7227

there is some selling caught, but not a

7322
02:35:11,510 --> 02:35:11,520
there is some selling caught, but not a
 

7323
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:14,870
there is some selling caught, but not a
lot. Right down here, not a lot. There's

02:35:14,870 --> 02:35:14,880
lot. Right down here, not a lot. There's
 

7325
02:35:14,880 --> 02:35:16,469

a couple guys caught, but like I said,

7326
02:35:16,469 --> 02:35:16,479
a couple guys caught, but like I said,
 

7327
02:35:16,479 --> 02:35:19,030
a couple guys caught, but like I said,
if they hold 60 to 40s, that might be

7328
02:35:19,030 --> 02:35:19,040
if they hold 60 to 40s, that might be
 

7329
02:35:19,040 --> 02:35:20,309
if they hold 60 to 40s, that might be
your first higher low. So, you can see

7330
02:35:20,309 --> 02:35:20,319
your first higher low. So, you can see
 

7331
02:35:20,319 --> 02:35:22,389
your first higher low. So, you can see
sellers piling in at the moment. If they

7332
02:35:22,389 --> 02:35:22,399
sellers piling in at the moment. If they
 

7333
02:35:22,399 --> 02:35:24,710
sellers piling in at the moment. If they
hold 60 to 40, it might be the first

7334
02:35:24,710 --> 02:35:24,720
hold 60 to 40, it might be the first
 

7335
02:35:24,720 --> 02:35:26,389
hold 60 to 40, it might be the first
higher low. And then if they get relief

7336
02:35:26,389 --> 02:35:26,399
higher low. And then if they get relief
 

7337
02:35:26,399 --> 02:35:28,550
higher low. And then if they get relief
back inside here, then. So if they hold

7338
02:35:28,550 --> 02:35:28,560
back inside here, then. So if they hold
 

7339
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:30,950
back inside here, then. So if they hold

7345
02:35:34,399 --> 02:35:37,590
to do. It's why we kept saying if they
hold 60s to 40s but again I would not

7346
02:35:37,590 --> 02:35:37,600
hold 60s to 40s but again I would not

02:35:41,750 --> 02:35:41,760
is where they will need to hold if
 

7351
02:35:41,760 --> 02:35:43,110
is where they will need to hold if
they're going to do that move. We are

participants where this seller came in.
 

7649
02:42:22,240 --> 02:42:24,710
participants where this seller came in.
Remember we said 60s to 40s. Another

7650
02:42:24,710 --> 02:42:24,720
Remember we said 60s to 40s. Another
 

7651
02:42:24,720 --> 02:42:26,070
Remember we said 60s to 40s. Another
seller came in. They're still trying to

7652
02:42:26,070 --> 02:42:26,080
seller came in. They're still trying to
 

7653
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:28,150
seller came in. They're still trying to
absorb 60s to 40s. Right now, buyers

7654
02:42:28,150 --> 02:42:28,160
absorb 60s to 40s. Right now, buyers
 

7655
02:42:28,160 --> 02:42:30,630
absorb 60s to 40s. Right now, buyers
know if they absorb that and they pivot

7656
02:42:30,630 --> 02:42:30,640
know if they absorb that and they pivot
 

7657
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:33,349
know if they absorb that and they pivot
over 900, they have a squeeze. If they

7658
02:42:33,349 --> 02:42:33,359
over 900, they have a squeeze. If they
 

7659
02:42:33,359 --> 02:42:35,590
over 900, they have a squeeze. If they
fail 60s to 40s, there will be a reflush

7660
02:42:35,590 --> 02:42:35,600
fail 60s to 40s, there will be a reflush
 

7661
02:42:35,600 --> 02:42:37,349
fail 60s to 40s, there will be a reflush
all the way down here and fill some of

7662
02:42:37,349 --> 02:42:37,359
all the way down here and fill some of
 

7663
02:42:37,359 --> 02:42:38,950
all the way down here and fill some of
these imbalances. All right. Bids

7664
02:42:38,950 --> 02:42:38,960
these imbalances. All right. Bids
 

7665
02:42:38,960 --> 02:42:40,070
these imbalances. All right. Bids
underneath. I'm going to have a quick

7666
02:42:40,070 --> 02:42:40,080
underneath. I'm going to have a quick
 

7667
02:42:40,080 --> 02:42:43,110
underneath. I'm going to have a quick
look. There is a bid at 800, a 550 lot,

7668
02:42:43,110 --> 02:42:43,120
look. There is a bid at 800, a 550 lot,
 

7669
02:42:43,120 --> 02:42:45,030
look. There is a bid at 800, a 550 lot,
and there's a 100 lot at 780. I'm

7670
02:42:45,030 --> 02:42:45,040
and there's a 100 lot at 780. I'm
 

7671
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:47,429
and there's a 100 lot at 780. I'm
keeping going down. And then there is a

7672
02:42:47,429 --> 02:42:47,439
keeping going down. And then there is a
 

7673
02:42:47,439 --> 02:42:49,750
keeping going down. And then there is a
bid at 700. All right. So, there are

7674
02:42:49,750 --> 02:42:49,760
bid at 700. All right. So, there are
 

7675
02:42:49,760 --> 02:42:51,429
bid at 700. All right. So, there are
bids lower. You might get a breakdown if

7676
02:42:51,429 --> 02:42:51,439
bids lower. You might get a breakdown if
 

7677
02:42:51,439 --> 02:42:54,070
bids lower. You might get a breakdown if
they uh can get under these 40s. I would

7678
02:42:54,070 --> 02:42:54,080
they uh can get under these 40s. I would
 

7679
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:55,750
they uh can get under these 40s. I would

7738
02:44:32,150 --> 02:44:32,160
of patience and watching waiting? I
 

7739
02:44:32,160 --> 02:44:34,710
of patience and watching waiting? I
watch my setups come and go and never

7740
02:44:34,710 --> 02:44:34,720
watch my setups come and go and never
 

7741
02:44:34,720 --> 02:44:36,550
watch my setups come and go and never
take them and play out perfectly. It's

7742
02:44:36,550 --> 02:44:36,560
take them and play out perfectly. It's
 

7743
02:44:36,560 --> 02:44:40,710
take them and play out perfectly. It's
like I give myself PTSD. Um, so you're

7744
02:44:40,710 --> 02:44:40,720
like I give myself PTSD. Um, so you're
 

7745
02:44:40,720 --> 02:44:43,830
like I give myself PTSD. Um, so you're
not taking the setups, you're saying.

7746
02:44:43,830 --> 02:44:43,840
not taking the setups, you're saying.
 

7747
02:44:43,840 --> 02:44:45,670
not taking the setups, you're saying.
So you are you waiting or you're not

7748
02:44:45,670 --> 02:44:45,680
So you are you waiting or you're not
 

7749
02:44:45,680 --> 02:44:47,590
So you are you waiting or you're not
waiting? So you're watching and waiting.

7750
02:44:47,590 --> 02:44:47,600
waiting? So you're watching and waiting.
 

7751
02:44:47,600 --> 02:44:49,590
waiting? So you're watching and waiting.
I watch my setups come and go. So that

7752
02:44:49,590 --> 02:44:49,600
I watch my setups come and go. So that
 

7753
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:50,950
I watch my setups come and go. So that
means like you're not taking them by the

7754
02:44:50,950 --> 02:44:50,960
means like you're not taking them by the
 

7755
02:44:50,960 --> 02:44:52,710
means like you're not taking them by the
sounds of it. You need to get you need

7756
02:44:52,710 --> 02:44:52,720
sounds of it. You need to get you need
 

7757
02:44:52,720 --> 02:44:54,790
sounds of it. You need to get you need
to start putting risk on. If you see

7758
02:44:54,790 --> 02:44:54,800
to start putting risk on. If you see
 

7759
02:44:54,800 --> 02:44:58,230
to start putting risk on. If you see
your setup Start sim. Prove to yourself

7760
02:44:58,230 --> 02:44:58,240
your setup Start sim. Prove to yourself
 

7761
02:44:58,240 --> 02:45:00,150
your setup Start sim. Prove to yourself
that you understand your setup. Then

7762
02:45:00,150 --> 02:45:00,160
that you understand your setup. Then
 

7763
02:45:00,160 --> 02:45:02,870
that you understand your setup. Then
start with one micro. All right? And get

7764
02:45:02,870 --> 02:45:02,880
start with one micro. All right? And get
 

7765
02:45:02,880 --> 02:45:04,389
start with one micro. All right? And get
used to taking that setup so that you

7766
02:45:04,389 --> 02:45:04,399
used to taking that setup so that you
 

7767
02:45:04,399 --> 02:45:07,269
used to taking that setup so that you
get you got to build up your tolerance.

7768
02:45:07,269 --> 02:45:07,279
get you got to build up your tolerance.
 

7769
02:45:07,279 --> 02:45:08,950
get you got to build up your tolerance.
You have to build up your tolerance. You

7770
02:45:08,950 --> 02:45:08,960
You have to build up your tolerance. You
 

7771
02:45:08,960 --> 02:45:10,710
You have to build up your tolerance. You
don't want to be putting trades on and

7772
02:45:10,710 --> 02:45:10,720
don't want to be putting trades on and
 

7773
02:45:10,720 --> 02:45:12,230
don't want to be putting trades on and
instantly feeling anxious. And when you

7774
02:45:12,230 --> 02:45:12,240
instantly feeling anxious. And when you
 

7775
02:45:12,240 --> 02:45:14,070
instantly feeling anxious. And when you
start trading, you probably will feel

7776
02:45:14,070 --> 02:45:14,080
start trading, you probably will feel
 

7777
02:45:14,080 --> 02:45:15,910
start trading, you probably will feel
like that. And if you start trading with

7778
02:45:15,910 --> 02:45:15,920
like that. And if you start trading with
 

7779
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:17,830
like that. And if you start trading with
too much size, you will really feel like

7780
02:45:17,830 --> 02:45:17,840
too much size, you will really feel like
 

7781
02:45:17,840 --> 02:45:19,910
too much size, you will really feel like
that, right? So, you need to get used to

7782
02:45:19,910 --> 02:45:19,920
that, right? So, you need to get used to
 

7783
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:21,990
that, right? So, you need to get used to
like putting risk on, having your stop

7784
02:45:21,990 --> 02:45:22,000
like putting risk on, having your stop
 

7785
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:23,269
like putting risk on, having your stop
in the right position. Be like, "Okay,

7786
02:45:23,269 --> 02:45:23,279
in the right position. Be like, "Okay,
 

7787
02:45:23,279 --> 02:45:26,070
in the right position. Be like, "Okay,
I'm going to risk $100 on this trade.

7788
02:45:26,070 --> 02:45:26,080
I'm going to risk $100 on this trade.
 

7789
02:45:26,080 --> 02:45:27,750
I'm going to risk $100 on this trade.
There's my stop. There's the swing

7790
02:45:27,750 --> 02:45:27,760
There's my stop. There's the swing
 

7791
02:45:27,760 --> 02:45:29,990
There's my stop. There's the swing
point. That makes sense. I'm in this. If

7792
02:45:29,990 --> 02:45:30,000
point. That makes sense. I'm in this. If
 

7793
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,309
point. That makes sense. I'm in this. If
I lose that trade, I lose $100. I'm

7794
02:45:32,309 --> 02:45:32,319
I lose that trade, I lose $100. I'm
 

7795
02:45:32,319 --> 02:45:34,550
I lose that trade, I lose $100. I'm
absolutely fine with that." All right.

7796
02:45:34,550 --> 02:45:34,560
absolutely fine with that." All right.
 

7797
02:45:34,560 --> 02:45:37,190
absolutely fine with that." All right.
What you don't want to do is put risk on

7798
02:45:37,190 --> 02:45:37,200
What you don't want to do is put risk on
 

7799
02:45:37,200 --> 02:45:40,150
What you don't want to do is put risk on
and be like, "Uh, my stop's there. It's

7800
02:45:40,150 --> 02:45:40,160
and be like, "Uh, my stop's there. It's
 

7801
02:45:40,160 --> 02:45:42,550
and be like, "Uh, my stop's there. It's
five grand. [\h__\h] I'm anxious. I can't

7803
02:45:42,560 --> 02:45:44,230

afford to lose that." Take the trade

7804
02:45:44,230 --> 02:45:44,240
afford to lose that." Take the trade
 

7805
02:45:44,240 --> 02:45:46,389
afford to lose that." Take the trade
off. Right? So, that's why I say size

7806
02:45:46,389 --> 02:45:46,399
off. Right? So, that's why I say size
 

7807
02:45:46,399 --> 02:45:47,349
off. Right? So, that's why I say size
down. You've got to build up the

You start doing bench press. You don't

when we said about the longs? What I

7866
02:47:18,870 --> 02:47:18,880
when we said about the longs? What I
 

7867
02:47:18,880 --> 02:47:21,429
when we said about the longs? What I
would need to see is a lot of liquidity

7868
02:47:21,429 --> 02:47:21,439
would need to see is a lot of liquidity
 

7869
02:47:21,439 --> 02:47:24,469
would need to see is a lot of liquidity
build out

7870
02:47:24,469 --> 02:47:24,479
build out
 

7871
02:47:24,479 --> 02:47:27,670
build out
a swipe with bears entering in and a

7872
02:47:27,670 --> 02:47:27,680
a swipe with bears entering in and a
 

7873
02:47:27,680 --> 02:47:29,750
a swipe with bears entering in and a
recovery of that. So we now know bears

7874
02:47:29,750 --> 02:47:29,760
recovery of that. So we now know bears
 

7875
02:47:29,760 --> 02:47:31,269
recovery of that. So we now know bears
have entered at the lows. We've

7876
02:47:31,269 --> 02:47:31,279
have entered at the lows. We've
 

7877
02:47:31,279 --> 02:47:33,190
have entered at the lows. We've
recovered volume and we can look up.

7878
02:47:33,190 --> 02:47:33,200
recovered volume and we can look up.
 

7879
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:35,030
recovered volume and we can look up.
That's the only way I would look long.

7887
02:47:41,600 --> 02:47:44,230
about the psychology all the guys who
didn't get short up here with us

7888
02:47:44,230 --> 02:47:44,240
didn't get short up here with us
 

7889
02:47:44,240 --> 02:47:45,510
didn't get short up here with us
and now like right I'm going to short

7890
02:47:45,510 --> 02:47:45,520
and now like right I'm going to short
 

7891

the moment we are still holding 40s and

7896
02:47:52,070 --> 02:47:52,080
the moment we are still holding 40s and
 

7897
02:47:52,080 --> 02:47:53,670
the moment we are still holding 40s and
60s there is a chance they squeeze this

7898
02:47:53,670 --> 02:47:53,680
60s there is a chance they squeeze this
 

7899
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:55,429
60s there is a chance they squeeze this
up at the moment but the problem is

7900
02:47:55,429 --> 02:47:55,439
up at the moment but the problem is
 

7901
02:47:55,439 --> 02:47:57,429
up at the moment but the problem is
without swiping all of this out this can

7902
02:47:57,429 --> 02:47:57,439
without swiping all of this out this can
 

7903
02:47:57,439 --> 02:47:59,110
without swiping all of this out this can
be a second leg which is then just sold

7904
02:47:59,110 --> 02:47:59,120
be a second leg which is then just sold
 

7905
02:47:59,120 --> 02:48:01,750
be a second leg which is then just sold
back into all right but the most

8043
02:51:14,399 --> 02:51:16,469
here. Now, if they get through this,
there's a swipe. Like potentially over

8044
02:51:16,469 --> 02:51:16,479
there's a swipe. Like potentially over
 

8045
02:51:16,479 --> 02:51:17,990
there's a swipe. Like potentially over
lunch, they swipe it up a little bit. Be

8046
02:51:17,990 --> 02:51:18,000
lunch, they swipe it up a little bit. Be
 

8047
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,150

02:51:20,150 --> 02:51:20,160
very careful, though. Um, this is just
 

8049
02:51:20,160 --> 02:51:22,870
very careful, though. Um, this is just
how the market works. It's not like this

8050
02:51:22,870 --> 02:51:22,880
how the market works. It's not like this
 

8051
02:51:22,880 --> 02:51:24,710
how the market works. It's not like this
is how I play it, but this is how all

8052
02:51:24,710 --> 02:51:24,720
is how I play it, but this is how all
 

8053
02:51:24,720 --> 02:51:27,670
is how I play it, but this is how all
markets work, right? All markets work

8054
02:51:27,670 --> 02:51:27,680
markets work, right? All markets work
 

8055
02:51:27,680 --> 02:51:30,070
markets work, right? All markets work
the same way. So, like we always talk

8056
02:51:30,070 --> 02:51:30,080
the same way. So, like we always talk
 

8057
02:51:30,080 --> 02:51:31,990
the same way. So, like we always talk
about, it doesn't matter if it's gold,

8058
02:51:31,990 --> 02:51:32,000
about, it doesn't matter if it's gold,
 

8059
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,230
about, it doesn't matter if it's gold,
if it's a physical asset, if it's oil,

8060
02:51:34,230 --> 02:51:34,240
if it's a physical asset, if it's oil,
 

8061
02:51:34,240 --> 02:51:36,790
if it's a physical asset, if it's oil,
if it's anything, right? If we deem this

8062
02:51:36,790 --> 02:51:36,800
if it's anything, right? If we deem this
 

8063
02:51:36,800 --> 02:51:38,870
if it's anything, right? If we deem this
price is too expensive and too many

8064
02:51:38,870 --> 02:51:38,880
price is too expensive and too many
 

8065
02:51:38,880 --> 02:51:41,110
price is too expensive and too many

that's the same price. I know this is

8094
02:52:10,230 --> 02:52:10,240
that's the same price. I know this is
 

8095
02:52:10,240 --> 02:52:11,670
that's the same price. I know this is
previous week. Let's just pretend it's

8096
02:52:11,670 --> 02:52:11,680
previous week. Let's just pretend it's
 

8097
02:52:11,680 --> 02:52:13,590
previous week. Let's just pretend it's
COVID. It's now the same price as it was

8098
02:52:13,590 --> 02:52:13,600
COVID. It's now the same price as it was
 

8099
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:16,870
COVID. It's now the same price as it was
in 2016. Oh, that's fair value. We like

8100
02:52:16,870 --> 02:52:16,880
in 2016. Oh, that's fair value. We like
 

8101
02:52:16,880 --> 02:52:19,910
in 2016. Oh, that's fair value. We like
that. We'll buy that at 20K and hope

8102
02:52:19,910 --> 02:52:19,920
that. We'll buy that at 20K and hope
 

8103
02:52:19,920 --> 02:52:22,070
that. We'll buy that at 20K and hope
that we get back up somewhere towards 30

8104
02:52:22,070 --> 02:52:22,080
that we get back up somewhere towards 30
 

8105
02:52:22,080 --> 02:52:24,469
that we get back up somewhere towards 30
or 40 or 50K and then we sell. It is an

8106
02:52:24,469 --> 02:52:24,479
or 40 or 50K and then we sell. It is an
 

8107
02:52:24,479 --> 02:52:26,309
or 40 or 50K and then we sell. It is an
auction. We leave one side of the

8108
02:52:26,309 --> 02:52:26,319
auction. We leave one side of the
 

8109
02:52:26,319 --> 02:52:27,830
auction. We leave one side of the
auction because we're too expensive. We

8110
02:52:27,830 --> 02:52:27,840
auction because we're too expensive. We
 

8111
02:52:27,840 --> 02:52:30,070
auction because we're too expensive. We
search for fair value. Fair value is

8112
02:52:30,070 --> 02:52:30,080
search for fair value. Fair value is
 

8113
02:52:30,080 --> 02:52:32,070
search for fair value. Fair value is
deemed by price going sideways for a

8114
02:52:32,070 --> 02:52:32,080
deemed by price going sideways for a
 

8115
02:52:32,080 --> 02:52:34,870
deemed by price going sideways for a
bit. If we deem this too cheap, we will

8116
02:52:34,870 --> 02:52:34,880
bit. If we deem this too cheap, we will
 

8117
02:52:34,880 --> 02:52:37,030
bit. If we deem this too cheap, we will
leave fair value and look for fair value

8118
02:52:37,030 --> 02:52:37,040
leave fair value and look for fair value
 

8119
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:38,710
leave fair value and look for fair value
somewhere else, which might be here. For

8120
02:52:38,710 --> 02:52:38,720
somewhere else, which might be here. For
 

8121
02:52:38,720 --> 02:52:40,950
somewhere else, which might be here. For
example, it doesn't matter what you're

8122
02:52:40,950 --> 02:52:40,960
example, it doesn't matter what you're
 

8123
02:52:40,960 --> 02:52:42,309
example, it doesn't matter what you're
trading, what you're talking about. It's

8124
02:52:42,309 --> 02:52:42,319
trading, what you're talking about. It's
 

8125
02:52:42,319 --> 02:52:44,950
trading, what you're talking about. It's
the same thing. Think about this. Think

8126
02:52:44,950 --> 02:52:44,960
the same thing. Think about this. Think
 

8127
02:52:44,960 --> 02:52:47,349
the same thing. Think about this. Think
about the very basics of a like a

8128
02:52:47,349 --> 02:52:47,359
about the very basics of a like a
 

8129
02:52:47,359 --> 02:52:49,110
about the very basics of a like a
market. Like for me, I always talk about

8130
02:52:49,110 --> 02:52:49,120
market. Like for me, I always talk about
 

8131
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:50,389
market. Like for me, I always talk about
Ridley Road market because I used to

8132
02:52:50,389 --> 02:52:50,399
Ridley Road market because I used to
 

8133
02:52:50,399 --> 02:52:51,910
Ridley Road market because I used to
live in Dston. But think about your

8134
02:52:51,910 --> 02:52:51,920
live in Dston. But think about your
 

8135
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:54,550
live in Dston. But think about your
local market or or fair that you go to,

8136
02:52:54,550 --> 02:52:54,560
local market or or fair that you go to,
 

8137
02:52:54,560 --> 02:52:57,349
local market or or fair that you go to,
okay? That selling apples and pears,

8138
02:52:57,349 --> 02:52:57,359
okay? That selling apples and pears,
 

8139
02:52:57,359 --> 02:52:58,870
okay? That selling apples and pears,
right? Just think about this. This might

8140
02:52:58,870 --> 02:52:58,880
right? Just think about this. This might
 

8141
02:52:58,880 --> 02:53:00,550
right? Just think about this. This might
be stupid, but just hear me out. They're

8142
02:53:00,550 --> 02:53:00,560
be stupid, but just hear me out. They're
 

8143
02:53:00,560 --> 02:53:02,790
be stupid, but just hear me out. They're
selling apples and pears, a fruit store,

8144
02:53:02,790 --> 02:53:02,800
selling apples and pears, a fruit store,
 

8145
02:53:02,800 --> 02:53:05,830
selling apples and pears, a fruit store,
all right? And it's like up here, maybe

8146
02:53:05,830 --> 02:53:05,840
all right? And it's like up here, maybe
 

8147
02:53:05,840 --> 02:53:08,950
all right? And it's like up here, maybe
it's five apples

8148
02:53:08,950 --> 02:53:08,960
it's five apples
 

8149
02:53:08,960 --> 02:53:12,550
it's five apples
for $10. All right.

8150
02:53:12,550 --> 02:53:12,560
for $10. All right.
 

8151
02:53:12,560 --> 02:53:14,630
for $10. All right.
Right. But it gets to end of day and

8152
02:53:14,630 --> 02:53:14,640
Right. But it gets to end of day and
 

8153
02:53:14,640 --> 02:53:15,990
Right. But it gets to end of day and
they want to dump their inventory.

8154
02:53:15,990 --> 02:53:16,000
they want to dump their inventory.
 

8155
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:17,030
they want to dump their inventory.
They're like, "We don't want to sell

8156
02:53:17,030 --> 02:53:17,040
They're like, "We don't want to sell
 

8157
02:53:17,040 --> 02:53:18,710
They're like, "We don't want to sell
these apples tomorrow. They're not worth

8158
02:53:18,710 --> 02:53:18,720
these apples tomorrow. They're not worth
 

8159
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:21,030
these apples tomorrow. They're not worth
as much." So, at the end of day, it's

8160
02:53:21,030 --> 02:53:21,040
as much." So, at the end of day, it's
 

8161
02:53:21,040 --> 02:53:24,309
as much." So, at the end of day, it's
five apples for $1. All right? Cuz

8162
02:53:24,309 --> 02:53:24,319
five apples for $1. All right? Cuz
 

8163
02:53:24,319 --> 02:53:25,510
five apples for $1. All right? Cuz
they're like, "Let's get let's get rid

8164
02:53:25,510 --> 02:53:25,520
they're like, "Let's get let's get rid
 

8165
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:27,110
they're like, "Let's get let's get rid
of this. We don't want to hold this,

8166
02:53:27,110 --> 02:53:27,120
of this. We don't want to hold this,
 

8167
02:53:27,120 --> 02:53:28,950
of this. We don't want to hold this,
right? And we'll come back tomorrow."

8168
02:53:28,950 --> 02:53:28,960
right? And we'll come back tomorrow."
 

8169
02:53:28,960 --> 02:53:31,190
right? And we'll come back tomorrow."
That's that's like a good example of it.

8170
02:53:31,190 --> 02:53:31,200
That's that's like a good example of it.
 

8171
02:53:31,200 --> 02:53:33,190
That's that's like a good example of it.
And now everyone bought everyone waits.

8172
02:53:33,190 --> 02:53:33,200
And now everyone bought everyone waits.
 

8173
02:53:33,200 --> 02:53:34,309
And now everyone bought everyone waits.
They don't want to buy it here because

8174
02:53:34,309 --> 02:53:34,319
They don't want to buy it here because
 

8175
02:53:34,319 --> 02:53:36,389
They don't want to buy it here because
they know, hey, we know if we wait long

8176
02:53:36,389 --> 02:53:36,399
they know, hey, we know if we wait long
 

8177
02:53:36,399 --> 02:53:38,309
they know, hey, we know if we wait long
enough, we can get it for $1, for

8178
02:53:38,309 --> 02:53:38,319
enough, we can get it for $1, for
 

8179
02:53:38,319 --> 02:53:40,870
enough, we can get it for $1, for
example. Right? That is how the market

8180
02:53:40,870 --> 02:53:40,880
example. Right? That is how the market
 

8181
02:53:40,880 --> 02:53:42,870
example. Right? That is how the market
works. That is an auction. Doesn't

8182
02:53:42,870 --> 02:53:42,880
works. That is an auction. Doesn't
 

8183
02:53:42,880 --> 02:53:44,389
works. That is an auction. Doesn't
matter what you're trading. That's the

8184
02:53:44,389 --> 02:53:44,399
matter what you're trading. That's the
 

8185
02:53:44,399 --> 02:53:51,990
matter what you're trading. That's the
auction.

8186
02:53:51,990 --> 02:53:52,000

 

8187
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:53,830

How can you back test order flow or

8188
02:53:53,830 --> 02:53:53,840
How can you back test order flow or
 

8189
02:53:53,840 --> 02:53:56,230
How can you back test order flow or
practice without live markets? I don't

8190
02:53:56,230 --> 02:53:56,240
practice without live markets? I don't
 

8191
02:53:56,240 --> 02:53:58,150
practice without live markets? I don't
know if you can do it in Trading View. I

8192
02:53:58,150 --> 02:53:58,160
know if you can do it in Trading View. I
 

8193
02:53:58,160 --> 02:53:59,269
know if you can do it in Trading View. I
don't think you can do it in Trading

8194
02:53:59,269 --> 02:53:59,279
don't think you can do it in Trading
 

8195
02:53:59,279 --> 02:54:01,750
don't think you can do it in Trading
View. Um I'm not sure. I'm not sure how

8196
02:54:01,750 --> 02:54:01,760
View. Um I'm not sure. I'm not sure how
 

8197
02:54:01,760 --> 02:54:03,110
View. Um I'm not sure. I'm not sure how
you could necessarily back test it. I

8198
02:54:03,110 --> 02:54:03,120
you could necessarily back test it. I
 

8199
02:54:03,120 --> 02:54:04,550
you could necessarily back test it. I
think you dump lower here, folks. I

8200
02:54:04,550 --> 02:54:04,560
think you dump lower here, folks. I
 

8201
02:54:04,560 --> 02:54:05,510
think you dump lower here, folks. I
think you're going to come and take that

8202
02:54:05,510 --> 02:54:05,520
think you're going to come and take that
 

8203
02:54:05,520 --> 02:54:06,870
think you're going to come and take that
out. They're really trying to get under

8204
02:54:06,870 --> 02:54:06,880
out. They're really trying to get under
 

8205
02:54:06,880 --> 02:54:09,830
out. They're really trying to get under
these 40s.

8206
02:54:09,830 --> 02:54:09,840
these 40s.
 

8207
02:54:09,840 --> 02:54:11,750
these 40s.
Is there a method to recognizing a

8208
02:54:11,750 --> 02:54:11,760
Is there a method to recognizing a
 

8209
02:54:11,760 --> 02:54:14,389
Is there a method to recognizing a
V-shaped reversal? Vshape need to come

8210
02:54:14,389 --> 02:54:14,399
V-shaped reversal? Vshape need to come
 

8211
02:54:14,399 --> 02:54:17,269
V-shaped reversal? Vshape need to come
immediately after no drop or the Vshape

8212
02:54:17,269 --> 02:54:17,279
immediately after no drop or the Vshape
 

8213
02:54:17,279 --> 02:54:19,190
immediately after no drop or the Vshape
will be when there's big excess, right?

8214
02:54:19,190 --> 02:54:19,200
will be when there's big excess, right?
 

8215
02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:20,950
will be when there's big excess, right?
It's the same thing. So, if this is

8216
02:54:20,950 --> 02:54:20,960
It's the same thing. So, if this is
 

8217
02:54:20,960 --> 02:54:22,710
It's the same thing. So, if this is
fairly controlled, but if we done like

8218
02:54:22,710 --> 02:54:22,720
fairly controlled, but if we done like
 

8219
02:54:22,720 --> 02:54:26,230
fairly controlled, but if we done like
this down here, big wick and this is all

8220
02:54:26,230 --> 02:54:26,240
this down here, big wick and this is all
 

8221
02:54:26,240 --> 02:54:28,469
this down here, big wick and this is all
sellers, heavy sellers, and we turn

8222
02:54:28,469 --> 02:54:28,479
sellers, heavy sellers, and we turn
 

8223
02:54:28,479 --> 02:54:30,550
sellers, heavy sellers, and we turn
around and they're huge size, then they

8224
02:54:30,550 --> 02:54:30,560
around and they're huge size, then they
 

8225
02:54:30,560 --> 02:54:32,710
around and they're huge size, then they
will cover very quick. Right? This isn't

8226
02:54:32,710 --> 02:54:32,720
will cover very quick. Right? This isn't
 

8227
02:54:32,720 --> 02:54:35,750
will cover very quick. Right? This isn't
a Vshape. Now, this is potential if they

8228
02:54:35,750 --> 02:54:35,760
a Vshape. Now, this is potential if they
 

8229
02:54:35,760 --> 02:54:37,910
a Vshape. Now, this is potential if they
hold to do a bit of relief. But again,

8230
02:54:37,910 --> 02:54:37,920
hold to do a bit of relief. But again,
 

8231
02:54:37,920 --> 02:54:40,389
hold to do a bit of relief. But again,
you would have to expect respect every

8232
02:54:40,389 --> 02:54:40,399
you would have to expect respect every
 

8233
02:54:40,399 --> 02:54:43,670
you would have to expect respect every
single node in here. So they are

8234
02:54:43,670 --> 02:54:43,680
single node in here. So they are
 

8235
02:54:43,680 --> 02:54:45,590
single node in here. So they are
battling right now. They are really

8236
02:54:45,590 --> 02:54:45,600
battling right now. They are really
 

8237
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:46,790
battling right now. They are really
battling. I haven't looked at the order

8238
02:54:46,790 --> 02:54:46,800
battling. I haven't looked at the order
 

8239
02:54:46,800 --> 02:54:47,750
battling. I haven't looked at the order
flow for a minute. Let me just have a

8240
02:54:47,750 --> 02:54:47,760
flow for a minute. Let me just have a
 

8241
02:54:47,760 --> 02:54:50,230
flow for a minute. Let me just have a
look. This seller is still caught. This

8242
02:54:50,230 --> 02:54:50,240
look. This seller is still caught. This
 

8243
02:54:50,240 --> 02:54:52,790
look. This seller is still caught. This
seller here is still caught. 55s. Same

8244
02:54:52,790 --> 02:54:52,800
seller here is still caught. 55s. Same
 

8245
02:54:52,800 --> 02:54:54,630
seller here is still caught. 55s. Same
guy. He's still caught right now. He

8246
02:54:54,630 --> 02:54:54,640
guy. He's still caught right now. He
 

8247
02:54:54,640 --> 02:54:56,230
guy. He's still caught right now. He
can't get price under. So if we pivot

8248
02:54:56,230 --> 02:54:56,240
can't get price under. So if we pivot
 

8249
02:54:56,240 --> 02:54:59,750
can't get price under. So if we pivot
now over these buyers at 900, there is

8250
02:54:59,750 --> 02:54:59,760
now over these buyers at 900, there is
 

8251
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:02,389
now over these buyers at 900, there is
release I would say up to 60. So if they

8252
02:55:02,389 --> 02:55:02,399
release I would say up to 60. So if they
 

8253
02:55:02,399 --> 02:55:05,269
release I would say up to 60. So if they
can get over 900s, there is potentially

8254
02:55:05,269 --> 02:55:05,279
can get over 900s, there is potentially
 

8255
02:55:05,279 --> 02:55:07,030
can get over 900s, there is potentially
again it's counter trend hardest trade

8256
02:55:07,030 --> 02:55:07,040
again it's counter trend hardest trade
 

8257
02:55:07,040 --> 02:55:08,389
again it's counter trend hardest trade
in the book. There's potentially a move

8258
02:55:08,389 --> 02:55:08,399
in the book. There's potentially a move
 

8259
02:55:08,399 --> 02:55:11,429
in the book. There's potentially a move
up to 60 where this last block of big

8260
02:55:11,429 --> 02:55:11,439
up to 60 where this last block of big
 

8261
02:55:11,439 --> 02:55:13,269
up to 60 where this last block of big
sellers came in. Right? So if they can

8262
02:55:13,269 --> 02:55:13,279
sellers came in. Right? So if they can
 

8263
02:55:13,279 --> 02:55:15,110
sellers came in. Right? So if they can
get over 900s, if they leave this

8264
02:55:15,110 --> 02:55:15,120
get over 900s, if they leave this
 

8265
02:55:15,120 --> 02:55:17,349
get over 900s, if they leave this
seller, we got to move it up for you.

8266
02:55:17,349 --> 02:55:17,359
seller, we got to move it up for you.
 

8267
02:55:17,359 --> 02:55:19,590
seller, we got to move it up for you.
They leave this seller here caught. This

8268
02:55:19,590 --> 02:55:19,600
They leave this seller here caught. This
 

8269
02:55:19,600 --> 02:55:21,510
They leave this seller here caught. This
seller here caught. If they hold above

8270
02:55:21,510 --> 02:55:21,520
seller here caught. If they hold above
 

8271
02:55:21,520 --> 02:55:24,389
seller here caught. If they hold above
him at 50s and they get above this shelf

8272
02:55:24,389 --> 02:55:24,399
him at 50s and they get above this shelf
 

8273
02:55:24,399 --> 02:55:26,630
him at 50s and they get above this shelf
at 900s, there's potentially a move back

8274
02:55:26,630 --> 02:55:26,640
at 900s, there's potentially a move back
 

8275
02:55:26,640 --> 02:55:29,429
at 900s, there's potentially a move back
up to 60s where these last big sellers

8276
02:55:29,429 --> 02:55:29,439
up to 60s where these last big sellers
 

8277
02:55:29,439 --> 02:55:31,590
up to 60s where these last big sellers
came in. But I would not be playing it

8278
02:55:31,590 --> 02:55:31,600
came in. But I would not be playing it
 

8279
02:55:31,600 --> 02:55:34,230
came in. But I would not be playing it
personally. It's very, very, very hard

8280
02:55:34,230 --> 02:55:34,240
personally. It's very, very, very hard
 

8281
02:55:34,240 --> 02:55:38,950
personally. It's very, very, very hard
to trade that in a very heavy market.

8282
02:55:38,950 --> 02:55:38,960
to trade that in a very heavy market.
 

8283

Discord, I will be popping in there this

8300
02:55:54,469 --> 02:55:54,479
Discord, I will be popping in there this
 

8301
02:55:54,479 --> 02:55:57,190
Discord, I will be popping in there this
afternoon. Um, the only thing I'm really

8302
02:55:57,190 --> 02:55:57,200
afternoon. Um, the only thing I'm really
 

8303
02:55:57,200 --> 02:55:59,030
afternoon. Um, the only thing I'm really
looking for at this moment would be a

8304
02:55:59,030 --> 02:55:59,040
looking for at this moment would be a
 

8305
02:55:59,040 --> 02:56:00,790
looking for at this moment would be a
swipe of low hanging fruit and to see if

8306
02:56:00,790 --> 02:56:00,800
swipe of low hanging fruit and to see if
 

8307
02:56:00,800 --> 02:56:03,429
swipe of low hanging fruit and to see if
we trap players. I don't really want to

8308
02:56:03,429 --> 02:56:03,439
we trap players. I don't really want to
 

8309
02:56:03,439 --> 02:56:05,190
we trap players. I don't really want to
look for more downside unless we push

8310
02:56:05,190 --> 02:56:05,200
look for more downside unless we push
 

8311
02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:06,950
look for more downside unless we push
fairly aggressively higher and I don't

8312
02:56:06,950 --> 02:56:06,960
fairly aggressively higher and I don't
 

8313
02:56:06,960 --> 02:56:09,110
fairly aggressively higher and I don't
really want to look for upside unless we

8314
02:56:09,110 --> 02:56:09,120
really want to look for upside unless we
 

8315
02:56:09,120 --> 02:56:11,590
really want to look for upside unless we
swipe actually which ES has done and

8316
02:56:11,590 --> 02:56:11,600
swipe actually which ES has done and
 

8317
02:56:11,600 --> 02:56:13,190
swipe actually which ES has done and
starting to recover. So, we should watch

8318
02:56:13,190 --> 02:56:13,200
starting to recover. So, we should watch
 

8319
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:16,070
starting to recover. So, we should watch
that carefully on ES. So, ES by the way

8320
02:56:16,070 --> 02:56:16,080
that carefully on ES. So, ES by the way
 

8321
02:56:16,080 --> 02:56:17,590
that carefully on ES. So, ES by the way
those looking ES has actually done the

8322
02:56:17,590 --> 02:56:17,600
those looking ES has actually done the
 

8323
02:56:17,600 --> 02:56:20,070
those looking ES has actually done the
move I would be looking for right there

8324
02:56:20,070 --> 02:56:20,080
move I would be looking for right there
 

8325
02:56:20,080 --> 02:56:21,830
move I would be looking for right there
right here. That is the undercut. I

8326
02:56:21,830 --> 02:56:21,840
right here. That is the undercut. I
 

8327
02:56:21,840 --> 02:56:23,910
right here. That is the undercut. I
would prefer more excess on this, but

8328
02:56:23,910 --> 02:56:23,920
would prefer more excess on this, but
 

8329
02:56:23,920 --> 02:56:26,230
would prefer more excess on this, but
this is the kind of move we want.

8330
02:56:26,230 --> 02:56:26,240
this is the kind of move we want.
 

8331
02:56:26,240 --> 02:56:28,150
this is the kind of move we want.
Breakout sellers. We'd prefer excess

Breakout sellers. We'd prefer excess
 

8333
02:56:28,160 --> 02:56:30,389

down into here and then a turnaround and

8334
02:56:30,389 --> 02:56:30,399
down into here and then a turnaround and
 

8335
02:56:30,399 --> 02:56:32,150
down into here and then a turnaround and
then relief. All right, trap sellers

8336
02:56:32,150 --> 02:56:32,160
then relief. All right, trap sellers
 

8337
02:56:32,160 --> 02:56:33,429
then relief. All right, trap sellers
under here and then relief. That's the

8338
02:56:33,429 --> 02:56:33,439
under here and then relief. That's the
 

8339
02:56:33,439 --> 02:56:34,710
under here and then relief. That's the
