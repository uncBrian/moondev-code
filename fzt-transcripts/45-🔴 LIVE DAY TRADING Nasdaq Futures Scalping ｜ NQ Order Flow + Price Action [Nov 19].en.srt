00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,830
more edge than that. Just think about
where we we are. All right, this little

48
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840
where we we are. All right, this little
 

49
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,230
where we we are. All right, this little
chunk here became important yesterday

50
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
chunk here became important yesterday
 

51
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,390
chunk here became important yesterday
and they lost it. All right, so we're

52
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
and they lost it. All right, so we're
 

53
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,390
and they lost it. All right, so we're
now trading

54
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
now trading
 

55
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,070
now trading
underneath

56
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
underneath
 

57
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,589
underneath
uh these lows here from the yearly

58
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
uh these lows here from the yearly
 

59
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,270
uh these lows here from the yearly
profile. So, let me just get my screen

60
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
profile. So, let me just get my screen
 

61
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,870
profile. So, let me just get my screen
up here so I can see you on the side

62
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
up here so I can see you on the side
 

63
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,270
up here so I can see you on the side
monitor.

64
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
monitor.
 

65
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,950
monitor.
All right, so we're trading underneath

66
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
All right, so we're trading underneath
 

67
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,189
All right, so we're trading underneath
this key level on the yearly profile.

68
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
this key level on the yearly profile.
 

69
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,749
this key level on the yearly profile.
You will notice this is sort of into

70
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
You will notice this is sort of into
 

71
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,390
You will notice this is sort of into
that 800 range. If you traded or watched

72
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
that 800 range. If you traded or watched
 

73
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,710
that 800 range. If you traded or watched
towards the close yesterday, we ranged

74
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
towards the close yesterday, we ranged
 

75
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,469
towards the close yesterday, we ranged
up here for a long time before they

76
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
up here for a long time before they
 

77
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,150
up here for a long time before they
liquidated late in the day. All right,

78
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,160
liquidated late in the day. All right,
 

79
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,469
liquidated late in the day. All right,
so bulls had numerous chances yesterday

80
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
so bulls had numerous chances yesterday
 

81
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,550
so bulls had numerous chances yesterday
into close. I was actually hoping we'd

82
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
into close. I was actually hoping we'd
 

83
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,870
into close. I was actually hoping we'd
get one of these. Um, but we didn't. All

84
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
get one of these. Um, but we didn't. All
 

85
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,629
get one of these. Um, but we didn't. All
right, they had numerous chances to get

86
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
right, they had numerous chances to get
 

87
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,469
right, they had numerous chances to get
back over sort of the 800 and look for

88
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
back over sort of the 800 and look for
 

89
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,790
back over sort of the 800 and look for
the drive up to sort of 850 because if

90
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
the drive up to sort of 850 because if
 

91
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,749
the drive up to sort of 850 because if
we closed up here, all right, that is a

92
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
we closed up here, all right, that is a
 

93
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,469
we closed up here, all right, that is a
much much more bullish close leading

94
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
much much more bullish close leading
 

95
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,550
much much more bullish close leading
into today to allow a squeeze. We didn't

96
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,560
into today to allow a squeeze. We didn't
 

97
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,629
into today to allow a squeeze. We didn't
close up there. We close right on the

98
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
close up there. We close right on the
 

99
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,309
close up there. We close right on the
lower Ballinger band which is pointing

100
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
lower Ballinger band which is pointing
 

101
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,230
lower Ballinger band which is pointing
down and you'll see it will take a bit

102
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
down and you'll see it will take a bit
 

103
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,150
down and you'll see it will take a bit
of time but eventually if we keep

104
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
of time but eventually if we keep
 

105
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,469
of time but eventually if we keep
trading lower this uh upper Ballinger

106
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
trading lower this uh upper Ballinger
 

107
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,869
trading lower this uh upper Ballinger
band is going to turn down with us and

108
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
band is going to turn down with us and
 

109
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,230
band is going to turn down with us and
we're going to start doing something

110
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
we're going to start doing something
 

111
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,670
we're going to start doing something
like this. Right, you've now got the

112
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
like this. Right, you've now got the
 

113
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,670
like this. Right, you've now got the
5day cross the 50. Everything's very

114
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
5day cross the 50. Everything's very
 

115
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,830
5day cross the 50. Everything's very
very bearish in the charts but our

116
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
very bearish in the charts but our
 

117
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,309
very bearish in the charts but our
location for the short as we talk about

118
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
location for the short as we talk about
 

119
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,029
location for the short as we talk about
is not ideal. Now, if you're in a swing

120
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
is not ideal. Now, if you're in a swing
 

121
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,550
is not ideal. Now, if you're in a swing
position or you're looking to add to

122
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
position or you're looking to add to
 

123
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,790
position or you're looking to add to
your positions, all right, you quite

124
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
your positions, all right, you quite
 

125
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,790
your positions, all right, you quite
clearly you have sort of uh relative

126
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
clearly you have sort of uh relative
 

127
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,430
clearly you have sort of uh relative
equal lows down here into this pocket.

128
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
equal lows down here into this pocket.
 

129
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,909
equal lows down here into this pocket.
All right, this is the area which bulls

130
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
All right, this is the area which bulls
 

131
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,589
All right, this is the area which bulls
will next want to try and defend. All

132
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
will next want to try and defend. All
 

133
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,510
will next want to try and defend. All
right, into here. If we get through

134
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520
right, into here. If we get through
 

135
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,189
right, into here. If we get through
this, you've got a value area low down

136
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
this, you've got a value area low down
 

137
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,150
this, you've got a value area low down
here and this old pivot. All right, so

138
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
here and this old pivot. All right, so
 

139
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,510
here and this old pivot. All right, so
that's what I'd be looking at if you're

140
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
that's what I'd be looking at if you're
 

141
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,950
that's what I'd be looking at if you're
managing a position. I wouldn't be

142
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
managing a position. I wouldn't be
 

143
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,350
managing a position. I wouldn't be
putting a new short on at these lows. I

144
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
putting a new short on at these lows. I
 

145
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,670
putting a new short on at these lows. I
think it's very, very risky. The other

146
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:33,680
think it's very, very risky. The other
 

147
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,430
think it's very, very risky. The other
thing to note is we are opening up an

148
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
thing to note is we are opening up an
 

149
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,509
thing to note is we are opening up an
inside bar. We're inside previous days

150
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
inside bar. We're inside previous days
 

151
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,029
inside bar. We're inside previous days
value which we're going to get into now.

152
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
value which we're going to get into now.
 

153
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,790
value which we're going to get into now.
We have Nvidia earnings coming tonight

154
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800

00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:47,839
was here. Pal was pretty dovish. Uh
 

161
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,910
was here. Pal was pretty dovish. Uh
sorry, he was not dovish. He was pretty

162
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:49,920
sorry, he was not dovish. He was pretty
 

163
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,550
sorry, he was not dovish. He was pretty
hawkish on the December rate cut. All

164
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
hawkish on the December rate cut. All
 

165
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,470
hawkish on the December rate cut. All
right, we had priced in a December rate

166
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
right, we had priced in a December rate
 

167
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,829
right, we had priced in a December rate
cut and um well, he was kind of saying,

168
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
cut and um well, he was kind of saying,
 

169
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,910
cut and um well, he was kind of saying,
"Hey, we don't it's no guarantee we're

170
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
"Hey, we don't it's no guarantee we're
 

171
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,150
"Hey, we don't it's no guarantee we're
going to get that." the market did not

172
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
going to get that." the market did not
 

173
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,829
going to get that." the market did not
like it and that's kind of what signaled

174
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
like it and that's kind of what signaled
 

175
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,030
like it and that's kind of what signaled
the top in the market. So, we're going

176
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
the top in the market. So, we're going
 

177
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,790
the top in the market. So, we're going
to get the minutes from that to see what

178
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
to get the minutes from that to see what
 

179
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,710
to get the minutes from that to see what
what is said. So, into an hourly, this

180
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:10,720
what is said. So, into an hourly, this
 

181
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,190
what is said. So, into an hourly, this
is your value area from yesterday. Okay,

182
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
is your value area from yesterday. Okay,
 

183
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,269
is your value area from yesterday. Okay,
we're opening up slap bang in the middle

184
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
we're opening up slap bang in the middle
 

185
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,430
we're opening up slap bang in the middle
of it. Pretty close to a VWOP right now

186
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
of it. Pretty close to a VWOP right now
 

187
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,590
of it. Pretty close to a VWOP right now
as well. There's no edge in here, folks.

188
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
as well. There's no edge in here, folks.
 

189
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,110
as well. There's no edge in here, folks.
All right, what do I expect today? Churn

190
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
All right, what do I expect today? Churn
 

191
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,030

right, something like this. Why? Because
 

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,829
right, something like this. Why? Because
this will burn the theta. All right,

196
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
this will burn the theta. All right,
 

197
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,350
this will burn the theta. All right,
this will burn all the options who are

198
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
this will burn all the options who are
 

199
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,110

this big move, right? That will burn it.
I wouldn't surprise me if Invidia ends

204
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
I wouldn't surprise me if Invidia ends
 

205
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,389
I wouldn't surprise me if Invidia ends
up doing absolutely nothing. But but we

206
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
up doing absolutely nothing. But but we
 

207
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,150
up doing absolutely nothing. But but we
will see. Everyone looking for it to be

208
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
will see. Everyone looking for it to be
 

209
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,389
will see. Everyone looking for it to be
the savior in the market. We will see.

210
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
the savior in the market. We will see.
 

211
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,870
the savior in the market. We will see.
Overall, right, we are bearish. There's

212
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
Overall, right, we are bearish. There's
 

213
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,190
Overall, right, we are bearish. There's
no doubt about it. Okay, we are bearish.

214
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
no doubt about it. Okay, we are bearish.
 

215
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,110
no doubt about it. Okay, we are bearish.
Here's the micro head and shoulder

216
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,120
Here's the micro head and shoulder
 

217
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,790
Here's the micro head and shoulder
inside the giant head and shoulder we're

218
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
inside the giant head and shoulder we're
 

219
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,470
inside the giant head and shoulder we're
looking at. There's the net line.

220
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
looking at. There's the net line.
 

221
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,750
looking at. There's the net line.
There's the sort of break. But we're

222
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
There's the sort of break. But we're
 

223
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,990
There's the sort of break. But we're
hanging on, aren't we? idea thread.

224
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
hanging on, aren't we? idea thread.
 

225
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,910
hanging on, aren't we? idea thread.
Could this be a bare flag to break down?

226
00:09:59,910 --> 00:09:59,920
Could this be a bare flag to break down?
 

227
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,230
Could this be a bare flag to break down?
Yeah, it could also be a wedge. And this

228
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
Yeah, it could also be a wedge. And this
 

229
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,150
Yeah, it could also be a wedge. And this
is what I'm looking at. I'm I'm

230
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
is what I'm looking at. I'm I'm
 

231
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,230
is what I'm looking at. I'm I'm
wondering if this market needs a bit of

232
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
wondering if this market needs a bit of
 

233
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,870
wondering if this market needs a bit of
relief before going lower or if just the

234
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
relief before going lower or if just the
 

235
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,870
relief before going lower or if just the
trap in here is going to be enough

236
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:10,880
trap in here is going to be enough
 

237
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,069
trap in here is going to be enough
liquidity for a snap. Either way, we

238
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
liquidity for a snap. Either way, we
 

239
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,550
liquidity for a snap. Either way, we
know that this 800 level is a huge level

240
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
know that this 800 level is a huge level
 

241
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,470
know that this 800 level is a huge level
on the yearly profile. All right. If we

242
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
on the yearly profile. All right. If we
 

243
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,110
on the yearly profile. All right. If we
get over this 8850, I think there's a

244
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
get over this 8850, I think there's a
 

245
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,069
get over this 8850, I think there's a
squeeze back up to sort of 25,000

246
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
squeeze back up to sort of 25,000
 

247
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,710
squeeze back up to sort of 25,000
25,100. A look above here and fail.

248
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
25,100. A look above here and fail.
 

249
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,550
25,100. A look above here and fail.
There's a rotation back down. A look

250
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,560
There's a rotation back down. A look
 

251
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,110
There's a rotation back down. A look
below and fails. A rotation back inside.

252
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
below and fails. A rotation back inside.
 

253
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,269
below and fails. A rotation back inside.
And we expect chop and slop in here. I

254
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
And we expect chop and slop in here. I
 

255
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,590
And we expect chop and slop in here. I
don't expect it to come that far outside

256
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
don't expect it to come that far outside
 

257
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,430
don't expect it to come that far outside
of previous range. If it gets really

258
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
of previous range. If it gets really
 

259
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,590
of previous range. If it gets really
heavy, we'll just follow the tape. If

260
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
heavy, we'll just follow the tape. If
 

261
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,030
heavy, we'll just follow the tape. If
they want to dump this, we'll follow the

262
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
they want to dump this, we'll follow the
 

263
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,110
they want to dump this, we'll follow the
tape. But remember, your location, your

264
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
tape. But remember, your location, your
 

265
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,350
tape. But remember, your location, your
lower Ballinger band is down here. It's

266
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
lower Ballinger band is down here. It's
 

267
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,590
lower Ballinger band is down here. It's
not really ideal to be looking for

268
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
not really ideal to be looking for
 

269
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,190
not really ideal to be looking for
shorts down there. All right? It's very,

270
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
shorts down there. All right? It's very,
 

271
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,509
shorts down there. All right? It's very,
very risky beyond two sigas to be

272
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
very risky beyond two sigas to be
 

273
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,110
very risky beyond two sigas to be
looking for a short on a daily. So, I'll

274
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
looking for a short on a daily. So, I'll
 

275
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,269
looking for a short on a daily. So, I'll
just say that if we look at what

276
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
just say that if we look at what
 

277
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,069
just say that if we look at what
happened overnight, okay, opening or

278
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079

279

closing, where do we close? Closed

281
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,590
closing, where do we close? Closed
pretty heavy, didn't we? All right,

282
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:01,600
pretty heavy, didn't we? All right,
 

283
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,790

say, "Okay, sentiment shifted or bulls
are in control, right? No one's in

312
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
are in control, right? No one's in
 

313
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,870
are in control, right? No one's in
control here. This is a liquidity

314
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
control here. This is a liquidity
 

315
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,030
control here. This is a liquidity
building stage. The overall sentiment

316
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
building stage. The overall sentiment
 

317
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,829
building stage. The overall sentiment
remains bearish. Can buyers come in?

318
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:41,839
remains bearish. Can buyers come in?
 

319
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,829
remains bearish. Can buyers come in?
Yeah, they can defend the edge. Can they

320
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
Yeah, they can defend the edge. Can they
 

321
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,389
Yeah, they can defend the edge. Can they
get above 850? Maybe they can get above

322
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
get above 850? Maybe they can get above
 

323
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,470
get above 850? Maybe they can get above
850 for a squeeze. I would find it

324
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
850 for a squeeze. I would find it
 

325
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,030
850 for a squeeze. I would find it
unlikely for them to do that move today

326
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
unlikely for them to do that move today
 

327
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,590
unlikely for them to do that move today
unless uh someone knows something that

328
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,600
unless uh someone knows something that
 

329
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,509
unless uh someone knows something that
we don't which is possible. We can't

330
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519
we don't which is possible. We can't
 

331
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,590
we don't which is possible. We can't
rule it out but I would expect more

332
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
rule it out but I would expect more
 

333
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,710
rule it out but I would expect more
liquidity to just be built out today.

334
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:00,720
liquidity to just be built out today.
 

335
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,310
liquidity to just be built out today.
Right into the lower time frames. Let's

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320
Right into the lower time frames. Let's
 

337
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,269
Right into the lower time frames. Let's
look at some of the other markets.

338
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
look at some of the other markets.
 

339

Building out its range. Uh this is your

342
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
Building out its range. Uh this is your
 

343
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,269
Building out its range. Uh this is your
range built out yesterday. You can see

344
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:13,279
range built out yesterday. You can see
 

345
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,670
range built out yesterday. You can see
here are your pivots. Very very simple.

346
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
here are your pivots. Very very simple.
 

347
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,949
here are your pivots. Very very simple.
6 680s. as we can just call it down to

348
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
6 680s. as we can just call it down to
 

349
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,710
6 680s. as we can just call it down to
615s and PDC here 640. So just a big old

350
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,720
615s and PDC here 640. So just a big old
 

351
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,389
615s and PDC here 640. So just a big old
range but what becomes key is going to

352
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:24,399
range but what becomes key is going to
 

353
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,230
range but what becomes key is going to
become a spy doesn't accuse. What is

354
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
become a spy doesn't accuse. What is
 

355
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,318
become a spy doesn't accuse. What is
going on here? Let's get rid of that.

00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
it. It is a huge huge level. I'd say
 

379
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,150

under here we've got room back down to
the 40s I think it was when I looked

383
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,069
the 40s I think it was when I looked
last night. Yeah, down here. All right.

But uh I would again be very cautious
 

391
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,750
But uh I would again be very cautious
looking for that move today.

397
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,870
wall. All right. Yesterday they had the
chance to save it. All right. And they

398
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
chance to save it. All right. And they
 

399
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,470
chance to save it. All right. And they
failed into end of day and you can see

400
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
failed into end of day and you can see
 

401
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,629
failed into end of day and you can see
we've just rejected 600 this morning in

402
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
we've just rejected 600 this morning in
 

403
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,870
we've just rejected 600 this morning in
the pre-market. Right. So I would say

404
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
the pre-market. Right. So I would say
 

405
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,870
the pre-market. Right. So I would say
bears have the edge but we're in

406
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880
bears have the edge but we're in
 

407
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,389
bears have the edge but we're in
rotation. We're inside of initial

408
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
rotation. We're inside of initial
 

409
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,990
rotation. We're inside of initial
balance from yesterday. But bears do

410
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
balance from yesterday. But bears do
 

411
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,590
balance from yesterday. But bears do
have the edge here overall in this

412
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
have the edge here overall in this
 

413
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,389
have the edge here overall in this
market.

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,949
your break at these lows. Here's

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
these lows right now. I'd be careful
 

479
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,870
these lows right now. I'd be careful
about a look below and fail. That would

480
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
about a look below and fail. That would
 

481
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,350
about a look below and fail. That would
be your typical sort of move back inside

482
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,360
be your typical sort of move back inside
 

483

there's moves into 76s and 73. I think

554
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
there's moves into 76s and 73. I think
 

555
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,590
there's moves into 76s and 73. I think
it's about a $12 move we're expecting on

556
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,600
it's about a $12 move we're expecting on
 

557
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,430
it's about a $12 move we're expecting on
Nvidia. I think at least. So

558
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,440
Nvidia. I think at least. So
 

559
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,189
Nvidia. I think at least. So
yeah, just be aware of that. At least

560
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:21,199
yeah, just be aware of that. At least
 

561
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,150
yeah, just be aware of that. At least
$12. 121 12 to $15 probably is normal,

562
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
$12. 121 12 to $15 probably is normal,
 

563
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,910
$12. 121 12 to $15 probably is normal,
but you know, in this market it could be

564
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:25,920
but you know, in this market it could be
 

565
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,230
but you know, in this market it could be
anything. Just be careful, folks. Just

566
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:28,240
anything. Just be careful, folks. Just
 

567
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,030
anything. Just be careful, folks. Just
be careful. It's trying to hold on.

568

Okay, so you're prepared. I'm just

Okay, so you're prepared. I'm just
 

679

Okay, so you're prepared. I'm just
expecting rotations today, which means

680
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,400
expecting rotations today, which means
 

681
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,830
expecting rotations today, which means
you probably want to be playing the

682
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
you probably want to be playing the
 

683
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,070
you probably want to be playing the
edges. Um, bears have the most control

684
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080

685
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,350
edges. Um, bears have the most control
right now overall in this market, but uh

686
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360
right now overall in this market, but uh
 

687
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,029
right now overall in this market, but uh
just be cautious is all I'm saying

688
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:03,039
just be cautious is all I'm saying
 

689
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,350
just be cautious is all I'm saying
today. Uh, the one thing I guess we

690
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:05,360
today. Uh, the one thing I guess we
 

691
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,870
today. Uh, the one thing I guess we
didn't go over was the VIX. Actually,

692
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:06,880
didn't go over was the VIX. Actually,
 

693
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,230
didn't go over was the VIX. Actually,
let's just quickly look at that because

694
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,240
let's just quickly look at that because
 

695
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,113
let's just quickly look at that because
it rem does remain elevated.

696
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:14,123

Get rid of this some old levels here.

703
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,390

All right. These are the levels I'll be

704
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,400
All right. These are the levels I'll be
 

705
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,150

709
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,830

All right. You can see [snorts] this

710
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:33,840
All right. You can see [snorts] this
 

711
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,750
All right. You can see [snorts] this
build out here

712
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:37,760

 

713
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,510

is very much looking like this right

714
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,520
is very much looking like this right
 

715
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,029
is very much looking like this right
now.

716
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:41,039
now.
 

717
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,590

All right, these are all breaking out if

718
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:43,600
All right, these are all breaking out if
 

719
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,110
All right, these are all breaking out if
we do another one of these and break out

720
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120
we do another one of these and break out
 

721
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,270
we do another one of these and break out
and the market's in big big trouble. So,

722
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280
and the market's in big big trouble. So,
 

723
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,138
and the market's in big big trouble. So,
normally you would expect a down day

724
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:50,148
normally you would expect a down day
 

725
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,430

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,909
[snorts] after such a big day like this
on the VIX for the last few days, but uh

728
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:53,919
on the VIX for the last few days, but uh
 

729
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,590
on the VIX for the last few days, but uh
given where we're at, I just think we're

730
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600
given where we're at, I just think we're
 

731
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,669
given where we're at, I just think we're
going to hold increased volatility into

732
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
going to hold increased volatility into
 

733
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,789
going to hold increased volatility into
uh earnings and then maybe post Nvidia,

734
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:00,799
uh earnings and then maybe post Nvidia,
 

735
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,710
uh earnings and then maybe post Nvidia,
we either get that one big push or that

736
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:02,720
we either get that one big push or that
 

737
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,150
we either get that one big push or that
pull back into here and have a little

738
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:04,160
pull back into here and have a little
 

739
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,909
pull back into here and have a little
bit of a cool off. But, you know, let's

740
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:05,919
bit of a cool off. But, you know, let's
 

741
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,669
bit of a cool off. But, you know, let's
just see. I don't want to uh I'm not

742
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
just see. I don't want to uh I'm not
 

743
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,110
just see. I don't want to uh I'm not
here to guess the market. I'm here to

744
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,120
here to guess the market. I'm here to
 

745
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,630
here to guess the market. I'm here to
trade what's in front of me right now.

746
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:10,640
trade what's in front of me right now.
 

747
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,870

So, we will just see. Whatever the

748
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880
So, we will just see. Whatever the
 

749
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,350
So, we will just see. Whatever the
market brings is what we will be able to

750
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
market brings is what we will be able to
 

751
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,950
market brings is what we will be able to
trade. like yesterday didn't bring me

752
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:16,960
trade. like yesterday didn't bring me
 

753
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,549
trade. like yesterday didn't bring me
what I wanted. So, I was limited on

754
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:18,559
what I wanted. So, I was limited on
 

755
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,710
what I wanted. So, I was limited on
trading opportunity. Today, I think

756
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720
trading opportunity. Today, I think
 

757
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,070
trading opportunity. Today, I think
we're going to be very limited on

758
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,080
we're going to be very limited on
 

759
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,070
we're going to be very limited on
trading opportunities, but uh you know,

760
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,080
trading opportunities, but uh you know,
 

761
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,190
trading opportunities, but uh you know,
who knows? Maybe something changes.

762

00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:36,799
they send us back down to value again.
 

937
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:43,590
they send us back down to value again.
And you're going to get the idea here

938
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:43,600

 

939
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:50,390

going the high.

940
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,400

 

941
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,230

So yeah, if you're doing anything here,

942
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:52,240
So yeah, if you're doing anything here,
 

943
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,909
So yeah, if you're doing anything here,
maybe you've got a system for this. I

944
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:53,919
maybe you've got a system for this. I
 

945
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,590
maybe you've got a system for this. I
certainly do not have a system for this

946
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:55,600
certainly do not have a system for this
 

947
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,430
certainly do not have a system for this
right now.

948
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440

 

949
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,110

Here's a gamble.

950
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,120

 

951
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,870

There's the high of day. New high of day

952
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:04,880
There's the high of day. New high of day
 

953
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,029
There's the high of day. New high of day
in the New York session.

954
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:07,039
in the New York session.
 

955
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,470
in the New York session.
So maybe they come back up for this

956
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:08,480
So maybe they come back up for this
 

957
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,830
So maybe they come back up for this
previous day point of control. We're

958
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:09,840
previous day point of control. We're
 

959
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,549
previous day point of control. We're
thick in here. Like I said, I just think

960
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:12,559
thick in here. Like I said, I just think
 

961
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,350
thick in here. Like I said, I just think
this is going to be very back and forth.

962
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
this is going to be very back and forth.
 

963
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,710
this is going to be very back and forth.
If I was going to be a buyer, I'd want

964
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:16,720
If I was going to be a buyer, I'd want
 

965
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,269
If I was going to be a buyer, I'd want
to be a buyer down here today.

966
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:19,279
to be a buyer down here today.
 

967
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,789
to be a buyer down here today.
Don't really want to be a buyer up here.

968
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
Don't really want to be a buyer up here.
 

969
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,390
Don't really want to be a buyer up here.
uh because we're approaching this thick

970
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:24,400
uh because we're approaching this thick
 

971
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,310
uh because we're approaching this thick
gray level which we traded under over

972
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,320
gray level which we traded under over
 

973
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,789
gray level which we traded under over
numerous times yesterday which is why

974
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:28,799
numerous times yesterday which is why
 

975
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,870
numerous times yesterday which is why
it's marked.

00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:30,880
it's marked.

it's marked.
You can see rejection of that volume. So

978
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,240
You can see rejection of that volume. So
 

979
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,269
You can see rejection of that volume. So
yeah, I'd be somewhat cautious trying to

980
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:37,279
yeah, I'd be somewhat cautious trying to
 

981
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,950
yeah, I'd be somewhat cautious trying to
do anything up here. If you're looking

982
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:38,960
do anything up here. If you're looking
 

983
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,269
do anything up here. If you're looking
to be a buyer,

984
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:41,279
to be a buyer,
 

985
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,950
to be a buyer,
I don't know what you can risk off up

986
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:42,960
I don't know what you can risk off up
 

987
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:55,029
I don't know what you can risk off up
here.

988
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:55,039

 

989
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,269

You can go for whatever you want, but uh

990
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
You can go for whatever you want, but uh
 

991
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,110
You can go for whatever you want, but uh
you are not you should if you zoom out,

992
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,120
you are not you should if you zoom out,
 

993
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,630
you are not you should if you zoom out,
you will see you're a slap bang in the

994
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:00,640
you will see you're a slap bang in the
 

995
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,110
you will see you're a slap bang in the
middle of a range right now.

00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
middle of a range right now.
 

997
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,789

So, don't think anyone's uh we're not at

So, don't think anyone's uh we're not at

So, don't think anyone's uh we're not at

trading ranges if we're not at the edge
 

1003

trading ranges if we're not at the edge
because I don't know what you're risking

1004
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:11,679
because I don't know what you're risking
 

1005
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,110
because I don't know what you're risking
off. This is a thick area. If they want

off. This is a thick area. If they want

to come and test previous day PC, they

to come and test previous day PC, they
 

1009
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,110
to come and test previous day PC, they
can. It's what they tried to do in

1010
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,120
can. It's what they tried to do in
 

1011
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,630
can. It's what they tried to do in
Gloex. You can see globe it's just

1012
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:18,640
Gloex. You can see globe it's just
 

1013

peaked above there that P US PC.

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,830
this is beyond what I would want to
trade right now. I don't mind buying

1252
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:33,840
trade right now. I don't mind buying
 

1253
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,950
trade right now. I don't mind buying
dips at the lows at value. We didn't see

1254
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:36,960
dips at the lows at value. We didn't see
 

1255
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,909
dips at the lows at value. We didn't see
that. Didn't even get down there. I'm

1256
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:39,919
that. Didn't even get down there. I'm
 

1257
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,750
that. Didn't even get down there. I'm
not going to buy a high today. That's

1258
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:41,760
not going to buy a high today. That's
 

1259
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,230
not going to buy a high today. That's
for sure. It would have to really get

1260
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,240
for sure. It would have to really get
 

1261
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,630
for sure. It would have to really get
above 800850 if it's going to be like a

1262
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:46,640
above 800850 if it's going to be like a
 

1263
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,470
above 800850 if it's going to be like a
trend join at highs and I just can't

1264
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:48,480
trend join at highs and I just can't
 

1265
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,990
trend join at highs and I just can't
imagine they're going to let that happen

1266
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,000
imagine they're going to let that happen
 

1267
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,909
imagine they're going to let that happen
in this market today. But you never

1268
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:51,919
in this market today. But you never
 

1269
00:32:51,919 --> 00:33:01,590
in this market today. But you never
know.

1270
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:01,600

 

1271
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,190

So here's the move back towards previous

1272
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,200
So here's the move back towards previous
 

1273
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,310
So here's the move back towards previous
day point control. So, if you are

1274
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:04,320
day point control. So, if you are
 

1275
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,909
day point control. So, if you are
longing this for any reason, you want to

1276
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:05,919
longing this for any reason, you want to
 

1277
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,590
longing this for any reason, you want to
be locking in as we get into this red

1278
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:07,600
be locking in as we get into this red
 

1279
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,789
be locking in as we get into this red
line above this right here. That's what

1280
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:10,799
line above this right here. That's what
 

1281
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,950
line above this right here. That's what
they've been defending.

1282
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:12,960
they've been defending.
 

1283
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,389
they've been defending.
And through that, we're probably going

1284
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:14,399
And through that, we're probably going
 

1285
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,870
And through that, we're probably going
to go 800.

1286
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:16,880
to go 800.
 

1287
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,549
to go 800.
What was that high from? Yeah. To the

1288
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:18,559
What was that high from? Yeah. To the
 

1289
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,029
What was that high from? Yeah. To the
800s. If they get through this 800s is

1290
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:21,039
800s. If they get through this 800s is
 

1291
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,549
800s. If they get through this 800s is
where they want to go to. That was the

1292
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:22,559
where they want to go to. That was the
 

1293
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,070
where they want to go to. That was the
level they defended nonstop yesterday.

1294
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,080
level they defended nonstop yesterday.
 

1295
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,029
level they defended nonstop yesterday.
Okay. Nonstop yesterday. They defended

1296
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:29,039
Okay. Nonstop yesterday. They defended
 

1297
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,549
Okay. Nonstop yesterday. They defended
800

00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:30,559

that.
 

1309
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,070
that.
Some selling on the tape here now as

1310
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:44,080
Some selling on the tape here now as
 

1311
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,990
Some selling on the tape here now as
they try and defend around these 700s

1312
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,000
they try and defend around these 700s
 

1313
00:33:46,000 --> 00:34:02,070
they try and defend around these 700s
and that point control

1314
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,080

 

1315
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,149

desperate to complete the rotation which

1316
00:34:04,149 --> 00:34:04,159
desperate to complete the rotation which
 

1317
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,950
desperate to complete the rotation which
they're unable to complete right now.

1318
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:06,960
they're unable to complete right now.
 

1319
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,470
they're unable to complete right now.
Haven't quite got there. I mean they're

1320
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:08,480
Haven't quite got there. I mean they're
 

1321
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,829
Haven't quite got there. I mean they're
not very shy of it are they? They're

1322
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:09,839
not very shy of it are they? They're
 

1323
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,030
not very shy of it are they? They're
pretty much there. They're pretty much

1324
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,040
pretty much there. They're pretty much
 

1325
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,869
pretty much there. They're pretty much
there in fairness to them. They're

1326
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:12,879
there in fairness to them. They're
 

1327
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,550
there in fairness to them. They're
pretty much there in fairness to them.

1328
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:14,560
pretty much there in fairness to them.
 

1329
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,270
pretty much there in fairness to them.
We should be fair to them.

1330
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,280

 

1331
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,030

Buyers trying to absorb here. But uh

1332
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,040
Buyers trying to absorb here. But uh
 

1333
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,030
Buyers trying to absorb here. But uh
like I said,

1334
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,040
like I said,
 

1335
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,550
like I said,
previous day point control is probably

1336
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:24,560
previous day point control is probably
 

1337
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,629
previous day point control is probably
the target and then through that 800 if

1338
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:26,639
the target and then through that 800 if
 

1339
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,389
the target and then through that 800 if
they are able to complete the rotation.

1340
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:28,399
they are able to complete the rotation.
 

1341
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,430
they are able to complete the rotation.
I don't know if they're going to be able

1342
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:29,440
I don't know if they're going to be able
 

1343
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,510
I don't know if they're going to be able
to complete through it all. That's what

1344
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:31,520
to complete through it all. That's what
 

1345
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,629
to complete through it all. That's what
they're attempting to do. I can only

1346
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:32,639
they're attempting to do. I can only
 

1347
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,230
they're attempting to do. I can only
tell you what they're attempting to do.

1348
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,240
tell you what they're attempting to do.
 

1349
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,790
tell you what they're attempting to do.
So there's previous day point control.

1350
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:38,800
So there's previous day point control.
 

1351
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,149
So there's previous day point control.
Now, I would hold on to see if you can

1352
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:40,159
Now, I would hold on to see if you can
 

1353
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,030
Now, I would hold on to see if you can
get up to 800. Now,

1354
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,040
get up to 800. Now,
 

1355
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,844
get up to 800. Now,
if you're in this long,

1356
00:34:46,844 --> 00:34:46,854

 

1357
00:34:46,854 --> 00:34:49,909

[snorts]

1358
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:49,919

 

1359
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:52,069

so through here, value area high up

1360
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:52,079
so through here, value area high up
 

1361
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,430
so through here, value area high up
here. Now, this is the area yesterday

1362
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:53,440
here. Now, this is the area yesterday
 

1363
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,109
here. Now, this is the area yesterday
which they defended over and over. I

1364
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:55,119
which they defended over and over. I
 

1365
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,629
which they defended over and over. I
will tell you if we get over this is the

1366
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:56,639
will tell you if we get over this is the
 

1367
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,069
will tell you if we get over this is the
thick area that we went over on the

1368
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:58,079
thick area that we went over on the
 

1369
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,150
thick area that we went over on the
weekly. If they if they get over this,

1370
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,160
weekly. If they if they get over this,
 

1371
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,790
weekly. If they if they get over this,
there is squeeze potential. I wouldn't I

1372
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:02,800
there is squeeze potential. I wouldn't I
 

1373
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,790
there is squeeze potential. I wouldn't I
would have quite happily been long for

00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:04,800
would have quite happily been long for
 

1375
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,109
would have quite happily been long for
this off here, but not off this move

1376
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:07,119
this off here, but not off this move
 

1377
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,589
this off here, but not off this move
here. is far too risky. And I'm okay.

1378
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:09,599
here. is far too risky. And I'm okay.
 

1379
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,990
here. is far too risky. And I'm okay.

want, I don't trade it. Not going to
 

1387

want, I don't trade it. Not going to
chase in a range rotating market.

1388
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:26,240

 

1389
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,390

There's a squeeze. [snorts]

So, if we start getting through 800s,
800s, gap fill will be 880 from a couple

1460
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,160
800s, gap fill will be 880 from a couple
 

1461
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,630
800s, gap fill will be 880 from a couple
days ago. Uh, lots of stops up here.

1462
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:08,640

zone. This up here, if we get through
 

1467
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,190
zone. This up here, if we get through
that, there is a lot of stops up here

1468
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,200
that, there is a lot of stops up here
 

1469
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,990

1529
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,109

00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:21,520
honest. This is how I see it. It's a
 

1863
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,829
honest. This is how I see it. It's a
long trigger.

It's not even a C setup for me even
 

1871
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,910
It's not even a C setup for me even
though it's panned out. This is what I

1872
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:39,920
though it's panned out. This is what I
 

1873
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,349
though it's panned out. This is what I
was saying to I can't remember who it

Okay, previous day open now like hit

00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,670
Okay, previous day open now like hit
that previous day open. Only thing left

2074
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:33,680
that previous day open. Only thing left
 

2075
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,349
that previous day open. Only thing left
now is previous day high

2076
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:37,359
now is previous day high
 

2077
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:40,950
now is previous day high
and then I guess I mean

2078
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:40,960
and then I guess I mean
 

2079
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,630
and then I guess I mean
can't rule it out. Previous week value

2080
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:42,640
can't rule it out. Previous week value
 

2081
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,870
can't rule it out. Previous week value
area low. I cannot rule it out up into

2082
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:44,880
area low. I cannot rule it out up into
 

2083
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,790
area low. I cannot rule it out up into
here. Very unlikely I would say on a day

2084
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:48,800
here. Very unlikely I would say on a day
 

2085
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,150
here. Very unlikely I would say on a day
which would normally be inside.

2086
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:50,160
which would normally be inside.
 

2087
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,549
which would normally be inside.
Technically, we're still inside until we

2088
00:53:52,549 --> 00:53:52,559
Technically, we're still inside until we
 

2089
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,069
Technically, we're still inside until we
get above previous day high, but we're

2090
00:53:54,069 --> 00:53:54,079
get above previous day high, but we're
 

2091
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:55,910
get above previous day high, but we're
outside of previous day value area high.

2092
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:55,920
outside of previous day value area high.
 

2093
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,710
outside of previous day value area high.
So, any bid that holds above previous

2094
00:53:58,710 --> 00:53:58,720
So, any bid that holds above previous
 

2095
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,349
So, any bid that holds above previous
day value area high, all right, could be

2096
00:54:01,349 --> 00:54:01,359
day value area high, all right, could be
 

2097
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,270
day value area high, all right, could be
supported now technically as an outside

2098
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:03,280
supported now technically as an outside

completing this rotation, maybe they

come back for it. If they fail back

It's previous week close. I think

2516
01:06:17,109 --> 01:06:17,119

01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:23,200
That would be like all the way back to
 

2523
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,029
That would be like all the way back to
Friday's close basically from last week.

2524
01:06:25,029 --> 01:06:25,039
Friday's close basically from last week.
 

2525
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:30,470
Friday's close basically from last week.
That'd be like nothing's happened.

pint is the size of the beer that you

pint is the size of the beer that you

pint is the size of the beer that you
would order in England. You wouldn't go

01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:12,960
would order in England. You wouldn't go
 

2605

Uh, don't drink cider. Too sweet, maybe.
 

2617
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:36,390
Uh, don't drink cider. Too sweet, maybe.
Maybe when I was a kid.

2618
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:36,400

 

2619
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,390

Yeah. And the bonds are all up today as

2620
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:38,400
Yeah. And the bonds are all up today as
 

2621
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,550
Yeah. And the bonds are all up today as
well. Got my eye on everything. Just a

2622
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:40,560
well. Got my eye on everything. Just a
 

2623
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,950
well. Got my eye on everything. Just a
bit of a relief day across across the

2624
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:42,960
bit of a relief day across across the
 

2625
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:48,709
bit of a relief day across across the
board right now.

2626
01:08:48,709 --> 01:08:48,719

 

2627
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:50,789

Yeah, I'm sure New York does that. That

2628
01:08:50,789 --> 01:08:50,799
Yeah, I'm sure New York does that. That
 

2629
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:52,709
Yeah, I'm sure New York does that. That
would make total sense to me. Sure New

2630
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:52,719
would make total sense to me. Sure New
 

2631
01:08:52,719 --> 01:09:03,669
would make total sense to me. Sure New
York does it.

2632
01:09:03,669 --> 01:09:03,679

 

2633
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:07,829

So, previous day high taken,

2634
01:09:07,829 --> 01:09:07,839

 

2635
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:10,149

low hanging fruit taken. Only thing left

2636
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:10,159
low hanging fruit taken. Only thing left
 

2637
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:11,510
low hanging fruit taken. Only thing left
if they're going to drift it higher is

2638
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:11,520
if they're going to drift it higher is
 

2639
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,510
if they're going to drift it higher is
the previous week lows.

2640
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:13,520
the previous week lows.
 

2641
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,789
the previous week lows.
You're building out a decent amount of

2642
01:09:14,789 --> 01:09:14,799
You're building out a decent amount of
 

2643
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:20,630
You're building out a decent amount of
liquidity up here.

2644
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:20,640

 

2645
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,709

Remember, you've hit your objectives.

2646
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:22,719
Remember, you've hit your objectives.
 

2647
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:24,950
Remember, you've hit your objectives.
So, I mean, even if they dip back down

2648
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:24,960
So, I mean, even if they dip back down
 

2649
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,070
So, I mean, even if they dip back down
now, it's hard to want to be long on

2650
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:28,080
now, it's hard to want to be long on
 

2651
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:32,229
now, it's hard to want to be long on
pullbacks now because this is a a giant

2652
01:09:32,229 --> 01:09:32,239
pullbacks now because this is a a giant
 

2653
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:33,749
pullbacks now because this is a a giant
squeeze out which has now taken the

2654
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:33,759
squeeze out which has now taken the
 

2655
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:36,149
squeeze out which has now taken the
high. So, you know, there's less reason

2656
01:09:36,149 --> 01:09:36,159
high. So, you know, there's less reason
 

2657
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:38,070
high. So, you know, there's less reason
for them to catch a bid to go back up

2658
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:38,080
for them to catch a bid to go back up
 

2659
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:42,630
for them to catch a bid to go back up
now because they've done the work.

2660
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:42,640

 

2661
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,789

Alex, do you know where the term mind

2662
01:09:44,789 --> 01:09:44,799
Alex, do you know where the term mind
 

2663
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:46,870
Alex, do you know where the term mind
your pleases and Q's what where it comes

2664
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:46,880
your pleases and Q's what where it comes
 

2665
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,669
your pleases and Q's what where it comes
from? Please and thank yous. I I don't

All right. Still building out in this

All right. Still building out in this

I mean, the area is good. I haven't seen
 

2837
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,990
I mean, the area is good. I haven't seen
it let go of anything yet, but the area

2838
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:58,000
it let go of anything yet, but the area
 

2839
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,590
it let go of anything yet, but the area
is good. I'll be honest. I haven't been

2840
01:16:59,590 --> 01:16:59,600
is good. I'll be honest. I haven't been
 

2841
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,149

watching the um tapers closely today.

2842
01:17:02,149 --> 01:17:02,159
watching the um tapers closely today.
 

2843
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,430
watching the um tapers closely today.
I'm just not feeling well. But let me

2844
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:03,440
I'm just not feeling well. But let me
 

2845
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:06,149
I'm just not feeling well. But let me
have a quick look for you.

2846
01:17:06,149 --> 01:17:06,159
have a quick look for you.
 

2847
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:12,550
have a quick look for you.
Um you want to defend 64 64 65. If bears

2848
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:12,560
Um you want to defend 64 64 65. If bears
 

2849
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,070
Um you want to defend 64 64 65. If bears
defend that, then I'd say there's a

2850
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:14,080
defend that, then I'd say there's a
 

2851
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,990
defend that, then I'd say there's a
little bit of excess left above that.

2852
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:16,000
little bit of excess left above that.
 

2853
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,070
little bit of excess left above that.
All right. But I' I'd be cautious on any

2854
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:18,080
All right. But I' I'd be cautious on any
 

2855
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:21,510
All right. But I' I'd be cautious on any
reclaim of 65 right now, just based on

2856
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:21,520
reclaim of 65 right now, just based on
 

2857
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,229
reclaim of 65 right now, just based on
the order flow.

2858
01:17:24,229 --> 01:17:24,239
the order flow.
 

2859
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,070
the order flow.
Yeah, Tyson, they just emailed out

2860
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:26,080

they're still experiencing problems.

2864
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:29,280
they're still experiencing problems.
 

2865
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,709
they're still experiencing problems.
They're doing everything they can to fix

2866
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:30,719
They're doing everything they can to fix
 

2867
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:38,310
They're doing everything they can to fix
it.

2868
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:38,320

 

2869
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,910

So, who is it that just said they're

2870
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:39,920
So, who is it that just said they're
 

2871
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,229
So, who is it that just said they're
short? Uh Jack. So, just be careful

2872
01:17:42,229 --> 01:17:42,239
short? Uh Jack. So, just be careful
 

2873
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:45,030
short? Uh Jack. So, just be careful
here. You they need to defend that area.

2874
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:45,040
here. You they need to defend that area.
 

2875
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,229
here. You they need to defend that area.
You're still building volume. I mean,

2876
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:46,239
You're still building volume. I mean,
 

2877
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:48,310
You're still building volume. I mean,
for me, there's no short trigger here.

2878
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:48,320
for me, there's no short trigger here.
 

2879
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,070
for me, there's no short trigger here.
You're still holding flow zones. You're

2880
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:50,080
You're still holding flow zones. You're
 

2881
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,790
You're still holding flow zones. You're
still basing out. Um, but if they defend

2882
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:52,800
still basing out. Um, but if they defend
 

2883
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:57,110
still basing out. Um, but if they defend
6465, you have had excess above that.

2884
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:57,120
6465, you have had excess above that.
 

2885
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,790
6465, you have had excess above that.
Um, but you would need to see that

2886
01:17:58,790 --> 01:17:58,800
Um, but you would need to see that
 

2887
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,390
Um, but you would need to see that
defended. I think that last push, did

2888
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:00,400
defended. I think that last push, did
 

2889
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:04,229
defended. I think that last push, did
that come right into it? 63.75 was

2890
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:04,239
that come right into it? 63.75 was
 

2891
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:06,630
that come right into it? 63.75 was
pretty good, wasn't it? So, that's the

2892
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:06,640
pretty good, wasn't it? So, that's the
 

2893
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,709
pretty good, wasn't it? So, that's the
level. Whatever that last push was like

2894
01:18:08,709 --> 01:18:08,719
level. Whatever that last push was like
 

2895
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,310
level. Whatever that last push was like
I talked about, bulls are stuck above

01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:10,320
I talked about, bulls are stuck above
 

2897
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,070

that. Reclaim that. I would be very
cautious to hold on to your short.

2901
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,350

01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,189
I would personally, I wouldn't be
shorting this yet. I haven't seen a move

2904
01:18:19,189 --> 01:18:19,199
shorting this yet. I haven't seen a move
 

2905

Yes, we're well
 

2989
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,750
Yes, we're well
we're definitely building up liquidity.

Your point of controls up here, right?

2992

Your point of controls up here, right?
 

2993
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,430
Your point of controls up here, right?
But we're defending 64 but not seeing a

breakdown at the unders underside of
 

2997
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,830
breakdown at the unders underside of

01:21:45,830 --> 01:21:45,840
this. I mean, we can tie this in smaller
 

2999

we're definitely building liquidity,

we're definitely building liquidity,
 

3005
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,790
we're definitely building liquidity,
aren't we? We've traded the most volume

3006
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:54,800
aren't we? We've traded the most volume

Someone will get hurt. It's a matter of

Someone will get hurt. It's a matter of

And if they fail this, then you know

01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:07,520
And if they fail this, then you know

01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,910
And if they fail this, then you know
they have room.

they have room.
 

3019
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:12,870

You'll be aware of bear traps today. If

You'll be aware of bear traps today. If

We're starting to see that move away

We're starting to see that move away
 

3033
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,870
We're starting to see that move away
from that liquidity now. It's the first

from that liquidity now. It's the first
 

3035
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,470
from that liquidity now. It's the first
time I'd say you're starting to see a

01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:34,480
time I'd say you're starting to see a
 

3037
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,790
time I'd say you're starting to see a
move away from liquidity, but be very,

01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:36,800
move away from liquidity, but be very,

3053
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,430

They caught it again. So that's the bear

3054
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:03,440
They caught it again. So that's the bear
 

3055
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,950
They caught it again. So that's the bear
trap underneath that shelf.

3056
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:06,960
trap underneath that shelf.
 

3057
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,950
trap underneath that shelf.
Back to the top side. And they're going

3058
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:08,960
Back to the top side. And they're going
 

3059
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,390
Back to the top side. And they're going
to keep going backwards and forwards.

3060
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:10,400
to keep going backwards and forwards.
 

3061
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,910
to keep going backwards and forwards.
This can take a while until they've got

3062
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:11,920
This can take a while until they've got
 

3063
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,669
This can take a while until they've got
enough caught one side that they want to

01:23:13,669 --> 01:23:13,679
enough caught one side that they want to
 

3065
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:15,732
enough caught one side that they want to

3066
01:23:15,732 --> 01:23:15,742

3141
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:05,189

I think there's a wash coming soon. It's

3142
01:26:05,189 --> 01:26:05,199
I think there's a wash coming soon. It's
 

3143
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:06,709
I think there's a wash coming soon. It's
just whether they trap bears in that

3144
01:26:06,709 --> 01:26:06,719
just whether they trap bears in that
 

3145
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:09,590
just whether they trap bears in that
wash or not. Starting to build up lots

3146
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:09,600
wash or not. Starting to build up lots
 

3147
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,030
wash or not. Starting to build up lots
of volume here. Starting to see bearish

3148
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:11,040
of volume here. Starting to see bearish
 

3149
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,030
of volume here. Starting to see bearish
pressure try and force this wash down to

3150
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:13,040
pressure try and force this wash down to
 

3151
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:21,350
pressure try and force this wash down to
into some of these levels.

3152
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:21,360

 

3153
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,830

previous day high taken starting to

3154
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:23,840
previous day high taken starting to
 

3155
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,510
previous day high taken starting to
build volume up at those highs and now

3156
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:25,520
build volume up at those highs and now
 

3157
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,750
build volume up at those highs and now
we're starting to move away from those

3158
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:27,760
we're starting to move away from those
 

3159
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:32,470
we're starting to move away from those
highs.

3160
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:32,480

 

3161
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,310

Yeah, Kevin, you see that book map above

3162
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:34,320
Yeah, Kevin, you see that book map above
 

3163
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,830
Yeah, Kevin, you see that book map above
me? It's right there. It's there. There.

3164
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:37,840
me? It's right there. It's there. There.
 

3165
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:40,070
me? It's right there. It's there. There.
That's why I have it there for you to

3166
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:40,080
That's why I have it there for you to
 

3167
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:45,510
That's why I have it there for you to
use.

3168
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:45,520

 

3169
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,350

And even if you're not, you can use

3170
01:26:47,350 --> 01:26:47,360
And even if you're not, you can use
 

3171
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,030
And even if you're not, you can use
volume profile. You can see where are we

3172
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:49,040
volume profile. You can see where are we
 

3173
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:52,390
volume profile. You can see where are we
thick? 37 to 50 is here. You don't need

3174
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:52,400
thick? 37 to 50 is here. You don't need
 

3175
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,070
thick? 37 to 50 is here. You don't need
to know the exact order number. You can

3176
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:54,080
to know the exact order number. You can
 

3177
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,030
to know the exact order number. You can
see where we're thick. This doesn't

3178
01:26:57,030 --> 01:26:57,040
see where we're thick. This doesn't
 

3179
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,189
see where we're thick. This doesn't
matter if it's bitmap or whatever you're

3180
01:26:59,189 --> 01:26:59,199
matter if it's bitmap or whatever you're
 

3181
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:09,570
matter if it's bitmap or whatever you're
using.

3182
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:09,580

 

3183
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:10,390

[snorts]

3184
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:10,400
[snorts]
 

3185
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,030
[snorts]
So if bears defend

3186
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:13,040
So if bears defend
 

3187
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:16,470
So if bears defend
basically 40 to 50 10point range, you

3188
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:16,480
basically 40 to 50 10point range, you
 

3189
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,950
basically 40 to 50 10point range, you
can see a rotation maybe for this wick

3190
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:18,960
can see a rotation maybe for this wick
 

3191
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:20,550
can see a rotation maybe for this wick
and down into here. If bulls reclaim

3192
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:20,560
and down into here. If bulls reclaim
 

3193
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,550
and down into here. If bulls reclaim
that, I'd be watching out for a big old

3194
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:22,560
that, I'd be watching out for a big old
 

3195
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,790
that, I'd be watching out for a big old
squeeze out.

3196
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:24,800
squeeze out.
 

3197
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,270
squeeze out.
Bear traps in this environment can be uh

3198
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:27,280
Bear traps in this environment can be uh
 

3199
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:37,990
Bear traps in this environment can be uh
pretty nasty.

3200
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:38,000

 

3201
01:27:38,000 --> 01:28:09,030

I'm not playing this game anymore, guys.

3202
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:09,040

 

3203
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,110

Starting to see bears come in here. They

3204
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:11,120
Starting to see bears come in here. They
 

3205
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,030
Starting to see bears come in here. They
need to defend this level. This gray

3206
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:13,040
need to defend this level. This gray
 

3207
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:16,070
need to defend this level. This gray
box. This gray box right here. That is

3208
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:16,080
box. This gray box right here. That is
 

3209
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:17,830
box. This gray box right here. That is
what they must defend. If you're going

3210
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:17,840
what they must defend. If you're going
 

3211
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,669
what they must defend. If you're going
to see a wash down here, if they fail to

3212
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:19,679
to see a wash down here, if they fail to
 

3213
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:21,430
to see a wash down here, if they fail to
defend it, this can be a bullish move.

3214
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:21,440
defend it, this can be a bullish move.
 

3215
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,990
defend it, this can be a bullish move.
This can be a two-leg.

3216
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:24,000
This can be a two-leg.
 

3217
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,830
This can be a two-leg.
If they catch this, this is what you're

3218
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:25,840
If they catch this, this is what you're
 

3219
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,990
If they catch this, this is what you're
going to get.

3220
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:28,000
going to get.
 

3221
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,830
going to get.
And the target will be up here if they

3222
01:28:29,830 --> 01:28:29,840
And the target will be up here if they
 

3223
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:32,229
And the target will be up here if they
do that. It's that's a very very bullish

3224
01:28:32,229 --> 01:28:32,239
do that. It's that's a very very bullish
 

3225
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:34,470
do that. It's that's a very very bullish
move if they do it

3226
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:34,480
move if they do it
 

3227
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,629
move if they do it
up into this. Bears will try and defend

3228
01:28:36,629 --> 01:28:36,639
up into this. Bears will try and defend
 

3229
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:39,270
up into this. Bears will try and defend
this gray box here.

3230
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:39,280
this gray box here.
 

3231
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,790
this gray box here.
That's an important level for them to

3232
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:40,800
That's an important level for them to
 

3233
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,830
That's an important level for them to
defend right now. [snorts]

3234
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:43,840
defend right now. [snorts]
 

3235
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:47,110
defend right now. [snorts]
That's what you're watching.

3236
01:28:47,110 --> 01:28:47,120
That's what you're watching.
 

3237
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:49,590
That's what you're watching.
Overall momentum in this session has

3238
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:49,600
Overall momentum in this session has
 

3239
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,669
Overall momentum in this session has
been upside. There's no doubt about it.

3240
01:28:51,669 --> 01:28:51,679
been upside. There's no doubt about it.
 

3241
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:54,390
been upside. There's no doubt about it.
You are 415 points higher. We built out

3242
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:54,400
You are 415 points higher. We built out
 

3243
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,990
You are 415 points higher. We built out
some volume going sideways.

3244
01:28:57,990 --> 01:28:58,000
some volume going sideways.
 

3245
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,990
some volume going sideways.
You just can't rule anything out in this

3246
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:00,000
You just can't rule anything out in this
 

3247
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:10,629
You just can't rule anything out in this
market.

3248
01:29:10,629 --> 01:29:10,639

 

3249
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:12,310

I'm going to start ignoring chat cuz

3250
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:12,320
I'm going to start ignoring chat cuz
 

3251
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:15,270
I'm going to start ignoring chat cuz
some of the stuff I'm seeing is

3252
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:15,280
some of the stuff I'm seeing is
 

3253
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:28,709
some of the stuff I'm seeing is
nonsensical at this point.

3254
01:29:28,709 --> 01:29:28,719

 

3255
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:30,149

Starting to find a bid up towards that

3256
01:29:30,149 --> 01:29:30,159
Starting to find a bid up towards that
 

3257
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:31,830
Starting to find a bid up towards that
previous day low. How it reacts there is

3258
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:31,840
previous day low. How it reacts there is
 

3259
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:38,070
previous day low. How it reacts there is
going to be important. I would say

3260
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:38,080

 

3261
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,310

they're successfully defending so far.

3262
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:40,320
they're successfully defending so far.
 

3263
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,990
they're successfully defending so far.
That box that is the area. It's been the

3264
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:44,000
That box that is the area. It's been the
 

3265
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:51,350
That box that is the area. It's been the
area the whole time.

3266
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:51,360

 

3267
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,110

There is room both sides here. It's just

3268
01:29:53,110 --> 01:29:53,120
There is room both sides here. It's just
 

3269
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,390
There is room both sides here. It's just
going to be a battle of who's going to

3270
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:54,400
going to be a battle of who's going to
 

3271
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:55,990
going to be a battle of who's going to
win. Are higher time frame bears going

3272
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:56,000
win. Are higher time frame bears going
 

3273
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,070
win. Are higher time frame bears going
to protect this area or not? It's really

3274
01:29:58,070 --> 01:29:58,080
to protect this area or not? It's really
 

3275
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,709
to protect this area or not? It's really
It's really that simple. Do higher time

3276
01:30:00,709 --> 01:30:00,719
It's really that simple. Do higher time
 

3277
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:02,709
It's really that simple. Do higher time
frame bears want to protect this area

3278
01:30:02,709 --> 01:30:02,719
frame bears want to protect this area
 

3279
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:04,629
frame bears want to protect this area
and force the rotation back down or not?

3280
01:30:04,629 --> 01:30:04,639
and force the rotation back down or not?
 

3281
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:07,270
and force the rotation back down or not?
If the answer is no, or that the bulls

3282
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:07,280
If the answer is no, or that the bulls
 

3283
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:08,950
If the answer is no, or that the bulls
are saying, "Hey, we want it higher."

3284
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:08,960
are saying, "Hey, we want it higher."
 

3285
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,070
are saying, "Hey, we want it higher."
Then they will win. The levels are here.

3286
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:12,080
Then they will win. The levels are here.
 

3287
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,669
Then they will win. The levels are here.
I've put them there for you. Trade it as

3288
01:30:13,669 --> 01:30:13,679
I've put them there for you. Trade it as

3292
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:23,360

 

3293
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,430

Starting to see some bears try and force

3294
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:25,440
Starting to see some bears try and force
 

3295
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:28,470
Starting to see some bears try and force
their way in here. 900 is a level. They

3296
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:28,480
their way in here. 900 is a level. They
 

3297
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,510
their way in here. 900 is a level. They
keep soaking off the 900 over and over

3298
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:31,520
keep soaking off the 900 over and over
 

3299
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,990
keep soaking off the 900 over and over
and over again these bulls. If you get a

3300
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:34,000
and over again these bulls. If you get a
 

3301
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,790
and over again these bulls. If you get a
break down here and you know that next

3302
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:36,800
break down here and you know that next
 

3303
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,430
break down here and you know that next
gray box is not out the question. It

3304
01:30:39,430 --> 01:30:39,440
gray box is not out the question. It
 

3305
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,990
gray box is not out the question. It
isn't out the question. There you go. So

3306
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:42,000
isn't out the question. There you go. So
 

3307
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,830
isn't out the question. There you go. So
starting to trade into the 900s. Once

3308
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:43,840
starting to trade into the 900s. Once
 

3309
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,750
starting to trade into the 900s. Once
you snap this, there is potential room.

3310
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:45,760
you snap this, there is potential room.
 

3311
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:48,070
you snap this, there is potential room.
Just be careful of bear traps because

3312
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:48,080
Just be careful of bear traps because
 

3313
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,270
Just be careful of bear traps because
you're basically trying to play the

3314
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:49,280
you're basically trying to play the
 

3315
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:52,390
you're basically trying to play the
counter trend of the high, but we are

3316
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:52,400
counter trend of the high, but we are
 

3317
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,270
counter trend of the high, but we are
rejecting volume. So, this was the area

3318
01:30:55,270 --> 01:30:55,280
rejecting volume. So, this was the area
 

3319
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:58,070
rejecting volume. So, this was the area
I told you so many times. If bears

3320
01:30:58,070 --> 01:30:58,080
I told you so many times. If bears
 

3321
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:01,430
I told you so many times. If bears
defend this, which they did,

3322
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:01,440
defend this, which they did,
 

3323
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,669
defend this, which they did,
this move here is possible and this is

3324
01:31:03,669 --> 01:31:03,679
this move here is possible and this is
 

3325
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:05,430
this move here is possible and this is
possible. Okay? Because we haven't

3326
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:05,440
possible. Okay? Because we haven't
 

3327
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,709
possible. Okay? Because we haven't
pulled back yet. They can bulls can set

3328
01:31:08,709 --> 01:31:08,719
pulled back yet. They can bulls can set
 

3329
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:10,950
pulled back yet. They can bulls can set
a trap and do this. So, you do not want

3330
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:10,960
a trap and do this. So, you do not want
 

3331
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,030
a trap and do this. So, you do not want
to be bearish on any reclaim of that

3332
01:31:13,030 --> 01:31:13,040
to be bearish on any reclaim of that
 

3333
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,950
to be bearish on any reclaim of that
level. That's all I'm saying. If you

3334
01:31:14,950 --> 01:31:14,960
level. That's all I'm saying. If you
 

3335
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,950
level. That's all I'm saying. If you
want to be bearish at this level looking

3336
01:31:16,950 --> 01:31:16,960
want to be bearish at this level looking
 

3337
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:19,350
want to be bearish at this level looking
for the wash, that makes sense. But do

3338
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:19,360
for the wash, that makes sense. But do
 

3339
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,990
for the wash, that makes sense. But do
not be bearish above this level. All

3340
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:22,000
not be bearish above this level. All
 

3341
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,030
not be bearish above this level. All
right? Because then you're going to try

3342
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:23,040
right? Because then you're going to try
 

3343
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:25,750
right? Because then you're going to try
and pick a top and you will get hurt. If

3344
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:25,760
and pick a top and you will get hurt. If
 

3345
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,030
and pick a top and you will get hurt. If
you want to be bullish, if you're

3346
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:27,040
you want to be bullish, if you're
 

3347
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,350
you want to be bullish, if you're
waiting, I'd say one big problem. You've

3348
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:29,360
waiting, I'd say one big problem. You've
 

3349
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,350
waiting, I'd say one big problem. You've
taken the lowhanging fruit today. But,

3350
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:31,360
taken the lowhanging fruit today. But,
 

3351
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:35,189
taken the lowhanging fruit today. But,
uh, I don't love this play. It's it's

3352
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:35,199
uh, I don't love this play. It's it's
 

3353
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:36,950
uh, I don't love this play. It's it's
probable that they will squeeze if they

3354
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:36,960
probable that they will squeeze if they
 

3355
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,229
probable that they will squeeze if they
do that play, but it means you're bet

3356
01:31:38,229 --> 01:31:38,239
do that play, but it means you're bet
 

3357
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:39,910
do that play, but it means you're bet
buying very high. It's very risky. The

3358
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:39,920
buying very high. It's very risky. The
 

3359
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,510
buying very high. It's very risky. The
easier bullish move will be something

3360
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:41,520
easier bullish move will be something
 

3361
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,070
easier bullish move will be something
like this. You know, something like that

3362
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:44,080
like this. You know, something like that
 

3363
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,470
like this. You know, something like that
off off an area or even that same move

3364
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:46,480
off off an area or even that same move
 

3365
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:49,990
off off an area or even that same move
down here will be a nicer rotation

3366
01:31:49,990 --> 01:31:50,000
down here will be a nicer rotation
 

3367
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,310
down here will be a nicer rotation
rotational move. Right now, bear

3368

3397
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:04,709

There's looking for that snap down to

01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:04,719
There's looking for that snap down to
 

3399
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:06,870
There's looking for that snap down to
that next area. That's what the bears

3400
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:06,880
that next area. That's what the bears
 

3401
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:09,189
that next area. That's what the bears
are looking for. They're looking to have

3402
01:33:09,189 --> 01:33:09,199
are looking for. They're looking to have
 

3403
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:11,510
are looking for. They're looking to have
trapped bulls and defend this area.

3404
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:11,520
trapped bulls and defend this area.
 

3405
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,270
trapped bulls and defend this area.
Remember, this is the area from Monday.

3406
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:13,280
Remember, this is the area from Monday.
 

3407
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:19,270
Remember, this is the area from Monday.
If we zoom out,

3408
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:19,280

 

3409
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:22,070

right? This is the area under over under

3410
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:22,080
right? This is the area under over under
 

3411
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,709
right? This is the area under over under
over. Think about this.

3412
01:33:24,709 --> 01:33:24,719
over. Think about this.
 

3413
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:27,270
over. Think about this.
We always talk about support, support,

3414
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:27,280
We always talk about support, support,
 

3415
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,270
We always talk about support, support,
breakdown, resistance, resistance,

3416
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:29,280
breakdown, resistance, resistance,
 

3417
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,430
breakdown, resistance, resistance,
breakdown. Currently, resistance. We get

3418
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:31,440
breakdown. Currently, resistance. We get
 

3419
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,950
breakdown. Currently, resistance. We get
over it, support, and squeeze as

3420
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:32,960
over it, support, and squeeze as
 

3421
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,390
over it, support, and squeeze as
possible. Which is why I'm saying if we

3422
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:34,400
possible. Which is why I'm saying if we
 

3423
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,830
possible. Which is why I'm saying if we
get over that, you do not want to be

3424
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:35,840
get over that, you do not want to be
 

3425
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:38,149
get over that, you do not want to be
bearish. But right now, they're doing a

3426
01:33:38,149 --> 01:33:38,159
bearish. But right now, they're doing a
 

3427
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:40,070
bearish. But right now, they're doing a
good job of defending it. They've let

3428
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:40,080
good job of defending it. They've let
 

3429
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,310
good job of defending it. They've let
bulls chase above previous day high.

3430
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:42,320
bulls chase above previous day high.
 

3431
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,229
bulls chase above previous day high.
They've created a volume shelf here.

3432
01:33:44,229 --> 01:33:44,239
They've created a volume shelf here.
 

3433
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:45,990
They've created a volume shelf here.
They're defending the volume shelf here.

3434
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:46,000
They're defending the volume shelf here.
 

3435
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,590
They're defending the volume shelf here.
They're liquidating this player here.

3436
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:47,600
They're liquidating this player here.
 

3437
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,910
They're liquidating this player here.
And now they're trying to get a flush

3438
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:49,920
And now they're trying to get a flush
 

3439
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,870
And now they're trying to get a flush
into these gray boxes. And then what

3440
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:52,880
into these gray boxes. And then what
 

3441
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,390
into these gray boxes. And then what
happens at that point? I don't know.

3442
01:33:54,390 --> 01:33:54,400
happens at that point? I don't know.
 

3443
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:55,270
happens at that point? I don't know.
We're going to have to watch the

3444
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:55,280
We're going to have to watch the
 

3445
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,750
We're going to have to watch the
momentum as we get down there, right? Do

3446
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:57,760
momentum as we get down there, right? Do
 

3447
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:06,470
momentum as we get down there, right? Do
balls come back in or not?

3448
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:06,480

 

3449
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,430

I'm starting to sweat now. [\h__\h] I might

3450
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:09,440
I'm starting to sweat now. [\h__\h] I might
 

3451
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,350
I'm starting to sweat now. [\h__\h] I might
not be on tomorrow, folks. All right.

3452
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:11,360
not be on tomorrow, folks. All right.
 

3453
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,350
not be on tomorrow, folks. All right.
I'm I'm away Friday, but if I'm feeling

3454
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:13,360
I'm I'm away Friday, but if I'm feeling
 

3455
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:14,709
I'm I'm away Friday, but if I'm feeling
like this tomorrow, I'm going to have to

3456
01:34:14,709 --> 01:34:14,719
like this tomorrow, I'm going to have to
 

3457
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:17,590
like this tomorrow, I'm going to have to
just try and rest. [snorts]

3458
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:17,600
just try and rest. [snorts]
 

3459
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,030
just try and rest. [snorts]
Otherwise, I'm just going to set myself

3460
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:19,040
Otherwise, I'm just going to set myself
 

3461
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:23,669
Otherwise, I'm just going to set myself
back.

3462
01:34:23,669 --> 01:34:23,679

 

3463
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:25,830

So, a trap can live in this low volume

3464
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:25,840
So, a trap can live in this low volume
 

3465
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,510
So, a trap can live in this low volume
node. So, if you've been bearish, just

3466
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:27,520
node. So, if you've been bearish, just
 

3467
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,110
node. So, if you've been bearish, just
you don't want to see this snap back

3468
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:29,120
you don't want to see this snap back
 

3469
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,510
you don't want to see this snap back
from here. You don't want this to act as

3470
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:31,520
from here. You don't want this to act as
 

3471
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,189
from here. You don't want this to act as
a support mechanism. You want a straight

3472
01:34:33,189 --> 01:34:33,199
a support mechanism. You want a straight
 

3473
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:34,950
a support mechanism. You want a straight
flush down to the next level. If you're

3474
01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:34,960
flush down to the next level. If you're
 

3475
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,669
flush down to the next level. If you're
bearish on this move here into into 38s

3476
01:34:37,669 --> 01:34:37,679
bearish on this move here into into 38s
 

3477
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:40,390
bearish on this move here into into 38s
or 40s, you want to see a straight swipe

3478
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:40,400
or 40s, you want to see a straight swipe
 

3479
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,990
or 40s, you want to see a straight swipe
down and then just trail it down and

3480
01:34:41,990 --> 01:34:42,000
down and then just trail it down and
 

3481
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,350
down and then just trail it down and
hopefully it just pukes all the way out

3482
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:43,360
hopefully it just pukes all the way out
 

3483
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,790
hopefully it just pukes all the way out
for you. It' be very nice because think

3484
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:44,800
for you. It' be very nice because think
 

3485
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,070
for you. It' be very nice because think
about what we've done today. Have we

3486
01:34:46,070 --> 01:34:46,080
about what we've done today. Have we
 

3487
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,510
about what we've done today. Have we
built any structure really on the way

3488
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:47,520
built any structure really on the way
 

3489
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:50,470
built any structure really on the way
up? Not really, have we? Right. So, the

3490
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:50,480
up? Not really, have we? Right. So, the
 

3491
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,070
up? Not really, have we? Right. So, the
deeper this goes, the better. But you do

3492
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:52,080
deeper this goes, the better. But you do
 

3493
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:54,310
deeper this goes, the better. But you do
not want to be bearish above this gray

3494
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:54,320
not want to be bearish above this gray
 

3495
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,070
not want to be bearish above this gray
box up here in red line. That is

3496
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:56,080
box up here in red line. That is
 

3497
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:57,669
box up here in red line. That is
absolutely asking for it. If they

3498
01:34:57,669 --> 01:34:57,679
absolutely asking for it. If they
 

3499
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:07,030
absolutely asking for it. If they
reclaim that, it is asking for it.

3500
01:35:07,030 --> 01:35:07,040

 

3501
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:23,510

Oh my head.

3502
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:23,520

 

3503
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,669

All right, here's the retest of it.

3504
01:35:25,669 --> 01:35:25,679
All right, here's the retest of it.
 

3505
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:28,149
All right, here's the retest of it.
Again, if they reclaim this, I would not

3506
01:35:28,149 --> 01:35:28,159
Again, if they reclaim this, I would not
 

3507
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:30,550
Again, if they reclaim this, I would not
hold on to your shorts. If they reclaim

3508
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:30,560
hold on to your shorts. If they reclaim
 

3509
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,470
hold on to your shorts. If they reclaim
this, I would not hold on. They defend

3510
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:32,480
this, I would not hold on. They defend
 

3511
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:35,430
this, I would not hold on. They defend
it, you're fine, right? They keep using

3512
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:35,440
it, you're fine, right? They keep using
 

3513
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,149
it, you're fine, right? They keep using
it as a level to sell into, you're fine.

3514
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:38,159
it as a level to sell into, you're fine.
 

3515
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:39,910
it as a level to sell into, you're fine.
Would not hold on to shorts above it. I

3516
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:39,920
Would not hold on to shorts above it. I
 

3517
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,350
Would not hold on to shorts above it. I
wouldn't be risking high day here.

3518
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:41,360
wouldn't be risking high day here.
 

3519
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,189
wouldn't be risking high day here.
Personally, for me, I think it's way too

3520
01:35:43,189 --> 01:35:43,199
Personally, for me, I think it's way too
 

3521
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:52,790
Personally, for me, I think it's way too
risky.

3522
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:52,800

 

3523
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:56,950

Yeah, I don't blame you, Mike. I mean,

3524
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:56,960
Yeah, I don't blame you, Mike. I mean,
 

3525
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:00,470
Yeah, I don't blame you, Mike. I mean,
it's one of those days, right? Like

3526
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:00,480
it's one of those days, right? Like
 

3527
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,430
it's one of those days, right? Like
I was happy to be long, you know, if we

3528
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:03,440
I was happy to be long, you know, if we
 

3529
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,030
I was happy to be long, you know, if we
came down into here. Maybe that was

3530
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:05,040
came down into here. Maybe that was
 

3531
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,270
came down into here. Maybe that was
stingy of me, but you know, I'm not

3532
01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:07,280
stingy of me, but you know, I'm not
 

3533
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:10,229
stingy of me, but you know, I'm not
going to play the opening drive when

3534
01:36:10,229 --> 01:36:10,239
going to play the opening drive when
 

3535
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:11,830
going to play the opening drive when
all we did was this. We think about what

3536
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:11,840
all we did was this. We think about what
 

3537
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:15,750
all we did was this. We think about what
we did this morning. Up, down, up, down,

3538
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:15,760
we did this morning. Up, down, up, down,
 

3539
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:18,470
we did this morning. Up, down, up, down,
up, down. The first what, four minutes

3540
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:18,480
up, down. The first what, four minutes
 

3541
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:19,910
up, down. The first what, four minutes
didn't come into here. I was looking for

3542
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:19,920
didn't come into here. I was looking for
 

3543
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,830
didn't come into here. I was looking for
a lip below and fail if I'm going to be

3544
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:21,840
a lip below and fail if I'm going to be
 

3545
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:25,590
a lip below and fail if I'm going to be
a trigger long. And then we go and we

3546
01:36:25,590 --> 01:36:25,600
a trigger long. And then we go and we
 

3547
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,950
a trigger long. And then we go and we
chop around here for a bit and then we

3548
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:26,960
chop around here for a bit and then we
 

3549
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,430
chop around here for a bit and then we
go and we just we just go. We don't

3550
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:29,440
go and we just we just go. We don't
 

3551
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,430
go and we just we just go. We don't
stop. We don't do anything other than

3552
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:31,440
stop. We don't do anything other than
 

3553
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:34,149
stop. We don't do anything other than
straight up. So you now, like you said,

3554
01:36:34,149 --> 01:36:34,159
straight up. So you now, like you said,
 

3555
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:36,070
straight up. So you now, like you said,
we've taken previous day high, low

3556
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:36,080
we've taken previous day high, low
 

3557
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,590
we've taken previous day high, low
hanging fruit's gone. You're going to

3558
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:37,600
hanging fruit's gone. You're going to
 

3559
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,510
hanging fruit's gone. You're going to
see a move back down. We don't know if

3560
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:39,520
see a move back down. We don't know if
 

3561
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,870
see a move back down. We don't know if
bulls are going to come in and defend

3562
01:36:40,870 --> 01:36:40,880
bulls are going to come in and defend
 

3563
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,310
bulls are going to come in and defend
that move because they've just got the

3564
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:42,320
that move because they've just got the
 

3565
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,149
that move because they've just got the
big squeeze out that they wanted. Who's

3566
01:36:44,149 --> 01:36:44,159
big squeeze out that they wanted. Who's
 

3567
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:45,669
big squeeze out that they wanted. Who's
to say this doesn't come all the way

3568
01:36:45,669 --> 01:36:45,679
to say this doesn't come all the way
 

3569
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:48,550
to say this doesn't come all the way
down to low of day.

3570
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:48,560
down to low of day.
 

3571
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,229
down to low of day.
We've seen weirder things happen in this

3572
01:36:50,229 --> 01:36:50,239
We've seen weirder things happen in this
 

3573
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:51,669
We've seen weirder things happen in this
market, right? We've absolutely seen

3574
01:36:51,669 --> 01:36:51,679
market, right? We've absolutely seen
 

3575
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:54,790
market, right? We've absolutely seen
weirder things happen right now.

3576
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:54,800
weirder things happen right now.
 

3577
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,709
weirder things happen right now.
It's a big squeeze out. Remember, it was

3578
01:36:56,709 --> 01:36:56,719
It's a big squeeze out. Remember, it was
 

3579
01:36:56,719 --> 01:37:04,790
It's a big squeeze out. Remember, it was
415 point squeeze out this morning.

3580
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:04,800

 

3581
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,669

Do I think they want to take 25,000? I

3582
01:37:07,669 --> 01:37:07,679
Do I think they want to take 25,000? I
 

3583
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:10,870
Do I think they want to take 25,000? I
mean, they were pretty close. So, but

3584
01:37:10,870 --> 01:37:10,880
mean, they were pretty close. So, but
 

3585
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,709
mean, they were pretty close. So, but
you know, it's not a level other than a

3586
01:37:12,709 --> 01:37:12,719
you know, it's not a level other than a
 

3587
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:14,550
you know, it's not a level other than a
psychological level. The level really,

3588
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:14,560
psychological level. The level really,
 

3589
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:16,070
psychological level. The level really,
if they're going to they're going to get

3590
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:16,080
if they're going to they're going to get
 

3591
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,910
if they're going to they're going to get
above today's high, the level really is

3592
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:17,920
above today's high, the level really is
 

3593
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:19,990
above today's high, the level really is
up here, 25,000

3594
01:37:19,990 --> 01:37:20,000
up here, 25,000
 

3595
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,550
up here, 25,000
and let's just call it 95.

3596
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:22,560
and let's just call it 95.
 

3597
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,709
and let's just call it 95.
That's the level. They're building more

3598
01:37:24,709 --> 01:37:24,719

were very, very thin on the way up. This

3637
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,149

3756
01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:02,880
defended it, now we're starting to wash
 

3757
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,709
defended it, now we're starting to wash
down to search. What we searching for?

3758
01:41:04,709 --> 01:41:04,719
down to search. What we searching for?
 

3759
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:06,550
down to search. What we searching for?
We're searching for new value, right?

3760
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:06,560
We're searching for new value, right?
 

3761
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,709
We're searching for new value, right?
We're searching for fair value. None was

3762
01:41:08,709 --> 01:41:08,719
We're searching for fair value. None was
 

3763
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:10,629
We're searching for fair value. None was
deemed up there. We moved away from it

3764
01:41:10,629 --> 01:41:10,639
deemed up there. We moved away from it
 

3765
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:12,709
deemed up there. We moved away from it
now. All the buyers got caught moving

3766
01:41:12,709 --> 01:41:12,719
now. All the buyers got caught moving
 

3767
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:14,550
now. All the buyers got caught moving
aggressively away. We're going to search

3768
01:41:14,550 --> 01:41:14,560
aggressively away. We're going to search
 

3769
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:16,709
aggressively away. We're going to search
for value. We don't know if and when

3770
01:41:16,709 --> 01:41:16,719
for value. We don't know if and when
 

3771
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:19,350
for value. We don't know if and when
that value comes. It might not come. It

3772
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:19,360
that value comes. It might not come. It
 

3773
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:21,109
that value comes. It might not come. It
might be that they go all the way back

3774
01:41:21,109 --> 01:41:21,119
might be that they go all the way back
 

3775
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:23,189
might be that they go all the way back
to the lows because we haven't built any

3776
01:41:23,189 --> 01:41:23,199
to the lows because we haven't built any
 

3777
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:25,430
to the lows because we haven't built any
structure. I don't know. I can only tell

3778
01:41:25,430 --> 01:41:25,440
structure. I don't know. I can only tell
 

3779
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:26,790
structure. I don't know. I can only tell
you what I'm seeing in front of me. I

3780
01:41:26,790 --> 01:41:26,800
you what I'm seeing in front of me. I
 

3781
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,629
you what I'm seeing in front of me. I
have no idea what their intentions for

3782
01:41:28,629 --> 01:41:28,639
have no idea what their intentions for
 

3783
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:31,270
have no idea what their intentions for
this are.

3784
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:31,280
this are.
 

3785
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:42,390
this are.
VWAP is currently trading at 34s

3786
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:42,400

 

3787
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:46,310

and I think it was 8 40 to 800s or 850

3788
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:46,320
and I think it was 8 40 to 800s or 850
 

3789
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,149
and I think it was 8 40 to 800s or 850
to 800s was the levels from yesterday.

3790
01:41:48,149 --> 01:41:48,159
to 800s was the levels from yesterday.
 

3791
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:50,629
to 800s was the levels from yesterday.
Right. So here we go. Here's the 40s VW

3792
01:41:50,629 --> 01:41:50,639
Right. So here we go. Here's the 40s VW
 

3793
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:53,189
Right. So here we go. Here's the 40s VW
coming up and under that previous day

3794
01:41:53,189 --> 01:41:53,199
coming up and under that previous day
 

3795
01:41:53,199 --> 01:41:54,550
coming up and under that previous day
value area high. Okay, so if you're in

3796
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:54,560
value area high. Okay, so if you're in
 

3797
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,990
value area high. Okay, so if you're in
the short, you look pretty good at the

3798
01:41:55,990 --> 01:41:56,000
the short, you look pretty good at the
 

3799
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,590
the short, you look pretty good at the
moment. Under this, we get very, very

3800
01:41:57,590 --> 01:41:57,600
moment. Under this, we get very, very
 

3801
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:58,950
moment. Under this, we get very, very
thin. Again, you can see the shelf

3802
01:41:58,950 --> 01:41:58,960
thin. Again, you can see the shelf
 

3803
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,669
thin. Again, you can see the shelf
there. We get very thin under this.

3804
01:42:01,669 --> 01:42:01,679
there. We get very thin under this.
 

3805
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:04,790
there. We get very thin under this.
Here's your VWAP bid. So, some bids at

3806
01:42:04,790 --> 01:42:04,800
Here's your VWAP bid. So, some bids at
 

3807
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,390
Here's your VWAP bid. So, some bids at
VWAP here. A little bit of a reaction

3808
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:06,400
VWAP here. A little bit of a reaction
 

3809
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:10,390
VWAP here. A little bit of a reaction
here.

3810
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:10,400

 

3811
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:12,390

So, back down into that gray box and

3812
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:12,400
So, back down into that gray box and
 

3813
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:14,470
So, back down into that gray box and
shelf. That's your first reaction of the

3814
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:14,480
shelf. That's your first reaction of the
 

3815
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,470
shelf. That's your first reaction of the
day

3816
01:42:16,470 --> 01:42:16,480
day
 

3817
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:18,149
day
or buyers.

3818
01:42:18,149 --> 01:42:18,159
or buyers.
 

3819
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:19,910
or buyers.
And you need to see if they can sustain

3820
01:42:19,910 --> 01:42:19,920
And you need to see if they can sustain
 

3821
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:21,270
And you need to see if they can sustain
anything here, really, don't you? You

3822
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:21,280
anything here, really, don't you? You
 

3823
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,790
anything here, really, don't you? You
need to see are they going to hold this

3824
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:22,800
need to see are they going to hold this
 

3825
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,629
need to see are they going to hold this
gray box. This is a cover point for you.

3826
01:42:24,629 --> 01:42:24,639
gray box. This is a cover point for you.
 

3827
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:25,990
gray box. This is a cover point for you.
If you were short, you should be taking

3828
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:26,000
If you were short, you should be taking
 

3829
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,310
If you were short, you should be taking
a partial here. If they flush this

3830
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:28,320
a partial here. If they flush this
 

3831
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:30,149
a partial here. If they flush this
previous day value area high and then

3832
01:42:30,149 --> 01:42:30,159
previous day value area high and then
 

3833
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:32,070
previous day value area high and then
all the way back down into 740s. All

3834
01:42:32,070 --> 01:42:32,080
all the way back down into 740s. All
 

3835
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:33,750
all the way back down into 740s. All
right, so hopefully this makes sense for

3836
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:33,760
right, so hopefully this makes sense for
 

3837
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:36,310
right, so hopefully this makes sense for
you. My head is pounding, so I am not

3838
01:42:36,310 --> 01:42:36,320
you. My head is pounding, so I am not
 

3839
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:39,189
you. My head is pounding, so I am not
actively trading this today, folks. But

3840
01:42:39,189 --> 01:42:39,199
actively trading this today, folks. But
 

3841
01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:41,510
actively trading this today, folks. But
hopefully me making sense of this is

3842
01:42:41,510 --> 01:42:41,520
hopefully me making sense of this is
 

3843
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:42,870
hopefully me making sense of this is
helping you. Maybe I'm able to teach

3844
01:42:42,870 --> 01:42:42,880
helping you. Maybe I'm able to teach
 

3845
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,310
helping you. Maybe I'm able to teach
even more than normal because I'm not

3846
01:42:44,310 --> 01:42:44,320
even more than normal because I'm not
 

3847
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:53,030
even more than normal because I'm not
really trading it.

3848
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:53,040

 

3849
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:55,109

Oh, did it did it really mo? Yeah, for

3850
01:42:55,109 --> 01:42:55,119
Oh, did it did it really mo? Yeah, for
 

3851
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:56,310
Oh, did it did it really mo? Yeah, for
me it was just a look. It was a look

3852
01:42:56,310 --> 01:42:56,320
me it was just a look. It was a look
 

3853
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,070
me it was just a look. It was a look
above previous day high and fail. That's

3854
01:42:58,070 --> 01:42:58,080
above previous day high and fail. That's
 

3855
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:00,070
above previous day high and fail. That's
all it was for me. Squeeze out, look

3856
01:43:00,070 --> 01:43:00,080
all it was for me. Squeeze out, look
 

3857
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,470
all it was for me. Squeeze out, look
above, fail into key level here. Balls

3858
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:02,480
above, fail into key level here. Balls
 

3859
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:03,910
above, fail into key level here. Balls
either hold this level. If they fail to

3860
01:43:03,910 --> 01:43:03,920
either hold this level. If they fail to
 

3861
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:05,590
either hold this level. If they fail to
hold this level, we drop down. So the

3862
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:05,600
hold this level, we drop down. So the
 

3863
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,070
hold this level, we drop down. So the
rotations, if bulls hold this level,

3864
01:43:08,070 --> 01:43:08,080
rotations, if bulls hold this level,
 

3865
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:11,430
rotations, if bulls hold this level,
right, the rotation will be

3866
01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:11,440
right, the rotation will be
 

3867
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:13,109
right, the rotation will be
between this box and this box, right?

3868
01:43:13,109 --> 01:43:13,119
between this box and this box, right?
 

3869
01:43:13,119 --> 01:43:14,310
between this box and this box, right?
Because that's when we get thick, they

3870
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:14,320
Because that's when we get thick, they
 

3871
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:15,990
Because that's when we get thick, they
reclaim this between this box and this

3872
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:16,000
reclaim this between this box and this
 

3873
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,990
reclaim this between this box and this
box. If bulls fail the rotation, we're

3874
01:43:17,990 --> 01:43:18,000
box. If bulls fail the rotation, we're
 

3875
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,790
box. If bulls fail the rotation, we're
going to come down either here or here.

3876
01:43:20,790 --> 01:43:20,800
going to come down either here or here.
 

3877
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,629
going to come down either here or here.
That's the battle, right? That's how we

3878
01:43:22,629 --> 01:43:22,639
That's the battle, right? That's how we
 

3879
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:24,550
That's the battle, right? That's how we
build liquidity. We're searching to see

3880
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:24,560
build liquidity. We're searching to see
 

3881
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:27,030
build liquidity. We're searching to see
if this is deemed fair value. Do bulls

3882
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:27,040
if this is deemed fair value. Do bulls
 

3883
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:29,350
if this is deemed fair value. Do bulls
want to say, "Hey, no more. This is

3884
01:43:29,350 --> 01:43:29,360
want to say, "Hey, no more. This is
 

3885

want to say, "Hey, no more. This is
good. We're happy to buy here. This is

good. We're happy to buy here. This is
 

3887
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:34,950
good. We're happy to buy here. This is
too cheap now." Or do they go, "Hey, no,

3888
01:43:34,950 --> 01:43:34,960
too cheap now." Or do they go, "Hey, no,
 

3889
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,709
too cheap now." Or do they go, "Hey, no,
no, no, no. We're we're in too much pain

no, no, no. We're we're in too much pain
 

3891
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:38,629
no, no, no. We're we're in too much pain
here. It's got to come lower. We don't

here. It's got to come lower. We don't
 

3893
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:40,470
here. It's got to come lower. We don't
like the price of this here. It's got to

3894
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:40,480
like the price of this here. It's got to
 

3895
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,790
like the price of this here. It's got to
come lower before we defend it." And who

3896
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:42,800
come lower before we defend it." And who
 

3897
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,470
come lower before we defend it." And who
knows? Maybe they don't defend it at

3898
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:44,480
knows? Maybe they don't defend it at
 

3899
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:47,189
knows? Maybe they don't defend it at
all. We don't know that, right? It's

3900
01:43:47,189 --> 01:43:47,199
all. We don't know that, right? It's
 

3901
01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:49,750
all. We don't know that, right? It's
searching. It's searching for prices

3902
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:49,760
searching. It's searching for prices
 

3903
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:55,109
searching. It's searching for prices
where bulls might want to buy it.

3904
01:43:55,109 --> 01:43:55,119

 

3905
01:43:55,119 --> 01:44:02,310

No worries, David.

3906

3929
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,590

cuz we're into this sort of gray box

3930
01:44:27,590 --> 01:44:27,600
cuz we're into this sort of gray box
 

3931
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,830
cuz we're into this sort of gray box
zone. If they fail this, then uh or you

3932
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:29,840
zone. If they fail this, then uh or you
 

3933
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,030
zone. If they fail this, then uh or you
get a bigger wash and you'd be very

01:44:32,629 --> 01:44:32,639
happy. But you've got to pay yourself on
 

3937
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:35,189
happy. But you've got to pay yourself on
the way. You don't know if and when this

3938
01:44:35,189 --> 01:44:35,199
the way. You don't know if and when this
 

3939
01:44:35,199 --> 01:44:38,310

about current session, but you have to

3988
01:45:52,790 --> 01:45:52,800
about current session, but you have to
 

3989
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:54,950
about current session, but you have to
respect the previous s day session as

we stop, we go the other direction. Like

01:48:34,390 --> 01:48:34,400
we stop, we go the other direction. Like
 

4081
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:36,229
we stop, we go the other direction. Like
we just don't build out structure

4082
01:48:36,229 --> 01:48:36,239
we just don't build out structure
 

4083
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:37,830
we just don't build out structure
anymore in these markets because it's

That's such a big size. I think he's a

That's such a big size. I think he's a
 

4133

That's such a big size. I think he's a
probably a spoofer, but it's the first

01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:36,400
probably a spoofer, but it's the first
 

4135
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:37,990
probably a spoofer, but it's the first
time I've seen some size been put on a

01:49:37,990 --> 01:49:38,000
time I've seen some size been put on a
 

4137
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:42,390
time I've seen some size been put on a
bid today.

4139
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:52,790

I would not trust him.

4140
01:49:52,790 --> 01:49:52,800

 

4141
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,070

They're going to come for him. He's

4142
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:54,080
They're going to come for him. He's
 

4143
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:55,750
They're going to come for him. He's

01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:15,760
all down there. I reckon he pulls it the
 

4157
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:19,830

moment you get anywhere near him.

moment you get anywhere near him.
 

4159
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,830
moment you get anywhere near him.
I reckon he's a spoofer. I reckon he's a

4160
01:50:21,830 --> 01:50:21,840
I reckon he's a spoofer. I reckon he's a
 

4161
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:25,910
I reckon he's a spoofer. I reckon he's a
seller. And I reckon he pulls it.

move up if he's legit. And right now

4198
01:51:31,990 --> 01:51:32,000
move up if he's legit. And right now
 

4199
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,070
move up if he's legit. And right now
he's not budged.

he's not budged.
 

4201

4222
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:25,360
they figure out what they're doing, I
 

4223
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:27,030
they figure out what they're doing, I
guess.

4224
01:52:27,030 --> 01:52:27,040
guess.
 

4225
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:29,350
guess.
Um, so if they do squeeze, they'd be

4226
01:52:29,350 --> 01:52:29,360
Um, so if they do squeeze, they'd be
 

4227
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:33,270
Um, so if they do squeeze, they'd be
coming up here into 828, basically this

4228
01:52:33,270 --> 01:52:33,280
coming up here into 828, basically this
 

4229
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,790
coming up here into 828, basically this
gray box. And if they got over that,

4230
01:52:34,790 --> 01:52:34,800
gray box. And if they got over that,
 

4231
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,950
gray box. And if they got over that,
back up here, and this is the rotation.

4232
01:52:36,950 --> 01:52:36,960
back up here, and this is the rotation.
 

4233
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:38,950
back up here, and this is the rotation.
And if they fail this, probably down. We

4234
01:52:38,950 --> 01:52:38,960
And if they fail this, probably down. We
 

4235
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,790
And if they fail this, probably down. We
can move this a little bit. Probably

4236
01:52:40,790 --> 01:52:40,800
can move this a little bit. Probably
 

4237
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:44,790
can move this a little bit. Probably
down to this little globeex level.

4238
01:52:44,790 --> 01:52:44,800
down to this little globeex level.
 

4239
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,229
down to this little globeex level.
I've got to turn this light down, folks.

4240
01:52:46,229 --> 01:52:46,239
I've got to turn this light down, folks.
 

4241
01:52:46,239 --> 01:52:47,750
I've got to turn this light down, folks.
I'm really sorry. I'm getting such a bad

4242
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:47,760
I'm really sorry. I'm getting such a bad
 

4243
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:49,189
I'm really sorry. I'm getting such a bad
headache. I know it doesn't look as good

4244
01:52:49,189 --> 01:52:49,199
headache. I know it doesn't look as good
 

4245
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:51,350
headache. I know it doesn't look as good
on stream, but my h head is pounding

4246
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:51,360
on stream, but my h head is pounding
 

4247
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:56,870
on stream, but my h head is pounding
right now. [snorts]

4248
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:56,880

 

4249
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:58,870

So, some buyers trying to wake up here.

4250
01:52:58,870 --> 01:52:58,880
So, some buyers trying to wake up here.
 

4251
01:52:58,880 --> 01:52:59,990
So, some buyers trying to wake up here.
It's probably as much covering as

4252
01:52:59,990 --> 01:53:00,000
It's probably as much covering as
 

4253
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,149
It's probably as much covering as
anything else. Um, this can still be a

4254
01:53:02,149 --> 01:53:02,159
anything else. Um, this can still be a
 

4255
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:03,910
anything else. Um, this can still be a
bare flag, which is sold into to move

4256
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:03,920
bare flag, which is sold into to move
 

4257
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:05,270
bare flag, which is sold into to move
lower right now because they haven't

4258
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:05,280
lower right now because they haven't
 

4259
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,910
lower right now because they haven't
built any structure out. I I would just

4260
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:07,920
built any structure out. I I would just
 

4261
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,470
built any structure out. I I would just
be very careful. It's a very one-way

4262
01:53:10,470 --> 01:53:10,480
be very careful. It's a very one-way
 

4263
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:12,229
be very careful. It's a very one-way
take. We either going straight up or

4264
01:53:12,229 --> 01:53:12,239
take. We either going straight up or
 

4265
01:53:12,239 --> 01:53:13,430
take. We either going straight up or
we're going straight down. We haven't

4266
01:53:13,430 --> 01:53:13,440
we're going straight down. We haven't
 

4267
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:15,350
we're going straight down. We haven't
seen much liquidity be built out other

4268
01:53:15,350 --> 01:53:15,360
seen much liquidity be built out other
 

4269
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:16,790
seen much liquidity be built out other
than that. This is current value area

4270
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:16,800
than that. This is current value area
 

4271
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,870
than that. This is current value area
low on the day and they can expand it

4272
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:18,880
low on the day and they can expand it
 

4273
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:20,790
low on the day and they can expand it
because we are now inside previous day's

4274
01:53:20,790 --> 01:53:20,800
because we are now inside previous day's
 

4275
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:22,790
because we are now inside previous day's
value. So they failed to hold previous

4276
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:22,800
value. So they failed to hold previous
 

4277
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:31,430
value. So they failed to hold previous
day value for now.

4278
01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:31,440

 

4279
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:34,229

Yes, we are in a high volume node. This

4280
01:53:34,229 --> 01:53:34,239
Yes, we are in a high volume node. This
 

4281
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:36,870
Yes, we are in a high volume node. This
gray box showing you the high volume

4282
01:53:36,870 --> 01:53:36,880
gray box showing you the high volume
 

4283
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,550
gray box showing you the high volume
nodes. All right, I marked them out for

4284
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:38,560
nodes. All right, I marked them out for
 

4285
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:45,030
nodes. All right, I marked them out for
you. That's why they're there.

4286
01:53:45,030 --> 01:53:45,040

 

4287
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:54,870

Few

4288
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:54,880

 

4289
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:59,109

shorts got stuck at 770 there. But uh I

4290
01:53:59,109 --> 01:53:59,119
shorts got stuck at 770 there. But uh I
 

4291
01:53:59,119 --> 01:54:02,229
shorts got stuck at 770 there. But uh I
would struggle to trust this. Honestly,

4292
01:54:02,229 --> 01:54:02,239
would struggle to trust this. Honestly,
 

4293
01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:03,990
would struggle to trust this. Honestly,
I would really struggle to trust this

4294
01:54:03,990 --> 01:54:04,000
I would really struggle to trust this
 

4295
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,750
I would really struggle to trust this
right now.

4296
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:05,760
right now.
 

4297
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:07,750
right now.
I just think in in markets like this,

4298
01:54:07,750 --> 01:54:07,760
I just think in in markets like this,
 

4299
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:09,589
I just think in in markets like this,
big players will do whatever big players

4300
01:54:09,589 --> 01:54:09,599
big players will do whatever big players
 

4301
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:14,310
big players will do whatever big players
want to do. And as smaller fish,

4302
01:54:14,310 --> 01:54:14,320
want to do. And as smaller fish,
 

4303
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,550
want to do. And as smaller fish,
it's very very hard when they just go,

4304
01:54:16,550 --> 01:54:16,560
it's very very hard when they just go,
 

4305
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:18,790
it's very very hard when they just go,
okay, one side to the other. Who knows?

4306
01:54:18,790 --> 01:54:18,800
okay, one side to the other. Who knows?
 

4307
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:20,629
okay, one side to the other. Who knows?
Maybe they come all the way down here,

4308
01:54:20,629 --> 01:54:20,639
Maybe they come all the way down here,
 

4309
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:23,669
Maybe they come all the way down here,
this side to this side.

4310
01:54:23,669 --> 01:54:23,679
this side to this side.
 

4311
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:26,629
this side to this side.
So it's a rotational market in 415

4312
01:54:26,629 --> 01:54:26,639
So it's a rotational market in 415
 

4313
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:29,990
So it's a rotational market in 415
points of rotation.

4314
01:54:29,990 --> 01:54:30,000
points of rotation.
 

4315
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,950
points of rotation.
Mind blown. But that's what it is.

4316
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:32,960
Mind blown. But that's what it is.
 

4317
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:35,030
Mind blown. But that's what it is.
That's the size of weekly moves back in

4318
01:54:35,030 --> 01:54:35,040
That's the size of weekly moves back in
 

4319
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:39,109
That's the size of weekly moves back in
the day. We're doing those in 45

4320
01:54:39,109 --> 01:54:39,119
the day. We're doing those in 45
 

4321
01:54:39,119 --> 01:54:44,070
the day. We're doing those in 45
minutes.

4322
01:54:44,070 --> 01:54:44,080

 

4323
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:57,350

Nice [snorts] David.

4324
01:54:57,350 --> 01:54:57,360

 

4325
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:58,709

You're basically back into the midpoint

4326
01:54:58,709 --> 01:54:58,719
You're basically back into the midpoint
 

4327
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:00,229
You're basically back into the midpoint
of the range today. I mean, what what

4328
01:55:00,229 --> 01:55:00,239
of the range today. I mean, what what
 

4329
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:02,470
of the range today. I mean, what what
are you going to do with this? What are

4330
01:55:02,470 --> 01:55:02,480
are you going to do with this? What are
 

4331
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,830
are you going to do with this? What are
you going to do with this? Probably not

4332
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:03,840
you going to do with this? Probably not
 

4333
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:05,750
you going to do with this? Probably not
a lot not a lot you can do with this

4334
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:05,760
a lot not a lot you can do with this
 

4335
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:35,030
a lot not a lot you can do with this
here.

4336
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:35,040

 

4337
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,390

Are they actually going to give this

4338
01:55:36,390 --> 01:55:36,400
Are they actually going to give this
 

4339
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:41,990
Are they actually going to give this
whole move back?

4340
01:55:41,990 --> 01:55:42,000

 

4341
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,669

You'd expect them to defend. If they're

4342
01:55:43,669 --> 01:55:43,679
You'd expect them to defend. If they're
 

4343
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:45,030
You'd expect them to defend. If they're
going to defend this, they I would say

4344
01:55:45,030 --> 01:55:45,040
going to defend this, they I would say
 

4345
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:46,950
going to defend this, they I would say
they need to defend this in this area.

4346
01:55:46,950 --> 01:55:46,960
they need to defend this in this area.
 

4347
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:48,950
they need to defend this in this area.
Now, if they give this whole move back,

4348
01:55:48,950 --> 01:55:48,960
Now, if they give this whole move back,
 

4349
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,790
Now, if they give this whole move back,
I mean,

4350
01:55:50,790 --> 01:55:50,800
I mean,
 

4351
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:52,870
I mean,
if I

4352
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:52,880
if I
 

4353
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:55,990
if I
man, that is a big uh what should we

4354
01:55:55,990 --> 01:55:56,000
man, that is a big uh what should we
 

4355
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,669
man, that is a big uh what should we
say? It's a big tell on the market,

4356
01:55:57,669 --> 01:55:57,679
say? It's a big tell on the market,
 

4357
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:00,629
say? It's a big tell on the market,
isn't it? If they're going to give 420

4358
01:56:00,629 --> 01:56:00,639
isn't it? If they're going to give 420
 

4359
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:03,830
isn't it? If they're going to give 420
plus points back, it's a pretty big tell

4360
01:56:03,830 --> 01:56:03,840
plus points back, it's a pretty big tell
 

4361
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:06,550
plus points back, it's a pretty big tell
that this market is scared shitless

4362
01:56:06,550 --> 01:56:06,560
that this market is scared shitless
 

4363
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:08,550
that this market is scared shitless
right now if they're not going to hold

4364
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:08,560
right now if they're not going to hold
 

4365
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:10,870
right now if they're not going to hold
any pull back.

4366
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:10,880
any pull back.
 

4367
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,790
any pull back.
That's how I read it anyway. I'd be

4368
01:56:12,790 --> 01:56:12,800
That's how I read it anyway. I'd be
 

4369
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:14,070
That's how I read it anyway. I'd be
like, "Okay, the market's scared

4370
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:14,080
like, "Okay, the market's scared
 

4371
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:15,750
like, "Okay, the market's scared
shitless." So, they're going to hold it.

4372
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:15,760
shitless." So, they're going to hold it.
 

4373
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:17,109
shitless." So, they're going to hold it.
They need to hold here and they need to

4374
01:56:17,109 --> 01:56:17,119
They need to hold here and they need to
 

4375
01:56:17,119 --> 01:56:18,470
They need to hold here and they need to
reclaim all of this and try and get up

4376
01:56:18,470 --> 01:56:18,480
reclaim all of this and try and get up

every pot now starting to be sold. Hey,
 

4383
01:56:27,199 --> 01:56:28,709
every pot now starting to be sold. Hey,
this is the story from the last few

this is the story from the last few
 

4385
01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:30,629
this is the story from the last few
days.

4386
01:56:30,629 --> 01:56:30,639
days.
 

4387
01:56:30,639 --> 01:56:33,830
days.
That last pop was just passively sold.

4388
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:33,840
That last pop was just passively sold.
 

4389
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:36,550
That last pop was just passively sold.
And I don't like that you have got an

And I don't like that you have got an
 

4391
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:39,510
And I don't like that you have got an
800 lot advertising that he's a buyer

4392
01:56:39,510 --> 01:56:39,520
800 lot advertising that he's a buyer
 

4393
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:43,350
800 lot advertising that he's a buyer

4394
01:56:43,350 --> 01:56:43,360
underneath 725. I don't like that one
 

4395
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:49,669
underneath 725. I don't like that one
bit.

4396
01:56:49,669 --> 01:56:49,679

 

4397
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:51,669

01:56:57,679 --> 01:57:00,709
leaves the tape. Here we come.
HOW LONG TILL WE OH, WHO' have guessed?

4404
01:57:00,709 --> 01:57:00,719
HOW LONG TILL WE OH, WHO' have guessed?
 

4405
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:02,550
HOW LONG TILL WE OH, WHO' have guessed?
Who have [\h__\h] guessed he left the

01:57:02,550 --> 01:57:02,560
Who have [\h__\h] guessed he left the

01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:05,990
Who have [\h__\h] guessed he left the

4408
01:57:05,990 --> 01:57:06,000
tape? Told you.
 

4409
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,709
tape? Told you.
Absolutely told you. It's so Their games

4410
01:57:08,709 --> 01:57:08,719
Absolutely told you. It's so Their games
 

4411
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:14,771
Absolutely told you. It's so Their games
are so obvious, but it's so dirty.

4412
01:57:14,771 --> 01:57:14,781

 

4413
01:57:14,781 --> 01:57:15,910

[laughter]

4414
01:57:15,910 --> 01:57:15,920
[laughter]
 

4415
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:21,990
[laughter]
It's so dirty, folks. When they do that,

4416
01:57:21,990 --> 01:57:22,000

 

4417
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,470

he's non-existent. He's non-existent

4418
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:24,480
he's non-existent. He's non-existent
 

4419
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:26,629
he's non-existent. He's non-existent
because he's not a buyer. He's a seller

4420
01:57:26,629 --> 01:57:26,639
because he's not a buyer. He's a seller
 

4421
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:28,790
because he's not a buyer. He's a seller
trying to make price go lower. That's

4422
01:57:28,790 --> 01:57:28,800
trying to make price go lower. That's
 

4423
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:30,870
trying to make price go lower. That's
exactly what he is. So that you

4424
01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:30,880
exactly what he is. So that you
 

4425
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:33,109
exactly what he is. So that you
understand, he wants price to go lower.

4426
01:57:33,109 --> 01:57:33,119
understand, he wants price to go lower.
 

4427
01:57:33,119 --> 01:57:35,189
understand, he wants price to go lower.
So, he's advertising a big old order

4428
01:57:35,189 --> 01:57:35,199
So, he's advertising a big old order
 

4429
01:57:35,199 --> 01:57:37,030
So, he's advertising a big old order
there and pulling it when it gets close

4430
01:57:37,030 --> 01:57:37,040
there and pulling it when it gets close
 

4431
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:39,589
there and pulling it when it gets close
because he's got no ambition on actually

4432
01:57:39,589 --> 01:57:39,599
because he's got no ambition on actually
 

4433
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:41,589
because he's got no ambition on actually
buying that.

4434
01:57:41,589 --> 01:57:41,599
buying that.
 

4435
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:44,149
buying that.
And down we go.

4436
01:57:44,149 --> 01:57:44,159
And down we go.
 

4437
01:57:44,159 --> 01:57:47,030
And down we go.
Balls are [\h__\h] This is a big problem

4438
01:57:47,030 --> 01:57:47,040
Balls are [\h__\h] This is a big problem
 

4439
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:51,270
Balls are [\h__\h] This is a big problem

4441
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:55,030
now. And this this should be uh a big
warning sign to everyone of hey, we're

4442
01:57:55,030 --> 01:57:55,040
warning sign to everyone of hey, we're
 

4443
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:57,270
warning sign to everyone of hey, we're

not respecting levels. We're not holding
 

4445
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:00,229
not respecting levels. We're not holding

4446
01:58:00,229 --> 01:58:00,239
above value. We're we're just selling.
 

4447
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:02,790
above value. We're we're just selling.
Everything is being sold no matter what.

4448
01:58:02,790 --> 01:58:02,800
Everything is being sold no matter what.
 

4449
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:05,350
Everything is being sold no matter what.
That's a bit of a warning sign. I would

4450
01:58:05,350 --> 01:58:05,360
That's a bit of a warning sign. I would
 

4451
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:07,990
That's a bit of a warning sign. I would
say

4452
01:58:07,990 --> 01:58:08,000
say
 

4453
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,870
say
if bulls can't defend after squeezing

4454
01:58:10,870 --> 01:58:10,880
if bulls can't defend after squeezing
 

4455
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:13,589
if bulls can't defend after squeezing
400 points, it's a warning sign, isn't

4456
01:58:13,589 --> 01:58:13,599
400 points, it's a warning sign, isn't
 

4457
01:58:13,599 --> 01:58:15,510
400 points, it's a warning sign, isn't
it? If they can't defend, it's a big

4458
01:58:15,510 --> 01:58:15,520
it? If they can't defend, it's a big
 

4459
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:18,390
it? If they can't defend, it's a big
warning sign.

4460
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:18,400
warning sign.
 

4461
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:20,149
warning sign.
It's the first covering we've seen right

4462
01:58:20,149 --> 01:58:20,159
It's the first covering we've seen right
 

4463
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:22,390
It's the first covering we've seen right
here into previous day point control.

4464
01:58:22,390 --> 01:58:22,400
here into previous day point control.
 

4465
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:24,390
here into previous day point control.
First bit of covering we've seen. Back

4466
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:24,400
First bit of covering we've seen. Back
 

4467
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:31,406
First bit of covering we've seen. Back
to VWAP we go.

4468
01:58:31,406 --> 01:58:31,416

 

4469
01:58:31,416 --> 01:58:34,070

[snorts]

01:58:34,070 --> 01:58:34,080

 

4471
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:35,910

And we now have this shelf above that

4472
01:58:35,910 --> 01:58:35,920
And we now have this shelf above that
 

4473
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:38,390
And we now have this shelf above that
balls can get stuck in. We can move this

4474
01:58:38,390 --> 01:58:38,400
balls can get stuck in. We can move this
 

4475
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:42,470
balls can get stuck in. We can move this
slightly. Right. This is the level.

4476
01:58:42,470 --> 01:58:42,480
slightly. Right. This is the level.
 

4477
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:43,910
slightly. Right. This is the level.
Right. So balls will need to get above

4478
01:58:43,910 --> 01:58:43,920
Right. So balls will need to get above
 

4479
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:45,589
Right. So balls will need to get above
this for a rotation. Failing to get

4480
01:58:45,589 --> 01:58:45,599
this for a rotation. Failing to get
 

4481
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:49,350
this for a rotation. Failing to get
above that, they'll be caught.

4482
01:58:49,350 --> 01:58:49,360
above that, they'll be caught.
 

4483
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:51,510
above that, they'll be caught.
Again, that was all from manipulation.

4484
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:51,520
Again, that was all from manipulation.
 

4485
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:53,109
Again, that was all from manipulation.

You get used to seeing these guys on the

You get used to seeing these guys on the

01:58:55,589 --> 01:58:55,599

not legal. But proving it's very, very

4490
01:58:58,310 --> 01:58:58,320
not legal. But proving it's very, very

01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:01,189
not legal. But proving it's very, very
hard.

hard.

Vick's still not through that New York

I'm not sure they're done selling it.

from what I'm seeing.
We'll see. They did just try and sell

We'll see. They did just try and sell
 

4537
02:00:08,239 --> 02:00:09,910
We'll see. They did just try and sell
that last candle and failed, but the

4538
02:00:09,910 --> 02:00:09,920
that last candle and failed, but the
 

4539
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:13,270

four minutes ago.
We're not seeing excess selling down

4544
02:00:17,109 --> 02:00:17,119
We're not seeing excess selling down
 

4545
02:00:17,119 --> 02:00:19,830
We're not seeing excess selling down

02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:21,350
there yet, but we'll see. We'll see. But
this gray box above you, you can see

4548
02:00:21,350 --> 02:00:21,360
this gray box above you, you can see
 

4549
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:22,870
this gray box above you, you can see
that's the squeeze trigger. Once you get

4550
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:22,880
that's the squeeze trigger. Once you get
 

4551
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:24,310
that's the squeeze trigger. Once you get
through that gray box, you can squeeze

4552
02:00:24,310 --> 02:00:24,320
through that gray box, you can squeeze
 

4553
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:26,629
through that gray box, you can squeeze
higher. But right now, sellers are in

4554
02:00:26,629 --> 02:00:26,639
higher. But right now, sellers are in
 

4555
02:00:26,639 --> 02:00:33,109
higher. But right now, sellers are in
absolute control.

4556
02:00:33,109 --> 02:00:33,119

 

4557
02:00:33,119 --> 02:00:34,470

No worries, fresh. Yeah, I've got

4558
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:34,480
No worries, fresh. Yeah, I've got
 

4559
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:35,830
No worries, fresh. Yeah, I've got
pounding headache. I really want to get

4560
02:00:35,830 --> 02:00:35,840
pounding headache. I really want to get
 

4561
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:37,270
pounding headache. I really want to get
out of here, but market's starting to

4562
02:00:37,270 --> 02:00:37,280
out of here, but market's starting to
 

4563
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:42,149
out of here, but market's starting to
move for you guys. I want to call it

4564
02:00:42,149 --> 02:00:42,159

 

4565
02:00:42,159 --> 02:00:48,870

do feel dreadful, though.

4566
02:00:48,870 --> 02:00:48,880

 

4567
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:50,550

Back to previous day point of control

4568
02:00:50,550 --> 02:00:50,560
Back to previous day point of control
 

4569
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:52,709
Back to previous day point of control
here. And if we fail that, well, we've

4570
02:00:52,709 --> 02:00:52,719
here. And if we fail that, well, we've
 

4571
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:55,030
here. And if we fail that, well, we've
not got much below. We really do not

4572
02:00:55,030 --> 02:00:55,040
not got much below. We really do not
 

4573
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:58,070
not got much below. We really do not
have much below.

4574
02:00:58,070 --> 02:00:58,080
have much below.
 

4575
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:00,070
have much below.
Do they come back for previous day value

4576
02:01:00,070 --> 02:01:00,080
Do they come back for previous day value
 

4577
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:03,270
Do they come back for previous day value
area low? Who knows? Structure is very

4578
02:01:03,270 --> 02:01:03,280
area low? Who knows? Structure is very
 

4579
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:05,270
area low? Who knows? Structure is very
bearish right now. No excess on the

4580
02:01:05,270 --> 02:01:05,280
bearish right now. No excess on the
 

4581
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,270
bearish right now. No excess on the
lows. Bears coming flying in. Until we

4582
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:07,280
lows. Bears coming flying in. Until we
 

4583
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:09,750
lows. Bears coming flying in. Until we
see bears get caught at the on a low

4584
02:01:09,750 --> 02:01:09,760
see bears get caught at the on a low
 

4585
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:11,669
see bears get caught at the on a low
print. I don't think there's any chance

4586
02:01:11,669 --> 02:01:11,679
print. I don't think there's any chance
 

4587
02:01:11,679 --> 02:01:14,310
print. I don't think there's any chance
of a squeeze back up. We're not We're

4588
02:01:14,310 --> 02:01:14,320
of a squeeze back up. We're not We're
 

4589
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:17,350
of a squeeze back up. We're not We're
just not seeing it yet.

4590
02:01:17,350 --> 02:01:17,360
just not seeing it yet.
 

4591
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:19,430
just not seeing it yet.
Remember, the market's in fear. It's in

4592
02:01:19,430 --> 02:01:19,440
Remember, the market's in fear. It's in
 

4593
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:21,189
Remember, the market's in fear. It's in
absolute fear. That's why I'm kind of

4594
02:01:21,189 --> 02:01:21,199
absolute fear. That's why I'm kind of
 

4595
02:01:21,199 --> 02:01:23,589
absolute fear. That's why I'm kind of
surprised they even had the power to do

4596
02:01:23,589 --> 02:01:23,599
surprised they even had the power to do
 

4597
02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:25,030
surprised they even had the power to do
uh what they did this morning to be

4598
02:01:25,030 --> 02:01:25,040
uh what they did this morning to be
 

4599
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:27,350
uh what they did this morning to be
quite honest with you.

4600
02:01:27,350 --> 02:01:27,360
quite honest with you.
 

4601
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:28,629
quite honest with you.
But here we go. Like I said, don't think

4602
02:01:28,629 --> 02:01:28,639
But here we go. Like I said, don't think
 

4603
02:01:28,639 --> 02:01:29,669
But here we go. Like I said, don't think
the auction's finished because we

4604
02:01:29,669 --> 02:01:29,679
the auction's finished because we
 

4605
02:01:29,679 --> 02:01:31,109
the auction's finished because we
haven't seen excess selling at the lows.

4606
02:01:31,109 --> 02:01:31,119
haven't seen excess selling at the lows.
 

4607
02:01:31,119 --> 02:01:32,229
haven't seen excess selling at the lows.
It's first time we're seeing selling

4608
02:01:32,229 --> 02:01:32,239
It's first time we're seeing selling
 

4609
02:01:32,239 --> 02:01:33,990
It's first time we're seeing selling
down here. And is there a response to it

4610
02:01:33,990 --> 02:01:34,000
down here. And is there a response to it
 

4611
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,390
down here. And is there a response to it
at the moment?

4612
02:01:36,390 --> 02:01:36,400
at the moment?
 

4613
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:38,550
at the moment?
Do we go back to Gloveex, which would be

4614
02:01:38,550 --> 02:01:38,560
Do we go back to Gloveex, which would be
 

4615
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,870
Do we go back to Gloveex, which would be
what? 680.

4616
02:01:40,870 --> 02:01:40,880
what? 680.
 

4617
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:49,510
what? 680.
That would be Gloveex at the moment.

4618
02:01:49,510 --> 02:01:49,520

 

4619
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:53,430

700s. Those old 700s from last month.

4620
02:01:53,430 --> 02:01:53,440
700s. Those old 700s from last month.
 

4621
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:58,709
700s. Those old 700s from last month.
Have a look on that shelf.

4622
02:01:58,709 --> 02:01:58,719

 

4623
02:01:58,719 --> 02:02:00,629

They didn't defend it. They did not

4624
02:02:00,629 --> 02:02:00,639
They didn't defend it. They did not
 

4625
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:03,109
They didn't defend it. They did not
defend it. We are weak on multiple

4626
02:02:03,109 --> 02:02:03,119
defend it. We are weak on multiple
 

4627
02:02:03,119 --> 02:02:06,870
defend it. We are weak on multiple
profiles right now.

4628
02:02:06,870 --> 02:02:06,880
profiles right now.
 

4629
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:08,629
profiles right now.
Still, I'm not convinced the auction's

4630
02:02:08,629 --> 02:02:08,639
Still, I'm not convinced the auction's
 

4631
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:10,229
Still, I'm not convinced the auction's
done yet. Still not convinced this

4632
02:02:10,229 --> 02:02:10,239
done yet. Still not convinced this
 

4633
02:02:10,239 --> 02:02:12,709
done yet. Still not convinced this
auction's done selling.

4634
02:02:12,709 --> 02:02:12,719
auction's done selling.
 

4635
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:21,589
auction's done selling.
No excess.

4636
02:02:21,589 --> 02:02:21,599

 

4637
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:24,950

Oh my gosh,

4638
02:02:24,950 --> 02:02:24,960
Oh my gosh,
 

4639
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,990
Oh my gosh,
what a uh

4640
02:02:27,990 --> 02:02:28,000
what a uh
 

4641
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,149
what a uh
panicky market.

4642
02:02:30,149 --> 02:02:30,159
panicky market.
 

4643
02:02:30,159 --> 02:02:32,149
panicky market.
What a panicky market. Where's the daily

4644
02:02:32,149 --> 02:02:32,159
What a panicky market. Where's the daily
 

4645
02:02:32,159 --> 02:02:36,149
What a panicky market. Where's the daily
bowl now?

4646
02:02:36,149 --> 02:02:36,159

 

4647
02:02:36,159 --> 02:02:37,910

560.

4648
02:02:37,910 --> 02:02:37,920
560.
 

4649
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:42,629
560.
Okay, just worth noting.

4650
02:02:42,629 --> 02:02:42,639

 

4651
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:51,990

Still no excess at the lows for me.

4652
02:02:51,990 --> 02:02:52,000

 

4653
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,510

We have some structure here, but we

4654
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:53,520
We have some structure here, but we
 

4655
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:56,070
We have some structure here, but we
don't have excess.

4656
02:02:56,070 --> 02:02:56,080
don't have excess.
 

4657
02:02:56,080 --> 02:02:57,990
don't have excess.
Still not seeing much of a response here

4658
02:02:57,990 --> 02:02:58,000
Still not seeing much of a response here
 

4659
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,350
Still not seeing much of a response here
from buyers is what I'm saying.

4660
02:03:01,350 --> 02:03:01,360
from buyers is what I'm saying.
 

4661
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:02,870
from buyers is what I'm saying.
Still not seeing sellers get trapped.

4662
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:02,880
Still not seeing sellers get trapped.
 

4663
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:04,709
Still not seeing sellers get trapped.
Still think there is new lows possible.

4664
02:03:04,709 --> 02:03:04,719
Still think there is new lows possible.
 

4665
02:03:04,719 --> 02:03:06,790
Still think there is new lows possible.
Here we go. So, selling back down again.

4666
02:03:06,790 --> 02:03:06,800
Here we go. So, selling back down again.
 

4667
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:09,910
Here we go. So, selling back down again.
There's no excess. There's no real

4668
02:03:09,910 --> 02:03:09,920
There's no excess. There's no real
 

4669
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:11,990
There's no excess. There's no real
attempt from buyers to do anything. They

02:03:11,990 --> 02:03:12,000
attempt from buyers to do anything. They
 

4671
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,310
attempt from buyers to do anything. They
are absolutely [\h__\h] themselves right

now. and I don't blame them.
 

4675
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:24,149
now. and I don't blame them.
Okay, back to GlobeEx then.

4676
02:03:24,149 --> 02:03:24,159

 

4677
02:03:24,159 --> 02:03:26,709

Still not seeing excess. Still seeing

seeing much of a response.
Oh my gosh. Are we going to make new

4684
02:03:34,550 --> 02:03:34,560
Oh my gosh. Are we going to make new
 

4685
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:39,109
Oh my gosh. Are we going to make new
lows on the day underneath New York? I

4686
02:03:39,109 --> 02:03:39,119
lows on the day underneath New York? I
 

4687
02:03:39,119 --> 02:03:42,629
lows on the day underneath New York? I
I cannot fathom this market right now.

4688
02:03:42,629 --> 02:03:42,639
I cannot fathom this market right now.
 

4689
02:03:42,639 --> 02:03:45,669
I cannot fathom this market right now.
415 points up. Are we going to go beyond

4690
02:03:45,669 --> 02:03:45,679
415 points up. Are we going to go beyond
 

4691
02:03:45,679 --> 02:03:49,270
415 points up. Are we going to go beyond
415 points down? It is absolutely

4692
02:03:49,270 --> 02:03:49,280
415 points down? It is absolutely
 

4693
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,990
415 points down? It is absolutely
possible and that is

4694
02:03:51,990 --> 02:03:52,000
possible and that is
 

4695
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:55,589
possible and that is
mental to me like to just say that out

4696
02:03:55,589 --> 02:03:55,599
mental to me like to just say that out
 

4697
02:03:55,599 --> 02:03:57,990
mental to me like to just say that out
loud.

4698
02:03:57,990 --> 02:03:58,000
loud.
 

4699
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:01,430
loud.
But it's absolutely possible. We cannot

4700
02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:01,440
But it's absolutely possible. We cannot
 

4701
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:04,390
But it's absolutely possible. We cannot
rule it out. We cannot rule out new lows

4702
02:04:04,390 --> 02:04:04,400
rule it out. We cannot rule out new lows
 

4703
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:05,910
rule it out. We cannot rule out new lows
on the session. We can't rule out

4704
02:04:05,910 --> 02:04:05,920
on the session. We can't rule out
 

4705
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:08,470
on the session. We can't rule out
anything. We're back inside value. If we

4706
02:04:08,470 --> 02:04:08,480
anything. We're back inside value. If we
 

4707
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:10,629
anything. We're back inside value. If we
fail area high, we can come back down to

4708
02:04:10,629 --> 02:04:10,639
fail area high, we can come back down to
 

4709
02:04:10,639 --> 02:04:12,149
fail area high, we can come back down to
here, which is where I said I'd be

4710
02:04:12,149 --> 02:04:12,159
here, which is where I said I'd be
 

4711
02:04:12,159 --> 02:04:13,430
here, which is where I said I'd be
interested in buying this morning. And I

4712
02:04:13,430 --> 02:04:13,440
interested in buying this morning. And I
 

4713
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:15,109
interested in buying this morning. And I
certainly will not be interested in

4714
02:04:15,109 --> 02:04:15,119
certainly will not be interested in
 

4715
02:04:15,119 --> 02:04:17,589
certainly will not be interested in
buying it today now. Not after they

4716
02:04:17,589 --> 02:04:17,599
buying it today now. Not after they
 

4717
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:19,109
buying it today now. Not after they
completed the lowhanging fruit move

4718
02:04:19,109 --> 02:04:19,119
completed the lowhanging fruit move
 

4719
02:04:19,119 --> 02:04:21,669
completed the lowhanging fruit move
higher and have just absolutely tanked

4720
02:04:21,669 --> 02:04:21,679
higher and have just absolutely tanked
 

4721
02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:23,589
higher and have just absolutely tanked
this market back down. No way would I be

4722
02:04:23,589 --> 02:04:23,599
this market back down. No way would I be
 

4723
02:04:23,599 --> 02:04:25,030
this market back down. No way would I be
interested in buying down there today

4724
02:04:25,030 --> 02:04:25,040
interested in buying down there today
 

4725
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:28,310
interested in buying down there today
now. No chance.

4726
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:28,320
now. No chance.
 

4727
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:35,750
now. No chance.
No way, Jose.

4728
02:04:35,750 --> 02:04:35,760

 

4729
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:38,950

Still the selling comes in.

4730
02:04:38,950 --> 02:04:38,960
Still the selling comes in.
 

4731
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:52,870
Still the selling comes in.

total liquidation right now. Absolute
 

4735
02:04:55,760 --> 02:05:01,030
total liquidation right now. Absolute

4736
02:05:01,030 --> 02:05:01,040

 

4737
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:02,390

Little bit of a squeeze here, but you've

4738
02:05:02,390 --> 02:05:02,400
Little bit of a squeeze here, but you've
 

4739
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:04,149
Little bit of a squeeze here, but you've
got so much to get through above. I

4740
02:05:04,149 --> 02:05:04,159
got so much to get through above. I
 

4741
02:05:04,159 --> 02:05:05,589
got so much to get through above. I
wouldn't trust it. I wouldn't be trying

4742
02:05:05,589 --> 02:05:05,599
wouldn't trust it. I wouldn't be trying
 

4743
02:05:05,599 --> 02:05:08,790
wouldn't trust it. I wouldn't be trying
to long this. We'd have to like take

4744
02:05:08,790 --> 02:05:08,800
to long this. We'd have to like take
 

4745
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:33,750
to long this. We'd have to like take
many, many levels out.

4746
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:33,760

 

4747
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:36,470

battle here. Sellers still coming in.

4748
02:05:36,470 --> 02:05:36,480
battle here. Sellers still coming in.
 

4749
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:39,030
battle here. Sellers still coming in.
Still very strong selling, folks.

4750
02:05:39,030 --> 02:05:39,040
Still very strong selling, folks.
 

4751
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:41,270
Still very strong selling, folks.
There's absolutely nothing here to

4752
02:05:41,270 --> 02:05:41,280
There's absolutely nothing here to
 

4753
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:42,870
There's absolutely nothing here to
suggest we're going to squeeze out right

4754
02:05:42,870 --> 02:05:42,880
suggest we're going to squeeze out right
 

4755
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:44,950
suggest we're going to squeeze out right
now.

4756
02:05:44,950 --> 02:05:44,960
now.
 

4757
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:48,870
now.
There's the tiniest bit of excess sub700

4758
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:48,880
There's the tiniest bit of excess sub700
 

4759
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:51,030
There's the tiniest bit of excess sub700
and not much of response above it right

4760
02:05:51,030 --> 02:05:51,040
and not much of response above it right
 

4761
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:52,629
and not much of response above it right
now. It's not like we've traded back

4762
02:05:52,629 --> 02:05:52,639
now. It's not like we've traded back
 

4763
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:55,510
now. It's not like we've traded back
above this box.

4764
02:05:55,510 --> 02:05:55,520
above this box.
 

4765
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:57,109
above this box.
Now we're starting to see buyers try and

4766
02:05:57,109 --> 02:05:57,119
Now we're starting to see buyers try and
 

4767
02:05:57,119 --> 02:05:59,350
Now we're starting to see buyers try and
step in. And if they can't move it

4768
02:05:59,350 --> 02:05:59,360
step in. And if they can't move it
 

4769
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:00,629
step in. And if they can't move it
higher, it means there's still a passive

4770
02:06:00,629 --> 02:06:00,639
higher, it means there's still a passive
 

4771
02:06:00,639 --> 02:06:02,390
higher, it means there's still a passive
seller on the tape, doesn't it? So just

4772
02:06:02,390 --> 02:06:02,400
seller on the tape, doesn't it? So just
 

4773
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:04,629
seller on the tape, doesn't it? So just
be careful. Now we're seeing big big

4774
02:06:04,629 --> 02:06:04,639
be careful. Now we're seeing big big
 

4775
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:06,149
be careful. Now we're seeing big big
buying step in. Let's see if they

4776
02:06:06,149 --> 02:06:06,159
buying step in. Let's see if they
 

4777
02:06:06,159 --> 02:06:08,950
buying step in. Let's see if they
actually squeeze up to this 775 and what

4778
02:06:08,950 --> 02:06:08,960
actually squeeze up to this 775 and what
 

4779
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:12,709
actually squeeze up to this 775 and what
they do with it. What's this new wall?

4780
02:06:12,709 --> 02:06:12,719
they do with it. What's this new wall?
 

4781
02:06:12,719 --> 02:06:18,950
they do with it. What's this new wall?

4783
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:21,189

Can they respond here? Can these buyers

4784
02:06:21,189 --> 02:06:21,199
Can they respond here? Can these buyers
 

4785
02:06:21,199 --> 02:06:24,390
Can they respond here? Can these buyers
get any control of this market? They are

4786
02:06:24,390 --> 02:06:24,400
get any control of this market? They are
 

4787
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:25,990
get any control of this market? They are
attempting to. They're not doing a very

4788
02:06:25,990 --> 02:06:26,000
attempting to. They're not doing a very
 

4789
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,950
attempting to. They're not doing a very
good job right now.

4790
02:06:28,950 --> 02:06:28,960
good job right now.
 

4791
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:32,310
good job right now.

back down to it. He probably pulls it
 

4805
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:48,709
back down to it. He probably pulls it

If they get through that and back above

If they get through that and back above

02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:40,149
If they get through that and back above
previous day value, then they've got a

02:07:40,149 --> 02:07:40,159
previous day value, then they've got a
 

4843
02:07:40,159 --> 02:07:43,109
previous day value, then they've got a
shot at doing something, some kind of

4844
02:07:43,109 --> 02:07:43,119
shot at doing something, some kind of
 

4845
02:07:43,119 --> 02:07:45,830
shot at doing something, some kind of
relief. But at the moment, bears are in

5017
02:12:07,599 --> 02:12:10,390
at right now. Those are the two
opportunities in the tape. Again, I am

5018
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:10,400
opportunities in the tape. Again, I am
 

5019
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:12,149
opportunities in the tape. Again, I am
not trading this. I'm not well enough to

5020
02:12:12,149 --> 02:12:12,159
not trading this. I'm not well enough to
 

5021
02:12:12,159 --> 02:12:13,589
not trading this. I'm not well enough to
do anything right now. I'm struggling to

5022
02:12:13,589 --> 02:12:13,599
do anything right now. I'm struggling to
 

5023
02:12:13,599 --> 02:12:16,390
do anything right now. I'm struggling to
even read the price action for you. I'm

5024
02:12:16,390 --> 02:12:16,400
even read the price action for you. I'm
 

5025
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:22,069
even read the price action for you. I'm
sweating buckets.

5026
02:12:22,069 --> 02:12:22,079

 

5027
02:12:22,079 --> 02:12:23,510

At least bulls have got it back above

5028
02:12:23,510 --> 02:12:23,520
At least bulls have got it back above
 

5029
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:25,030
At least bulls have got it back above
previous day point of control. This was

5030
02:12:25,030 --> 02:12:25,040
previous day point of control. This was
 

5031
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:27,270
previous day point of control. This was
a straight move up, straight move down.

5032
02:12:27,270 --> 02:12:27,280
a straight move up, straight move down.
 

5033
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:29,350
a straight move up, straight move down.
It could be a straight move slicing back

5034
02:12:29,350 --> 02:12:29,360
It could be a straight move slicing back
 

5035
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:31,030
It could be a straight move slicing back
through if enough bears got stuck down

5036
02:12:31,030 --> 02:12:31,040
through if enough bears got stuck down
 

5037
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:32,709

5039
02:12:32,719 --> 02:12:34,149
here which [snorts] I'm not totally
convinced has happened. There was some

5040
02:12:34,149 --> 02:12:34,159
convinced has happened. There was some
 

5041
02:12:34,159 --> 02:12:35,510
convinced has happened. There was some
strong delta down there but I'm not

5042
02:12:35,510 --> 02:12:35,520
strong delta down there but I'm not
 

5043
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:40,149

5045
02:12:40,159 --> 02:12:41,910

I'd be watching previous day value area

02:12:41,910 --> 02:12:41,920
I'd be watching previous day value area
 

5047
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:45,669
I'd be watching previous day value area
high really.

5049
02:12:45,679 --> 02:12:51,510

That's probably kind of your level.

02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:36,790
So much aggressive selling. This is wild
what I'm witnessing on the tape. There's

5456
02:23:36,790 --> 02:23:36,800
what I'm witnessing on the tape. There's
 

5457
02:23:36,800 --> 02:23:42,790
what I'm witnessing on the tape. There's
a major battle here around the 700

5458

5459
02:23:42,800 --> 02:23:44,630

and I'm not convinced. I'm still not

5460
02:23:44,630 --> 02:23:44,640
and I'm not convinced. I'm still not
 

5461
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:45,990
and I'm not convinced. I'm still not
convinced the low is in. When I look at

5462
02:23:45,990 --> 02:23:46,000
convinced the low is in. When I look at
 

5463
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,070
convinced the low is in. When I look at
that candle that printed your like wick

5464
02:23:48,070 --> 02:23:48,080
that candle that printed your like wick
 

5465
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:50,630
that candle that printed your like wick
low, it's buying at the bottom side of

5466
02:23:50,630 --> 02:23:50,640
low, it's buying at the bottom side of
 

5467
02:23:50,640 --> 02:23:55,349
low, it's buying at the bottom side of
it. That is not what I'd want to see.

5468
02:23:55,349 --> 02:23:55,359
it. That is not what I'd want to see.
 

5469
02:23:55,359 --> 02:23:57,270
it. That is not what I'd want to see.
All the selling happened before it. Yes.

5470
02:23:57,270 --> 02:23:57,280
All the selling happened before it. Yes.
 

5471
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:59,270
All the selling happened before it. Yes.
Like you could argue if they hold a bid

5472
02:23:59,270 --> 02:23:59,280
Like you could argue if they hold a bid
 

5473
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:01,830
Like you could argue if they hold a bid
above 80s, but what you'd want to see is

5474
02:24:01,830 --> 02:24:01,840
above 80s, but what you'd want to see is
 

5475
02:24:01,840 --> 02:24:03,830
above 80s, but what you'd want to see is
is selling at the lows. And you haven't

5476
02:24:03,830 --> 02:24:03,840
is selling at the lows. And you haven't
 

5477
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:07,990
is selling at the lows. And you haven't
seen selling at the lows. So I'm not

5478
02:24:07,990 --> 02:24:08,000
seen selling at the lows. So I'm not
 

5479
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:20,870
seen selling at the lows. So I'm not
convinced the auction is over.

5480

different to short selling. It's a panic
 

5637
02:28:20,640 --> 02:28:25,190
different to short selling. It's a panic
cell. It's buyers stuck in the tape on

5638
02:28:25,190 --> 02:28:25,200
cell. It's buyers stuck in the tape on
 

5639
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:27,190
cell. It's buyers stuck in the tape on
every time frame, panic selling

5640
02:28:27,190 --> 02:28:27,200
every time frame, panic selling
 

5641
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:29,910
every time frame, panic selling
everything. We do have excess for the

5642
02:28:29,910 --> 02:28:29,920
everything. We do have excess for the
 

5643
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:31,429
everything. We do have excess for the
first time today. On that last move, we

5644
02:28:31,429 --> 02:28:31,439
first time today. On that last move, we
 

5645
02:28:31,439 --> 02:28:33,270
first time today. On that last move, we
have excess. You do not have any reclaim

5646
02:28:33,270 --> 02:28:33,280
have excess. You do not have any reclaim
 

5647
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:34,870
have excess. You do not have any reclaim
of any notable level, but you do have

5648
02:28:34,870 --> 02:28:34,880
of any notable level, but you do have
 

5649
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:36,870
of any notable level, but you do have
excess. It's way too early to say that

5650
02:28:36,870 --> 02:28:36,880
excess. It's way too early to say that
 

5651
02:28:36,880 --> 02:28:38,870
excess. It's way too early to say that
that's a low in, but there is excess on

5652
02:28:38,870 --> 02:28:38,880
that's a low in, but there is excess on
 

5653
02:28:38,880 --> 02:28:41,110
that's a low in, but there is excess on
that last move down for the first time,

5654
02:28:41,110 --> 02:28:41,120
that last move down for the first time,
 

5655
02:28:41,120 --> 02:28:43,750
that last move down for the first time,
I'd say, in this kind of roll over,

5656
02:28:43,750 --> 02:28:43,760
I'd say, in this kind of roll over,
 

5657
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:45,349
I'd say, in this kind of roll over,
let's call it. It's the first time we've

5658
02:28:45,349 --> 02:28:45,359
let's call it. It's the first time we've
 

5659
02:28:45,359 --> 02:28:47,590
let's call it. It's the first time we've
seen sellers at the lows, but I mean,

5660
02:28:47,590 --> 02:28:47,600
seen sellers at the lows, but I mean,
 

5661
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:49,110
seen sellers at the lows, but I mean,
right now, you're still defending every

5662
02:28:49,110 --> 02:28:49,120
right now, you're still defending every
 

5663
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:50,790
right now, you're still defending every
level. Buyers have still got to get way

5664
02:28:50,790 --> 02:28:50,800
level. Buyers have still got to get way
 

5665
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:52,550
level. Buyers have still got to get way
above.

5666
02:28:52,550 --> 02:28:52,560
above.
 

5667
02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:54,950
above.
I'd say you still got to get above 725,

5668
02:28:54,950 --> 02:28:54,960
I'd say you still got to get above 725,
 

5669
02:28:54,960 --> 02:28:57,910
I'd say you still got to get above 725,
730 for the buyers to have any form of

5670
02:28:57,910 --> 02:28:57,920
730 for the buyers to have any form of
 

5671
02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:01,190
730 for the buyers to have any form of
control in this. any form of control at

5672
02:29:01,190 --> 02:29:01,200
control in this. any form of control at
 

5673
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:12,309
control in this. any form of control at
all.

5674
02:29:12,309 --> 02:29:12,319

 

5675
02:29:12,319 --> 02:29:14,230

Yeah, there's no there's literally no

5676
02:29:14,230 --> 02:29:14,240
Yeah, there's no there's literally no
 

5677
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:16,150
Yeah, there's no there's literally no
reason to be buying down here, right?

5678
02:29:16,150 --> 02:29:16,160
reason to be buying down here, right?
 

5679
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:18,710
reason to be buying down here, right?
Right. The momentum is so heavy. There's

5680
02:29:18,710 --> 02:29:18,720
Right. The momentum is so heavy. There's
 

5681
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:20,630
Right. The momentum is so heavy. There's
no reason to be buying down here. You

5682
02:29:20,630 --> 02:29:20,640
no reason to be buying down here. You
 

5683
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:22,230
no reason to be buying down here. You
would need to see a reclaim of all key

5684
02:29:22,230 --> 02:29:22,240
would need to see a reclaim of all key
 

5685
02:29:22,240 --> 02:29:23,750
would need to see a reclaim of all key
levels. We're now we're inside a

5686
02:29:23,750 --> 02:29:23,760
levels. We're now we're inside a
 

5687
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:25,670
levels. We're now we're inside a
previous day's value. Think about this.

5688
02:29:25,670 --> 02:29:25,680
previous day's value. Think about this.
 

5689
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:27,830
previous day's value. Think about this.
We haven't held previous day high. We

5690
02:29:27,830 --> 02:29:27,840
We haven't held previous day high. We
 

5691
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:29,510
We haven't held previous day high. We
haven't held previous day value area

5692
02:29:29,510 --> 02:29:29,520
haven't held previous day value area
 

5693
02:29:29,520 --> 02:29:31,429
haven't held previous day value area
high. We're back inside yesterday's

5694
02:29:31,429 --> 02:29:31,439
high. We're back inside yesterday's
 

5695
02:29:31,439 --> 02:29:33,270
high. We're back inside yesterday's
range. They want to come down for this.

5696
02:29:33,270 --> 02:29:33,280
range. They want to come down for this.
 

5697
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:37,429
range. They want to come down for this.
They will. There's wh where why why buy?

5698
02:29:37,429 --> 02:29:37,439
They will. There's wh where why why buy?
 

5699
02:29:37,439 --> 02:29:40,230
They will. There's wh where why why buy?
Why buy? Like there's no reason to be

5700
02:29:40,230 --> 02:29:40,240
Why buy? Like there's no reason to be
 

5701
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:41,590
Why buy? Like there's no reason to be
buying. Look, lower high, lower low,

5702
02:29:41,590 --> 02:29:41,600
buying. Look, lower high, lower low,
 

5703
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:43,190
buying. Look, lower high, lower low,
lower high, lower low, lower high, lower

5704
02:29:43,190 --> 02:29:43,200
lower high, lower low, lower high, lower
 

5705
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:45,110
lower high, lower low, lower high, lower
low. We haven't even had a change of

5706
02:29:45,110 --> 02:29:45,120
low. We haven't even had a change of
 

5707
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:46,710
low. We haven't even had a change of
character. Flow zones are in a cell.

5708
02:29:46,710 --> 02:29:46,720
character. Flow zones are in a cell.
 

5709
02:29:46,720 --> 02:29:48,469
character. Flow zones are in a cell.
We're under VWAP. There's literally

5710
02:29:48,469 --> 02:29:48,479
We're under VWAP. There's literally
 

5711
02:29:48,479 --> 02:29:50,469
We're under VWAP. There's literally
you're under everything. You're under

5712
02:29:50,469 --> 02:29:50,479
you're under everything. You're under
 

5713
02:29:50,479 --> 02:29:51,830
you're under everything. You're under
everything. So if we're under

5714
02:29:51,830 --> 02:29:51,840
everything. So if we're under
 

5715
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:54,150
everything. So if we're under
everything, take yourself and your ego

5716
02:29:54,150 --> 02:29:54,160
everything, take yourself and your ego
 

5717
02:29:54,160 --> 02:29:56,070
everything, take yourself and your ego
out of it.

5718
02:29:56,070 --> 02:29:56,080
out of it.
 

5719
02:29:56,080 --> 02:29:58,150
out of it.
Who else is under everything? Who else

5720
02:29:58,150 --> 02:29:58,160
Who else is under everything? Who else
 

5721
02:29:58,160 --> 02:30:01,510
Who else is under everything? Who else
is stuck? Everyone. Correct. Everyone's

5722
02:30:01,510 --> 02:30:01,520
is stuck? Everyone. Correct. Everyone's
 

5723
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:03,750
is stuck? Everyone. Correct. Everyone's
stuck. So, don't [\h__\h] buy it. All

5724
02:30:03,750 --> 02:30:03,760
stuck. So, don't [\h__\h] buy it. All
 

5725
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:13,830
stuck. So, don't [\h__\h] buy it. All
right. Don't be a bottom picker.

5726
02:30:13,830 --> 02:30:13,840

 

5727
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:15,670

Can I explain what I mean by excess? I

5728
02:30:15,670 --> 02:30:15,680
Can I explain what I mean by excess? I
 

5729
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:18,550
Can I explain what I mean by excess? I
mean, they tried to sell the low down

5730
02:30:18,550 --> 02:30:18,560
mean, they tried to sell the low down
 

5731
02:30:18,560 --> 02:30:20,710
mean, they tried to sell the low down
here. Sellers

5732
02:30:20,710 --> 02:30:20,720
here. Sellers
 

5733
02:30:20,720 --> 02:30:22,710
here. Sellers
market sold this. It's the first time

5734
02:30:22,710 --> 02:30:22,720
market sold this. It's the first time
 

5735
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:24,710
market sold this. It's the first time
they didn't do that here. They market

5736
02:30:24,710 --> 02:30:24,720
they didn't do that here. They market
 

5737
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:26,389
they didn't do that here. They market
sold it here. It's the first time we've

5738
02:30:26,389 --> 02:30:26,399
sold it here. It's the first time we've
 

5739
02:30:26,399 --> 02:30:28,630
sold it here. It's the first time we've
had market selling at the lows. So, if

5740
02:30:28,630 --> 02:30:28,640
had market selling at the lows. So, if
 

5741
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:30,309
had market selling at the lows. So, if
we don't move lower than that, then

5742
02:30:30,309 --> 02:30:30,319
we don't move lower than that, then
 

5743
02:30:30,319 --> 02:30:32,150
we don't move lower than that, then
we've got notable sellers stuck at the

5744
02:30:32,150 --> 02:30:32,160
we've got notable sellers stuck at the
 

5745
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:33,750
we've got notable sellers stuck at the
lows. But right now, you're still not

5746
02:30:33,750 --> 02:30:33,760
lows. But right now, you're still not
 

5747
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:35,990
lows. But right now, you're still not
seeing a response. All I'm saying is

5748
02:30:35,990 --> 02:30:36,000
seeing a response. All I'm saying is
 

5749
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,630
seeing a response. All I'm saying is
it's the first time Delta was maybe

5750
02:30:38,630 --> 02:30:38,640
it's the first time Delta was maybe
 

5751
02:30:38,640 --> 02:30:41,429
it's the first time Delta was maybe
offside at the low of day. Not low of

5752
02:30:41,429 --> 02:30:41,439
offside at the low of day. Not low of
 

5753
02:30:41,439 --> 02:30:44,230
offside at the low of day. Not low of
day, low of this move. We're not at low

5754
02:30:44,230 --> 02:30:44,240
day, low of this move. We're not at low
 

5755
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:45,750
day, low of this move. We're not at low
of day yet. Low of day is probably the

5756
02:30:45,750 --> 02:30:45,760
of day yet. Low of day is probably the
 

5757
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:57,670
of day yet. Low of day is probably the
target.

5758
02:30:57,670 --> 02:30:57,680

 

5759
02:30:57,680 --> 02:31:02,630

Yes, I see it in the footprint and in uh

5760
02:31:02,630 --> 02:31:02,640
Yes, I see it in the footprint and in uh
 

5761
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:12,710
Yes, I see it in the footprint and in uh
input map.

5762
02:31:12,710 --> 02:31:12,720

 

5763
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:15,830

So they got stuck under 660. So if we

5764
02:31:15,830 --> 02:31:15,840
So they got stuck under 660. So if we
 

5765
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:17,590
So they got stuck under 660. So if we
trade through under 660, they're

5766
02:31:17,590 --> 02:31:17,600
trade through under 660, they're
 

5767
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:19,190
trade through under 660, they're
comfortable again. We're right there

5768
02:31:19,190 --> 02:31:19,200
comfortable again. We're right there
 

5769
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:20,710
comfortable again. We're right there
now. So, we're probably going to trade

5770
02:31:20,710 --> 02:31:20,720
now. So, we're probably going to trade
 

5771
02:31:20,720 --> 02:31:29,190
now. So, we're probably going to trade
new lows now at this point.

5772
02:31:29,190 --> 02:31:29,200

 

5773
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:33,429

Vick's new high day here. This is so so

5774
02:31:33,429 --> 02:31:33,439
Vick's new high day here. This is so so
 

5775
02:31:33,439 --> 02:31:35,830
Vick's new high day here. This is so so
heavy.

5776
02:31:35,830 --> 02:31:35,840
heavy.
 

5777
02:31:35,840 --> 02:31:42,630
heavy.
So heavy.

5778
02:31:42,630 --> 02:31:42,640

 

5779
02:31:42,640 --> 02:31:45,510

Previous week low is right below us as

5780
02:31:45,510 --> 02:31:45,520
Previous week low is right below us as
 

5781
02:31:45,520 --> 02:31:47,510
Previous week low is right below us as
is uh New York open. Everything's there

5782
02:31:47,510 --> 02:31:47,520
is uh New York open. Everything's there
 

5783
02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:50,950
is uh New York open. Everything's there
for the taking right now.

5784
02:31:50,950 --> 02:31:50,960
for the taking right now.
 

5785
02:31:50,960 --> 02:31:52,550
for the taking right now.
Everything is there for the taking at

5786
02:31:52,550 --> 02:31:52,560
Everything is there for the taking at
 

5787
02:31:52,560 --> 02:31:54,710
Everything is there for the taking at
the moment. And if you get through that,

5788
02:31:54,710 --> 02:31:54,720

5957
02:36:16,319 --> 02:36:19,750
you're not trying to sell the low, are
you? Right? If you've bought high today,

5958
02:36:19,750 --> 02:36:19,760
you? Right? If you've bought high today,
 

5959
02:36:19,760 --> 02:36:20,950
you? Right? If you've bought high today,
you're trying to let it come up to you

5960
02:36:20,950 --> 02:36:20,960
you're trying to let it come up to you
 

5961
02:36:20,960 --> 02:36:22,870
you're trying to let it come up to you
and then get rid of inventory, right?

5962
02:36:22,870 --> 02:36:22,880
and then get rid of inventory, right?
 

5963
02:36:22,880 --> 02:36:28,790
and then get rid of inventory, right?
You want to like minimize your damages.

5964
02:36:28,790 --> 02:36:28,800

 

5965
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:30,309

Right? When you see liquidation breaks

5966
02:36:30,309 --> 02:36:30,319
Right? When you see liquidation breaks
 

5967
02:36:30,319 --> 02:36:31,990
Right? When you see liquidation breaks
of the low and we dump two, three, four,

5968
02:36:31,990 --> 02:36:32,000
of the low and we dump two, three, four,
 

5969
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,870
of the low and we dump two, three, four,
500 points and start going limit down,

5970
02:36:34,870 --> 02:36:34,880
500 points and start going limit down,
 

5971
02:36:34,880 --> 02:36:37,910
500 points and start going limit down,
that's when you know that they've given

5972
02:36:37,910 --> 02:36:37,920
that's when you know that they've given
 

5973
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:39,990
that's when you know that they've given
up all help and it's margin call time

5974
02:36:39,990 --> 02:36:40,000
up all help and it's margin call time
 

5975
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:41,830
up all help and it's margin call time
and it's bank shutting down time. But

5976
02:36:41,830 --> 02:36:41,840
and it's bank shutting down time. But
 

5977
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:46,150
and it's bank shutting down time. But
right now, it's like dump the inventory.

5978
02:36:46,150 --> 02:36:46,160
right now, it's like dump the inventory.
 

5979
02:36:46,160 --> 02:36:48,710
right now, it's like dump the inventory.
Remember, if they were stuck yesterday,

5980
02:36:48,710 --> 02:36:48,720
Remember, if they were stuck yesterday,
 

5981
02:36:48,720 --> 02:36:50,150
Remember, if they were stuck yesterday,
right, if they bought, if they were

5982
02:36:50,150 --> 02:36:50,160
right, if they bought, if they were
 

5983
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:51,990
right, if they bought, if they were
stuck anytime yesterday, today we traded

5984
02:36:51,990 --> 02:36:52,000
stuck anytime yesterday, today we traded
 

5985
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:53,510
stuck anytime yesterday, today we traded
back up to previous day high. That gave

5986
02:36:53,510 --> 02:36:53,520
back up to previous day high. That gave
 

5987
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:55,830
back up to previous day high. That gave
them the opportunity to get out. So,

5988
02:36:55,830 --> 02:36:55,840
them the opportunity to get out. So,
 

5989
02:36:55,840 --> 02:36:57,750
them the opportunity to get out. So,
anyone who was stuck yesterday was given

5990
02:36:57,750 --> 02:36:57,760
anyone who was stuck yesterday was given
 

5991
02:36:57,760 --> 02:36:59,750
anyone who was stuck yesterday was given
the opportunity to get out in the money

5992
02:36:59,750 --> 02:36:59,760
the opportunity to get out in the money
 

5993
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:06,870
the opportunity to get out in the money
or at least break even.

5994
02:37:06,870 --> 02:37:06,880

 

5995
02:37:06,880 --> 02:37:08,630

Strong buying coming in here. First time

5996
02:37:08,630 --> 02:37:08,640
Strong buying coming in here. First time
 

5997
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:10,469
Strong buying coming in here. First time
I've seen very strong buying coming in

5998
02:37:10,469 --> 02:37:10,479
I've seen very strong buying coming in
 

5999
02:37:10,479 --> 02:37:12,469
I've seen very strong buying coming in
volumewise. Now, can they get through

6000
02:37:12,469 --> 02:37:12,479
volumewise. Now, can they get through
 

6001
02:37:12,479 --> 02:37:14,309
volumewise. Now, can they get through
7720

6002
02:37:14,309 --> 02:37:14,319
7720
 

6003
02:37:14,319 --> 02:37:17,190
7720
and then back through PC and then really

6004
02:37:17,190 --> 02:37:17,200
and then back through PC and then really
 

6005
02:37:17,200 --> 02:37:18,870
and then back through PC and then really
take control of anything lower time

6006
02:37:18,870 --> 02:37:18,880
take control of anything lower time
 

6007
02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:20,150
take control of anything lower time
frame? At the moment, it's still a

6008
02:37:20,150 --> 02:37:20,160
frame? At the moment, it's still a
 

6009
02:37:20,160 --> 02:37:21,750
frame? At the moment, it's still a
seller up there at 700. He's just

6010
02:37:21,750 --> 02:37:21,760
seller up there at 700. He's just
 

6011
02:37:21,760 --> 02:37:25,590
seller up there at 700. He's just
[\h__\h] dumped it on them again.

6012
02:37:25,590 --> 02:37:25,600
[\h__\h] dumped it on them again.
 

6013
02:37:25,600 --> 02:37:27,510
[\h__\h] dumped it on them again.
So, we can't even get through this uh

6014
02:37:27,510 --> 02:37:27,520
So, we can't even get through this uh
 

6015
02:37:27,520 --> 02:37:29,110
So, we can't even get through this uh
this gray box here. Not even getting

02:37:29,110 --> 02:37:29,120
this gray box here. Not even getting
 

6017
02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:30,438

02:37:30,438 --> 02:37:30,448
relief through that yet. It's still
 

6019
02:37:30,448 --> 02:37:31,830

02:37:36,469 --> 02:37:36,479

 

6023
02:37:36,479 --> 02:37:38,070

We're not seeing higher highs or higher

6024
02:37:38,070 --> 02:37:38,080
We're not seeing higher highs or higher
 

6025
02:37:38,080 --> 02:37:40,389
We're not seeing higher highs or higher
lows yet. You're just you're in this.

02:37:40,389 --> 02:37:40,399
lows yet. You're just you're in this.

02:37:46,240 --> 02:37:48,790

lows for the first time. You're not

02:37:48,790 --> 02:37:48,800
lows for the first time. You're not

So 720s, I'd say. And then 7. What's

6042
02:37:59,750 --> 02:37:59,760
So 720s, I'd say. And then 7. What's

6050
02:38:08,309 --> 02:38:08,319

Every time we popped up there has been a
massive seller. If he's gone, then you

massive seller. If he's gone, then you
might get some relief to 20s, but every

time we've popped up into it, there's
 

6389
02:48:28,960 --> 02:48:31,269
time we've popped up into it, there's
been a huge seller right here. He's

6390
02:48:31,269 --> 02:48:31,279
been a huge seller right here. He's
 

6391
02:48:31,279 --> 02:48:33,429
been a huge seller right here. He's
gone. He might get up into 20s, but uh

02:48:33,439 --> 02:48:35,990
gone. He might get up into 20s, but uh
let's see. There's the 700s. Is he gone?

6394
02:48:35,990 --> 02:48:36,000
let's see. There's the 700s. Is he gone?
 

6395
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,630
let's see. There's the 700s. Is he gone?
Is he done dumping it? Does he allow

Is he done dumping it? Does he allow
 

6397

What's this previous day point control?

6400

What's this previous day point control?
 

6401
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:45,429
What's this previous day point control?
Basically close to the 30s actually,

6402
02:48:45,429 --> 02:48:45,439
Basically close to the 30s actually,
 

6403

02:48:48,230 --> 02:48:48,240
isn't it?
 

6405
02:48:48,240 --> 02:48:51,990
isn't it?
So, do they hold 700s on a retest

6406
02:48:51,990 --> 02:48:52,000
So, do they hold 700s on a retest
 

6407
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:53,990
So, do they hold 700s on a retest
or do they just uh dump it straight back

6408
02:48:53,990 --> 02:48:54,000
or do they just uh dump it straight back
 

6409
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:58,309
or do they just uh dump it straight back
down now?

6410
02:48:58,309 --> 02:48:58,319

 

6411
02:48:58,319 --> 02:49:01,750

6412
02:49:01,750 --> 02:49:01,760
Psychological level here.
 

6413
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:03,590
Psychological level here.
Some selling coming in here just above

6414
02:49:03,590 --> 02:49:03,600
Some selling coming in here just above
 

6415
02:49:03,600 --> 02:49:07,190
Some selling coming in here just above
the 700s. They can't hold it yet. Buyers

6416
02:49:07,190 --> 02:49:07,200
the 700s. They can't hold it yet. Buyers
 

6417
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:10,070
the 700s. They can't hold it yet. Buyers
need to get up to 720s for any relief.

6418
02:49:10,070 --> 02:49:10,080
need to get up to 720s for any relief.
 

6419
02:49:10,080 --> 02:49:11,910
need to get up to 720s for any relief.
This gray box above you or 730 is

6420
02:49:11,910 --> 02:49:11,920
This gray box above you or 730 is
 

6421
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:15,510
This gray box above you or 730 is
previous day point control.

6422
02:49:15,510 --> 02:49:15,520
previous day point control.
 

6423
02:49:15,520 --> 02:49:23,429
previous day point control.
Big battle going on here.

6424
02:49:23,429 --> 02:49:23,439

 

6425
02:49:23,439 --> 02:49:28,710

Seriously, can they not get to 20s?

6426
02:49:28,710 --> 02:49:28,720
Seriously, can they not get to 20s?
 

6427
02:49:28,720 --> 02:49:30,070
Seriously, can they not get to 20s?
Yeah, no worries.

6428
02:49:30,070 --> 02:49:30,080
Yeah, no worries.
 

6429
02:49:30,080 --> 02:49:34,469
Yeah, no worries.
Hopefully some of you made money.

6430
02:49:34,469 --> 02:49:34,479

 

6431
02:49:34,479 --> 02:49:35,670

I don't think I would have caught the

6432
02:49:35,670 --> 02:49:35,680
I don't think I would have caught the
 

6433
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:37,110
I don't think I would have caught the
long no matter what today. Even if I was

6434
02:49:37,110 --> 02:49:37,120
long no matter what today. Even if I was
 

6435
02:49:37,120 --> 02:49:38,389
long no matter what today. Even if I was
well enough. Maybe I would have caught

6436
02:49:38,389 --> 02:49:38,399
well enough. Maybe I would have caught
 

6437
02:49:38,399 --> 02:49:40,469
well enough. Maybe I would have caught
the short. I don't think I'd be in it

6438
02:49:40,469 --> 02:49:40,479
the short. I don't think I'd be in it
 

6439
02:49:40,479 --> 02:49:41,910
the short. I don't think I'd be in it
now. I think I would have already got

6440
02:49:41,910 --> 02:49:41,920
now. I think I would have already got
 

6441
02:49:41,920 --> 02:49:43,750
now. I think I would have already got
out of it. Man, they just dumped sevens

6442
02:49:43,750 --> 02:49:43,760
out of it. Man, they just dumped sevens
 

6443
02:49:43,760 --> 02:49:46,550
out of it. Man, they just dumped sevens
again.

6444
02:49:46,550 --> 02:49:46,560
again.
 

6445
02:49:46,560 --> 02:49:49,190
again.
Oh my god, dude. You bulls are [\h__\h]

6446
02:49:49,190 --> 02:49:49,200
Oh my god, dude. You bulls are [\h__\h]
 

6447
02:49:49,200 --> 02:50:02,389
Oh my god, dude. You bulls are [\h__\h]
terrible.

6448
02:50:02,389 --> 02:50:02,399

 

6449
02:50:02,399 --> 02:50:05,670

You got to reclaim 700s again

6450
02:50:05,670 --> 02:50:05,680
You got to reclaim 700s again
 

6451
02:50:05,680 --> 02:50:08,309
You got to reclaim 700s again
to go 720 730s for relief. There's

6452
02:50:08,309 --> 02:50:08,319
to go 720 730s for relief. There's
 

6453
02:50:08,319 --> 02:50:13,110
to go 720 730s for relief. There's
sevens.

6454
02:50:13,110 --> 02:50:13,120

 

6455
02:50:13,120 --> 02:50:15,110

They're really struggling up here.

6456
02:50:15,110 --> 02:50:15,120
They're really struggling up here.
 

6457
02:50:15,120 --> 02:50:16,870
They're really struggling up here.
Really struggling up here to get any

6458
02:50:16,870 --> 02:50:16,880
Really struggling up here to get any
 

6459
02:50:16,880 --> 02:50:21,030
Really struggling up here to get any
follow through.

6460
02:50:21,030 --> 02:50:21,040

 

6461
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:24,230

There's bid support coming on.

6462
02:50:24,230 --> 02:50:24,240
There's bid support coming on.
 

6463
02:50:24,240 --> 02:50:26,630
There's bid support coming on.
I just haven't I wouldn't trust that bit

6464
02:50:26,630 --> 02:50:26,640
I just haven't I wouldn't trust that bit
 

6465
02:50:26,640 --> 02:50:30,070
I just haven't I wouldn't trust that bit
support, but it's there passively trying

6466
02:50:30,070 --> 02:50:30,080
support, but it's there passively trying
 

6467
02:50:30,080 --> 02:50:32,469
support, but it's there passively trying
to step on the book. Okay, they've got a

6468
02:50:32,469 --> 02:50:32,479
to step on the book. Okay, they've got a
 

6469
02:50:32,479 --> 02:50:33,750
to step on the book. Okay, they've got a
chance now to go up to previous day

6470
02:50:33,750 --> 02:50:33,760
chance now to go up to previous day
 

6471
02:50:33,760 --> 02:50:36,150
chance now to go up to previous day
point of control.

6472
02:50:36,150 --> 02:50:36,160
point of control.
 

6473
02:50:36,160 --> 02:50:37,429
point of control.
They've got a chance here to get to

6474
02:50:37,429 --> 02:50:37,439
They've got a chance here to get to
 

6475
02:50:37,439 --> 02:50:38,870
They've got a chance here to get to
previous day point of control. And if

6476
02:50:38,870 --> 02:50:38,880
previous day point of control. And if
 

6477
02:50:38,880 --> 02:50:40,389
previous day point of control. And if
they get through that, then uh maybe

6478
02:50:40,389 --> 02:50:40,399
they get through that, then uh maybe
 

6479
02:50:40,399 --> 02:50:43,750
they get through that, then uh maybe
sort of 780 800. So bulls have got a

6480
02:50:43,750 --> 02:50:43,760
sort of 780 800. So bulls have got a
 

6481
02:50:43,760 --> 02:50:45,670
sort of 780 800. So bulls have got a
chance here for a squeeze for some

6482
02:50:45,670 --> 02:50:45,680
chance here for a squeeze for some
 

6483
02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:48,150
chance here for a squeeze for some
relief. You've got a new Audi bar coming

6484
02:50:48,150 --> 02:50:48,160
relief. You've got a new Audi bar coming
 

6485
02:50:48,160 --> 02:50:50,309
relief. You've got a new Audi bar coming
being very careful.

6486
02:50:50,309 --> 02:50:50,319
being very careful.
 

6487
02:50:50,319 --> 02:50:51,670
being very careful.
I don't think sellers are done with this

6488
02:50:51,670 --> 02:50:51,680
I don't think sellers are done with this
 

6489
02:50:51,680 --> 02:50:53,830
I don't think sellers are done with this
yet. I'm just going to make that very

6490
02:50:53,830 --> 02:50:53,840
yet. I'm just going to make that very
 

6491
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:55,110
yet. I'm just going to make that very
clear. I don't think sellers are done

6492
02:50:55,110 --> 02:50:55,120
clear. I don't think sellers are done
 

6493
02:50:55,120 --> 02:50:56,469
clear. I don't think sellers are done
with this yet. I think this is a squeeze

6494
02:50:56,469 --> 02:50:56,479
with this yet. I think this is a squeeze
 

6495
02:50:56,479 --> 02:51:14,630
with this yet. I think this is a squeeze
relief which is probably sold into

6496
02:51:14,630 --> 02:51:14,640

 

6497
02:51:14,640 --> 02:51:16,870

I'd say [sighs and gasps] above above

6498
02:51:16,870 --> 02:51:16,880
I'd say [sighs and gasps] above above
 

6499
02:51:16,880 --> 02:51:18,630
I'd say [sighs and gasps] above above
780

6500
02:51:18,630 --> 02:51:18,640
780
 

6501
02:51:18,640 --> 02:51:20,230
780
can trigger a bigger squeeze, but I

6502
02:51:20,230 --> 02:51:20,240
can trigger a bigger squeeze, but I
 

6503
02:51:20,240 --> 02:51:21,910
can trigger a bigger squeeze, but I
would say bull traps will probably live

6504
02:51:21,910 --> 02:51:21,920
would say bull traps will probably live
 

6505
02:51:21,920 --> 02:51:24,710
would say bull traps will probably live
in here.

6506
02:51:24,710 --> 02:51:24,720
in here.
 

6507
02:51:24,720 --> 02:51:27,190
in here.
So, I can imagine that happening today

6508
02:51:27,190 --> 02:51:27,200
So, I can imagine that happening today
 

6509
02:51:27,200 --> 02:51:29,110
So, I can imagine that happening today
above here, but you'd have to watch the

6510
02:51:29,110 --> 02:51:29,120
above here, but you'd have to watch the
 

6511
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:31,269
above here, but you'd have to watch the
tape.

6512
02:51:31,269 --> 02:51:31,279
tape.
 

6513
02:51:31,279 --> 02:51:32,469
tape.
You would have to watch the tape for

6514
02:51:32,469 --> 02:51:32,479
You would have to watch the tape for
 

6515
02:51:32,479 --> 02:51:35,269
You would have to watch the tape for
that move. I can I can imagine that kind

6516
02:51:35,269 --> 02:51:35,279
that move. I can I can imagine that kind
 

6517
02:51:35,279 --> 02:51:43,190
that move. I can I can imagine that kind
of thing playing out. [snorts]

6518
02:51:43,190 --> 02:51:43,200

 

6519
02:51:43,200 --> 02:51:43,830

Oh [groaning]

6520
02:51:43,830 --> 02:51:43,840
Oh [groaning]
 

6521
02:51:43,840 --> 02:51:46,230
Oh [groaning]
my gosh, I can't believe I made it to

6522
02:51:46,230 --> 02:51:46,240
my gosh, I can't believe I made it to
 

6523
02:51:46,240 --> 02:51:49,190
my gosh, I can't believe I made it to
lunch with you. I'm literally like a

6524
02:51:49,190 --> 02:51:49,200
lunch with you. I'm literally like a
 

6525
02:51:49,200 --> 02:51:52,428
lunch with you. I'm literally like a
puddle of water underneath this jacket.

6526
02:51:52,428 --> 02:51:52,438
puddle of water underneath this jacket.
 

6527
02:51:52,438 --> 02:52:01,110
puddle of water underneath this jacket.
[snorts]

6528
02:52:01,110 --> 02:52:01,120

 

6529
02:52:01,120 --> 02:52:04,550

And they're selling that 720s.

6530
02:52:04,550 --> 02:52:04,560
And they're selling that 720s.
 

6531
02:52:04,560 --> 02:52:05,750
And they're selling that 720s.
Like I said, I don't think they're done

6532
02:52:05,750 --> 02:52:05,760
Like I said, I don't think they're done
 

6533
02:52:05,760 --> 02:52:07,269
Like I said, I don't think they're done
with it. It's a It's just a question of

6534
02:52:07,269 --> 02:52:07,279
with it. It's a It's just a question of
 

6535
02:52:07,279 --> 02:52:08,870
with it. It's a It's just a question of
when they come back into sell. Previous

6536
02:52:08,870 --> 02:52:08,880
when they come back into sell. Previous
 

6537
02:52:08,880 --> 02:52:10,309
when they come back into sell. Previous
day point of control right now is when

6538
02:52:10,309 --> 02:52:10,319
day point of control right now is when
 

6539
02:52:10,319 --> 02:52:11,990
day point of control right now is when
they're coming in. That red line. Is

6540
02:52:11,990 --> 02:52:12,000
they're coming in. That red line. Is
 

6541
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:13,590
they're coming in. That red line. Is
that current point of control? What is

6542
02:52:13,590 --> 02:52:13,600
that current point of control? What is
 

6543
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:16,630
that current point of control? What is
this? No, it's previous day only.

6544
02:52:16,630 --> 02:52:16,640
this? No, it's previous day only.
 

6545
02:52:16,640 --> 02:52:19,750
this? No, it's previous day only.
Where's current? Oh, is it both? They

6546
02:52:19,750 --> 02:52:19,760
Where's current? Oh, is it both? They
 

6547
02:52:19,760 --> 02:52:23,030
Where's current? Oh, is it both? They
flipped it to both. All they have

6548
02:52:23,030 --> 02:52:23,040
flipped it to both. All they have
 

6549
02:52:23,040 --> 02:52:26,389
flipped it to both. All they have
That's an ugly look.

6550
02:52:26,389 --> 02:52:26,399
That's an ugly look.
 

6551
02:52:26,399 --> 02:52:37,429
That's an ugly look.
That's an ugly look.

6552
02:52:37,429 --> 02:52:37,439

 

6553
02:52:37,439 --> 02:52:41,990

Big level here.

6554
02:52:41,990 --> 02:52:42,000

 

6555
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:43,910

Lunchtime coming folks as well. You're

6556
02:52:43,910 --> 02:52:43,920
Lunchtime coming folks as well. You're
 

6557
02:52:43,920 --> 02:52:49,429
Lunchtime coming folks as well. You're
Well, you're at lunch now.

6558
02:52:49,429 --> 02:52:49,439

 

6559
02:52:49,439 --> 02:52:51,590

Thanks, Jeff.

6560
02:52:51,590 --> 02:52:51,600
Thanks, Jeff.
 

6561
02:52:51,600 --> 02:52:53,590
Thanks, Jeff.
Hopefully, it's helped some of you.

6562
02:52:53,590 --> 02:52:53,600
Hopefully, it's helped some of you.
 

6563
02:52:53,600 --> 02:52:55,269
Hopefully, it's helped some of you.
Yeah, I can't believe I made it to noon.

6564
02:52:55,269 --> 02:52:55,279
Yeah, I can't believe I made it to noon.
 

6565
02:52:55,279 --> 02:52:58,309
Yeah, I can't believe I made it to noon.
I actually can't believe it.

6566
02:52:58,309 --> 02:52:58,319
I actually can't believe it.
 

6567
02:52:58,319 --> 02:53:00,070
I actually can't believe it.
I must look awful. I better look very
