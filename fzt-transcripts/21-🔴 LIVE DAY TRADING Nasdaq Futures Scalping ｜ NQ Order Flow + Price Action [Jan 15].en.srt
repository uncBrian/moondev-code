moves happening in the market right now.
 

9
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,110
moves happening in the market right now.
All right. As the rotation continues,

10
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
All right. As the rotation continues,
 

11
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,749
All right. As the rotation continues,
you can see if we uh just move to the

12
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
you can see if we uh just move to the
 

13
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,110
you can see if we uh just move to the
daily here. Here we go. Okay. And we're

14
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
daily here. Here we go. Okay. And we're
 

15
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,270
daily here. Here we go. Okay. And we're
still and we remain still inside the

16
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
still and we remain still inside the
 

17
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,590
still and we remain still inside the
weekly range. Right? So if we think

18
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
weekly range. Right? So if we think
 

19
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,670
weekly range. Right? So if we think
about the Monday count, Monday, Tuesday

20
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
about the Monday count, Monday, Tuesday
 

21
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,110
about the Monday count, Monday, Tuesday
set the high low of the week. We had

22
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
set the high low of the week. We had
 

23
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,749
set the high low of the week. We had
continuation yesterday uh which is what

24
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
continuation yesterday uh which is what
 

25
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,070
continuation yesterday uh which is what
we played to the downside. Right? The

26
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
we played to the downside. Right? The
 

27
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,110
we played to the downside. Right? The
break of the low volume node which is

28
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
break of the low volume node which is
 

29
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,030
break of the low volume node which is
some reason gone missing. Where is our

30
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,040
some reason gone missing. Where is our
 

31
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,030
some reason gone missing. Where is our
volume? Oh, we're going to have to put

32
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040
volume? Oh, we're going to have to put
 

33
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,950
volume? Oh, we're going to have to put
this back on apparently. So let's see if

34
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
this back on apparently. So let's see if
 

35
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,870
this back on apparently. So let's see if
we can uh get the anchor to go back on

36
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
we can uh get the anchor to go back on
 

37
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,110
we can uh get the anchor to go back on
from January

38
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
from January
 

39
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,830
from January
last year.

40
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
last year.
 

41
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,950
last year.
Let that develop. Okay, so we found a

42
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
Let that develop. Okay, so we found a
 

43
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,950
Let that develop. Okay, so we found a
bid.

44
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
bid.
 

45
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,870
bid.
All right, false break underneath. Came

46
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
All right, false break underneath. Came
 

47
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,350
All right, false break underneath. Came
back to the EMAs, closing right back at

48
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
back to the EMAs, closing right back at
 

49
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,469
back to the EMAs, closing right back at
this bundle of EMAs, 50 and 20. And this

50
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
this bundle of EMAs, 50 and 20. And this
 

51
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,990
this bundle of EMAs, 50 and 20. And this
gray box is a low volume note. Don't

52
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
gray box is a low volume note. Don't
 

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,510
gray box is a low volume note. Don't
know why the volume isn't showing, but

54
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
know why the volume isn't showing, but
 

55
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,590
know why the volume isn't showing, but
for whatever reason, it isn't right now.

56
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
for whatever reason, it isn't right now.
 

57
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,670
for whatever reason, it isn't right now.
It's struggling to show it. Then we

58
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
It's struggling to show it. Then we
 

59
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,189
It's struggling to show it. Then we
start to drive higher, okay,

60
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
start to drive higher, okay,
 

61
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,830
start to drive higher, okay,
in this GlobeEx session and we're coming

62
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:25,840
in this GlobeEx session and we're coming
 

63
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,310
in this GlobeEx session and we're coming
right up to where we started all of this

64
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
right up to where we started all of this
 

65
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,550

move yesterday. All right, so right back
into the Wednesday open, Wednesday high.

68
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
into the Wednesday open, Wednesday high.
 

69
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,749
into the Wednesday open, Wednesday high.
If we can find a bid above that and we

70
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
If we can find a bid above that and we
 

71
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,749
If we can find a bid above that and we
base, all right, there's a chance to

72
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
base, all right, there's a chance to
 

73
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,029
base, all right, there's a chance to
come and take this out. You can see the

74
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
come and take this out. You can see the
 

75
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,430
come and take this out. You can see the
Ballinger band is trying is desperately

76
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
Ballinger band is trying is desperately
 

77
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,749
Ballinger band is trying is desperately
trying to start turning

78
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
trying to start turning
 

79
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,590
trying to start turning
and we have all these stops up here at

80
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
and we have all these stops up here at
 

81
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,550
and we have all these stops up here at
26 or 125. That's kind of the area that

82
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
26 or 125. That's kind of the area that
 

83
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,870
26 or 125. That's kind of the area that
we're looking at. The easiest thing or

84
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
we're looking at. The easiest thing or
 

85
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,790
we're looking at. The easiest thing or
the nicest play today will be if they

86
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
the nicest play today will be if they
 

87
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,110
the nicest play today will be if they
stop rotating and they just offer a dip

88
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,120
stop rotating and they just offer a dip
 

89
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,990
stop rotating and they just offer a dip
somewhere into sort of this 830s would

90
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
somewhere into sort of this 830s would
 

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,390
somewhere into sort of this 830s would
be good. All right, something like this

92
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
be good. All right, something like this
 

93
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,870
be good. All right, something like this
for a continuation trade higher, but we

94
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
for a continuation trade higher, but we
 

95
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,390
for a continuation trade higher, but we
will just have to see what these guys

96
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
will just have to see what these guys
 

97
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,309
will just have to see what these guys
offer us today. This is a big move off

98
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
offer us today. This is a big move off
 

99
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,189
offer us today. This is a big move off
the lows. All right, so 300 point rally.

100
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
the lows. All right, so 300 point rally.
 

101
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,790
the lows. All right, so 300 point rally.
Why? Well, we've had earnings this

102
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
Why? Well, we've had earnings this
 

103
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,270
Why? Well, we've had earnings this
morning. SMCI had good earnings. So

104
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
morning. SMCI had good earnings. So
 

105
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,270
morning. SMCI had good earnings. So
because of that offer Taiwan

106
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
because of that offer Taiwan
 

107
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,629
because of that offer Taiwan
semiconductors you're starting to see a

108
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
semiconductors you're starting to see a
 

109
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,870
semiconductors you're starting to see a
rotation back into the chip name. So

110
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
rotation back into the chip name. So
 

111
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,710
rotation back into the chip name. So
they're starting to get some relief. So

112
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
they're starting to get some relief. So
 

113
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,029
they're starting to get some relief. So
the likes of Nvidia etc etc are starting

114
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
the likes of Nvidia etc etc are starting
 

115
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,870
the likes of Nvidia etc etc are starting
to get a bit of a bid. So we will go

116
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
to get a bit of a bid. So we will go
 

117
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,469
to get a bit of a bid. So we will go
over that as we go through the

118
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
over that as we go through the
 

119
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,990
over that as we go through the
individual names. Once we look at the

120
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
individual names. Once we look at the
 

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,749
individual names. Once we look at the
profile on the hourly we can see what

122
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
profile on the hourly we can see what
 

123
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,909
profile on the hourly we can see what
we've done here. So this is your

124
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
we've done here. So this is your
 

125
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,749
we've done here. So this is your
developing weekly profile. You can see

126
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:33,759
developing weekly profile. You can see
 

127
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,550
developing weekly profile. You can see
yesterday right we failed outside the

128
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
yesterday right we failed outside the
 

129
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,189
yesterday right we failed outside the
previous twoe range right here. Right.

130
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
previous twoe range right here. Right.
 

131
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,029
previous twoe range right here. Right.
We were short yesterday morning from

132
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
We were short yesterday morning from
 

133
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,070
We were short yesterday morning from
here for this move down. We've come all

134
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
here for this move down. We've come all
 

135
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,909
here for this move down. We've come all
the way down almost tested this old

136
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
the way down almost tested this old
 

137
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,510
the way down almost tested this old
naked point of control which we have

138
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
naked point of control which we have
 

139
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,110
naked point of control which we have
back tested already. So, it's no longer

140
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
back tested already. So, it's no longer
 

141
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,390
back tested already. So, it's no longer
naked and we found a bid and we closed

142
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
naked and we found a bid and we closed
 

143
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,270
naked and we found a bid and we closed
back inside. All right, back inside to

144
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
back inside. All right, back inside to
 

145
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,270
back inside. All right, back inside to
the current weekly value area low and

146
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,280
the current weekly value area low and
 

147
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,629
the current weekly value area low and
the previous week point of control.

148
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
the previous week point of control.
 

149
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,469
the previous week point of control.
GlobeEx has reclaimed it all and we're

150
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:00,479
GlobeEx has reclaimed it all and we're
 

151
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,909
GlobeEx has reclaimed it all and we're
back up to the current weak point of

152
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:01,919
back up to the current weak point of
 

153
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,950
back up to the current weak point of
control. I mean, it's a mess, folks.

154
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
control. I mean, it's a mess, folks.
 

155

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,670
mess, this is a mess. All right, this is
a mess. This is a massive liquidity

160
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
a mess. This is a massive liquidity
 

161
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,990
a mess. This is a massive liquidity
build out. All right, we need a break

162
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
build out. All right, we need a break
 

163
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,150
build out. All right, we need a break
either side for a continuation.

164
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
either side for a continuation.
 

165
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,070
either side for a continuation.
Otherwise, we're going to keep doing

166
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
Otherwise, we're going to keep doing
 

167
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,430
Otherwise, we're going to keep doing
this rotation. So, we have to be

168
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
this rotation. So, we have to be
 

169
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,950
this rotation. So, we have to be
careful. I would say it's a pretty

170
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
careful. I would say it's a pretty
 

171
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,550
careful. I would say it's a pretty
bullish move overnight. The key part

172
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
bullish move overnight. The key part
 

173
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,070
bullish move overnight. The key part
coming into this big huge PC here, right

174
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
coming into this big huge PC here, right
 

175
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,510
coming into this big huge PC here, right
here. So, we're getting stuck. You can

176
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
here. So, we're getting stuck. You can
 

177
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,029
here. So, we're getting stuck. You can
just call it sort of 900s and just

178
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
just call it sort of 900s and just
 

179
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,749
just call it sort of 900s and just
above. The easiest move in my mind will

180
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:35,759
above. The easiest move in my mind will
 

181
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,430
above. The easiest move in my mind will
be a dip. Now I am watching the edge of

182
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
be a dip. Now I am watching the edge of
 

183
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,550
be a dip. Now I am watching the edge of
this shelf into 860s. Interested if they

184
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
this shelf into 860s. Interested if they
 

185
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,469
this shelf into 860s. Interested if they
held the shelf if not down into previous

186
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
held the shelf if not down into previous
 

187
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,870
held the shelf if not down into previous
week value area low. And do we catch a

188
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:44,880
week value area low. And do we catch a
 

189
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,670
week value area low. And do we catch a
bid around there? 850 to 800. Let's call

190
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:47,680
bid around there? 850 to 800. Let's call
 

191
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,990
bid around there? 850 to 800. Let's call
it. Do we catch a bid around there and

192
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000
it. Do we catch a bid around there and
 

193
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,990
it. Do we catch a bid around there and
start to do this for an upside move? If

194
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
start to do this for an upside move? If
 

195
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,390
start to do this for an upside move? If
this is just all too thin and too much

196
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
this is just all too thin and too much
 

197
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,589
this is just all too thin and too much
of a reaction and we instantly lose. All

198
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
of a reaction and we instantly lose. All
 

199
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,510
of a reaction and we instantly lose. All
right. If we instantly lose previous

200
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
right. If we instantly lose previous
 

201
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,950
right. If we instantly lose previous
week value area high and we stay heavy,

202
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
week value area high and we stay heavy,
 

203
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,469
week value area high and we stay heavy,
then we're going to get this again and

204
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
then we're going to get this again and
 

205
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,830
then we're going to get this again and
we're going to rotate all the way back

206
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
we're going to rotate all the way back
 

207
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,309
we're going to rotate all the way back
down into the 700s. All right. So, those

208
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
down into the 700s. All right. So, those
 

209
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,670
down into the 700s. All right. So, those
are the two things I'm looking at. Do we

210
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
are the two things I'm looking at. Do we
 

211
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,070
are the two things I'm looking at. Do we
catch a bid between sort of 850? Let's

212
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
catch a bid between sort of 850? Let's
 

213
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,950
catch a bid between sort of 850? Let's
call it Yeah. 860, 870, and 800s or

214
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960
call it Yeah. 860, 870, and 800s or
 

215
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,589
call it Yeah. 860, 870, and 800s or
820s. Let's just call it 8. Let's

216
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
820s. Let's just call it 8. Let's
 

217
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,150
820s. Let's just call it 8. Let's
measure this out. 870

218
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160
measure this out. 870
 

219
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,830
measure this out. 870
to 830s. Do we catch a bid in there on a

220
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
to 830s. Do we catch a bid in there on a
 

221
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,309
to 830s. Do we catch a bid in there on a
pullback or do we stay heavy? The other

222
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
pullback or do we stay heavy? The other
 

223
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,790
pullback or do we stay heavy? The other
option is if we keep driving, then we're

224
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
option is if we keep driving, then we're
 

225
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,070
option is if we keep driving, then we're
going to have to look for a pull back to

226
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
going to have to look for a pull back to
 

227
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,830
going to have to look for a pull back to
hold point of control and don't really

228
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
hold point of control and don't really
 

229
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,829
hold point of control and don't really
love that trade. I'm going to be honest,

230
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
love that trade. I'm going to be honest,
 

231
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,230
love that trade. I'm going to be honest,
not leaving ourselves much room. But

232
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
not leaving ourselves much room. But
 

233
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,990
not leaving ourselves much room. But
there we go. That's what we're looking

234
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
there we go. That's what we're looking
 

235
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,509
there we go. That's what we're looking
at. So either this move here, maybe a

236
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
at. So either this move here, maybe a
 

237
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,670
at. So either this move here, maybe a
little false break and something like

238
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
little false break and something like
 

239
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,590
little false break and something like
this. Maybe a shove this morning that's

240
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
this. Maybe a shove this morning that's
 

241
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,670
this. Maybe a shove this morning that's
absorbed. If we just keep shoving, you

242
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:47,680
absorbed. If we just keep shoving, you
 

243
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,190
absorbed. If we just keep shoving, you
want to be very careful buying into this

244
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
want to be very careful buying into this
 

245
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,710
want to be very careful buying into this
because at some point they run the stops

246
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
because at some point they run the stops
 

247
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,150
because at some point they run the stops
and then they collapse the whole thing.

248
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,160
and then they collapse the whole thing.
 

249
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,790
and then they collapse the whole thing.
If we lose previous week value area high

250
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
If we lose previous week value area high
 

251
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,750
If we lose previous week value area high
and back test it and stay heavy then

252
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
and back test it and stay heavy then
 

253
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,430
and back test it and stay heavy then
this move back down into previous week

254
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
this move back down into previous week
 

255
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,190
this move back down into previous week
point of control previous day value area

256
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
point of control previous day value area
 

257
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,670
point of control previous day value area
high etc etc for the rotation you can

258
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:03,680
high etc etc for the rotation you can
 

259
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,509
high etc etc for the rotation you can
see flow zones on the hourly are trying

260
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
see flow zones on the hourly are trying
 

261
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,190
see flow zones on the hourly are trying
to turn positive or they have turned

262
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
to turn positive or they have turned
 

263
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,070
to turn positive or they have turned
positive but we are extended away from

264
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
positive but we are extended away from
 

265
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,630
positive but we are extended away from
them overnight what did we get well Asia

266
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
them overnight what did we get well Asia
 

267
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,269
them overnight what did we get well Asia
went sideways

268
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
went sideways
 

269
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,590
went sideways
and then we got into London which

270
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
and then we got into London which
 

271
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,750
and then we got into London which
started to rally and we've pushed that

272
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
started to rally and we've pushed that
 

273
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,269
started to rally and we've pushed that
rally higher now based off earnings.

274
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
rally higher now based off earnings.
 

275
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,470
rally higher now based off earnings.
Okay, let's have a look at some of the

276
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
Okay, let's have a look at some of the
 

277
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,750
Okay, let's have a look at some of the
broader market and what we're seeing.

278
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
broader market and what we're seeing.
 

279
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,590
broader market and what we're seeing.
You can see this strong trend here

280
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
You can see this strong trend here
 

281
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,030
You can see this strong trend here
developing. Even if you just wanted to

282
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
developing. Even if you just wanted to
 

283
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,790
developing. Even if you just wanted to
put a trend line on. All right, we are

284
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
put a trend line on. All right, we are
 

285
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,870
put a trend line on. All right, we are
very very strong upside right now. Do

286
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
very very strong upside right now. Do
 

287
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,870
very very strong upside right now. Do
not be fighting that trend right now.

288
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
not be fighting that trend right now.
 

289
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,470
not be fighting that trend right now.
All right, yes, we're coming into a key

290
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
All right, yes, we're coming into a key
 

291
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,190
All right, yes, we're coming into a key
area. I agree. Previous day high,

292
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,200
area. I agree. Previous day high,
 

293
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,350
area. I agree. Previous day high,
previous week high above into previous

294
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
previous week high above into previous
 

295
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,269
previous week high above into previous
point of control. Yes, lots of

296
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,279
point of control. Yes, lots of
 

297
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,710
point of control. Yes, lots of
resistance, but we're very bullish.

298
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
resistance, but we're very bullish.
 

299
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,870
resistance, but we're very bullish.
You're not seeing this market roll over.

300
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
You're not seeing this market roll over.
 

301
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,430
You're not seeing this market roll over.
And you're seeing the same

302
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
And you're seeing the same
 

303
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,910
And you're seeing the same
in the ES. So here's the ES and

304
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:51,920
in the ES. So here's the ES and
 

305
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,750
in the ES. So here's the ES and
obviously this has a relative strength

306
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
obviously this has a relative strength
 

307
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,350
obviously this has a relative strength
overall. All right, if we compare where

308
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
overall. All right, if we compare where
 

309
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,670
overall. All right, if we compare where
we are on a daily ES looking to break

310
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
we are on a daily ES looking to break
 

311
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,670
we are on a daily ES looking to break
out every time it comes up into these

312
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,680
out every time it comes up into these
 

313
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,430
out every time it comes up into these
kind of levels, it's being sold off. The

314
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440
kind of levels, it's being sold off. The
 

315
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,430
kind of levels, it's being sold off. The
question is, will it do it again? This

316
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
question is, will it do it again? This
 

317
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,509
question is, will it do it again? This
is one, two, this is the third time

318
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
is one, two, this is the third time
 

319
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,430
is one, two, this is the third time
visiting up here. All right, dips have

320
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
visiting up here. All right, dips have
 

321
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,550
visiting up here. All right, dips have
been absorbed. We talked about it

322
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
been absorbed. We talked about it
 

323
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,070
been absorbed. We talked about it
yesterday. There was a buyer on the tape

324
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:10,080
yesterday. There was a buyer on the tape
 

325
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,509
yesterday. There was a buyer on the tape
all day yesterday. Even when we moved

326
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
all day yesterday. Even when we moved
 

327
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,710
all day yesterday. Even when we moved
lower, there was someone trying to

328
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
lower, there was someone trying to
 

329
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,870
lower, there was someone trying to
absorb the tape. Well, if he's held on

330
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
absorb the tape. Well, if he's held on
 

331
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,150
absorb the tape. Well, if he's held on
to his position, if that was

332
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,160
to his position, if that was
 

333
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,750
to his position, if that was
institutional buying, then he's very

334
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
institutional buying, then he's very
 

335
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,030
institutional buying, then he's very
comfortable right now looking for a

336
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
comfortable right now looking for a
 

337
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,710
comfortable right now looking for a
breakout, isn't he? So, we need to be

338
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
breakout, isn't he? So, we need to be
 

339
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,870
breakout, isn't he? So, we need to be
aware of that

340
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
aware of that
 

341
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,389
aware of that
all those moves higher. But yeah, it

342
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
all those moves higher. But yeah, it
 

343
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,069
all those moves higher. But yeah, it
looks comfortable here. Let's have a

344
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
looks comfortable here. Let's have a
 

345
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,790
looks comfortable here. Let's have a
look quick look at the ETFs. Think about

346
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
look quick look at the ETFs. Think about
 

347
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,310
look quick look at the ETFs. Think about
the levels. I would imagine there's some

348
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
the levels. I would imagine there's some
 

349
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,630
the levels. I would imagine there's some
gamma exposure at 695 on the spiders.

350
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
gamma exposure at 695 on the spiders.
 

351
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,550
gamma exposure at 695 on the spiders.
And we can mark our gap fill underneath.

352
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
And we can mark our gap fill underneath.
 

353
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,150
And we can mark our gap fill underneath.
Where's that at 90? So, gap fill at 90s

354
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
Where's that at 90? So, gap fill at 90s
 

355
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,990
Where's that at 90? So, gap fill at 90s
will be nice if it offered that. I very

356
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
will be nice if it offered that. I very
 

357
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,430
will be nice if it offered that. I very
much doubt it wanted to do that today,

358
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,440
much doubt it wanted to do that today,
 

359
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,509
much doubt it wanted to do that today,
but we will see. Same on the cues,

360
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
but we will see. Same on the cues,
 

361
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,110
but we will see. Same on the cues,
right? Coming into some big levels.

362
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
right? Coming into some big levels.
 

363
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,230
right? Coming into some big levels.
reclaimed the 25s and that gap filled

364
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
reclaimed the 25s and that gap filled
 

365
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,269
reclaimed the 25s and that gap filled
basically down to 1950s. I I just can't

366
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
basically down to 1950s. I I just can't
 

367
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,110
basically down to 1950s. I I just can't
see this market wanting to do that. I

368
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,120
see this market wanting to do that. I
 

369
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,790
see this market wanting to do that. I
mean, it's possible. We've done it

370
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
mean, it's possible. We've done it
 

371
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,590
mean, it's possible. We've done it
before. Um we did it a lot last week.

372
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:01,600
before. Um we did it a lot last week.
 

373
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,509
before. Um we did it a lot last week.
This will be an instant buy opportunity

374
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
This will be an instant buy opportunity
 

375
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,590
This will be an instant buy opportunity
if we even dare to come that low, but I

376
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
if we even dare to come that low, but I
 

377
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,710
if we even dare to come that low, but I
find it somewhat hard to believe.

378
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
find it somewhat hard to believe.
 

379
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,190
find it somewhat hard to believe.
Dixie rallying as well this morning. Um

383
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,870
that's a strong move off the Dixie
trying to get back to that 100 spot. If

384
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
trying to get back to that 100 spot. If
 

385
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,230
trying to get back to that 100 spot. If
we have a look at the VIX, all right,

386
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
we have a look at the VIX, all right,
 

387
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,870
we have a look at the VIX, all right,
got crushed that false break of 18. we

388
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:18,880
got crushed that false break of 18. we
 

389

talked about it got crushed back down
into some old support here. And he's

392
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
into some old support here. And he's
 

393
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,870
into some old support here. And he's
moved all these again.

394
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880

 

395
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,030

Okay. So, if we start losing a bid on

396
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,040
Okay. So, if we start losing a bid on
 

397
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,990
Okay. So, if we start losing a bid on
Dixie, expect this market to continue to

Dixie, expect this market to continue to
 

399
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,670
Dixie, expect this market to continue to
move higher. Let's have a look at MAG

400
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
move higher. Let's have a look at MAG
 

401
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,350
move higher. Let's have a look at MAG
because that's the interesting part this

402
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
because that's the interesting part this
 

403
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,509
because that's the interesting part this
morning. All right. You can see this

404
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:37,519
morning. All right. You can see this
 

405

morning. All right. You can see this
dip,

406
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
dip,
 

407
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,949
dip,
this undercut here. This dip got

408
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:40,959
this undercut here. This dip got
 

409
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,509
this undercut here. This dip got
absorbed yesterday. We are potentially

410
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
absorbed yesterday. We are potentially
 

411
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,590
absorbed yesterday. We are potentially
building this liquidity to try and

412
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
building this liquidity to try and
 

413
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,190
building this liquidity to try and
break. Apple has been one of the weaker

414
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
break. Apple has been one of the weaker
 

415
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,230
break. Apple has been one of the weaker
names. Um, but we'll see. We'll see.

416
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
names. Um, but we'll see. We'll see.

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
We're still just stuck inside this,
 

419
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,910
We're still just stuck inside this,
right? But if we can get back over the

420
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,920
right? But if we can get back over the
 

421
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,230
right? But if we can get back over the
60s, maybe Apple's got a shot of like

422
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
60s, maybe Apple's got a shot of like
 

423
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,750
60s, maybe Apple's got a shot of like
starting to catch a bid. It's been weak

424
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
starting to catch a bid. It's been weak
 

425
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,110
starting to catch a bid. It's been weak
for a little while here. You can see the

acceptance back inside some of these
 

443
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,790
acceptance back inside some of these
ranges that we've broken out from?

444
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
ranges that we've broken out from?
 

445
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,350
ranges that we've broken out from?

rest of the market, remember, has
 

467
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,750
rest of the market, remember, has
already started to do this. So, Meta is

468
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
already started to do this. So, Meta is
 

469
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,750
already started to do this. So, Meta is
still weak. Still relative weakness on

470
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
still weak. Still relative weakness on
 

471
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,430
still weak. Still relative weakness on
Meta for those of you trading it, but we

472
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:49,440
Meta for those of you trading it, but we
 

473
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,790
Meta for those of you trading it, but we
are gapping up, but we have a little bit

474
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:50,800
are gapping up, but we have a little bit
 

475
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,710
are gapping up, but we have a little bit
more weakness there. Microsoft trying to

476
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
more weakness there. Microsoft trying to
 

477
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,990
more weakness there. Microsoft trying to
do the move. This is what we've just

478
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,000
do the move. This is what we've just
 

479
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,550
do the move. This is what we've just
talked about. It's failed from here. And

480
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
talked about. It's failed from here. And
 

481
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,550
talked about. It's failed from here. And
that was from a bigger failure point in

482
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
that was from a bigger failure point in
 

483
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,430
that was from a bigger failure point in
a downtrend. Can it now start to hold

484
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
a downtrend. Can it now start to hold
 

485
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,269
a downtrend. Can it now start to hold
bids and try and break out? Big question

486
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
bids and try and break out? Big question
 

487
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,750
bids and try and break out? Big question
mark over that. And Nvidia, these are

488
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
mark over that. And Nvidia, these are
 

489
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,030
mark over that. And Nvidia, these are
going to be the important ones. Catching

490
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
going to be the important ones. Catching
 

491
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,269
going to be the important ones. Catching
a bid of SMCI like I talked about. All

492
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279
a bid of SMCI like I talked about. All
 

493
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,870
a bid of SMCI like I talked about. All
right. 180 big level. All right. False

494
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
right. 180 big level. All right. False
 

495
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,910
right. 180 big level. All right. False
break so far. And that's a decent gap

496
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
break so far. And that's a decent gap
 

497
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,110
break so far. And that's a decent gap
up. Two $3 gap up. So, we'll be watching

498
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
up. Two $3 gap up. So, we'll be watching
 

499
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,470
up. Two $3 gap up. So, we'll be watching
for a break of right here.

500
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,480

 

501
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,550

All right. 88s

502
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
All right. 88s
 

503
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,949
All right. 88s
will be a decent break even where we are

504
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:28,959
will be a decent break even where we are
 

505
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,750
will be a decent break even where we are
right now. Really, 86s and 88s. But we

506
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:31,760
right now. Really, 86s and 88s. But we
 

507
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,310
right now. Really, 86s and 88s. But we
get through 88s or if we hold a bid

508
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
get through 88s or if we hold a bid
 

509
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,230
get through 88s or if we hold a bid
through 87s and 88s, then we're back

510
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,240
through 87s and 88s, then we're back
 

511
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,310
through 87s and 88s, then we're back
into that old range, which will be

512
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
into that old range, which will be
 

513
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,470
into that old range, which will be
important even if even if it just closes

514
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
important even if even if it just closes
 

515
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,150
important even if even if it just closes
up there. The important part is what

516
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
up there. The important part is what
 

517
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,990
up there. The important part is what
happens when we get up there. But yes,

518
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000
happens when we get up there. But yes,
 

519
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,310
happens when we get up there. But yes,
catching a bid, like I said, off SMCI,

520
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320
catching a bid, like I said, off SMCI,
 

521
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,230
catching a bid, like I said, off SMCI,
the earnings coming through this

522
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
the earnings coming through this
 

523
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,870
the earnings coming through this
morning. Tesla, same story. So much of

524
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
morning. Tesla, same story. So much of
 

525
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,790
morning. Tesla, same story. So much of
these having the same story. There's the

526
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
these having the same story. There's the
 

527
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,430
these having the same story. There's the
box, there's the failure, there's the

528
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:55,440
box, there's the failure, there's the
 

529
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,069
box, there's the failure, there's the
undercut, there's the pivot, there's the

530
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
undercut, there's the pivot, there's the
 

531
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,949
undercut, there's the pivot, there's the
hold. Can we get back inside? That is

532
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
hold. Can we get back inside? That is
 

533
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,030
hold. Can we get back inside? That is
the question. If we fail that and

534
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
the question. If we fail that and
 

535
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,030
the question. If we fail that and
retest, market will might maybe roll

536
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,040
retest, market will might maybe roll
 

537
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,470
retest, market will might maybe roll
over this squeeze this morning. So,

538
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480
over this squeeze this morning. So,
 

539
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,550
over this squeeze this morning. So,
that's what we're watching for this

540
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:08,560
that's what we're watching for this
 

541
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,910
that's what we're watching for this
morning. All right, that's what we're

542
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
morning. All right, that's what we're
 

543
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,870
morning. All right, that's what we're
looking at this morning. We can have a

544
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
looking at this morning. We can have a
 

545
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,310
looking at this morning. We can have a
look at some of the broader names that

546
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
look at some of the broader names that
 

547
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,509
look at some of the broader names that
probably caught a bid as well. There you

548
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519
probably caught a bid as well. There you
 

549
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,990
probably caught a bid as well. There you
go. Oracle filing a bid off that SMCI.

550
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
go. Oracle filing a bid off that SMCI.
 

551
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,310
go. Oracle filing a bid off that SMCI.
I'd imagine AMD as well. Yes, AMD

552
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,320
I'd imagine AMD as well. Yes, AMD
 

553
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,350
I'd imagine AMD as well. Yes, AMD
catching a bid. So, all the

554
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
catching a bid. So, all the
 

555
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,750
catching a bid. So, all the
semiconductors catching bids here this

556
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:21,760
semiconductors catching bids here this
 

557
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,590
semiconductors catching bids here this
morning, which is going to help tech.

558
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:23,600
morning, which is going to help tech.
 

559
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,750
morning, which is going to help tech.
I'd say the broader market. I think uh

560
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:25,760
I'd say the broader market. I think uh
 

561
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,350
I'd say the broader market. I think uh
did JP Morgan have earnings this

562
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
did JP Morgan have earnings this
 

563
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,750
did JP Morgan have earnings this
morning? I'm pretty sure they did. Let's

564
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:29,760
morning? I'm pretty sure they did. Let's
 

565
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,069
morning? I'm pretty sure they did. Let's
have a quick look there.

566
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:32,079
have a quick look there.
 

567
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,509
have a quick look there.
Pretty sure they had earnings. Yeah,

568
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519
Pretty sure they had earnings. Yeah,
 

569
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,910
Pretty sure they had earnings. Yeah,
they did. I think they beat as well or

570
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
they did. I think they beat as well or
 

571
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,750
they did. I think they beat as well or
they've got them coming. This

572
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,760

 

573
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,310

Yeah, 5% rise. Yeah, they beat as well.

574
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
Yeah, 5% rise. Yeah, they beat as well.
 

575
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,150
Yeah, 5% rise. Yeah, they beat as well.
So, slight gap up there. So, you might

576
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
So, slight gap up there. So, you might
 

577
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,069
So, slight gap up there. So, you might
get some breadth moving with it as well,

578
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:50,079
get some breadth moving with it as well,
 

579
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,350
get some breadth moving with it as well,
given that um if the banks start to go,

580
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:53,360
given that um if the banks start to go,
 

581
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,310
given that um if the banks start to go,
then ES will look good with the broader

582
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:56,320
then ES will look good with the broader
 

583
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,310
then ES will look good with the broader
moves in the market. All right, let's

584
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,320
moves in the market. All right, let's
 

585
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,790
moves in the market. All right, let's
zoom this back in.

586
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:00,800
zoom this back in.
 

587
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,430
zoom this back in.
Let's get us set up here. All right,

588
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440
Let's get us set up here. All right,
 

589
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,310
Let's get us set up here. All right,
already breaking out.

590
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,320
already breaking out.
 

591
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,069
already breaking out.
Wow, look at this. Even since I've been

592
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
Wow, look at this. Even since I've been
 

593
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,590
Wow, look at this. Even since I've been
talking. Jeez, man. Market does not want

594
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,600
talking. Jeez, man. Market does not want
 

595
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,189
talking. Jeez, man. Market does not want
to slow down. I would not want to be

596
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
to slow down. I would not want to be
 

597
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,350
to slow down. I would not want to be
buying the top up here today. Um, it's

598
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,360
buying the top up here today. Um, it's
 

599
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,790
buying the top up here today. Um, it's
just one of those. If it goes without

600
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
just one of those. If it goes without
 

601
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,269
just one of those. If it goes without
me, it goes without me.

602
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:19,279
me, it goes without me.
 

603
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,509
me, it goes without me.
That will be it. All right, folks. So,

604
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,519
That will be it. All right, folks. So,
 

605
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,389
That will be it. All right, folks. So,
that's kind of the setup. Um, I would

606
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:24,399
that's kind of the setup. Um, I would
 

607
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,230
that's kind of the setup. Um, I would
love a retest of this area here. All

608
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:26,240
love a retest of this area here. All
 

609
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,790
love a retest of this area here. All
right, this is uh areas of interest for

610
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
right, this is uh areas of interest for
 

611
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,790
right, this is uh areas of interest for
me to bid off. It very well might not

612
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
me to bid off. It very well might not
 

613
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,910
me to bid off. It very well might not
offer it. All right, we're coming to a

614
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
offer it. All right, we're coming to a
 

615
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,509
offer it. All right, we're coming to a
bump in the road here. I'd love to be a

616
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:33,519
bump in the road here. I'd love to be a
 

617
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,750
bump in the road here. I'd love to be a
buyer down here. I'd even consider some

618
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:35,760

00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:17,600

 

779
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,190

No rush here. Just waiting to see if we

780
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,200
No rush here. Just waiting to see if we
 

781
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,510
No rush here. Just waiting to see if we
either drift lower or if we do reclaim

782
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
either drift lower or if we do reclaim
 

783
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,110
either drift lower or if we do reclaim
New York. I might be forced to buy high.

784
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
New York. I might be forced to buy high.
 

785
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,430
New York. I might be forced to buy high.
It's not what I want to do, but

786
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,440
It's not what I want to do, but
 

787
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,789
It's not what I want to do, but
definitely don't want to be left behind

788
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:26,799
definitely don't want to be left behind
 

789
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,549
definitely don't want to be left behind
today, but hopefully we can drift lower

790
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
today, but hopefully we can drift lower
 

791
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,150
today, but hopefully we can drift lower
first.

792
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160

 

793
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,870

Look at the mag.

794
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:34,880
Look at the mag.
 

795
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,950
Look at the mag.
All the mag gapping up. So, I keep

796
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:36,960
All the mag gapping up. So, I keep
 

797
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,430
All the mag gapping up. So, I keep
getting stuck at this uh New York open

798
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,440
getting stuck at this uh New York open
 

799
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,270
getting stuck at this uh New York open
so far. This red block, right? We keep

800
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,280
so far. This red block, right? We keep
 

801
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,390
so far. This red block, right? We keep
getting stuck there. Not finding

802
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:42,400
getting stuck there. Not finding
 

803
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,990
getting stuck there. Not finding
acceptance over it yet. I'm not looking

804
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,000
acceptance over it yet. I'm not looking
 

805
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,669
acceptance over it yet. I'm not looking
to play the short down into here. I want

806
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
to play the short down into here. I want
 

807
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,029
to play the short down into here. I want
to wait to see if it can offer me the

808
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,039
to wait to see if it can offer me the
 

809
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,110
to wait to see if it can offer me the
long.

810
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,120
long.
 

811
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,789
long.
You guys do what you feels right for

812
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
You guys do what you feels right for
 

813
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,390
You guys do what you feels right for
you. I'm not looking to play the short.

814
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:52,400
you. I'm not looking to play the short.
 

815
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,310
you. I'm not looking to play the short.
I would much rather look to absorb a

816
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,320
I would much rather look to absorb a
 

817
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,710
I would much rather look to absorb a
long.

818

819
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,590

Still not through that New York open.

820
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600

 

821
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,029

If they get through that New York open

822
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:07,039
If they get through that New York open
 

823
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,549
If they get through that New York open
and they base above, there's a chance

824
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:08,559
and they base above, there's a chance
 

825
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,909
and they base above, there's a chance
that they squeeze and take out the

826
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
that they squeeze and take out the
 

827
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,430
that they squeeze and take out the
highs. But I'd much rather it came

828
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:11,440
highs. But I'd much rather it came
 

829
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,590
highs. But I'd much rather it came
lower. going to offer a much better

830
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:13,600
lower. going to offer a much better
 

831
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,870
lower. going to offer a much better
riskreward.

832
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:18,880

 

833
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,789

Morning, Tyson.

834
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:20,799
Morning, Tyson.

Morning, Tyson.
All right, watching here. Here's the New

00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:25,039
York open test again.
 

839
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,710
York open test again.
Still stuck there. So, definitely some

840
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:26,720
Still stuck there. So, definitely some
 

841
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,390
Still stuck there. So, definitely some
passive selling up here so far. I think

842
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,400
passive selling up here so far. I think
 

843
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,990
passive selling up here so far. I think
we will probably squeeze through it once

844
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,000
we will probably squeeze through it once
 

845
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,630
we will probably squeeze through it once
we go.

846
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:32,640
we go.
 

847
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,070
we go.
Watching for a trigger. Still stuck

Break above there and we can potentially

Break above there and we can potentially
 

869
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,630
Break above there and we can potentially
squeeze if we can break above and hold.

squeeze if we can break above and hold.

All right. Are we going to get some

00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:10,799
All right. Are we going to get some
 

875
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,270
All right. Are we going to get some
movement through here now?

movement through here now?

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,350
movement through here now?
Can we base and absorb? Lots of buyers

878
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,360
Can we base and absorb? Lots of buyers
 

879
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,950
Can we base and absorb? Lots of buyers
coming in here, but not seeing a base

force my way in. Just waiting patiently

That is your New York open. That's where

That is your New York open. That's where

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,789
That is your New York open. That's where
they keep getting stuck. Buyers keep

00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:32,799
they keep getting stuck. Buyers keep
 

895
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,870
they keep getting stuck. Buyers keep
coming up at here and trying to force

coming up at here and trying to force
 

897
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,549
coming up at here and trying to force
the way higher and they can't base

00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:36,559
the way higher and they can't base
 

899
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,310
the way higher and they can't base
above. If they based above, I'd be

900
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,320
above. If they based above, I'd be
 

901
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,590
above. If they based above, I'd be
willing to potentially look for the

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:39,600
willing to potentially look for the
 

903
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,110
willing to potentially look for the
move, but really I want to be a buyer

904
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,120
move, but really I want to be a buyer
 

905
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,710
move, but really I want to be a buyer
down here. It's the best opportunity

906
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:42,720
down here. It's the best opportunity
 

907
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,470
down here. It's the best opportunity
possible.

908
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:44,480
possible.
 

909
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,789
possible.
They're having another go up here in

They're having another go up here in

Google gone red now. Oracle gone red.

915
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,510

I just look around at the ETS. Vic still

nice and patient. I want to wait and see

nice and patient. I want to wait and see
 

921
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,669
nice and patient. I want to wait and see
if we come down here. Maybe some of you

922
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:11,679
if we come down here. Maybe some of you
 

923
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,950
if we come down here. Maybe some of you
are looking to play this short down to

924
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:12,960
are looking to play this short down to
 

925
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,870
are looking to play this short down to
there. It's uh it's a possible move.

926
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
there. It's uh it's a possible move.
 

927
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,950
there. It's uh it's a possible move.
It's not what I'm looking for. I want to

928
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:16,960
It's not what I'm looking for. I want to
 

929
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,789
It's not what I'm looking for. I want to
be a buyer in the market if we can

930
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:18,799
be a buyer in the market if we can
 

931
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,789
be a buyer in the market if we can
rotate down

932
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:20,799
rotate down
 

933
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,870
rotate down
because we're gapping up over the

934
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:22,880
because we're gapping up over the
 

935
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,390
because we're gapping up over the
previous day's value. So, I want to try

936
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
previous day's value. So, I want to try
 

937
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,029
previous day's value. So, I want to try
and be a buyer. Sellers just got caught

938
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
and be a buyer. Sellers just got caught
 

939
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,029
and be a buyer. Sellers just got caught
at those lows at 88. I'll tell you that

940
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:29,039
at those lows at 88. I'll tell you that
 

941
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,990
at those lows at 88. I'll tell you that
right now. 197 lot just got caught at

942
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
right now. 197 lot just got caught at
 

943
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,990
right now. 197 lot just got caught at
the low of day there or current lows of

944
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,000
the low of day there or current lows of
 

945
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,710
the low of day there or current lows of
88 in the New York session. So if they

946
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:36,720
88 in the New York session. So if they
 

947
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,630
88 in the New York session. So if they
don't break below that there is a

948
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:38,640
don't break below that there is a
 

949
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,510
don't break below that there is a
squeeze potential.

950
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:43,520

 

951
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,470

He's right at 88 that big seller. They

952
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,480
He's right at 88 that big seller. They
 

953
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,230
He's right at 88 that big seller. They
need to get under that for him to feel

954
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,240
need to get under that for him to feel
 

955
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,510
need to get under that for him to feel
comfortable. They're going to have

956
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:49,520
comfortable. They're going to have
 

957
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,070
comfortable. They're going to have
another attempt down here. Are they?

958
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,080
another attempt down here. Are they?
 

959
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,230
another attempt down here. Are they?
Well hopefully we can get down into

960
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
Well hopefully we can get down into
 

961
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:02,710
Well hopefully we can get down into
here. It' be very nice if we could.

962
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:02,720

 

963
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,470

What is the edge of this that we talked

964
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,480
What is the edge of this that we talked
 

965
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,190
What is the edge of this that we talked
about earlier? 60 60 or 70, wasn't it?

966
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,200
about earlier? 60 60 or 70, wasn't it?
 

967
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,950
about earlier? 60 60 or 70, wasn't it?
870s

968
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:08,960
870s
 

969
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,590
870s
down into 830s is a sort of level. So,

970
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:11,600
down into 830s is a sort of level. So,
 

971
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,510
down into 830s is a sort of level. So,
here's the 870. This is the edge of the

972
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:13,520
here's the 870. This is the edge of the
 

973
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,510
here's the 870. This is the edge of the
big point of control node. And if we

974
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:15,520
big point of control node. And if we
 

975
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,350
big point of control node. And if we
lose this, then hopefully we come down

976
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
lose this, then hopefully we come down
 

977
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,909
lose this, then hopefully we come down
into 830s, maybe even deeper if we get

978
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:19,919
into 830s, maybe even deeper if we get
 

979
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,070
into 830s, maybe even deeper if we get
very lucky. Right, Google starting to

980
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,080
very lucky. Right, Google starting to
 

981
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,870
very lucky. Right, Google starting to
sell now. So, Google starting to sell

982
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:24,880
sell now. So, Google starting to sell
 

983
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,750
sell now. So, Google starting to sell
off 3/4 of a percent down. Rest of the

984
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:27,760
off 3/4 of a percent down. Rest of the
 

985
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,909
off 3/4 of a percent down. Rest of the
market still looks okay. Here's the 70s

986
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
market still looks okay. Here's the 70s
 

987
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,750
market still looks okay. Here's the 70s
test. Can we come down into the 30s and

988
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:31,760
test. Can we come down into the 30s and
 

989
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,549
test. Can we come down into the 30s and
below?

990
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:36,559

 

991
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,870

Yes, still holding up against the

992
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:38,880
Yes, still holding up against the
 

993
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,510
Yes, still holding up against the
previous day high. I think it is. No,

994
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:41,520
previous day high. I think it is. No,
 

995
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,350
previous day high. I think it is. No,
must be previous week gap.

996
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,360

 

997
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,430

So, 70 is finding a bid so far. Like we

998
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:49,440
So, 70 is finding a bid so far. Like we
 

999
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,789
So, 70 is finding a bid so far. Like we
talked about pre-market.

1000
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
talked about pre-market.
 

1001
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,470
talked about pre-market.
If we lose 70s, there's a chance for it

1002
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:54,480
If we lose 70s, there's a chance for it
 

1003
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,950
If we lose 70s, there's a chance for it
to move to 30s.

1004
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:56,960
to move to 30s.
 

1005
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,710
to move to 30s.
There are some bids at 50s and 45s,

1006
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:00,720
There are some bids at 50s and 45s,
 

1007
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,110
There are some bids at 50s and 45s,
but this 70s just based on current the

1008
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,120
but this 70s just based on current the
 

1009
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,110
but this 70s just based on current the
current weekly profile, the developing

1010
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,120
current weekly profile, the developing
 

1011
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,789
current weekly profile, the developing
profile is important. I'm going to get

1012
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:06,799
profile is important. I'm going to get
 

1013
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,990
profile is important. I'm going to get
rid of this trend line because it's just

1014
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,000
rid of this trend line because it's just
 

1015
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,590
rid of this trend line because it's just
in my way. Can't see what I need to see.

1016
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:15,600

 

1017
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,510

And I think if we get back over 90s,

1018
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:17,520
And I think if we get back over 90s,
 

1019
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,149
And I think if we get back over 90s,
there's chance to move higher.

1020
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:20,159
there's chance to move higher.
 

1021
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,510
there's chance to move higher.
Watching this carefully. That's where

1022
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:21,520
Watching this carefully. That's where
 

1023
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,510
Watching this carefully. That's where
that big seller came in. Remember,

1024
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:23,520
that big seller came in. Remember,
 

1025
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,190
that big seller came in. Remember,
there's the move to 90s. All right. Can

1026
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,200
there's the move to 90s. All right. Can
 

1027
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,190
there's the move to 90s. All right. Can
we base above and squeeze?

1028
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
we base above and squeeze?
 

1029
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,710
we base above and squeeze?
So, there's the attempt to go through

1030
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:30,720
So, there's the attempt to go through
 

1031
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,950
So, there's the attempt to go through
90s. Still trapping buyers up there.

1032
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:32,960
90s. Still trapping buyers up there.
 

1033
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,950
90s. Still trapping buyers up there.
Still a passive seller here at 900s.

1034
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
Still a passive seller here at 900s.
 

1035
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,950
Still a passive seller here at 900s.
No base above still. So, same as

1036
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:38,960
No base above still. So, same as
 

1037
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,789
No base above still. So, same as
earlier. Buyers are attempting, but not

1038
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:40,799
earlier. Buyers are attempting, but not
 

1039
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,510
earlier. Buyers are attempting, but not
getting a base.

1040
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,520

 

1041
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,110

Not going to force my way into this. I'm

1042
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,120
Not going to force my way into this. I'm
 

1043
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,830
Not going to force my way into this. I'm
going to be very, very patient.

1044
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:51,840

 

1045
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,669

that was the London high 30s. All right.

1046
00:24:57,669 --> 00:24:57,679
that was the London high 30s. All right.
 

1047
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:03,750
that was the London high 30s. All right.
The edge of this

1048
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:03,760

 

1049
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,950

830. Yeah, I really like that area. I

1050
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:06,960
830. Yeah, I really like that area. I
 

1051
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,950
830. Yeah, I really like that area. I
like where we are now and I like 830s.

1052
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:08,960
like where we are now and I like 830s.
 

1053
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,510
like where we are now and I like 830s.
Both of those have opportunities.

1054
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
Both of those have opportunities.
 

1055
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,669
Both of those have opportunities.
They're trying for the 90s again and

1056
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:13,679
They're trying for the 90s again and
 

1057
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,190
They're trying for the 90s again and
they're going to try and push 900s if

1058
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,200
they're going to try and push 900s if
 

1059
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,350
they're going to try and push 900s if
they can basic up above 90s which they

1060
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,360
they can basic up above 90s which they
 

1061
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,430
they can basic up above 90s which they
still are unable to do. So sellers still

1062
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:19,440
still are unable to do. So sellers still
 

1063
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,789
still are unable to do. So sellers still
dragging this market down. How we

1064
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:20,799
dragging this market down. How we
 

1065
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,110
dragging this market down. How we
looking on the mag oracle trying to find

1066
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120
looking on the mag oracle trying to find
 

1067
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,149
looking on the mag oracle trying to find
a bid. Google trying to find a bid.

1068
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,159
a bid. Google trying to find a bid.
 

1069
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,789
a bid. Google trying to find a bid.
Here's the drive back down towards

1070
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:28,799
Here's the drive back down towards
 

1071
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,149
Here's the drive back down towards
the 70s again. Still waiting here. Just

1072
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
the 70s again. Still waiting here. Just
 

1073
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:43,590
the 70s again. Still waiting here. Just
patiently waiting here.

1074
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:43,600

 

1075
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,710

Spying to its VWAP. By the way,

1076
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:46,720
Spying to its VWAP. By the way,
 

1077
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,390
Spying to its VWAP. By the way,
cues are under the VWAP. Coming to the

1078
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:48,400
cues are under the VWAP. Coming to the
 

1079
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,190
cues are under the VWAP. Coming to the
5day now

1080
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,200
5day now
 

1081
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,870
5day now
almost into this level of interest.

1082
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:54,880
almost into this level of interest.
 

1083
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,549
almost into this level of interest.
If we lose this level of interest is a

1084
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:56,559
If we lose this level of interest is a
 

1085
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,029
If we lose this level of interest is a
long way down. So we we really if we're

1086
00:25:59,029 --> 00:25:59,039
long way down. So we we really if we're
 

1087
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,549
long way down. So we we really if we're
going to be uber bullish today, I'd want

1088
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
going to be uber bullish today, I'd want
 

1089
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,789
going to be uber bullish today, I'd want
to see them absorb between where we are

1090
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:02,799
to see them absorb between where we are
 

1091
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:10,230
to see them absorb between where we are
now and there. Really

1092

the session. 08s. I want to see if we
 

1155
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,950
the session. 08s. I want to see if we
can get acceptance through that. I know

1156
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:26,960
can get acceptance through that. I know
 

1157
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,230
can get acceptance through that. I know
it looks different to you on here. I'm

920s again. So, this dip here needs to
 

1173

920s again. So, this dip here needs to
hold otherwise I'm out and it would just

hold otherwise I'm out and it would just

hold otherwise I'm out and it would just
be a scalp.

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,710

You have to be patient today. If you're

1244
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:32,720
You have to be patient today. If you're
 

1245
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,230
You have to be patient today. If you're
going to be a buyer, you've either got

1246
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,240
going to be a buyer, you've either got
 

1247
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,230
going to be a buyer, you've either got
to join when the Momo's there or wait

1248
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,240
to join when the Momo's there or wait
 

1249
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,870
to join when the Momo's there or wait
for it to drift lower into the zone.

1250
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:38,880
for it to drift lower into the zone.
 

1251
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,230
for it to drift lower into the zone.
What I don't want to do is be buying the

1252
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:40,240
What I don't want to do is be buying the
 

1253
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,430
What I don't want to do is be buying the
high of day, but I don't want to miss

1254
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:41,440
high of day, but I don't want to miss
 

1255
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,510
high of day, but I don't want to miss
the move either. So, it's a tricky one.

1256
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:43,520
the move either. So, it's a tricky one.
 

1257
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,870
the move either. So, it's a tricky one.
You can see value area low keeps

1258
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:44,880
You can see value area low keeps
 

1259
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,230
You can see value area low keeps
developing here and we're not finding

1260
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,240
developing here and we're not finding
 

1261
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,029
developing here and we're not finding
acceptance lower right now. Remember, we

1262
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:49,039
acceptance lower right now. Remember, we
 

1263
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,350
acceptance lower right now. Remember, we
are moving value higher from yesterday.

1264
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:51,360
are moving value higher from yesterday.
 

1265
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,029
are moving value higher from yesterday.
We're back inside the current week's

1266
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:53,039
We're back inside the current week's
 

1267
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,590
We're back inside the current week's
value and we talked about there's 70s

1268
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:55,600
value and we talked about there's 70s
 

1269
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,110
value and we talked about there's 70s
pre-market

1270
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,120
pre-market
 

1271
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,750
pre-market
or 70s down to 30s as a key level based

1272
00:30:59,750 --> 00:30:59,760
or 70s down to 30s as a key level based
 

1273
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,310
or 70s down to 30s as a key level based
on current weekly developing value.

1274
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:06,320

 

1275
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,669

They're going to have another go here by

1276
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:07,679
They're going to have another go here by
 

1277
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,350
They're going to have another go here by
the looks of it. Value area high on the

1278
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:09,360
the looks of it. Value area high on the
 

1279
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,710
the looks of it. Value area high on the
session is 900. So the question is can

1280
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:12,720
session is 900. So the question is can
 

1281
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,990
session is 900. So the question is can
they get back above that?

1282
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,000

 

1283
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,070

Yeah, New York view up is set to 930.

1284
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,080
Yeah, New York view up is set to 930.
 

1285
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,789
Yeah, New York view up is set to 930.
Set to the 930 open. We're right at this

1286
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:22,799
Set to the 930 open. We're right at this
 

1287
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,470
Set to the 930 open. We're right at this
level at 90s. Can we find acceptance

1288
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:24,480
level at 90s. Can we find acceptance
 

1289
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,990
level at 90s. Can we find acceptance
through here now and start driving?

1290
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,000
through here now and start driving?
 

1291
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,669
through here now and start driving?
Look, I'm interested in this, but need

1292
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:27,679
Look, I'm interested in this, but need
 

1293
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,190
Look, I'm interested in this, but need
to be very careful. We cannot get

1294
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,200
to be very careful. We cannot get
 

1295
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,669
to be very careful. We cannot get
through these 900s yet. If we start

1296
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:31,679
through these 900s yet. If we start
 

1297
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,430
through these 900s yet. If we start
getting through 900s, we can look at the

1298
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:33,440
getting through 900s, we can look at the
 

1299
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,830
getting through 900s, we can look at the
New York Open 920s. And if we get

1300
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:35,840
New York Open 920s. And if we get
 

1301
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,509
New York Open 920s. And if we get
through that, we can look at a really

1302
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:37,519
through that, we can look at a really
 

1303
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,269
through that, we can look at a really
nice squeeze out.

1304
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:41,279

 

1305
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,470

So, we are now basing above that 80s,

1306
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:44,480
So, we are now basing above that 80s,
 

1307
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,470
So, we are now basing above that 80s,
sorry, the 90s, which is good. We need

1308
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:46,480
sorry, the 90s, which is good. We need
 

1309
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,110
sorry, the 90s, which is good. We need
to get back through the 900s through

1310
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:49,120
to get back through the 900s through
 

1311
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,190
to get back through the 900s through
value area high which is 9006 and find

1312
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:51,200
value area high which is 9006 and find
 

1313
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,509
value area high which is 9006 and find
acceptance over 24. So looking long here

1314
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:53,519
acceptance over 24. So looking long here
 

1315
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,430
acceptance over 24. So looking long here
to see if we can get a continuation

1316
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:55,440
to see if we can get a continuation
 

1317
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,990
to see if we can get a continuation
squeeze higher here. You need to be

1318
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,000
squeeze higher here. You need to be
 

1319
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,750
squeeze higher here. You need to be
aggressive with stops today because this

1320
00:31:59,750 --> 00:31:59,760
aggressive with stops today because this
 

1321
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:07,269
aggressive with stops today because this
market is not showing momentum yet.

1322
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:07,279

 

1323
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,190

Here we go. Beautiful. There's the New

1324
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,200
Here we go. Beautiful. There's the New
 

1325
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,630
Here we go. Beautiful. There's the New
York open. Let's see if we can really

1326
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:10,640
York open. Let's see if we can really
 

1327
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,430
York open. Let's see if we can really
start squeezing now.

1328
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:13,440
start squeezing now.
 

1329
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,029
start squeezing now.
Lovely.

1330
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:17,039

 

1331
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,509

So through value into the New York open

1332
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:19,519
So through value into the New York open
 

1333
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,549
So through value into the New York open
this level here we need to find

1334
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:20,559
this level here we need to find
 

1335
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,310
this level here we need to find
acceptance above this now we find

1336
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,320
acceptance above this now we find
 

1337
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,070
acceptance above this now we find
acceptance above this New York open it

1338
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,080
acceptance above this New York open it
 

1339
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,509
acceptance above this New York open it
means all the cash players will be

1340
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:25,519
means all the cash players will be
 

1341
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,590
means all the cash players will be
positive and we can look for this drive

1342
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:27,600
positive and we can look for this drive
 

1343
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,590
positive and we can look for this drive
all right so we're long from here we're

1344
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:29,600
all right so we're long from here we're
 

1345
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,750
all right so we're long from here we're
looking for this now for ads

1346
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:33,760

 

1347
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,269

so the dip today was 70s to 30s we

1348
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:37,279
so the dip today was 70s to 30s we
 

1349
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,269
so the dip today was 70s to 30s we
talked about pre-market really good his

1350
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:39,279
talked about pre-market really good his
 

1351
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,029
talked about pre-market really good his
previous week close so you can trim some

1352
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:41,039
previous week close so you can trim some
 

1353
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,870
previous week close so you can trim some
into here you can reload if this next

1354
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:42,880
into here you can reload if this next
 

1355
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:49,430
into here you can reload if this next
dip holds

1356
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:49,440

 

1357
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,669

Market catching a big mad mag starting

1358
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:51,679
Market catching a big mad mag starting
 

1359
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,149
Market catching a big mad mag starting
to go green which is good. We can hold

1360
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:54,159
to go green which is good. We can hold
 

1361
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,990
to go green which is good. We can hold
above New York open it would be good but

1362
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,000
above New York open it would be good but
 

1363
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,590
above New York open it would be good but
definitely above 910s would be ideal.

1364
00:32:59,590 --> 00:32:59,600
definitely above 910s would be ideal.
 

1365
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,669
definitely above 910s would be ideal.
Above 910s would be ideal here.

1366
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:03,679
Above 910s would be ideal here.
 

1367
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,230
Above 910s would be ideal here.
Really nice. All right let's see if we

1368
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:06,240
Really nice. All right let's see if we
 

1369
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,310
Really nice. All right let's see if we
can start squeezing out here. Really

1370
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:08,320
can start squeezing out here. Really
 

1371
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,389
can start squeezing out here. Really
good. Come on market. Let's do it. Let's

1372
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:10,399
good. Come on market. Let's do it. Let's
 

1373
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,310
good. Come on market. Let's do it. Let's
be nasty. Let's trap all these shorts.

1374
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:12,320
be nasty. Let's trap all these shorts.
 

1375
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,630
be nasty. Let's trap all these shorts.
Really good. Let's go, baby. All right.

1376
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:14,640
Really good. Let's go, baby. All right.
 

1377
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,230
Really good. Let's go, baby. All right.
Looking for a squeeze out through high

1378
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:16,240
Looking for a squeeze out through high
 

1379
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,110
Looking for a squeeze out through high
of day. And let's see if we can hold on

1380
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,120
of day. And let's see if we can hold on
 

1381
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,950
of day. And let's see if we can hold on
to this now. Get through this gray box

1382
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:20,960
to this now. Get through this gray box
 

1383
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,149
to this now. Get through this gray box
and see if we can get all the way up

1384
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:22,159
and see if we can get all the way up
 

1385
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,830
and see if we can get all the way up
into here. That would be the best

1386
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:23,840
into here. That would be the best
 

1387
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,350
into here. That would be the best
scenario. But we're going to trim on the

1388
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:25,360
scenario. But we're going to trim on the
 

1389
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,590
scenario. But we're going to trim on the
way and pay ourselves.

1390
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:27,600
way and pay ourselves.
 

1391
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,870
way and pay ourselves.
So, if you go back to earlier this

1392
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:28,880
So, if you go back to earlier this
 

1393
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,789
So, if you go back to earlier this
morning, I was talking about the 70s

1394
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:30,799
morning, I was talking about the 70s
 

1395
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,070
morning, I was talking about the 70s
to30s dip. The 70s to30s dip. That was

1396
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,080
to30s dip. The 70s to30s dip. That was
 

1397
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,470
to30s dip. The 70s to30s dip. That was
all because of the current week value.

1398
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:38,480
all because of the current week value.
 

1399
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,549
all because of the current week value.
All right, current week value. We had a

1400
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:40,559
All right, current week value. We had a
 

1401
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,630
All right, current week value. We had a
big node here and we're holding. So,

1402
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:42,640
big node here and we're holding. So,
 

1403
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,310
big node here and we're holding. So,
trimming some into this. Please do not

1404
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:44,320
trimming some into this. Please do not
 

1405
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,990
trimming some into this. Please do not
be greedy because if they want to fail

1406
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,000
be greedy because if they want to fail
 

1407
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,590
be greedy because if they want to fail
this, they will

1408
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:49,600

 

1409
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,909

beautiful.

1410
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:53,919

 

1411
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,909

That delta at 90 was key, right? Once we

1412
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:55,919
That delta at 90 was key, right? Once we
 

1413
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,830
That delta at 90 was key, right? Once we
got back above the 90s, we I needed two

1414
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:57,840
got back above the 90s, we I needed two
 

1415
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,630
got back above the 90s, we I needed two
attempts there, but we got it. And

1416
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:00,640
attempts there, but we got it. And
 

1417
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,870
attempts there, but we got it. And
that's where we've now moved uh point of

1418
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:02,880
that's where we've now moved uh point of
 

1419
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,830
that's where we've now moved uh point of
control now is sort of 87 90s and 87 on

1420
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:05,840
control now is sort of 87 90s and 87 on
 

1421
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,109
control now is sort of 87 90s and 87 on
the day. So, nice decent move there. Not

1422
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:09,119
the day. So, nice decent move there. Not
 

1423
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,190
the day. So, nice decent move there. Not
too bad.

1424
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,200
too bad.
 

1425
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,190
too bad.
50 60 points. We'll take it. And we're

1426
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,200
50 60 points. We'll take it. And we're
 

1427
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:20,389
50 60 points. We'll take it. And we're
only what 15 minutes into the day.

1428
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:20,399

 

1429
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,950

If we can't hold PC, I'm not willing to

1430
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:22,960
If we can't hold PC, I'm not willing to
 

1431
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,750
If we can't hold PC, I'm not willing to
uh rebid on it.

1432
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:25,760
uh rebid on it.
 

1433
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,909
uh rebid on it.
So, my PC is different to this what

1434
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:27,919
So, my PC is different to this what
 

1435
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:30,550
So, my PC is different to this what
you're looking right here. Uh this level

1436
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:30,560
you're looking right here. Uh this level
 

1437
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,069
you're looking right here. Uh this level
here. We need to hold this. We need to

1438
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:32,079
here. We need to hold this. We need to
 

1439
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,149
here. We need to hold this. We need to
hold this low volume node and this. If

1440
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:34,159
hold this low volume node and this. If
 

1441
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,669
hold this low volume node and this. If
it can't hold this, I'm not interested

1442
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:35,679
it can't hold this, I'm not interested
 

1443
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,430
it can't hold this, I'm not interested
in longs. I'll let it come back down to

1444
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:37,440
in longs. I'll let it come back down to
 

1445
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,629
in longs. I'll let it come back down to
here. If we can hold that, I'll consider

1446
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:40,639
here. If we can hold that, I'll consider
 

1447
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,710
here. If we can hold that, I'll consider
rebidding here. Looking for this.

1448
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:44,720
rebidding here. Looking for this.
 

1449
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,069
rebidding here. Looking for this.
Just be careful because we're in the

1450
00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:46,079
Just be careful because we're in the
 

1451
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,950
Just be careful because we're in the
middle of that 15minute orb.

1452
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:48,960
middle of that 15minute orb.
 

1453
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,470
middle of that 15minute orb.
Yeah, lots of you grabbing it with me.

two two uh accounts.

1462
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,000

 

1463
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,109

right? Starting to build on that PC,

1464
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:21,119
right? Starting to build on that PC,
 

1465
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,150
right? Starting to build on that PC,
the 10. Would like to see us get back

1466
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,160
the 10. Would like to see us get back
 

1467
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:30,550
the 10. Would like to see us get back
above that New York open.

1468
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:30,560

 

1469
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,109

No worries, guys. Yeah, nice work. Nice

No worries, guys. Yeah, nice work. Nice
work. That all came from planning at

1472
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:34,400
work. That all came from planning at
 

1473
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,230
work. That all came from planning at
pre-market, right? That came from the

1474
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,240
pre-market, right? That came from the
 

1475
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,829
pre-market, right? That came from the
plan of pre-market understanding that

1476
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:37,839
plan of pre-market understanding that
 

1477
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,710
plan of pre-market understanding that
this was potentially an area to buy in

1478
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:40,720
this was potentially an area to buy in
 

1479
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,390
this was potentially an area to buy in
if we're going to be very aggressive.

1480
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:42,400
if we're going to be very aggressive.
 

1481
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,150
if we're going to be very aggressive.
All right. So, there's the leg down.

1482
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,160
All right. So, there's the leg down.
 

1483
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,150
All right. So, there's the leg down.
There's the pullback. There's the

1484
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,160
There's the pullback. There's the
 

1485
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,310
There's the pullback. There's the
squeeze. Can this pull back and hold now

1486
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:48,320
squeeze. Can this pull back and hold now
 

1487
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,630
squeeze. Can this pull back and hold now
for acceptance higher? We don't know,

1488
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:50,640
for acceptance higher? We don't know,
 

1489
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,150
for acceptance higher? We don't know,
but we positioned long for it. We don't

1490
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:54,160
but we positioned long for it. We don't
 

1491
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,510
but we positioned long for it. We don't
know what the market's going to do. In

1492
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:55,520
know what the market's going to do. In
 

1493
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,349
know what the market's going to do. In
truth, we can position for it. We don't

1494
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:57,359
truth, we can position for it. We don't
 

1495
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,550
truth, we can position for it. We don't
know what it's going to do. We have to

1496
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:58,560
know what it's going to do. We have to
 

1497
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,670
know what it's going to do. We have to
put risk on if we're going to make

1498
00:35:59,670 --> 00:35:59,680
put risk on if we're going to make
 

1499
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,910
put risk on if we're going to make
money.

1500
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:01,920
money.
 

1501
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,310
money.
If we lose this though,

1502
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:04,320
If we lose this though,
 

1503
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,910
If we lose this though,
let me do it. If we lose this though,

1504
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:05,920
let me do it. If we lose this though,
 

1505
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,550
let me do it. If we lose this though,
then I'm re re-entering down here or I'm

1506
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:08,560
then I'm re re-entering down here or I'm
 

1507
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,230
then I'm re re-entering down here or I'm
interested in re-entering down there, I

1508
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,240
interested in re-entering down there, I
 

1509
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,390
interested in re-entering down there, I
should say.

1510
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:14,400

 

1511
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,910

Mad really doesn't know what it wants to

1512
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:15,920
Mad really doesn't know what it wants to
 

1513
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,310
Mad really doesn't know what it wants to
do. It's the one thing. Nvidia now

1514
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:18,320
do. It's the one thing. Nvidia now
 

1515
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,470
do. It's the one thing. Nvidia now
through the 88, 3% up on the day. So,

1516
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:20,480
through the 88, 3% up on the day. So,
 

1517
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,550
through the 88, 3% up on the day. So,
Nvidia having a really good drive. Chips

1518
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:22,560
Nvidia having a really good drive. Chips
 

1519
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,670
Nvidia having a really good drive. Chips
look good. AMD 5% up on the day. Oracle

1520
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:25,680
look good. AMD 5% up on the day. Oracle
 

1521
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,910
look good. AMD 5% up on the day. Oracle
lagging behind. That has been the cheap

1522
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:27,920
lagging behind. That has been the cheap
 

1523
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,829
lagging behind. That has been the cheap
the weakest one of the bunch for a

1524
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:29,839
the weakest one of the bunch for a
 

1525
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,230
the weakest one of the bunch for a
while. people worried about debt issues

1526
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,240
while. people worried about debt issues
 

1527
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:40,870
while. people worried about debt issues
there.

1528
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:40,880

 

1529
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,710

Be nice if this market could just make a

1530
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:42,720
Be nice if this market could just make a
 

1531
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,150
Be nice if this market could just make a
decision. When I look at that daily, I

1532
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:44,160
decision. When I look at that daily, I
 

1533
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,230
decision. When I look at that daily, I
just think it looks

1534
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:46,240
just think it looks
 

1535
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,950
just think it looks
absolutely awful, doesn't it? Not

1536
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:48,960
absolutely awful, doesn't it? Not
 

1537
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,630
absolutely awful, doesn't it? Not
necessarily today's chart, but just the

1538
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:50,640
necessarily today's chart, but just the
 

1539
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,190
necessarily today's chart, but just the
last I mean, I'd say even say all the

1540
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,200
last I mean, I'd say even say all the
 

1541
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,710
last I mean, I'd say even say all the
way back to the early December, the last

1542
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:54,720
way back to the early December, the last
 

1543
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,670
way back to the early December, the last
two months look terrible. They look

1544
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:57,680
two months look terrible. They look
 

1545
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,750
two months look terrible. They look
terrible.

1546
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:03,760

 

1547
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,670

Okay, back to this New York open. Can

1548
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:05,680
Okay, back to this New York open. Can
 

1549
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,990
Okay, back to this New York open. Can
they base above New York open, above

1550
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,000
they base above New York open, above
 

1551
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,150
they base above New York open, above
value high, resqueeze out, and really

1552
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:10,160
value high, resqueeze out, and really
 

1553
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,750
value high, resqueeze out, and really
start to go for the day? Can we get

1554
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:11,760
start to go for the day? Can we get
 

1555
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,750
start to go for the day? Can we get
above all this and start to go for the

1556
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:13,760
above all this and start to go for the
 

1557
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,950
above all this and start to go for the
day

1558
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:20,960

 

1559
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,870

moment? It's struggling.

1560
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:24,880
moment? It's struggling.
 

1561
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,790
moment? It's struggling.
I would not be holding on to longs if we

1562
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:26,800
I would not be holding on to longs if we
 

1563
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,670
I would not be holding on to longs if we
lose 90s here. 890 is that sort of delta

1564
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:29,680
lose 90s here. 890 is that sort of delta
 

1565
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,390
lose 90s here. 890 is that sort of delta
area. You do not want to lose that area.

1566
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:34,400

 

1567
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,230

You lose that area probably means we're

1568
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:36,240
You lose that area probably means we're
 

1569
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,829
You lose that area probably means we're
going to take out low day.

1570
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:39,839
going to take out low day.
 

1571
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:48,470
going to take out low day.
Here's the 90s test.

1572
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:48,480

 

1573
00:37:48,480 --> 00:38:00,790

QQQ back to V1. Yes. Above it V1.

1574
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:00,800

 

1575
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,310

these 900s

1576
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,320

 

1577
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,910

apes asleep here this morning.

1578
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:07,920
apes asleep here this morning.
 

1579
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,150
apes asleep here this morning.
PC just above at 10. It's protecting

1580
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,160
PC just above at 10. It's protecting
 

1581
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,150
PC just above at 10. It's protecting
that now. We can't get back above that.

1582
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:12,160
that now. We can't get back above that.
 

1583
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,150
that now. We can't get back above that.
So, not really interested in this dip

1584
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,160
So, not really interested in this dip
 

1585
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:20,150
So, not really interested in this dip
there at the moment.

1586
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,160

 

1587
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,030

It's that sort of 90s test again.

1588
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,040

 

1589
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,230

That doesn't look good. I don't think

1590
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:26,240
That doesn't look good. I don't think
 

1591
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,430
That doesn't look good. I don't think
I'm going to touch this for a bit and

1592
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:27,440
I'm going to touch this for a bit and
 

1593
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,950
I'm going to touch this for a bit and
just let this do whatever it is it wants

1594
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:28,960
just let this do whatever it is it wants
 

1595
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,310
just let this do whatever it is it wants
to do. Looks nasty.

1596
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:32,320
to do. Looks nasty.
 

1597
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:40,230
to do. Looks nasty.
Looks nasty right now.

1598
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:40,240

 

1599
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:49,030

Maybe they come down for these 830s,

1600
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,040

 

1601
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,270

870s.

1602
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:53,280

 

1603
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,310

Opening range low is 50s 30s as an area

1604
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:56,320
Opening range low is 50s 30s as an area
 

1605
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,310
Opening range low is 50s 30s as an area
of interest. 24-hour VWAP is all the way

1606
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:58,320
of interest. 24-hour VWAP is all the way
 

1607
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,550
of interest. 24-hour VWAP is all the way
down at 800s.

1608
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:02,560

 

1609
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,430

What do you want to do market makers

1610
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:07,440

 

1611
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:15,349

trying to find a bid at 1560s.

1612
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:15,359

 

1613
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,109

Here we go. So, moving lower. So,

1614
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:17,119
Here we go. So, moving lower. So,
 

1615
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,470
Here we go. So, moving lower. So,
leaving this alone like we talked about

1616
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:18,480
leaving this alone like we talked about
 

1617
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,109
leaving this alone like we talked about
once it lost 90s. I was not interested

1618
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:21,119
once it lost 90s. I was not interested
 

1619
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,150
once it lost 90s. I was not interested
in holding a a thing in in this. No

1620
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:24,160
in holding a a thing in in this. No
 

1621
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,430
in holding a a thing in in this. No
interest. We can have a think about how

1622
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:27,440
interest. We can have a think about how
 

1623
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,670
interest. We can have a think about how
we act down here now into previous week

1624
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:29,680
we act down here now into previous week
 

1625
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,950
we act down here now into previous week
value area high.

1626
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:34,960

 

1627
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,390

But we wouldn't want to lose that. If we

1628
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:36,400
But we wouldn't want to lose that. If we
 

1629
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,670
But we wouldn't want to lose that. If we
lose that, I'd say there's a good chance

1630
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:37,680
lose that, I'd say there's a good chance
 

1631
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,390
lose that, I'd say there's a good chance
we trade 740s.

1632
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:40,400
we trade 740s.
 

1633
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,670
we trade 740s.
So, if we lose that, we're probably

1634
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:41,680
So, if we lose that, we're probably
 

1635
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,750
So, if we lose that, we're probably
going to trade 740s. So, don't want to

1636
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:43,760
going to trade 740s. So, don't want to
 

1637
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,990
going to trade 740s. So, don't want to
just bid against this, especially if the

1638
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,000
just bid against this, especially if the
 

1639
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,349
just bid against this, especially if the
market's going to go back into a

1640
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:47,359
market's going to go back into a
 

1641
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,150
market's going to go back into a
rotation again like it has. I don't know

1642
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,160
rotation again like it has. I don't know
 

1643
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,589
rotation again like it has. I don't know
the last week or so that you guys have

1644
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:51,599
the last week or so that you guys have
 

1645
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:58,790
the last week or so that you guys have
been trading it.

1646
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:58,800

 

1647
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,750

Mag starting to not look so pretty here.

00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:01,760
Mag starting to not look so pretty here.
 

1649
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,069
Mag starting to not look so pretty here.

They cannot make up what they want to do

They cannot make up what they want to do
 

1657
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,790
They cannot make up what they want to do
with this market as the rotation just

The truth is we have not been able to

The truth is we have not been able to

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,030
The truth is we have not been able to
print above a key level since

print above a key level since
 

1665

November 5th

November 5th
 

1667

November 5th

key level since
well December 17th. We've been stuck

1672
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,000
well December 17th. We've been stuck
 

1673
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,790
well December 17th. We've been stuck
really since then. Just stuck sideways.

really since then. Just stuck sideways.

I'd argue even the way all the way back

I'd argue even the way all the way back
 

1677
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,950
I'd argue even the way all the way back
to sort of November 25th.

Will be a range trader paradise right

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,630
Will be a range trader paradise right
now.

1685
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,550

There's no bookmap settings, guys. I

1686
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:56,560
There's no bookmap settings, guys. I
 

1687
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,710
There's no bookmap settings, guys. I
don't understand this. I say it every

1688
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:58,720
don't understand this. I say it every
 

1689
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,430
don't understand this. I say it every
day. Just use Why do you need a setting

1690
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:01,440
day. Just use Why do you need a setting
 

1691
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,750
day. Just use Why do you need a setting
on bookmap? Bookmap's showing you what's

1692
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:03,760
on bookmap? Bookmap's showing you what's
 

1693
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,349
on bookmap? Bookmap's showing you what's
happening inside the candles. You don't

1694
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:05,359
happening inside the candles. You don't
 

1695
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,950
happening inside the candles. You don't
need to change anything really. You

1696
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:06,960
need to change anything really. You
 

1697
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,710
need to change anything really. You
really don't. Only thing I change on

1698
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:08,720
really don't. Only thing I change on
 

1699
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:25,829
really don't. Only thing I change on
bookmap is my DOM.

1701
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,829

Big buyer keeps stepping in here and if

Big buyer keeps stepping in here and if

he doesn't get his way, he's going to
 

1705
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,670
he doesn't get his way, he's going to
become the liquidity to move lower. So,

1706
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:31,680
become the liquidity to move lower. So,
 

1707
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,589
become the liquidity to move lower. So,
let's see. Back inside point of control

1708
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:33,599
let's see. Back inside point of control
 

1709
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,910
let's see. Back inside point of control
now. Back inside value. I'm going to

1710
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:35,920
now. Back inside value. I'm going to
 

1711
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,790
now. Back inside value. I'm going to
test these 890s again. 880s, 890s maybe.

1712
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:38,800
test these 890s again. 880s, 890s maybe.
 

1713
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,150
test these 890s again. 880s, 890s maybe.
That was the pivot. Remember where I

1714
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,160
That was the pivot. Remember where I
 

1715
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,390
That was the pivot. Remember where I
said I don't want to be long if we start

1716
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:42,400
said I don't want to be long if we start
 

1717
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,790
said I don't want to be long if we start
breaking that. They've held this dip in

1718
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:44,800
breaking that. They've held this dip in
 

1719
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,790
breaking that. They've held this dip in
front of pre previous week value area

1720
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:46,800
front of pre previous week value area
 

1721
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,630
front of pre previous week value area
high right now. It's it just looks a bit

1722
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:48,640
high right now. It's it just looks a bit
 

1723
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:57,349
high right now. It's it just looks a bit
ugly to me if I'm honest with you.

1724
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:57,359

 

1725
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,150

Testing this 80 and 90 we talked about.

1726
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,160
Testing this 80 and 90 we talked about.
 

1727
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,430
Testing this 80 and 90 we talked about.
That's where we broke down from.

1728
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:03,440
That's where we broke down from.
 

1729
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,190
That's where we broke down from.
We're midpoint of the range. It's not

1730
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:05,200
We're midpoint of the range. It's not
 

1731
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,910
We're midpoint of the range. It's not
very pretty. So, here's the ' 90s test.

1732
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:07,920
very pretty. So, here's the ' 90s test.
 

1733
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,510
very pretty. So, here's the ' 90s test.
This is where we broke down from. Do

1734
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:09,520
This is where we broke down from. Do
 

1735
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,790
This is where we broke down from. Do
they resell this again?

1736
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:14,800

 

1737
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,390

If not, if they cause a squeeze, we're

1738
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:16,400
If not, if they cause a squeeze, we're
 

1739
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,190
If not, if they cause a squeeze, we're
going to test 900s, 915s, and New York

1740
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,200
going to test 900s, 915s, and New York
 

1741
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,870
going to test 900s, 915s, and New York
open. They're still trying to sell these

1742
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:20,880
open. They're still trying to sell these
 

1743
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:29,910
open. They're still trying to sell these
uh 90s like we talked about.

1744
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:29,920

 

1745
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,349

Testing these 90s.

1746
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:33,359
Testing these 90s.
 

1747
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,030
Testing these 90s.
I don't really fancy the long in this

1748
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,040
I don't really fancy the long in this
 

1749
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,790
I don't really fancy the long in this
now. Second attempt at this. This is the

1750
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:36,800
now. Second attempt at this. This is the
 

1751
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,030
now. Second attempt at this. This is the
same trade we took earlier. I think I'm

1752
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:39,040
same trade we took earlier. I think I'm
 

1753
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,710
same trade we took earlier. I think I'm
actually going to wait.

1754
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:42,720

 

1755
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,230

Do not want to get caught in this. So,

1756
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:44,240
Do not want to get caught in this. So,
 

1757
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,589
Do not want to get caught in this. So,
we've just hit that next shelf, the

1758
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:45,599
we've just hit that next shelf, the
 

1759
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:55,349
we've just hit that next shelf, the
900s.

1760
00:42:55,349 --> 00:42:55,359

 

1761
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,470

Next stop is 25s again. They're trying.

1762
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:58,480
Next stop is 25s again. They're trying.
 

1763
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,109
Next stop is 25s again. They're trying.
They're trying to lift it again. Max's

1764
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:01,119
They're trying to lift it again. Max's
 

1765
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,550
They're trying to lift it again. Max's
trying to rotate again. And Apple's

1766
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:02,560
trying to rotate again. And Apple's
 

1767
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,150
trying to rotate again. And Apple's
trying to go red to green. Oh my god.

1768
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:04,160
trying to go red to green. Oh my god.
 

1769
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,950
trying to go red to green. Oh my god.
What are you doing, market makers?

1770
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:06,960
What are you doing, market makers?
 

1771
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,589
What are you doing, market makers?
Let's see.

1772
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:09,599
Let's see.
 

1773
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,670
Let's see.
I actually want to join if we squeeze in

1774
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:11,680
I actually want to join if we squeeze in
 

1775
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,670
I actually want to join if we squeeze in
base. I don't want to play midpoint of

1776
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:13,680
base. I don't want to play midpoint of
 

1777
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,510
base. I don't want to play midpoint of
range. Let's see if we can squeeze in

1778
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:15,520
range. Let's see if we can squeeze in
 

1779
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,910
range. Let's see if we can squeeze in
base. I'm really interested.

1780
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:21,920

 

1781
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,589

Big buyer stepping in here. Back to this

1782
00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:23,599
Big buyer stepping in here. Back to this
 

1783
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,990
Big buyer stepping in here. Back to this
New York open now.

1784
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:26,000
New York open now.
 

1785
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,990
New York open now.
25's next level. That's the New York

1786
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:28,000
25's next level. That's the New York
 

1787
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,589
25's next level. That's the New York
open. Can we get over that and value

1788
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:29,599
open. Can we get over that and value
 

1789
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,109
open. Can we get over that and value
area higher? And can we push value on

1790
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:31,119
area higher? And can we push value on
 

1791
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,430
area higher? And can we push value on
the day higher?

1792
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:35,440

 

1793
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,109

I don't know, folks. All I know is that

1794
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:37,119
I don't know, folks. All I know is that
 

1795
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,030
I don't know, folks. All I know is that
this is messy.

1796
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:41,040

 

1797
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:57,910

This is messy.

1798
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:57,920

 

1799
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,990

Hands off mouse for me. You can see how

1800
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,000
Hands off mouse for me. You can see how
 

1801
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,950
Hands off mouse for me. You can see how
the profile's developing now.

1802
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:02,960
the profile's developing now.
 

1803
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,470
the profile's developing now.
Going to remove this. I know this is

1804
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:04,480
Going to remove this. I know this is
 

1805
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,470
Going to remove this. I know this is
here, but it's just taking clogging up a

1806
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:06,480
here, but it's just taking clogging up a
 

1807
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,069
here, but it's just taking clogging up a
bit too much. So, getting stuck at this

1808
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:08,079
bit too much. So, getting stuck at this
 

1809
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,390
bit too much. So, getting stuck at this
node again.

1810
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:10,400
node again.
 

1811
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,230
node again.
So, these 90s to 900s, 910s is the

1812
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:14,240
So, these 90s to 900s, 910s is the
 

1813
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,270
So, these 90s to 900s, 910s is the
rotation right now. Buyers really, they

1814
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:17,280
rotation right now. Buyers really, they
 

1815
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,550
rotation right now. Buyers really, they
want to hold this dip. They should have

1816
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:18,560
want to hold this dip. They should have
 

1817
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,910
want to hold this dip. They should have
held it last time. This is what I was

1818
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:19,920
held it last time. This is what I was
 

1819
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,349
held it last time. This is what I was
talking about. They have to hold this

1820
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:21,359
talking about. They have to hold this
 

1821
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,750
talking about. They have to hold this
level here. Why can't you draw it on me?

1822
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:23,760
level here. Why can't you draw it on me?
 

1823
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,230
level here. Why can't you draw it on me?
You have to hold this here, right? For

1824
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:26,240
You have to hold this here, right? For
 

1825
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,069
You have to hold this here, right? For
this. If they lose this, we come lower

1826
00:44:28,069 --> 00:44:28,079
this. If they lose this, we come lower
 

1827
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,829
this. If they lose this, we come lower
again. Right. This is what we're

1828
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:29,839
again. Right. This is what we're
 

1829
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,990
again. Right. This is what we're
building. You're looking to do to grab

1830
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:32,000
building. You're looking to do to grab
 

1831
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,710
building. You're looking to do to grab
that. If if they can find acceptance and

1832
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:34,720
that. If if they can find acceptance and
 

1833
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,190
that. If if they can find acceptance and
hold this and this, then everyone in

1834
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:37,200
hold this and this, then everyone in
 

1835
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,950
hold this and this, then everyone in
here will get caught. If we lose this

1836
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:38,960
here will get caught. If we lose this
 

1837
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,790
here will get caught. If we lose this
and we keep digging down, this is where

1838
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:40,800
and we keep digging down, this is where
 

1839
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,309
and we keep digging down, this is where
they're going to want to test. So, it's

1840
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:42,319
they're going to want to test. So, it's
 

1841
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:43,910
they're going to want to test. So, it's
you got to be like, see money, take

1842
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:43,920
you got to be like, see money, take
 

1843
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,750
you got to be like, see money, take
money. Look at the EMAs. Look at VWAP.

1844
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:45,760
money. Look at the EMAs. Look at VWAP.
 

1845
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,589
money. Look at the EMAs. Look at VWAP.
Everything's flattening out. It's not a

1846
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:47,599
Everything's flattening out. It's not a
 

1847
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,030
Everything's flattening out. It's not a
very pretty day right now. We've had

1848
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:49,040
very pretty day right now. We've had
 

1849
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,630
very pretty day right now. We've had
some nice trades this morning. I think

1850
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:50,640
some nice trades this morning. I think
 

1851
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,190
some nice trades this morning. I think
two two attempts it took. Made some good

1852
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:53,200
two two attempts it took. Made some good
 

1853
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,230
two two attempts it took. Made some good
money. Don't be forcing it. We're still

1854
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:56,240
money. Don't be forcing it. We're still
 

1855
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,550
money. Don't be forcing it. We're still
very early in the day. New hour coming

1856
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:58,560
very early in the day. New hour coming
 

1857
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,109
very early in the day. New hour coming
up in five minutes time. New hour, new 4

1858
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:01,119
up in five minutes time. New hour, new 4
 

1859
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,550
up in five minutes time. New hour, new 4
hour. And we can think about what

1860
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:02,560
hour. And we can think about what
 

1861
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:15,670
hour. And we can think about what
happens next once we get that maybe

1862
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:15,680

 

1863
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,230

back to the 90s. Back to this node

1864
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:18,240
back to the 90s. Back to this node
 

1865
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,630
back to the 90s. Back to this node
83ish.

1866
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:20,640
83ish.
 

1867
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,910
83ish.
So 90 down to 80s is where bulls need to

1868
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:23,920
So 90 down to 80s is where bulls need to
 

1869
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,430
So 90 down to 80s is where bulls need to
step in. And if they fail to step in in

1870
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:25,440
step in. And if they fail to step in in
 

1871
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,470
step in. And if they fail to step in in
here, then I think they're going to be

1872
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:26,480
here, then I think they're going to be
 

1873
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:34,390
here, then I think they're going to be
in trouble again

1874
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:34,400

 

1875
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,230

right onto that node again we just

1876
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:36,240
right onto that node again we just
 

1877
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,750
right onto that node again we just
talked about. This is where they have to

1878
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:37,760
talked about. This is where they have to
 

1879
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,910
talked about. This is where they have to
step in. They don't do that. I think

1880
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:39,920
step in. They don't do that. I think
 

1881
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:46,470
step in. They don't do that. I think
there's more of flashing them up.

1882
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:46,480

 

1883
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,069

Grabbing a coffee. Yeah, I don't blame

1884
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:48,079
Grabbing a coffee. Yeah, I don't blame
 

1885
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,150
Grabbing a coffee. Yeah, I don't blame
you.

1886
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:50,160
you.
 

1887
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,790
you.
3 minutes until the new H4.

1888
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:52,800
3 minutes until the new H4.
 

1889
00:45:52,800 --> 00:46:05,349
3 minutes until the new H4.
Actually more like two minutes now.

1890
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:05,359

 

1891
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,109

So they're trying to bid here like we

1892
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:07,119
So they're trying to bid here like we
 

1893
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,710
So they're trying to bid here like we
just talked about. Point of control now

1894
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:08,720
just talked about. Point of control now
 

1895
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,230
just talked about. Point of control now
here though. So it's fair value on the

1896
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:10,240
here though. So it's fair value on the
 

1897
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,390
here though. So it's fair value on the
session. We've got a tight range right

1898
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:12,400
session. We've got a tight range right
 

1899
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,470
session. We've got a tight range right
now guys. We've got 109 point range this

1900
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:14,480
now guys. We've got 109 point range this
 

1901
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,030
now guys. We've got 109 point range this
morning in the New York session and I'd

1902
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,040
morning in the New York session and I'd
 

1903
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,950
morning in the New York session and I'd
say most of that range has been

1904
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:18,960
say most of that range has been
 

1905
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,710
say most of that range has been
happening around where we are. So, we're

1906
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:20,720
happening around where we are. So, we're
 

1907
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,950
happening around where we are. So, we're
not finding

1908
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:24,960

 

1909
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,109

too much acceptance

1910
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:27,119
too much acceptance
 

1911
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,870
too much acceptance
uh lower and we're not driving higher.

1912
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:28,880
uh lower and we're not driving higher.
 

1913
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,550
uh lower and we're not driving higher.
We're just building out volume right

1914
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:30,560
We're just building out volume right
 

1915
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,390
We're just building out volume right
now.

1916
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:32,400
now.
 

1917
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,990
now.
If we think about the New York session,

1918
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:36,000
If we think about the New York session,
 

1919
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,190
If we think about the New York session,
it's just it's just standard Dshape,

1920
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:39,200
it's just it's just standard Dshape,
 

1921
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,150
it's just it's just standard Dshape,
right? D-shaped profile range. So far,

1922
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:42,160
right? D-shaped profile range. So far,
 

1923
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,270
right? D-shaped profile range. So far,
until we find acceptance below or above,

1924
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:45,280
until we find acceptance below or above,
 

1925
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,270
until we find acceptance below or above,
we are just rotating. Most of the volume

1926
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:47,280
we are just rotating. Most of the volume
 

1927
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,910
we are just rotating. Most of the volume
is taking place from 25 I mean

1928
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:49,920
is taking place from 25 I mean
 

1929
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,750
is taking place from 25 I mean
technically down to 72 but I'd include

1930
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:51,760
technically down to 72 but I'd include
 

1931
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,670
technically down to 72 but I'd include
it down to there. So you know you got

1932
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:53,680
it down to there. So you know you got
 

1933
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,910
it down to there. So you know you got
like 50 to 75 points range. That's all

1934
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:55,920
like 50 to 75 points range. That's all
 

1935
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,349
like 50 to 75 points range. That's all
we're looking at right now in this

1936
00:46:57,349 --> 00:46:57,359
we're looking at right now in this
 

1937
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,230
we're looking at right now in this
session. There's not much to play with.

1938
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:00,240
session. There's not much to play with.
 

1939
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:10,950
session. There's not much to play with.
Let it develop

1940
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:10,960

 

1941
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:22,870

again.

1942
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:22,880

 

1943
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,910

Just over 30 seconds to this new H4.

1944
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:25,920
Just over 30 seconds to this new H4.
 

1945
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,230
Just over 30 seconds to this new H4.
Your VP looks different. Um, I didn't

1946
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:28,240
Your VP looks different. Um, I didn't
 

1947
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,589
Your VP looks different. Um, I didn't
change anything either, bud. I don't

1948
00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:29,599
change anything either, bud. I don't
 

1949
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,990
change anything either, bud. I don't
know. Maybe just a bug. Maybe just need

1950
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:32,000
know. Maybe just a bug. Maybe just need
 

1951
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:38,550
know. Maybe just a bug. Maybe just need
to hit reset on it.

1952
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:38,560

 

1953
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:51,270

Have a look at the breed out of it.

1954
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:51,280

 

1955
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,589

Healthcare getting hit this morning. Eli

1956
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:53,599
Healthcare getting hit this morning. Eli
 

1957
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,109
Healthcare getting hit this morning. Eli
and Lily big loser. It's probably might

1958
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:55,119
and Lily big loser. It's probably might
 

1959
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,550
and Lily big loser. It's probably might
be the weakest one in the market right

1960
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:56,560
be the weakest one in the market right
 

1961
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,309
be the weakest one in the market right
now.

1962
00:47:58,309 --> 00:47:58,319
now.
 

1963
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,910
now.
Um, BSX, Eli, Lily, the whole healthcare

1964
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:01,920
Um, BSX, Eli, Lily, the whole healthcare
 

1965
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,150
Um, BSX, Eli, Lily, the whole healthcare
sector is red. So that's dragging ES

1966
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,160
sector is red. So that's dragging ES
 

1967
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,230
sector is red. So that's dragging ES
down.

1968
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:08,240

 

1969
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:15,270

Yep. Lost that same level again. Now,

1970
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:15,280

 

1971
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,550

here's the new H1 H4,

1972
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:18,560
here's the new H1 H4,
 

1973
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,510
here's the new H1 H4,
I'd say. Uh, yeah, those 900s are a big

1974
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:21,520
I'd say. Uh, yeah, those 900s are a big
 

1975
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,670
I'd say. Uh, yeah, those 900s are a big
level.

1976
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:23,680
level.
 

1977
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,470
level.
the H1 transition

1978
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:26,480
the H1 transition
 

1979
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:33,990
the H1 transition
95 8.95 is a big big level.

1980
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,000

 

1981
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,030

So, back to point of control again. I

1982
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:37,040
So, back to point of control again. I
 

1983
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,150
So, back to point of control again. I
know it doesn't look like it for you,

1984
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:38,160
know it doesn't look like it for you,
 

1985
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,150
know it doesn't look like it for you,
but my PC is here on Ninja Trader. All

1986
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:40,160
but my PC is here on Ninja Trader. All
 

1987
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,829
but my PC is here on Ninja Trader. All
right, so I'm just reading Ninja Trader

1988
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:41,839
right, so I'm just reading Ninja Trader
 

1989
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:45,510
right, so I'm just reading Ninja Trader
right now. We cannot get through that

1990
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:45,520
right now. We cannot get through that
 

1991
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,670
right now. We cannot get through that
890. It's been the level all day. That

1992
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:47,680
890. It's been the level all day. That
 

1993
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,589
890. It's been the level all day. That
has been an over under level all morning

1994
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:49,599
has been an over under level all morning
 

1995
00:48:49,599 --> 00:49:05,829
has been an over under level all morning
so far.

1996
00:49:05,829 --> 00:49:05,839

 

1997
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,670

How do I know to enter a trade? Well, it

1998
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:07,680
How do I know to enter a trade? Well, it
 

1999
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,349
How do I know to enter a trade? Well, it
needs to fit my system. At the moment,

2000
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:09,359
needs to fit my system. At the moment,
 

2001
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,190
needs to fit my system. At the moment,
we've got flat EMAs. We're inside a

2002
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:11,200
we've got flat EMAs. We're inside a
 

2003
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,790
we've got flat EMAs. We're inside a
D-shaped profile. We're not seeing

2004
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:14,800
D-shaped profile. We're not seeing
 

2005
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,630
D-shaped profile. We're not seeing
momentum. We're seeing sideways action.

2006
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:16,640
momentum. We're seeing sideways action.
 

2007
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,470
momentum. We're seeing sideways action.
So, it's not what I like to trade. If

2008
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:18,480
So, it's not what I like to trade. If
 

2009
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,910
So, it's not what I like to trade. If
you're a range trader, maybe it's what

2010
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:19,920
you're a range trader, maybe it's what
 

2011
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,630
you're a range trader, maybe it's what
you like, but for me, it's not what I

2012
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:22,640
you like, but for me, it's not what I
 

2013
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,710
you like, but for me, it's not what I
like. I like a continuation or a big

2014
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:24,720
like. I like a continuation or a big
 

2015
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,470
like. I like a continuation or a big
failure. I don't like sideways.

2016
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:28,480
failure. I don't like sideways.
 

2017
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,190
failure. I don't like sideways.
So, my EMAs are flat.

2018
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:31,200
So, my EMAs are flat.
 

2019
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,030
So, my EMAs are flat.
It's possible if we start to lose this,

2020
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:33,040
It's possible if we start to lose this,
 

2021
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,510
It's possible if we start to lose this,
they come back down here and look to tag

2022
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:35,520
they come back down here and look to tag
 

2023
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,109
they come back down here and look to tag
into here.

2024
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:39,119

 

2025
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,710

Remember the trade today was this to

2026
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:40,720
Remember the trade today was this to
 

2027
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,470
Remember the trade today was this to
here, I think. I think that was it. And

2028
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:42,480
here, I think. I think that was it. And
 

2029
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,470
here, I think. I think that was it. And
that's all we all we've taken. Two

2030
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:44,480
that's all we all we've taken. Two
 

2031
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,990
that's all we all we've taken. Two
attempts at it. Maybe this attempt and

2032
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:46,000
attempts at it. Maybe this attempt and
 

2033
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,309
attempts at it. Maybe this attempt and
this attempt.

2034
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:48,319
this attempt.
 

2035
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,230
this attempt.
Leaving this alone now. We're starting

2036
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:50,240
Leaving this alone now. We're starting
 

2037
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,950
Leaving this alone now. We're starting
to potentially break down into here. And

2038
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:52,960
to potentially break down into here. And
 

2039
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,870
to potentially break down into here. And
then I'll see how we respond if we get

2040
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:54,880
then I'll see how we respond if we get
 

2041
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:05,030
then I'll see how we respond if we get
down there.

2042
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:05,040

 

2043
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,670

Mag cannot make its mind up. Honestly,

2044
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:07,680
Mag cannot make its mind up. Honestly,
 

2045
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,069
Mag cannot make its mind up. Honestly,
it's one of the big problems right now.

2046
00:50:10,069 --> 00:50:10,079
it's one of the big problems right now.
 

2047
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,910
it's one of the big problems right now.
We've been rotating out the mag for a

2048
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:11,920
We've been rotating out the mag for a
 

2049
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,670
We've been rotating out the mag for a
couple weeks and in back into like small

2050
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:13,680
couple weeks and in back into like small
 

2051
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,870
couple weeks and in back into like small
caps and stuff, which is why you're

2052
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:14,880
caps and stuff, which is why you're
 

2053
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,430
caps and stuff, which is why you're
seeing bids on RTY,

2054
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:19,440

 

2055
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,670

but you know, we were short yesterday on

2056
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:21,680
but you know, we were short yesterday on
 

2057
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,030
but you know, we were short yesterday on
the Q's because we were the weaker

2058
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:23,040
the Q's because we were the weaker
 

2059
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,470
the Q's because we were the weaker
asset. We're long today on the Q's

2060
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:24,480
asset. We're long today on the Q's
 

2061
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,990
asset. We're long today on the Q's
because we're the stronger asset. Q's

2062
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:26,000
because we're the stronger asset. Q's
 

2063
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,150
because we're the stronger asset. Q's
almost 1% up. The rest of the market,

2064
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:28,160
almost 1% up. The rest of the market,
 

2065
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,190
almost 1% up. The rest of the market,
you know, ES half a percent up. YM 0.42%

2066
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:31,200
you know, ES half a percent up. YM 0.42%
 

2067
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,910
you know, ES half a percent up. YM 0.42%
up. RTY 0.73% up. But we can't get

2068
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:33,920
up. RTY 0.73% up. But we can't get
 

2069
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,670
up. RTY 0.73% up. But we can't get
going. The gap's just too big to sustain

2070
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:35,680
going. The gap's just too big to sustain
 

2071
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:48,790
going. The gap's just too big to sustain
right now by the looks of it.

2072
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:48,800

 

2073
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,589

You think we come to 800s? Um, I mean,

2074
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:51,599
You think we come to 800s? Um, I mean,
 

2075
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,030
You think we come to 800s? Um, I mean,
yeah, that's the box we've got lined

2076
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:53,040
yeah, that's the box we've got lined
 

2077
00:50:53,040 --> 00:51:01,430
yeah, that's the box we've got lined
out. It's very, very possible.

2078
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:01,440

 

2079
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,109

It's very, very possible.

2080
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:05,119
It's very, very possible.
 

2081
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:18,390
It's very, very possible.

stay inside this opening range, we're
 

2091

stay inside this opening range, we're
going to have to do something else. Oh

Did anyone play long overnight? What a

Are we heading towards VWAP? Well, we're

00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:17,680
Are we heading towards VWAP? Well, we're
 

2105
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,069
Are we heading towards VWAP? Well, we're
stuck between the two VWOPs, aren't we?

2106
00:52:20,069 --> 00:52:20,079
stuck between the two VWOPs, aren't we?
 

2107
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,910
stuck between the two VWOPs, aren't we?
There's your 24hour VWAP. There's the

So 70 now. PC trying to test those 90s
 

2115
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,829
So 70 now. PC trying to test those 90s
again. Can it find acceptance over 90s?

2116
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:33,839
again. Can it find acceptance over 90s?
 

2117
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:42,230
again. Can it find acceptance over 90s?
Can we push value area high up today?

2118
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:42,240

 

2119
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,910

Nvidia starting to squeeze. Just got

2120

Nvidia starting to squeeze. Just got
 

2121
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,430
Nvidia starting to squeeze. Just got
another alert here. So, it's back

2122

another alert here. So, it's back
 

2123
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,670
another alert here. So, it's back
through the 88s again.

2125
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,190

Question is, can it hold up here on

2126
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:51,200
Question is, can it hold up here on
 

2127
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,109
Question is, can it hold up here on
Nvidia and find acceptance? We cannot

2128
00:52:53,109 --> 00:52:53,119
Nvidia and find acceptance? We cannot
 

2129
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,950
Nvidia and find acceptance? We cannot
get over these 90s. It's the same level

2130
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:54,960
get over these 90s. It's the same level
 

2131
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,549
get over these 90s. It's the same level
I've been talking about all day. this

2132
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:56,559
I've been talking about all day. this
 

2133
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,030
I've been talking about all day. this
level right here, right? We've held no

2134
00:52:59,030 --> 00:52:59,040
level right here, right? We've held no
 

2135
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,030
level right here, right? We've held no
dip into it, right? We've squeezed

2136
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:01,040
dip into it, right? We've squeezed
 

2137
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,630
dip into it, right? We've squeezed
through it, flush through it, squeeze

through it, flush through it, squeeze
 

2139
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,710
through it, flush through it, squeeze
back through it. We cannot base above

2140
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:04,720
back through it. We cannot base above
 

2141
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,349
back through it. We cannot base above
it. Market, right, to get going has to

2142
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:07,359
it. Market, right, to get going has to
 

2143
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,069
it. Market, right, to get going has to
get back above this and find acceptance.

2144
00:53:10,069 --> 00:53:10,079
get back above this and find acceptance.
 

2145
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,069
get back above this and find acceptance.
At the moment, every push into here is

2146
00:53:12,069 --> 00:53:12,079
At the moment, every push into here is
 

2147
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,230
At the moment, every push into here is
being sold, right? So, it's possible

2148
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:14,240
being sold, right? So, it's possible
 

2149
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,510
being sold, right? So, it's possible
they're going to do this with it. I'm

2150
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:15,520
they're going to do this with it. I'm
 

2151
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,630
they're going to do this with it. I'm
not going to trade that because you're

2152
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:16,640
not going to trade that because you're
 

2153
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,549
not going to trade that because you're
trading at not a great location in my

2154
00:53:18,549 --> 00:53:18,559
trading at not a great location in my
 

2155
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:31,270
trading at not a great location in my
mind.

2156
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:31,280

 

2157
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,630

There's a seller trying to walk this

He just got absolutely wrecked there.

2162

Filled now. There we go. Let's see what
 

2165
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,430
Filled now. There we go. Let's see what
he does. Does he step back on the tape

2166
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:43,440
he does. Does he step back on the tape
 

2167
00:53:43,440 --> 00:54:14,230
he does. Does he step back on the tape
again? Get squeezed out.

2168
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:14,240

 

2169
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,990

See all this volume building up. Just

2170
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:16,000
See all this volume building up. Just
 

2171
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,309
See all this volume building up. Just
I'm just leaving this alone until we

2172
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:18,319
I'm just leaving this alone until we
 

2173
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:21,589
I'm just leaving this alone until we
leave this volume and we see what we do.

2174
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:21,599
leave this volume and we see what we do.
 

2175
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,349
leave this volume and we see what we do.
Maybe we come down to this blue box and

2176
00:54:23,349 --> 00:54:23,359
Maybe we come down to this blue box and
 

2177
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,190
Maybe we come down to this blue box and
the value area high from yesterday from

2178
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:25,200
the value area high from yesterday from
 

2179
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,230
the value area high from yesterday from
previous week. Maybe we stay heavy under

2180
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:28,240
previous week. Maybe we stay heavy under
 

2181
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,150
previous week. Maybe we stay heavy under
that and we start rotating in previous

2182
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:30,160
that and we start rotating in previous
 

2183
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,910
that and we start rotating in previous
week's value again. I'd rather we didn't

2184
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:31,920
week's value again. I'd rather we didn't
 

2185
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,950
week's value again. I'd rather we didn't
do that. That would be an awful move

2186
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:34,960
do that. That would be an awful move
 

2187
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,309
do that. That would be an awful move
right now. I'm not interested in doing

2188
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:36,319
right now. I'm not interested in doing
 

2189
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:41,270
right now. I'm not interested in doing
anything.

2190
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:41,280

 

2191
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,790

Sam, I'm ready to go with your course

2192
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:42,800
Sam, I'm ready to go with your course
 

2193
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,990
Sam, I'm ready to go with your course
and start my journey. Yeah, I look

2194
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:44,000
and start my journey. Yeah, I look
 

2195
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,109
and start my journey. Yeah, I look
forward to working with you then, my

2196
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:45,119
forward to working with you then, my
 

2197
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:59,589
forward to working with you then, my
friend.

2198
00:54:59,589 --> 00:54:59,599

 

2199
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,270

Honestly guys, for me, this is just a

2200
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:01,280
Honestly guys, for me, this is just a
 

2201
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,349
Honestly guys, for me, this is just a
leave alone part right now. It's good to

2202
00:55:03,349 --> 00:55:03,359
leave alone part right now. It's good to
 

2203
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,230
leave alone part right now. It's good to
just sit still.

2204
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:06,240
just sit still.
 

2205
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,870
just sit still.
Let it make up its mind. Let it either

2206
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:08,880
Let it make up its mind. Let it either
 

2207
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,349
Let it make up its mind. Let it either
come lower or break higher in base. But

2208
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:11,359
come lower or break higher in base. But
 

2209
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,870
come lower or break higher in base. But
I don't want to bid against it, that's

2210
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:12,880
I don't want to bid against it, that's
 

2211
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,549
I don't want to bid against it, that's
for sure. Not when we're going sideways.

2212
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:14,559
for sure. Not when we're going sideways.
 

2213
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:15,670
for sure. Not when we're going sideways.
And there's a good chance they want to

2214
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:15,680
And there's a good chance they want to
 

2215
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,109
And there's a good chance they want to
wash these guys out because they can't

2216
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:17,119
wash these guys out because they can't
 

2217
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,030
wash these guys out because they can't
get back back above these 90s which we

2218
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,040
get back back above these 90s which we
 

2219
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:25,030
get back back above these 90s which we
keep talking about.

2220
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:25,040

 

2221
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,710

Is it a must to work with the bookmap?

2222
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:26,720
Is it a must to work with the bookmap?
 

2223
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,950
Is it a must to work with the bookmap?
No, it's not a must.

2224
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:28,960
No, it's not a must.
 

2225
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,630
No, it's not a must.
It's not a must. Plenty of people trade

2226
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:30,640
It's not a must. Plenty of people trade
 

2227
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,549
It's not a must. Plenty of people trade
without it.

2228
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:32,559
without it.
 

2229
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,069
without it.
I feel like I'm trading blind without

2230
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:34,079
I feel like I'm trading blind without
 

2231
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,589
I feel like I'm trading blind without
it. There we go. Here's the wash. Let's

2232
00:55:35,589 --> 00:55:35,599
it. There we go. Here's the wash. Let's
 

2233
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:36,950
it. There we go. Here's the wash. Let's
see if they come down into here now and

2234
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:36,960
see if they come down into here now and
 

2235
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,510
see if they come down into here now and
how they respond. If we don't hold

2236
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:39,520
how they respond. If we don't hold
 

2237
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,430
how they respond. If we don't hold
previous week value area high, I would

2238
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:41,440
previous week value area high, I would
 

2239
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,069
previous week value area high, I would
have some concerns here.

2240
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:44,079
have some concerns here.
 

2241
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,309
have some concerns here.
Like in this, we call it like a block, a

2242
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:46,319
Like in this, we call it like a block, a
 

2243
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:47,670
Like in this, we call it like a block, a
level, right? If we don't hold this

2244
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:47,680
level, right? If we don't hold this
 

2245
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,829
level, right? If we don't hold this
area, I'd have some concerns because I

2246
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:49,839
area, I'd have some concerns because I
 

2247
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,630
area, I'd have some concerns because I
think then possibly, you know, a trade

2248
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:52,640
think then possibly, you know, a trade
 

2249
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,750
think then possibly, you know, a trade
back down to 755, 750s is possible,

2250
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:55,760
back down to 755, 750s is possible,
 

2251
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,190
back down to 755, 750s is possible,
right? All the way down here. It's not

2252
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:57,200
right? All the way down here. It's not
 

2253
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,589
right? All the way down here. It's not
ideal. So, they really bulls what we

2254
00:55:59,589 --> 00:55:59,599
ideal. So, they really bulls what we
 

2255
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,349
ideal. So, they really bulls what we
want to hold dips here. Otherwise, we're

2256
00:56:01,349 --> 00:56:01,359
want to hold dips here. Otherwise, we're
 

2257
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:02,950
want to hold dips here. Otherwise, we're
going to go back inside the previous

2258
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:02,960
going to go back inside the previous
 

2259
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,870
going to go back inside the previous
week's value area range, which is like

2260
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:04,880
week's value area range, which is like
 

2261
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,630
week's value area range, which is like
it's just not ideal. If we're going to

2262
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:06,640
it's just not ideal. If we're going to
 

2263
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,430
it's just not ideal. If we're going to
do that,

2264
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:09,440
do that,
 

2265
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:16,069
do that,
there would be a node. Yeah. 770

2266
00:56:16,069 --> 00:56:16,079

 

2267
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,150

770 750

2268
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:20,160

 

2269
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,470

674 It's less than ideal if they let go

2270
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:22,480
674 It's less than ideal if they let go
 

2271
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,230
674 It's less than ideal if they let go
of it. We go back in rotation of

2272
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:24,240
of it. We go back in rotation of
 

2273
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,630
of it. We go back in rotation of
previous week's value.

2274
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:28,640

 

2275
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,390

Alex, how do we get better at planning

2276
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:30,400
Alex, how do we get better at planning
 

2277
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,549
Alex, how do we get better at planning
and building an overall narrative? I

2278
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:32,559
and building an overall narrative? I
 

2279
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,150
and building an overall narrative? I
tend to struggle with that. Is that one

2280
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:34,160
tend to struggle with that. Is that one
 

2281
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,710
tend to struggle with that. Is that one
of the hardest things to develop? Um,

2282
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:38,720

 

2283
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,710

it's a good question. Uh, I think it

2284
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:40,720
it's a good question. Uh, I think it
 

2285
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,549
it's a good question. Uh, I think it
just comes from time, understanding how

2286
00:56:42,549 --> 00:56:42,559
just comes from time, understanding how
 

2287
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,390
just comes from time, understanding how
the market likes to move, understanding

2288
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:44,400
the market likes to move, understanding
 

2289
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,670
the market likes to move, understanding
what your playbook is, and being more

2290
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:47,680
what your playbook is, and being more
 

2291
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,270
what your playbook is, and being more
focused on the higher time frames,

2292
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:49,280
focused on the higher time frames,
 

2293
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,670
focused on the higher time frames,
understand like, are we attempting to

2294
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:51,680
understand like, are we attempting to
 

2295
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,270
understand like, are we attempting to
move the market higher? If we're in an

2296
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:53,280
move the market higher? If we're in an
 

2297
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,349
move the market higher? If we're in an
auction, remember the market's either

2298
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:55,359
auction, remember the market's either
 

2299
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:58,549
auction, remember the market's either
looking to find value or it's in value.

2300
00:56:58,549 --> 00:56:58,559
looking to find value or it's in value.
 

2301
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:00,710
looking to find value or it's in value.
It's either looking to find new value or

2302
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:00,720
It's either looking to find new value or
 

2303
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,870
It's either looking to find new value or
it's already in value currently. All

2304
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:02,880
it's already in value currently. All
 

2305
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,470
it's already in value currently. All
right, you could argue we have been

2306
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:04,480
right, you could argue we have been
 

2307
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,470
right, you could argue we have been
looking to find new value because we are

2308
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:06,480
looking to find new value because we are
 

2309
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,630
looking to find new value because we are
leaving previous day's value. If value

2310
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:08,640
leaving previous day's value. If value
 

2311
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,829
leaving previous day's value. If value
yesterday was in here, right, we left

2312
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:11,839
yesterday was in here, right, we left
 

2313
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:13,589
yesterday was in here, right, we left
that value, which means we've decided

2314
00:57:13,589 --> 00:57:13,599
that value, which means we've decided
 

2315
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,190
that value, which means we've decided
that's too cheap. Now, we're trying to

2316
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:15,200
that's too cheap. Now, we're trying to
 

2317
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,430
that's too cheap. Now, we're trying to
see, okay, are we finding value here? If

2318
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:17,440
see, okay, are we finding value here? If
 

2319
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,430
see, okay, are we finding value here? If
the answer's yes, we're going to go in a

2320
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:19,440
the answer's yes, we're going to go in a
 

2321
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,510
the answer's yes, we're going to go in a
rotation here. If we're saying, hey,

2322
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:21,520
rotation here. If we're saying, hey,
 

2323
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,950
rotation here. If we're saying, hey,
this isn't good value, then we're going

2324
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:22,960
this isn't good value, then we're going
 

2325
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,150
this isn't good value, then we're going
to come down, right, and we're going to

2326
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:24,160
to come down, right, and we're going to
 

2327
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,670
to come down, right, and we're going to
look for value somewhere else again,

2328
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:25,680
look for value somewhere else again,
 

2329
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,670
look for value somewhere else again,
maybe where it was before. It's

2330
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:27,680
maybe where it was before. It's
 

2331
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,390
maybe where it was before. It's
understanding that process and using,

2332
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:30,400
understanding that process and using,
 

2333
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,470
understanding that process and using,
you know, SNR off hourly levels, daily

2334
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:34,480
you know, SNR off hourly levels, daily
 

2335
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,069
you know, SNR off hourly levels, daily
levels, things like that to understand

2336
00:57:36,069 --> 00:57:36,079
levels, things like that to understand
 

2337
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,510
levels, things like that to understand
what the market's doing. I mean, all you

2338
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:37,520
what the market's doing. I mean, all you
 

2339
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,030
what the market's doing. I mean, all you
have to do right now, if you zoom out on

2340
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:39,040
have to do right now, if you zoom out on
 

2341
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,589
have to do right now, if you zoom out on
a daily, what are we actually doing?

2342
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:41,599
a daily, what are we actually doing?
 

2343
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,670
a daily, what are we actually doing?
We're not doing a lot, are we? All

2344
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:43,680
We're not doing a lot, are we? All
 

2345
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,190
We're not doing a lot, are we? All
right, we're not doing a lot. This is

2346
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:45,200
right, we're not doing a lot. This is
 

2347
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,390
right, we're not doing a lot. This is
what we've done on the daily for a

2348
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:46,400
what we've done on the daily for a
 

2349
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,829
what we've done on the daily for a
while. You can see we have failed to

2350
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:47,839
while. You can see we have failed to
 

2351
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,309
while. You can see we have failed to
break about above this since early

2352
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:50,319
break about above this since early
 

2353
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,870
break about above this since early
November. We're in one of these, but

2354
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:52,880
November. We're in one of these, but
 

2355
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,589
November. We're in one of these, but
we're tight. All right, so we are

2356
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:55,599
we're tight. All right, so we are
 

2357
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,789
we're tight. All right, so we are
creating liquidity. At some point, we

2358
00:57:58,789 --> 00:57:58,799
creating liquidity. At some point, we
 

2359
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,789
creating liquidity. At some point, we
will use that liquidity, but right now,

2360
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:00,799
will use that liquidity, but right now,
 

2361
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:03,349
will use that liquidity, but right now,
we're in liquidity creation by going

2362
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:03,359
we're in liquidity creation by going
 

2363
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:06,789
we're in liquidity creation by going
sideways.

2364
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:06,799

 

2365
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,789

Okay, back up to these 90s again. So,

2366
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:08,799
Okay, back up to these 90s again. So,
 

2367
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:10,950
Okay, back up to these 90s again. So,
that last dip was a little wick below.

2368
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:10,960
that last dip was a little wick below.
 

2369
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,789
that last dip was a little wick below.
Back to these 90s again. If they get

2370
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:12,799
Back to these 90s again. If they get
 

2371
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:14,230
Back to these 90s again. If they get
through these 90s, they have the

2372
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:14,240
through these 90s, they have the
 

2373
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,829
through these 90s, they have the
potential to squeeze. They've got to get

2374
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:15,839
potential to squeeze. They've got to get
 

2375
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:17,829
potential to squeeze. They've got to get
through and base. Otherwise, we're going

2376
00:58:17,829 --> 00:58:17,839
through and base. Otherwise, we're going
 

2377
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:19,829
through and base. Otherwise, we're going
to continue this rotation. So far, we're

2378
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:19,839
to continue this rotation. So far, we're
 

2379
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:21,270
to continue this rotation. So far, we're
not finding every time we come down

2380
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:21,280
not finding every time we come down
 

2381
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,470
not finding every time we come down
here, we're not really finding

2382
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:22,480
here, we're not really finding
 

2383
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,630
here, we're not really finding
acceptance. Yes, there's a lower low,

2384
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:24,640
acceptance. Yes, there's a lower low,
 

2385
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,270
acceptance. Yes, there's a lower low,
but this uh for me is probably a bullish

2386
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:27,280
but this uh for me is probably a bullish
 

2387
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,270
but this uh for me is probably a bullish
liquidity build right now. Right.

2388
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:31,280
liquidity build right now. Right.
 

2389
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,430
liquidity build right now. Right.
At some point I expect to see something

2390
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:33,440
At some point I expect to see something
 

2391
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:45,510
At some point I expect to see something
like this happen and then we can join.

2392
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:45,520

 

2393
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,589

Yeah. Uh my fillet ITM. Yeah. If you

just like go down towards the end of the
course, there's like a module on Discord

2398
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:51,520
course, there's like a module on Discord
 

2399
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,190
course, there's like a module on Discord
that will tell you what to do.

2400
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:55,200
that will tell you what to do.

Blew an account this morning. LOL. The
market is moving awful. Well, it I'm

2404
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:00,240
market is moving awful. Well, it I'm
 

2405

going to give you some tough love there.
It means you've oversized or you played

2408
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:03,760
It means you've oversized or you played
 

2409
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,430
It means you've oversized or you played
something that isn't there because the

2410
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:05,440
something that isn't there because the
 

2411
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,990
something that isn't there because the
market hasn't moved that much. Market's

2412
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:08,000
market hasn't moved that much. Market's
 

2413
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,630
market hasn't moved that much. Market's
moved 111 points and most of that's in

2414
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:10,640
moved 111 points and most of that's in
 

2415
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,630
moved 111 points and most of that's in
the 70 point range. So, if you've blown

2416
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:12,640
the 70 point range. So, if you've blown
 

2417
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,390
the 70 point range. So, if you've blown
an account, you've tried to take too

2418
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:14,400
an account, you've tried to take too
 

2419
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,630
an account, you've tried to take too
many trades or you've oversized.

2420
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:18,640

 

2421
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,030

Yeah, I see that JD. I mean, we're

Yeah, I see that JD. I mean, we're
 

2423
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,030
Yeah, I see that JD. I mean, we're
actually in the stronger asset. Well,

2424
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:23,040
actually in the stronger asset. Well,
 

2425
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,430
actually in the stronger asset. Well,
RTY now this what I was talking about.

00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:25,440
RTY now this what I was talking about.
 

2427
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,190
RTY now this what I was talking about.
The rotation the last few weeks has been

2428
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:27,200
The rotation the last few weeks has been
 

2429
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,910
The rotation the last few weeks has been
out of tech back into small caps and uh

2430
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:31,920
out of tech back into small caps and uh
 

2431
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,990
out of tech back into small caps and uh
like bio and stuff like that position

2432
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:34,000
like bio and stuff like that position
 

2433
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,030
like bio and stuff like that position
positioning for increased market breath.

2434
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:37,040
positioning for increased market breath.
 

2435
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,789
positioning for increased market breath.
Last year the breadth was awful right it

2436
00:59:38,789 --> 00:59:38,799
Last year the breadth was awful right it
 

2437
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:40,390
Last year the breadth was awful right it
was mag well I'd say in the last two

2438
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:40,400
was mag well I'd say in the last two
 

2439
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,789
was mag well I'd say in the last two
years was awful mag 7 doing all of the

2440
00:59:42,789 --> 00:59:42,799
years was awful mag 7 doing all of the
 

2441
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:44,789
years was awful mag 7 doing all of the
work all of the work came from the mag

2442
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:44,799
work all of the work came from the mag
 

2443
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:47,670
work all of the work came from the mag
7. So we're trimming mag 7 at the moment

2444
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:47,680
7. So we're trimming mag 7 at the moment
 

2445
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,589
7. So we're trimming mag 7 at the moment
and we're rotating into everything else

2446
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:49,599
and we're rotating into everything else
 

2447
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,270
and we're rotating into everything else
and at some point they will come back

2448
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:51,280
and at some point they will come back
 

2449
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,270
and at some point they will come back
into mag 7 when they deem the market's

2450
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:53,280
into mag 7 when they deem the market's
 

2451
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,270
into mag 7 when they deem the market's
ready. Okay, back up to 80s. So, we're

2452
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:55,280
ready. Okay, back up to 80s. So, we're
 

2453
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,950
ready. Okay, back up to 80s. So, we're
going to test 90s again.

2454
00:59:58,950 --> 00:59:58,960
going to test 90s again.
 

2455
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,190
going to test 90s again.
Waiting to see if we trigger a squeeze

2456
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:01,200
Waiting to see if we trigger a squeeze
 

2457
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:10,470
Waiting to see if we trigger a squeeze
and a base up. Yes, back into its VWAP.

2458
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:10,480

 

2459
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,950

Uh, daily and hourly are my go-tos.

2460
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:12,960
Uh, daily and hourly are my go-tos.
 

2461
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,829
Uh, daily and hourly are my go-tos.
Hourly I I call like God, right? God

2462
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:15,839
Hourly I I call like God, right? God
 

2463
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,910
Hourly I I call like God, right? God
hourly is very very key for me. Even a

2464
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:17,920
hourly is very very key for me. Even a
 

2465
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:24,150
hourly is very very key for me. Even a
30 minutes can be very very useful.

2466
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:24,160

 

2467
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,829

Like right now, if you look at the

2468
01:00:25,829 --> 01:00:25,839
Like right now, if you look at the
 

2469
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:28,069
Like right now, if you look at the
hourly,

2470

in here,
 

2477
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,270
in here,
right? We can't find acceptance above.

2478
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:35,280
right? We can't find acceptance above.
 

2479
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,789

We're in this huge pocket of volume

2482
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:40,880
We're in this huge pocket of volume
 

2483
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:53,349
We're in this huge pocket of volume
from this week.

2484
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:53,359

 

2485
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:56,390

It's why the 23s are key. 90s in this in

2486
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:56,400
It's why the 23s are key. 90s in this in
 

2487
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,710
It's why the 23s are key. 90s in this in
current days

2488
01:00:58,710 --> 01:00:58,720
current days
 

2489
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,750
current days
uh levels are key and then 23s which is

2490
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:01,760
uh levels are key and then 23s which is
 

2491
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,630
uh levels are key and then 23s which is
up here. This is the edge of that when

2492
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:04,640
up here. This is the edge of that when
 

2493
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,510
up here. This is the edge of that when
we talked about that rotation. It was

2494
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:07,520
we talked about that rotation. It was
 

2495
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,910
we talked about that rotation. It was
840s,

2496
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:09,920
840s,
 

2497
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:14,549
840s,
right? This is that huge current week

2498
01:01:14,549 --> 01:01:14,559
right? This is that huge current week
 

2499
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,710
right? This is that huge current week
volume node. This is what we're trading

2500
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:16,720
volume node. This is what we're trading
 

2501
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,349
volume node. This is what we're trading
between right now. If we can find

2502
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:19,359
between right now. If we can find
 

2503
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:22,549
between right now. If we can find
acceptance above this, we can go for it

2504
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:22,559
acceptance above this, we can go for it
 

2505
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:30,150
acceptance above this, we can go for it
right now. That's all we've got.

2506
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:30,160

 

2507
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,230

Alex, how long does key levels stay

2508
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:32,240
Alex, how long does key levels stay
 

2509
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,910
Alex, how long does key levels stay
relevant for you? For example, price has

2510
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:33,920
relevant for you? For example, price has
 

2511
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,670
relevant for you? For example, price has
moved through last week's value area

2512
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:35,680
moved through last week's value area
 

2513
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,910
moved through last week's value area
high multiple times this week already.

2514
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:37,920
high multiple times this week already.
 

2515

Still key though. Still key because if

01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:40,480
Still key though. Still key because if
 

2517
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,470
Still key though. Still key because if
you look, it's moved through it, but

01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:42,480
you look, it's moved through it, but
 

2519
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,829
you look, it's moved through it, but
once we moved through it, what did we do

2520
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:43,839
once we moved through it, what did we do
 

2521
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:45,990
once we moved through it, what did we do
overnight? We This became key, right?

2522
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:46,000
overnight? We This became key, right?

You can see as an area. Don't use it as

2524
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:48,240
You can see as an area. Don't use it as
 

2525
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,069
You can see as an area. Don't use it as
a direct area as an area. This is where

2526
01:01:50,069 --> 01:01:50,079
a direct area as an area. This is where
 

2527
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,069
a direct area as an area. This is where
we held found bids and and went over,

2528
01:01:52,069 --> 01:01:52,079
we held found bids and and went over,
 

2529
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:55,190
we held found bids and and went over,
right? Still key. It's best way of

2530
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:55,200
right? Still key. It's best way of
 

2531
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,630
right? Still key. It's best way of
putting that is it's key until it's not.

2532
01:01:58,630 --> 01:01:58,640
putting that is it's key until it's not.
 

2533
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,630
putting that is it's key until it's not.
It's still it's still a big level. If we

2534
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:00,640
It's still it's still a big level. If we
 

2535
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,230
It's still it's still a big level. If we
lose it, then we just look for the next

2536
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:02,240
lose it, then we just look for the next
 

2537
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,109
lose it, then we just look for the next
level down

2538
01:02:05,109 --> 01:02:05,119
level down
 

2539
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:06,870
level down
back into this shelf here again. These

2540
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:06,880
back into this shelf here again. These
 

2541
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,710
back into this shelf here again. These
90s again. I'm just saying the same

2542
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:08,720
90s again. I'm just saying the same
 

2543
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,990
90s again. I'm just saying the same
thing over and over again because the

2544
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:10,000
thing over and over again because the
 

2545
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,430
thing over and over again because the
market is doing the same thing over and

2546
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:11,440
market is doing the same thing over and
 

2547
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,270
market is doing the same thing over and
over again. Here's the test of 90s. And

2548
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:13,280
over again. Here's the test of 90s. And
 

2549
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,190
over again. Here's the test of 90s. And
the question is now, do they squeeze and

2550
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:15,200
the question is now, do they squeeze and
 

2551
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,670
the question is now, do they squeeze and
base above or do buyers come

2552
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:17,680
base above or do buyers come
 

2553
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,030
base above or do buyers come
aggressively in here and get trapped?

2554
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:19,040
aggressively in here and get trapped?
 

2555
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,349
aggressively in here and get trapped?
Here's the squeeze. Can they base above

2556
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:21,359
Here's the squeeze. Can they base above
 

2557
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,030
Here's the squeeze. Can they base above
though? Answer so far is no, but

2558
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:23,040
though? Answer so far is no, but
 

2559
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,470
though? Answer so far is no, but
aggressive buyers came in and got

2560
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:24,480
aggressive buyers came in and got
 

2561
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,430
aggressive buyers came in and got
trapped again above 90s. So, we've got

2562
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:27,440
trapped again above 90s. So, we've got
 

2563
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,910
trapped again above 90s. So, we've got
passive selling up here between 90s and

2564
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:29,920
passive selling up here between 90s and
 

2565
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,670
passive selling up here between 90s and
900s. It's absolutely clear they cannot

2566
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:33,680
900s. It's absolutely clear they cannot
 

2567
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,349
900s. It's absolutely clear they cannot
get through that level.

2568
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:37,359

 

2569
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:41,750

Am I looking for shorts? No.

2570
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:41,760

 

2571
01:02:41,760 --> 01:03:03,109

New to the channel? Morning Rob Miller.

2572
01:03:03,109 --> 01:03:03,119

 

2573
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,549

I'm going to get a refill on my tea

2574
01:03:04,549 --> 01:03:04,559
I'm going to get a refill on my tea
 

2575
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:06,069
I'm going to get a refill on my tea
while this is doing absolutely nothing.

2576
01:03:06,069 --> 01:03:06,079
while this is doing absolutely nothing.
 

2577
01:03:06,079 --> 01:04:14,069
while this is doing absolutely nothing.
All right, be right back.

2578
01:04:14,069 --> 01:04:14,079

 

2579
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,750

There we go.

2580
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:17,760

 

2581
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:45,990

Holding there.

2582
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:46,000

 

2583
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,829

Okay. Same stuff. Still true.

2584
01:04:49,829 --> 01:04:49,839
Okay. Same stuff. Still true.
 

2585
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:57,510
Okay. Same stuff. Still true.
Still in this shelf.

2586
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:57,520

 

2587
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,109

This probably the hardest part of the

2588
01:04:59,109 --> 01:04:59,119
This probably the hardest part of the
 

2589
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:00,630
This probably the hardest part of the
game, especially for you guys who are

2590
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:00,640
game, especially for you guys who are
 

2591
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,029
game, especially for you guys who are
new, is just sitting still. Just sitting

2592
01:05:03,029 --> 01:05:03,039
new, is just sitting still. Just sitting
 

2593
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:05,349
new, is just sitting still. Just sitting
still. Not wanting to click. Nothing's

01:05:05,349 --> 01:05:05,359
still. Not wanting to click. Nothing's
 

2595
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,190
still. Not wanting to click. Nothing's
going on here, folks. So until we get

2596
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:07,200
going on here, folks. So until we get
 

2597
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,589
going on here, folks. So until we get
that break above and a base or that dip

2598
01:05:09,589 --> 01:05:09,599
that break above and a base or that dip
 

2599
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,510
that break above and a base or that dip
below and a hold, I don't really want to

2600
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:11,520
below and a hold, I don't really want to
 

2601
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:25,430
below and a hold, I don't really want to
do anything.

2602
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:25,440

 

2603
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,430

Interesting. Let's now see our acts back

2604
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:27,440
Interesting. Let's now see our acts back
 

2605
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:35,829
Interesting. Let's now see our acts back
into the same level.

2606
01:05:35,829 --> 01:05:35,839

 

2607
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:39,349

New York right there.

2608
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:39,359
New York right there.
 

2609
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:42,870
New York right there.
So key, man. So key this level up here

2610
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:42,880
So key, man. So key this level up here
 

2611
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,470
So key, man. So key this level up here
with sentiment.

2612

2613
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,150

When it passes the first 15 minute

2614
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:48,160
When it passes the first 15 minute
 

2615
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,670
When it passes the first 15 minute
range, low and high, are we looking for

2616
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:49,680
range, low and high, are we looking for
 

2617
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,670
range, low and high, are we looking for
a fair value gap? And when will we know

2618
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:51,680
a fair value gap? And when will we know
 

2619
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,109
a fair value gap? And when will we know
whether to take long or high? I don't

2620
01:05:53,109 --> 01:05:53,119
whether to take long or high? I don't
 

2621
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:56,710

don't know what uh what type of setup

2624
01:05:59,829 --> 01:05:59,839
don't know what uh what type of setup
 

2625
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:08,870
don't know what uh what type of setup
that is.

2626
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:08,880

 

2627
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,710

Possible that we've seen some

2664
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:14,400
Possible that we've seen some
 

2665
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:21,270
Possible that we've seen some
accumulation at these lows.

2666
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:21,280

 

2667
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,789

Here's the drive-thru. Buyers caught

2668
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:22,799
Here's the drive-thru. Buyers caught
 

2669
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:24,309
Here's the drive-thru. Buyers caught
there again. Still a passive seller up

2670
01:07:24,309 --> 01:07:24,319
there again. Still a passive seller up
 

2671
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:27,190
there again. Still a passive seller up
there into 900. 90 to 900. still passive

2672
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:27,200

selling up there that every pop through
 

2675
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,109
selling up there that every pop through
they are just passively selling. So

2676
01:07:31,109 --> 01:07:31,119
they are just passively selling. So
 

2677
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:32,950
they are just passively selling. So
we're seeing big buyers step in and

2678
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:32,960
we're seeing big buyers step in and
 

2679
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,710
we're seeing big buyers step in and
they're just getting the door shut on

2680
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:34,720
they're just getting the door shut on
 

2681
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,950
they're just getting the door shut on
their face over and over and over again.

2682
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:36,960
their face over and over and over again.
 

2683
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:47,430
their face over and over and over again.
And that is the story so far today.

01:07:57,109 --> 01:07:57,119
me it wants to do something. At the
 

2693
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:58,710
me it wants to do something. At the
moment, there's there's quite literally

2694
01:07:58,710 --> 01:07:58,720
moment, there's there's quite literally
 

2695
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,549
moment, there's there's quite literally
nothing to do, guys. There's there's no

01:08:00,549 --> 01:08:00,559
nothing to do, guys. There's there's no
 

2697

01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:02,400
entry, right? I'm just flat. I'm just
 

2699
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,990

waiting. There's nothing going on right

2700
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:04,000
waiting. There's nothing going on right
 

2701
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,430
waiting. There's nothing going on right
now. If we can find acceptance above the

2702
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:07,440
now. If we can find acceptance above the
 

2703
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,270
now. If we can find acceptance above the
here, then I'm interested. But it's

2704
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:09,280
here, then I'm interested. But it's
 

2705
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,430
here, then I'm interested. But it's
going to be a scalp to start because I

2706
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:11,440
going to be a scalp to start because I
 

2707
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,190
going to be a scalp to start because I
don't know if this door gets shut on my

2708
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:13,200
don't know if this door gets shut on my
 

2709
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,470
don't know if this door gets shut on my
face here. All right. So, if we are able

2710
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:16,480
face here. All right. So, if we are able
 

2711
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,030
face here. All right. So, if we are able
to hold here, I'm interested.

2712
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:19,040
to hold here, I'm interested.
 

2713
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,430
to hold here, I'm interested.
I'm also interested down here. I'm

2714
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:21,440
I'm also interested down here. I'm
 

2715
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,870
I'm also interested down here. I'm
focused on the longs today, even though

2716
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:22,880
focused on the longs today, even though
 

2717
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,590
focused on the longs today, even though
we're sort of sideways and melting, but

2718
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:25,600
we're sort of sideways and melting, but
 

2719
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,590
we're sort of sideways and melting, but
I'm not going to like force my way in.

2720
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:27,600
I'm not going to like force my way in.

01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:44,319
see in here aggressive sellers, right?
 

2781
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,910
see in here aggressive sellers, right?
Market sellers in here. And I want to

2782
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:45,920
Market sellers in here. And I want to
 

2783
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,470
Market sellers in here. And I want to
see limit buyers absorbing the tape. I

2784
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:48,480
see limit buyers absorbing the tape. I
 

2785
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,950
see limit buyers absorbing the tape. I
want sellers to get trapped, right?

2786
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:50,960
want sellers to get trapped, right?
 

2787
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,390
want sellers to get trapped, right?
Ideally under this level here because

2788
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:52,400
Ideally under this level here because
 

2789
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,990
Ideally under this level here because
we've got a node and I want to use their

2790
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:54,000
we've got a node and I want to use their
 

2791
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,630
we've got a node and I want to use their
pain for them to stop out to go higher.

2792
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:56,640
pain for them to stop out to go higher.
 

2793
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,149
pain for them to stop out to go higher.
And then I'm going to take profit on the

2794
01:09:58,149 --> 01:09:58,159
And then I'm going to take profit on the
 

2795
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:59,910
And then I'm going to take profit on the
way up because I know right now we've

2796
01:09:59,910 --> 01:09:59,920
way up because I know right now we've
 

2797
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,669
way up because I know right now we've
got buyers trapped above this level

2798
01:10:01,669 --> 01:10:01,679
got buyers trapped above this level
 

2799
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:03,590
got buyers trapped above this level
here. That is the same level if we go to

2800
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:03,600
here. That is the same level if we go to
 

2801
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,430
here. That is the same level if we go to
an H1 that I'm looking at. Right? So

2802
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:05,440
an H1 that I'm looking at. Right? So
 

2803
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,070
an H1 that I'm looking at. Right? So
I've got confluence of this node right

2804
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:08,080
I've got confluence of this node right
 

2805
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,910
I've got confluence of this node right
here. Right? So I have to trim here. If

2806
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:09,920
here. Right? So I have to trim here. If
 

2807
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,590
here. Right? So I have to trim here. If
we find acceptance above that, we can

2808
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:11,600
we find acceptance above that, we can
 

2809
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,510
we find acceptance above that, we can
get going. But at the moment, we can't.

2810
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:13,520
get going. But at the moment, we can't.
 

2811
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,550
get going. But at the moment, we can't.
The moment is just a rotation. So, that

2812
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:16,560
The moment is just a rotation. So, that
 

2813
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,390
The moment is just a rotation. So, that
is pretty much the same setup I'm always

2814
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:18,400
is pretty much the same setup I'm always
 

2815
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,510
is pretty much the same setup I'm always
looking for. Pretty much the same thing.

2816
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:21,520
looking for. Pretty much the same thing.
 

2817
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,430
looking for. Pretty much the same thing.
Whether it's a reversal, whether it's a

2818
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:23,440
Whether it's a reversal, whether it's a
 

2819
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,510
Whether it's a reversal, whether it's a
continuation, it doesn't matter what it

2820
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:25,520
continuation, it doesn't matter what it
 

2821
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,590
continuation, it doesn't matter what it
what it is. I'm looking to play people's

2822
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:27,600
what it is. I'm looking to play people's
 

2823
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:46,550
what it is. I'm looking to play people's
pain.

2824
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:46,560

 

2825
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:53,270

Back to these same levels. 90s again.

2826
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:53,280

 

2827
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,350

That's great. Green otter. That's great.

2828
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:55,360
That's great. Green otter. That's great.
 

2829
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:58,070
That's great. Green otter. That's great.
like one one losing day in 3 weeks is

2830
01:10:58,070 --> 01:10:58,080
like one one losing day in 3 weeks is
 

2831
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,590
like one one losing day in 3 weeks is
amazing. That's not just great, it's

2832
01:10:59,590 --> 01:10:59,600
amazing. That's not just great, it's
 

2833
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,470
amazing. That's not just great, it's
fantastic

2834
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:02,480

and you're only negative 135. That's

2836
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:04,880
and you're only negative 135. That's
 

2837
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,790
and you're only negative 135. That's
very good discipline. Like that is good

trading. Too many people think a
 

2843
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:11,990
trading. Too many people think a
negative day is bad trading. If you've

2844
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:12,000
negative day is bad trading. If you've
 

2845
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,310

stuck to your rules and you've lost on

stuck to your rules and you've lost on
 

2847
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:17,510

the day, that's good trading. What's bad
 

2849
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,510

trading is if you haven't stuck to your

2850
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:19,520
trading is if you haven't stuck to your

Well, that is going to equate to a very

2868
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:33,920
Well, that is going to equate to a very
 

2869
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,630
Well, that is going to equate to a very
very good profit factor as as long as

That's what I use it on.

2878
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:51,040

good valuable person. Here's the '90s

2888
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:00,880
good valuable person. Here's the '90s
 

2889
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,630
good valuable person. Here's the '90s
test, guys. Although we can say that our

2890
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:02,640
test, guys. Although we can say that our
 

2891
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:03,990
test, guys. Although we can say that our
community relatively small, I can assure

2892
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:04,000
community relatively small, I can assure
 

2893
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,350
community relatively small, I can assure
you that we have been thinking about you

2894
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:05,360
you that we have been thinking about you

a lot in the past period. God bless you.
 

2897
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,350
a lot in the past period. God bless you.
Thank you so much. Okay, here's the

2898
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:09,360
Thank you so much. Okay, here's the
 

2899
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:13,350
Thank you so much. Okay, here's the
squeeze up to the next level.

2900
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:13,360

 

2901
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,350

Let's see. Do they fade this? Now, we're

2902
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:15,360
Let's see. Do they fade this? Now, we're
 

2903
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,110
Let's see. Do they fade this? Now, we're
looking for dips to hold and otherwise

2904
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:17,120
looking for dips to hold and otherwise
 

2905
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,950
looking for dips to hold and otherwise
we're looking for the 25s if there's a

2906
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:18,960
we're looking for the 25s if there's a
 

2907
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,510
we're looking for the 25s if there's a
way of getting involved in this.

2908
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:21,520
way of getting involved in this.
 

2909
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:22,790
way of getting involved in this.
So this was the move we were looking

2910
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:22,800
So this was the move we were looking
 

2911
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,390
So this was the move we were looking
for. Is there a way of getting involved

2912
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:24,400
for. Is there a way of getting involved
 

2913
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,669
for. Is there a way of getting involved
in it now? Is the market going to be

2914
01:12:25,669 --> 01:12:25,679
in it now? Is the market going to be
 

2915
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:26,950
in it now? Is the market going to be
crawled and go without us? ES

2916
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:26,960
crawled and go without us? ES
 

2917
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,669
crawled and go without us? ES
approaching high of day already. I want

2918
01:12:29,669 --> 01:12:29,679
approaching high of day already. I want
 

2919
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,350
approaching high of day already. I want
to be involved in this now. This is what

2920
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:31,360
to be involved in this now. This is what
 

2921
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,910
to be involved in this now. This is what
I was looking for. We've left 20s now.

2922
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:33,920
I was looking for. We've left 20s now.
 

2923
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,910
I was looking for. We've left 20s now.
Sorry, we've left 90s. We're approaching

2924
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:35,920
Sorry, we've left 90s. We're approaching
 

2925
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,669
Sorry, we've left 90s. We're approaching
trying to get to those 20s. Remember the

2926
01:12:37,669 --> 01:12:37,679
trying to get to those 20s. Remember the
 

2927
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:41,350
trying to get to those 20s. Remember the
20s is the edge of the current weekly

2928
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:41,360
20s is the edge of the current weekly
 

2929
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,630
20s is the edge of the current weekly
developing profile. Right? So this is

2930
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:44,640
developing profile. Right? So this is
 

2931
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,149
developing profile. Right? So this is
exactly what I just talked about. We

2932
01:12:46,149 --> 01:12:46,159
exactly what I just talked about. We
 

2933
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:47,990
exactly what I just talked about. We
leave here, we will try and trade to

2934
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:48,000
leave here, we will try and trade to
 

2935
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,669
leave here, we will try and trade to
this node. If we get through this node,

2936
01:12:49,669 --> 01:12:49,679
this node. If we get through this node,
 

2937
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:51,270
this node. If we get through this node,
we will trade up towards here. This is

2938
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:51,280
we will trade up towards here. This is
 

2939
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,790
we will trade up towards here. This is
the edge of the current week. If we get

2940
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:52,800
the edge of the current week. If we get
 

2941
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,630
the edge of the current week. If we get
through this, there is expansion

2942
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:54,640
through this, there is expansion
 

2943
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,189
through this, there is expansion
possible. The question is, is it going

2944
01:12:57,189 --> 01:12:57,199
possible. The question is, is it going
 

2945
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,550
possible. The question is, is it going
to offer us an opportunity to get

2946
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:58,560
to offer us an opportunity to get
 

2947
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,070
to offer us an opportunity to get
involved? Sometimes we can see the

2948
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:00,080
involved? Sometimes we can see the
 

2949
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,070
involved? Sometimes we can see the
levels and it will not offer us an

2950
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:02,080
levels and it will not offer us an
 

2951
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,510
levels and it will not offer us an
opportunity to get involved. That is

2952
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:03,520
opportunity to get involved. That is
 

2953
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,189
opportunity to get involved. That is
very, very possible. If dips start to

2954
01:13:05,189 --> 01:13:05,199
very, very possible. If dips start to
 

2955
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,030
very, very possible. If dips start to
hold here into 90s, I'm interested. If

2956
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:07,040
hold here into 90s, I'm interested. If
 

2957
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,189
hold here into 90s, I'm interested. If
they don't hold 90s, I'm simply not

2958
01:13:09,189 --> 01:13:09,199
they don't hold 90s, I'm simply not
 

2959
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:10,630
they don't hold 90s, I'm simply not
interested in playing. It just means

2960
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:10,640
interested in playing. It just means
 

2961
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,630
interested in playing. It just means
it's another false break and we come

2962
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:12,640
it's another false break and we come
 

2963
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,310
it's another false break and we come
right back down to what we're starting

2964
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:14,320
right back down to what we're starting
 

2965
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,270
right back down to what we're starting
to see. So, no trade here for me. It's

2966
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:17,280
to see. So, no trade here for me. It's
 

2967
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,870
to see. So, no trade here for me. It's
unfortunate. Like so we missed this

2968
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:18,880
unfortunate. Like so we missed this
 

2969
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,270
unfortunate. Like so we missed this
light drive up, but there's like I said,

2970
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:21,280
light drive up, but there's like I said,
 

2971
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,669
light drive up, but there's like I said,
I would have wanted to see it do this

2972
01:13:23,669 --> 01:13:23,679
I would have wanted to see it do this
 

2973
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:25,910
I would have wanted to see it do this
and it would have been TP1 and then hold

2974
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:25,920
and it would have been TP1 and then hold
 

2975
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,510
and it would have been TP1 and then hold
for TP2 and we would have got stopped

2976
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:27,520
for TP2 and we would have got stopped
 

2977
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:41,990
for TP2 and we would have got stopped
back out

2978
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:42,000

 

2979
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,830

and needs to give above the open. Yeah,

2980
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:43,840
and needs to give above the open. Yeah,
 

2981
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,669
and needs to give above the open. Yeah,
the opening print. That's literally it.

2982
01:13:45,669 --> 01:13:45,679
the opening print. That's literally it.
 

2983
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:47,990
the opening print. That's literally it.
That's the edge of that open print is

2984
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:48,000
That's the edge of that open print is
 

2985
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,910
That's the edge of that open print is
the edge of the current week's

2986
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:49,920
the edge of the current week's
 

2987
01:13:49,920 --> 01:14:00,229
the edge of the current week's
developing node. It's a massive level.

2988
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:00,239

 

2989
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:02,709

All right. So, this is another good

2990
01:14:02,709 --> 01:14:02,719
All right. So, this is another good
 

2991
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:05,430
All right. So, this is another good
example for you where it hits the

2992
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:05,440
example for you where it hits the
 

2993
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,350
example for you where it hits the
levels, but where's the entry? For me,

2994
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:07,360
levels, but where's the entry? For me,
 

2995
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,270
levels, but where's the entry? For me,
there's no entry there. I mean, maybe

2996
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:09,280
there's no entry there. I mean, maybe
 

2997
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,030
there's no entry there. I mean, maybe
some of you like buying breakouts.

2998
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:11,040
some of you like buying breakouts.
 

2999
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,550
some of you like buying breakouts.
There's certainly no way I'm buying a

3000
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:12,560
There's certainly no way I'm buying a
 

3001
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,270
There's certainly no way I'm buying a
breakout here for that move.

3002
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:15,280
breakout here for that move.
 

3003
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,830
breakout here for that move.
So, we're just flat,

3004
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:17,840
So, we're just flat,
 

3005
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,750
So, we're just flat,
you know, and there's clearly passive

3006
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:19,760
you know, and there's clearly passive
 

3007
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,510
you know, and there's clearly passive
selling on the tape. Like, how many guys

3008
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:21,520
selling on the tape. Like, how many guys
 

3009
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:26,070
selling on the tape. Like, how many guys
got stuck in there? 267 lot, 243 lot, 24

3010
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:26,080
got stuck in there? 267 lot, 243 lot, 24
 

3011
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,229
got stuck in there? 267 lot, 243 lot, 24
lot, 12 lot. They all joined from that

3012
01:14:28,229 --> 01:14:28,239
lot, 12 lot. They all joined from that
 

3013
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:30,550
lot, 12 lot. They all joined from that
90 break.

3014
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:30,560
90 break.
 

3015
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,229
90 break.
It's just messy, folks. Like, this is

3016
01:14:32,229 --> 01:14:32,239
It's just messy, folks. Like, this is
 

3017
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,310
It's just messy, folks. Like, this is
barcoding,

3018
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:34,320
barcoding,
 

3019
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:39,189
barcoding,
right? This is barcoding, really.

3020
01:14:39,189 --> 01:14:39,199

 

3021
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:41,189

Oh my gosh.

3022
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:41,199
Oh my gosh.
 

3023
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,430
Oh my gosh.
All right. Oh my gosh. Can't do it. Here

3024
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:43,440
All right. Oh my gosh. Can't do it. Here
 

3025
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,430
All right. Oh my gosh. Can't do it. Here
we go. All right, we're barcoding here.

3026
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:45,440
we go. All right, we're barcoding here.
 

3027
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,790
we go. All right, we're barcoding here.
Most most of what's happening is

3028
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:46,800
Most most of what's happening is
 

3029
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,030
Most most of what's happening is
happening here. Right. Right in here.

3030
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:51,040
happening here. Right. Right in here.
 

3031
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,030
happening here. Right. Right in here.
It's okay not to trade, guys. I know you

3032
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:53,040
It's okay not to trade, guys. I know you
 

3033
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,149
It's okay not to trade, guys. I know you
might be frustrated. You're probably

3034
01:14:54,149 --> 01:14:54,159
might be frustrated. You're probably
 

3035
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:55,350
might be frustrated. You're probably
leaving this channel and you're jumping

3036
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:55,360
leaving this channel and you're jumping
 

3037
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,110
leaving this channel and you're jumping
around to other guys who rip their

3038
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:57,120
around to other guys who rip their
 

3039
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,030
around to other guys who rip their
shirts off. Oh, we're going higher. No,

3040
01:14:59,030 --> 01:14:59,040
shirts off. Oh, we're going higher. No,
 

3041
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,550
shirts off. Oh, we're going higher. No,
we're not. We're going nowhere right

3042
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:00,560
we're not. We're going nowhere right
 

3043
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,030
we're not. We're going nowhere right
now. All right. So, just learn the

3044
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:03,040
now. All right. So, just learn the
 

3045
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,830
now. All right. So, just learn the
discipline to sit still.

3046
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:05,840
discipline to sit still.
 

3047
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,590
discipline to sit still.
Learn the discipline to sit still. It

3048
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:07,600
Learn the discipline to sit still. It
 

3049
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,110
Learn the discipline to sit still. It
will be obvious, right? It's going to be

3050
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:09,120
will be obvious, right? It's going to be
 

3051
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,470
will be obvious, right? It's going to be
really obvious when it wants to do

3052
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:10,480
really obvious when it wants to do
 

3053
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,750
really obvious when it wants to do
something. It's gonna scream at you to

3054
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:13,760
something. It's gonna scream at you to
 

3055
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:22,229
something. It's gonna scream at you to
get involved in it.

3056
01:15:22,229 --> 01:15:22,239

 

3057
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:25,110

So, you got the So, sorry, Alex Damian,

3058
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:25,120
So, you got the So, sorry, Alex Damian,
 

3059
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,669
So, you got the So, sorry, Alex Damian,
I hope I've said your name right. Right.

3060
01:15:27,669 --> 01:15:27,679
I hope I've said your name right. Right.
 

3061
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:29,350
I hope I've said your name right. Right.
You have a bearish sentiment and that's

3062
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:29,360
You have a bearish sentiment and that's
 

3063
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,630
You have a bearish sentiment and that's
that you want to go to the new week

3064
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:30,640
that you want to go to the new week
 

3065
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,790
that you want to go to the new week
opening gap and rejected it. So,

3066
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:32,800
opening gap and rejected it. So,
 

3067
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,910
opening gap and rejected it. So,
shorting retesting it again.

3068
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:35,920
shorting retesting it again.
 

3069
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,709
shorting retesting it again.
Okay. Like if that's your system, then

3070
01:15:38,709 --> 01:15:38,719
Okay. Like if that's your system, then
 

3071
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:40,390
Okay. Like if that's your system, then
that's exactly what you should be doing,

3072
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:40,400
that's exactly what you should be doing,
 

3073
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,510
that's exactly what you should be doing,
my friend. There's nothing wrong with

3074
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:41,520
my friend. There's nothing wrong with
 

3075
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,189
my friend. There's nothing wrong with
that. If that's what you're looking for

3076
01:15:43,189 --> 01:15:43,199
that. If that's what you're looking for
 

3077
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:45,189
that. If that's what you're looking for
and that's the system that pays you, do

3078
01:15:45,189 --> 01:15:45,199
and that's the system that pays you, do
 

3079
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:47,510
and that's the system that pays you, do
what the system pays you, right? Like I

3080
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:47,520
what the system pays you, right? Like I
 

3081
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,070
what the system pays you, right? Like I
said, this is just how I trade. This is

3082
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:50,080
said, this is just how I trade. This is
 

3083
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:54,310
said, this is just how I trade. This is
uh there's no um set rule. There's no

3084
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:54,320
uh there's no um set rule. There's no
 

3085
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:59,590
uh there's no um set rule. There's no
one way to trade

3086
01:15:59,590 --> 01:15:59,600

 

3087
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,950

the moment. If you just think about

3088
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:00,960
the moment. If you just think about
 

3089
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,590
the moment. If you just think about
value, if you're buying all dips here

3090
01:16:03,590 --> 01:16:03,600
value, if you're buying all dips here
 

3091
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,510
value, if you're buying all dips here
and selling all pops here, you're pretty

3092
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:05,520
and selling all pops here, you're pretty
 

3093
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,430
and selling all pops here, you're pretty
good today, aren't you? Buy that, sell

3094
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:07,440
good today, aren't you? Buy that, sell
 

3095
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,310
good today, aren't you? Buy that, sell
that, sell that, buy it back. Buy that,

01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:13,520
right, there's your range. Remember
 

3101
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,709
right, there's your range. Remember
earlier D-shaped profile

01:16:16,709 --> 01:16:16,719
earlier D-shaped profile
 

3103
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:19,350
earlier D-shaped profile
once we leave it

3104
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:19,360
once we leave it
 

3105
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,390
once we leave it
might be more.

3106
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:22,400
might be more.
 

3107
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,430
might be more.
I am going to um

I am going to um
just mark another little node out which

3110
01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:28,239
just mark another little node out which
 

3111
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:31,830
just mark another little node out which
is right here.

3112
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:31,840
is right here.
 

3113
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,470
is right here.
Watch the previous week

3114
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:34,480
Watch the previous week
 

3115
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:45,910
Watch the previous week
here. Same node.

3116
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:45,920

 

3117
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:52,229

Okay,

3118
01:16:52,229 --> 01:16:52,239

 

3119
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:53,910

so another attempt to get back down into

3120
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:53,920
so another attempt to get back down into
 

3121
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:58,149
so another attempt to get back down into
here now.

3122
01:16:58,149 --> 01:16:58,159

 

3123
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,790

Thanks, Alex. Still down trend. Uh,

3124
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:00,800
Thanks, Alex. Still down trend. Uh,
 

3125
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,510
Thanks, Alex. Still down trend. Uh,
yeah, so far on the day, but like zoom

3126
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:03,520
yeah, so far on the day, but like zoom
 

3127
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,790
yeah, so far on the day, but like zoom
out.

3128
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:06,800

 

3129
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,390

Right. I don't think we're backside yet.

3130
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:08,400
Right. I don't think we're backside yet.
 

3131
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,110
Right. I don't think we're backside yet.
I think this is a big drive.

3132
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:11,120
I think this is a big drive.
 

3133
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,030
I think this is a big drive.
All right. And we can absorb here to

3134
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:13,040
All right. And we can absorb here to
 

3135
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,950
All right. And we can absorb here to
rotate here. Where would I consider it

3136
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:14,960
rotate here. Where would I consider it
 

3137
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,550
rotate here. Where would I consider it
backside? Well, probably if we lose

3138
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:16,560
backside? Well, probably if we lose
 

3139
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,270
backside? Well, probably if we lose
this, right? That's where more weakness

3140
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:19,280
this, right? That's where more weakness
 

3141
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:22,390
this, right? That's where more weakness
comes in is under here. That's why I'm

3142
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:22,400
comes in is under here. That's why I'm
 

3143
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:23,830
comes in is under here. That's why I'm
being cautious. Everyone looking for the

3144
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:23,840
being cautious. Everyone looking for the
 

3145
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,350
being cautious. Everyone looking for the
short. That's why I'm being very, very

3146
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:25,360
short. That's why I'm being very, very
 

3147
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,870
short. That's why I'm being very, very
careful because this can be a big

3148
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:28,880
careful because this can be a big
 

3149
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:33,189
careful because this can be a big
buildout to go higher. All right.

3150
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:33,199
buildout to go higher. All right.
 

3151
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:35,910
buildout to go higher. All right.
What's the main move here? It's been

3152
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:35,920
What's the main move here? It's been
 

3153
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,070
What's the main move here? It's been
leaving previous day's value, isn't it?

3154
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:38,080
leaving previous day's value, isn't it?
 

3155
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,910
leaving previous day's value, isn't it?
Leaving previous days value. In fact,

3156
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:39,920
Leaving previous days value. In fact,
 

3157
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,750
Leaving previous days value. In fact,
it's also left previous week's value.

3158
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:41,760
it's also left previous week's value.
 

3159
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,990
it's also left previous week's value.
Previous day value area low. We found a

3160
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:44,000
Previous day value area low. We found a
 

3161
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,550
Previous day value area low. We found a
bid. We reclaim previous week value area

3162
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:46,560
bid. We reclaim previous week value area
 

3163
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,390
bid. We reclaim previous week value area
low. We take out previous day value area

3164
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:48,400
low. We take out previous day value area
 

3165
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,310
low. We take out previous day value area
high. We take out previous week point of

3166
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:50,320
high. We take out previous week point of
 

3167
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,310
high. We take out previous week point of
control. We take out previous week value

3168
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:52,320
control. We take out previous week value
 

3169
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,390
control. We take out previous week value
area high. We drive up. It can find a

3170
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:54,400
area high. We drive up. It can find a
 

3171
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,110
area high. We drive up. It can find a
bid here. This is a strong move which

3172
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:57,120
bid here. This is a strong move which
 

3173
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,950
bid here. This is a strong move which
might have still have continuation. And

3174
01:17:58,950 --> 01:17:58,960
might have still have continuation. And
 

3175
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,189
might have still have continuation. And
yes, maybe we drift down into here, but

3176
01:18:01,189 --> 01:18:01,199
yes, maybe we drift down into here, but
 

3177
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:03,750
yes, maybe we drift down into here, but
I would need to see that first, right?

3178
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:03,760
I would need to see that first, right?
 

3179
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,750
I would need to see that first, right?
That's why I'm being very careful about

3180
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:05,760
That's why I'm being very careful about
 

3181
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,229
That's why I'm being very careful about
thinking about a short. I'm not uh not

3182
01:18:08,229 --> 01:18:08,239
thinking about a short. I'm not uh not
 

3183
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:09,830
thinking about a short. I'm not uh not
too interested in the short right now.

3184
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:09,840
too interested in the short right now.
 

3185
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,110
too interested in the short right now.
I'm going to be very honest with you.

3186
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:11,120
I'm going to be very honest with you.
 

3187
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,390
I'm going to be very honest with you.
All right, initial balance now set 111

3188
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:14,400
All right, initial balance now set 111
 

3189
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,950
All right, initial balance now set 111
points. might be this purple line on the

3190
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:16,960
points. might be this purple line on the
 

3191
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:37,350
points. might be this purple line on the
bottom of your chart.

3192
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:37,360

 

3193
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,070

Felix. Um, depends on the type of

3194
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:40,080
Felix. Um, depends on the type of
 

3195
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,070
Felix. Um, depends on the type of
account, but I would just scale right

3196
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:42,080
account, but I would just scale right
 

3197
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,709
account, but I would just scale right
back to micros. Two to three micros

3198
01:18:44,709 --> 01:18:44,719
back to micros. Two to three micros
 

3199
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,669
back to micros. Two to three micros
gives yourself plenty of room on a 50k

3200
01:18:47,669 --> 01:18:47,679
gives yourself plenty of room on a 50k
 

3201
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:51,430
gives yourself plenty of room on a 50k
account.

3202
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:51,440

 

3203
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,790

Plenty of room.

3204
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:54,800
Plenty of room.
 

3205
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,189
Plenty of room.
If you go to minis, unless you're like a

3206
01:18:57,189 --> 01:18:57,199
If you go to minis, unless you're like a
 

3207
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:58,870
If you go to minis, unless you're like a
good trader and you're looking to like

3208
01:18:58,870 --> 01:18:58,880
good trader and you're looking to like
 

3209
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,430
good trader and you're looking to like
aggressively pass them,

3210
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:01,440
aggressively pass them,
 

3211
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,350
aggressively pass them,
which is, yeah, I'll be honest, I often

3212
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:03,360
which is, yeah, I'll be honest, I often
 

3213
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,350
which is, yeah, I'll be honest, I often
do that. I can be aggressive with minis

3214
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:05,360
do that. I can be aggressive with minis
 

3215
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:09,350
do that. I can be aggressive with minis
on evals, just get them past um because

3216
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:09,360
on evals, just get them past um because
 

3217
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,870
on evals, just get them past um because
I don't want what I would call time

3218
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:10,880
I don't want what I would call time
 

3219
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,550
I don't want what I would call time
decay sitting in them too long, but I

3220
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:12,560
decay sitting in them too long, but I
 

3221
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,910
decay sitting in them too long, but I
wouldn't advise that unless you know you

3222
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:13,920
wouldn't advise that unless you know you
 

3223
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,630
wouldn't advise that unless you know you
can you've got a good shot at pass them

3224
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:16,640
can you've got a good shot at pass them
 

3225
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,390
can you've got a good shot at pass them
if you're a newer trader. And definitely

3226
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:18,400
if you're a newer trader. And definitely
 

3227
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,790
if you're a newer trader. And definitely
if they're PA down to micros. Okay,

3228
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:20,800
if they're PA down to micros. Okay,
 

3229
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,310
if they're PA down to micros. Okay,
here's the rotation again. So another

3230
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:22,320
here's the rotation again. So another
 

3231
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,790
here's the rotation again. So another
failed look below underneath value area

3232
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:24,800
failed look below underneath value area
 

3233
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,470
failed look below underneath value area
low still being absorbed. We have

3234
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:26,480
low still being absorbed. We have
 

3235
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,630
low still being absorbed. We have
negative delta. So sellside delta came

3236
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:28,640
negative delta. So sellside delta came
 

3237
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,630
negative delta. So sellside delta came
in there at 860s. So 860s we had when is

3238
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:32,640
in there at 860s. So 860s we had when is
 

3239
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:36,310
in there at 860s. So 860s we had when is
this guy

3240
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:36,320

 

3241
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,790

190 lot at 860

3242
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:38,800
190 lot at 860
 

3243
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,070
190 lot at 860
sellside and we've got 194 lot buyer sat

3244
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:42,080
sellside and we've got 194 lot buyer sat
 

3245
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,709
sellside and we've got 194 lot buyer sat
there now. So that's a level right now

3246
01:19:44,709 --> 01:19:44,719
there now. So that's a level right now
 

3247
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:46,870
there now. So that's a level right now
that I'm watching carefully to see if we

3248
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:46,880

interact back down there.

3250

3251
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,350

Is there a trading system that isn't

3252
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:55,360
Is there a trading system that isn't
 

3253
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,870
Is there a trading system that isn't
yours that you're envious of? I don't

have envy for systems. It doesn't matter

3256
01:19:59,030 --> 01:19:59,040
have envy for systems. It doesn't matter
 

3257
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,430
have envy for systems. It doesn't matter
what a system is. All you got to do your

3258
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:01,440
what a system is. All you got to do your
 

3259
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,910
what a system is. All you got to do your
job is to make money. Job is not to

01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:03,920
job is to make money. Job is not to
 

3261
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:09,590

01:20:09,590 --> 01:20:09,600
gloat, not to to shout on social media.
 

3263
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,110
gloat, not to to shout on social media.
Your job as a trader is just to make

3264
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:11,120
Your job as a trader is just to make
 

3265
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,189
Your job as a trader is just to make
money and get off the charts, right? So

3266
01:20:13,189 --> 01:20:13,199
money and get off the charts, right? So
 

3267
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:16,149

3269
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:18,870

3271
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,790
and I love teaching my system to other
people and developing it and refining it

3272
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:20,800
people and developing it and refining it
 

3273
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,950
people and developing it and refining it
and that never stops. Like the moment

3274
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:22,960
and that never stops. Like the moment
 

3275
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,390
and that never stops. Like the moment
you think you're smarter than the market

3276
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:24,400
you think you're smarter than the market
 

3277
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:28,390
you think you're smarter than the market
is the moment you will lose it all.

3278
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:28,400
is the moment you will lose it all.
 

3279
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,070
is the moment you will lose it all.

is we have to be aware the current week
 

3513
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:13,669

01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:13,679
developing profile. This is a huge
 

3515
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:16,070
developing profile. This is a huge
level, right? Once we get over this, all

01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:26,800
big level. If we can base over that, we
 

3527
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,629
big level. If we can base over that, we
have a shot. All right, if we can base

3539
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,709

Just be careful because ES has taken out

3540
01:26:50,709 --> 01:26:50,719
Just be careful because ES has taken out
 

3541
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:52,870
Just be careful because ES has taken out
its high day.

3542
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:52,880
its high day.
 

3543
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:56,790
its high day.
VIX trading at lows 1550 out. I'm done.

3544
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:56,800
VIX trading at lows 1550 out. I'm done.
 

3545
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,310
VIX trading at lows 1550 out. I'm done.
I'm done. Not holding through that. All

3546
01:26:58,310 --> 01:26:58,320
I'm done. Not holding through that. All
 

3547
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,550
I'm done. Not holding through that. All
right. Not bad though. Not bad. I can

3548
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:00,560
right. Not bad though. Not bad. I can
 

3549
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,870
right. Not bad though. Not bad. I can
always read if we start to prove. I just

3550
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:02,880
always read if we start to prove. I just
 

3551
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,629
always read if we start to prove. I just
don't really want it to come all the way

3552
01:27:04,629 --> 01:27:04,639
don't really want it to come all the way
 

3553
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:06,229
don't really want it to come all the way
back down into this node here. This is

3554
01:27:06,229 --> 01:27:06,239
back down into this node here. This is
 

3555
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,229
back down into this node here. This is
why I was wanted it to hold this right

3556
01:27:08,229 --> 01:27:08,239
why I was wanted it to hold this right
 

3557
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:13,510
why I was wanted it to hold this right
here.

3558
01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:13,520

 

3559
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:19,750

So that edge at 25s is a huge level.

3560
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:19,760

 

3561
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,430

The discipline to cut here can always

3562
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:21,440
The discipline to cut here can always
 

3563
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,709
The discipline to cut here can always
get back in. That's the other thing

3564
01:27:22,709 --> 01:27:22,719
get back in. That's the other thing
 

3565
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:25,510
get back in. That's the other thing
folks like you can always get back into

3566
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:25,520
folks like you can always get back into
 

3567
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:34,229
folks like you can always get back into
the trade.

3568
01:27:34,229 --> 01:27:34,239

 

3569
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:37,270

That next shelf is key down here. Buyers

3570
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:37,280
That next shelf is key down here. Buyers
 

3571
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,590
That next shelf is key down here. Buyers
stepped in at 8.87. 87 earlier on this

3572
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:39,600
stepped in at 8.87. 87 earlier on this
 

3573
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,790
stepped in at 8.87. 87 earlier on this
drive up and a seller got caught there

3574
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:42,800
drive up and a seller got caught there
 

3575
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,550
drive up and a seller got caught there
at 60 65 lot. He got caught at 86 and

3576
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:46,560
at 60 65 lot. He got caught at 86 and
 

3577
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,870
at 60 65 lot. He got caught at 86 and
100 lot got caught at 78. We're still

3578
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:48,880
100 lot got caught at 78. We're still
 

3579
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:51,270
100 lot got caught at 78. We're still
bidding off it.

3580
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:51,280
bidding off it.
 

3581
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:52,870
bidding off it.
Did I not give that enough room to

3582
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:52,880
Did I not give that enough room to
 

3583
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,870
Did I not give that enough room to
breathe? Possibly.

3584
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:54,880
breathe? Possibly.
 

3585
01:27:54,880 --> 01:28:02,390
breathe? Possibly.
Possibly.

3586
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:02,400

 

3587
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,149

That's my indicator telling you to buy

3588
01:28:04,149 --> 01:28:04,159
That's my indicator telling you to buy
 

3589
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:08,629
That's my indicator telling you to buy
there. That's That's the flow zone pro.

3590
01:28:08,629 --> 01:28:08,639

 

3591
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:10,310

is actually where I bought. I didn't use

3592
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:10,320
is actually where I bought. I didn't use
 

3593
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,830
is actually where I bought. I didn't use
the indicator for it, but it is where I

3594
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:11,840
the indicator for it, but it is where I
 

3595
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,750
the indicator for it, but it is where I
bought because we'd reclaim flow zones

3596
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:13,760
bought because we'd reclaim flow zones
 

3597
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,229
bought because we'd reclaim flow zones
and we broke through 90s and we trapped

3598
01:28:16,229 --> 01:28:16,239
and we broke through 90s and we trapped
 

3599
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:20,070
and we broke through 90s and we trapped
sellers. So, the key for me was we

3600
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:20,080
sellers. So, the key for me was we
 

3601
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,830
sellers. So, the key for me was we
trapped sellers right here. Someone

3602
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:21,840
trapped sellers right here. Someone
 

3603
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,510
trapped sellers right here. Someone
asked me earlier about it. We trapped

3604
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:23,520
asked me earlier about it. We trapped
 

3605
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:25,510
asked me earlier about it. We trapped
sellers into 90s. So, once they were out

3606
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:25,520
sellers into 90s. So, once they were out
 

3607
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,189
sellers into 90s. So, once they were out
of position, we got this squeeze up. We

3608
01:28:27,189 --> 01:28:27,199
of position, we got this squeeze up. We
 

3609
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:29,669
of position, we got this squeeze up. We
need to break back above 25s now to get

3610
01:28:29,669 --> 01:28:29,679
need to break back above 25s now to get
 

3611
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:32,629
need to break back above 25s now to get
up to those 50s. It's it's doable. If we

3612
01:28:32,629 --> 01:28:32,639
up to those 50s. It's it's doable. If we
 

3613
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:35,510
up to those 50s. It's it's doable. If we
rebase here, it's doable. What you want

3614
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:35,520
rebase here, it's doable. What you want
 

3615
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,590
rebase here, it's doable. What you want
to see here is a new buildout of

3616
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:37,600
to see here is a new buildout of
 

3617
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,550
to see here is a new buildout of
liquidity in this range, right? Low

3618
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:40,560
liquidity in this range, right? Low
 

3619
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,149
liquidity in this range, right? Low
volume nodes held as support. That's

3620
01:28:42,149 --> 01:28:42,159
volume nodes held as support. That's
 

3621
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:43,910
volume nodes held as support. That's
good. We've reclaimed this. You want to

3622
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:43,920
good. We've reclaimed this. You want to
 

3623
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,510
good. We've reclaimed this. You want to
see this. You want to see this move

3624
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:45,520
see this. You want to see this move
 

3625
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,590
see this. You want to see this move
here. Now,

3626
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:47,600
here. Now,
 

3627
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,110
here. Now,
you do not want it to come back down

3628
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:49,120
you do not want it to come back down
 

3629
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,950
you do not want it to come back down
into here. It's got no reason to come

3630
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:50,960
into here. It's got no reason to come
 

3631
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,390
into here. It's got no reason to come
back down into there. We've already

3632
01:28:52,390 --> 01:28:52,400
back down into there. We've already
 

3633
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,310
back down into there. We've already
trapped. It should not be coming back

3634
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:54,320
trapped. It should not be coming back
 

3635
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,669
trapped. It should not be coming back
down into there again. It's tapped it

3636
01:28:55,669 --> 01:28:55,679
down into there again. It's tapped it
 

3637
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:57,990
down into there again. It's tapped it
once. It doesn't need to do it. It's

3638
01:28:57,990 --> 01:28:58,000
once. It doesn't need to do it. It's
 

3639
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,189
once. It doesn't need to do it. It's
already filled. There's a buy side

3640
01:28:59,189 --> 01:28:59,199
already filled. There's a buy side
 

3641
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:01,350
already filled. There's a buy side
imbalance in here. It's already filled

3642
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:01,360
imbalance in here. It's already filled
 

3643
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:04,149
imbalance in here. It's already filled
it. It doesn't need to to do it again.

3644
01:29:04,149 --> 01:29:04,159
it. It doesn't need to to do it again.
 

3645
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:06,390
it. It doesn't need to to do it again.
There is actually a sellside balance up

3646
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:06,400
There is actually a sellside balance up
 

3647
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:09,189
There is actually a sellside balance up
at 15s that you need to be aware of

3648
01:29:09,189 --> 01:29:09,199
at 15s that you need to be aware of
 

3649
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:18,709
at 15s that you need to be aware of
right here.

3650
01:29:18,709 --> 01:29:18,719

 

3651
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:20,470

I enjoy your show. I did well today.

3652
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:20,480
I enjoy your show. I did well today.
 

3653
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:29,030
I enjoy your show. I did well today.
Awesome. Nice work, man.

3654
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:29,040

 

3655
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,950

That chart. No, that's Ninja Trader. the

3656
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:30,960
That chart. No, that's Ninja Trader. the
 

3657
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:38,470
That chart. No, that's Ninja Trader. the
chart you just saw.

3658
01:29:38,470 --> 01:29:38,480

 

3659
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:45,910

Oh my gosh, it's so slow.

3660
01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:45,920

 

3661
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:53,510

Painfully slow.

3662
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:53,520

 

3663
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:56,629

It's both. This is New York view.

3664
01:29:56,629 --> 01:29:56,639
It's both. This is New York view.
 

3665
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:59,590
It's both. This is New York view.
Daily VW's down here. So why New York VW

3666
01:29:59,590 --> 01:29:59,600
Daily VW's down here. So why New York VW
 

3667
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,510
Daily VW's down here. So why New York VW
up? There's a whole video on New York

3668
01:30:01,510 --> 01:30:01,520
up? There's a whole video on New York
 

3669
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,510
up? There's a whole video on New York
View up and the importance of cash. But

3670
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:03,520
View up and the importance of cash. But
 

3671
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,910
View up and the importance of cash. But
if you think about where does most the

3672
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:05,920
if you think about where does most the
 

3673
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:09,270
if you think about where does most the
volume come in,

3674
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:09,280
volume come in,
 

3675
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,350
volume come in,
where's the volume coming in from 9:30,

3676
01:30:11,350 --> 01:30:11,360
where's the volume coming in from 9:30,
 

3677
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,510
where's the volume coming in from 9:30,
right? So where am I interested in? I'm

3678
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:13,520
right? So where am I interested in? I'm
 

3679
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:16,310
right? So where am I interested in? I'm
interested in the average

3680
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:16,320
interested in the average
 

3681
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,149
interested in the average
participation of buyers and sellers

3682
01:30:18,149 --> 01:30:18,159
participation of buyers and sellers
 

3683
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:19,830
participation of buyers and sellers
based on where volume comes in, which is

3684
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:19,840
based on where volume comes in, which is
 

3685
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:33,030
based on where volume comes in, which is
why New York view is important.

3686
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:33,040

 

3687
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:36,629

chop best. Yeah, is a little bit. Do I

3688
01:30:36,629 --> 01:30:36,639
chop best. Yeah, is a little bit. Do I
 

3689
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:39,189
chop best. Yeah, is a little bit. Do I
have a video on YouTube chart setup? Uh,

3690
01:30:39,189 --> 01:30:39,199
have a video on YouTube chart setup? Uh,
 

3691
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:40,950
have a video on YouTube chart setup? Uh,
there's one for Ninja Trader. I'm not

3692
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:40,960
there's one for Ninja Trader. I'm not
 

3693
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,950
there's one for Ninja Trader. I'm not
sure if there is one for Trading View.

3694
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:42,960
sure if there is one for Trading View.
 

3695
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,310
sure if there is one for Trading View.
Maybe there is. I'm not sure. Can't

3696
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:44,320
Maybe there is. I'm not sure. Can't
 

3697
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,149
Maybe there is. I'm not sure. Can't
remember. It's been a while. There's

3698
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:46,159
remember. It's been a while. There's
 

3699
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:51,350
remember. It's been a while. There's
definitely one for Ninja Trader.

3700
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:51,360

 

3701
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:55,590

Don't think I want to rebid down here.

3702
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:55,600
Don't think I want to rebid down here.
 

3703
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,350
Don't think I want to rebid down here.
I don't think I want to rebid it. It's

3704
01:30:57,350 --> 01:30:57,360
I don't think I want to rebid it. It's
 

3705
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:58,790
I don't think I want to rebid it. It's
very possible they hold and rip it, but

3706
01:30:58,790 --> 01:30:58,800
very possible they hold and rip it, but
 

3707
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,790
very possible they hold and rip it, but
I'm not too keen on the rebid. They

3708
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:00,800
I'm not too keen on the rebid. They
 

3709
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:01,990
I'm not too keen on the rebid. They
should have done the move. The fact that

3710
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:02,000
should have done the move. The fact that
 

3711
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,189
should have done the move. The fact that
they rejected 25 says to me that we're

3712
01:31:05,189 --> 01:31:05,199
they rejected 25 says to me that we're
 

3713
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:09,030
they rejected 25 says to me that we're
staying inside this uh Vshape. And uh we

3714
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:09,040
staying inside this uh Vshape. And uh we
 

3715
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,550
staying inside this uh Vshape. And uh we
all know Alex doesn't like trading

3716
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:10,560
all know Alex doesn't like trading
 

3717
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:13,189
all know Alex doesn't like trading
rotations.

3718
01:31:13,189 --> 01:31:13,199
rotations.
 

3719
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:15,830
rotations.
Is that a separate VWOP? Yes, it is a

3720
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:15,840
Is that a separate VWOP? Yes, it is a
 

3721
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,430
Is that a separate VWOP? Yes, it is a
separate VWOP. And you can just anchor

3722
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:17,440
separate VWOP. And you can just anchor
 

3723
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,590
separate VWOP. And you can just anchor
it. You can just use an anchor volume um

3724
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:19,600
it. You can just use an anchor volume um
 

3725
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,830
it. You can just use an anchor volume um
anchored VW to the 930 open. I'm very

3726
01:31:21,830 --> 01:31:21,840
anchored VW to the 930 open. I'm very
 

3727
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:24,229
anchored VW to the 930 open. I'm very
fortunate. Someone in my community made

3728
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:24,239
fortunate. Someone in my community made
 

3729
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:29,510
fortunate. Someone in my community made
us a uh a New York view up for the flow

3730
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:29,520
us a uh a New York view up for the flow
 

3731
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,110
us a uh a New York view up for the flow
zone community for free, which is very

3732
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:31,120
zone community for free, which is very
 

3733
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:42,470
zone community for free, which is very
kind of them.

3734
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:42,480

 

3735
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,470

I'm either too conservative or too

3736
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:44,480
I'm either too conservative or too
 

3737
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:47,350
I'm either too conservative or too
aggressive. Hence the question, what

3738
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:47,360
aggressive. Hence the question, what
 

3739
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:51,590
aggressive. Hence the question, what
your regular position size is on a 50k.

3740
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:51,600
your regular position size is on a 50k.
 

3741
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,470
your regular position size is on a 50k.
Um, okay. The the problem with that

3742
01:31:54,470 --> 01:31:54,480
Um, okay. The the problem with that
 

3743
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,149
Um, okay. The the problem with that
question, Felix, is you're not taking

3744
01:31:56,149 --> 01:31:56,159
question, Felix, is you're not taking
 

3745
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:58,070
question, Felix, is you're not taking
into account the potential of the move

3746
01:31:58,070 --> 01:31:58,080
into account the potential of the move
 

3747
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,390
into account the potential of the move
in front of you and the ATR. So, if

3748
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:00,400
in front of you and the ATR. So, if
 

3749
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,470
in front of you and the ATR. So, if
you're sizing the same for every single

3750
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:02,480
you're sizing the same for every single
 

3751
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:04,470
you're sizing the same for every single
trade, but the volatility is different

3752
01:32:04,470 --> 01:32:04,480
trade, but the volatility is different
 

3753
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,350
trade, but the volatility is different
and your ATR is different, then you're

3754
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:07,360
and your ATR is different, then you're
 

3755
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,189
and your ATR is different, then you're
going to get caught because if you have,

3756
01:32:09,189 --> 01:32:09,199
going to get caught because if you have,
 

3757
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:10,950
going to get caught because if you have,
let's say, a 20 point stop loss every

3758
01:32:10,950 --> 01:32:10,960
let's say, a 20 point stop loss every
 

3759
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,189
let's say, a 20 point stop loss every
day, and we're in a day where we're in,

3760
01:32:13,189 --> 01:32:13,199
day, and we're in a day where we're in,
 

3761
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:15,350
day, and we're in a day where we're in,
you know, high volatility, maybe VIX is

3762
01:32:15,350 --> 01:32:15,360
you know, high volatility, maybe VIX is
 

3763
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:18,550
you know, high volatility, maybe VIX is
at 18, 19, 20s, your 20 point stop loss

3764
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:18,560
at 18, 19, 20s, your 20 point stop loss
 

3765
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,310
at 18, 19, 20s, your 20 point stop loss
isn't going to mean diddly squat, right?

3766
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:20,320
isn't going to mean diddly squat, right?
 

3767
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:23,910
isn't going to mean diddly squat, right?
So, you have to understand that you

3768
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:23,920
So, you have to understand that you
 

3769
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,070
So, you have to understand that you
should be positioning based on where

3770
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:26,080
should be positioning based on where
 

3771
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,510
should be positioning based on where
you're trying to get the market to move

3772
01:32:27,510 --> 01:32:27,520
you're trying to get the market to move
 

3773
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,030
you're trying to get the market to move
from. Now, if you're going to start, if

3774
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:29,040
from. Now, if you're going to start, if
 

3775
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,310
from. Now, if you're going to start, if
you're newer and you want to start with

3776
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:30,320
you're newer and you want to start with
 

3777
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,790
you're newer and you want to start with
a fixed position sizing, then just size

3778
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:32,800
a fixed position sizing, then just size
 

3779
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,189
a fixed position sizing, then just size
down and try and understand where the

3780
01:32:35,189 --> 01:32:35,199
down and try and understand where the
 

3781
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:36,790
down and try and understand where the
market's trying to go to. Or if you're

3782
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:36,800
market's trying to go to. Or if you're
 

3783
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,229
market's trying to go to. Or if you're
going to be a scalper, maybe you're

3784
01:32:38,229 --> 01:32:38,239
going to be a scalper, maybe you're
 

3785
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:41,270
going to be a scalper, maybe you're
you're risking 30 to make 30. I don't

3786
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:41,280
you're risking 30 to make 30. I don't
 

3787
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,790
you're risking 30 to make 30. I don't
know.

3788
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:42,800
know.
 

3789
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,030
know.
But if you don't understand position

3790
01:32:45,030 --> 01:32:45,040
But if you don't understand position
 

3791
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:47,910
But if you don't understand position
sizing versus ATR and volatility or

3792
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:47,920
sizing versus ATR and volatility or
 

3793
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,590
sizing versus ATR and volatility or
where liquidity sat, you're going to

3794
01:32:49,590 --> 01:32:49,600
where liquidity sat, you're going to
 

3795
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:53,270
where liquidity sat, you're going to
find it hard. I see other traders,

3796
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:53,280
find it hard. I see other traders,
 

3797
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:56,790
find it hard. I see other traders,
big big streamers put on like one mini

3798
01:32:56,790 --> 01:32:56,800
big big streamers put on like one mini
 

3799
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,870
big big streamers put on like one mini
to scalp

3800
01:32:58,870 --> 01:32:58,880
to scalp
 

3801
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,590
to scalp
10, 20, 30 points or maybe even less,

3802
01:33:01,590 --> 01:33:01,600
10, 20, 30 points or maybe even less,
 

3803
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,669
10, 20, 30 points or maybe even less,
probably more like eight points at the

3804
01:33:03,669 --> 01:33:03,679
probably more like eight points at the
 

3805
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:05,110
probably more like eight points at the
start of the day, but they're not

3806
01:33:05,110 --> 01:33:05,120
start of the day, but they're not
 

3807
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:06,870
start of the day, but they're not
understanding the volatility of that

3808
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:06,880
understanding the volatility of that
 

3809
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,470
understanding the volatility of that
market and then we'll get wicked out

3810
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:08,480
market and then we'll get wicked out
 

3811
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:16,070
market and then we'll get wicked out
very quick. So,

3812
01:33:16,070 --> 01:33:16,080

 

3813
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:17,830

thank you. I've been watching for three
weeks to learn futures. I've been a

01:33:20,149 --> 01:33:20,159
weeks to learn futures. I've been a
 

3817
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:21,669
weeks to learn futures. I've been a
swing trader and passed two Apex

Congratulations.

3824
01:33:27,189 --> 01:33:27,199
Congratulations.

Congratulations.
In a lucid end of day draw down, if

3826
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:29,600
In a lucid end of day draw down, if
 

3827
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,550
In a lucid end of day draw down, if
during your day your account goes below

3828
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:32,560
during your day your account goes below
 

3829
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:35,750
during your day your account goes below
the minimum, do you automatically fail?

3830
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:35,760
the minimum, do you automatically fail?
 

3831
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,790
the minimum, do you automatically fail?
Uh, yeah, I think so. So if you go over

3832
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:38,800
Uh, yeah, I think so. So if you go over
 

3833
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,990
Uh, yeah, I think so. So if you go over
the the hard stop, yes, my understanding

3834
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:42,000
the the hard stop, yes, my understanding
 

3835
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,709
the the hard stop, yes, my understanding
is yes. I think I asked this before, but

3836
01:33:44,709 --> 01:33:44,719
is yes. I think I asked this before, but
 

3837
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:46,310
is yes. I think I asked this before, but
is there a setting or indicator that

3838
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:46,320
is there a setting or indicator that
 

3839
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:49,270
is there a setting or indicator that
automatically sets the open

3840
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:49,280
automatically sets the open
 

3841
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:53,990
automatically sets the open
and close for the day? Um,

3842
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:54,000
and close for the day? Um,
 

3843
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,510
and close for the day? Um,
there probably is. My flow zone

3844
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:55,520
there probably is. My flow zone
 

3845
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,110
there probably is. My flow zone
indicator would do it for you, but if

3846
01:33:57,110 --> 01:33:57,120
indicator would do it for you, but if
 

3847
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,030
indicator would do it for you, but if
not, you could probably just do it in

3848
01:33:59,030 --> 01:33:59,040
not, you could probably just do it in
 

3849
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,590
not, you could probably just do it in
the settings, I would imagine.

3850
01:34:01,590 --> 01:34:01,600
the settings, I would imagine.
 

3851
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,510
the settings, I would imagine.
Um, there's probably a way of just doing

3852
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:03,520
Um, there's probably a way of just doing
 

3853
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,830
Um, there's probably a way of just doing
it in here. Status line. I'm sure

3854
01:34:05,830 --> 01:34:05,840
it in here. Status line. I'm sure
 

3855
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,669
it in here. Status line. I'm sure
there'll be a way of of doing it, but

3856
01:34:07,669 --> 01:34:07,679
there'll be a way of of doing it, but
 

3857
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:10,870
there'll be a way of of doing it, but
but uh yeah, there they will without no

3858
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:10,880
but uh yeah, there they will without no
 

3859
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,070
but uh yeah, there they will without no
question of a doubt there will be a

3860
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:12,080
question of a doubt there will be a
 

3861
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:15,910
question of a doubt there will be a
setting for it. Um

3862
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:15,920
setting for it. Um
 

3863
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:18,070
setting for it. Um
which you could automatically put on you

3864
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:18,080
which you could automatically put on you
 

3865
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,510
which you could automatically put on you
just just search for it and indicate.

3866
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:19,520
just just search for it and indicate.
 

3867
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,870
just just search for it and indicate.
Just Google it and you'll probably find

3868
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:20,880
Just Google it and you'll probably find
 

3869
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,709
Just Google it and you'll probably find
it. This is why I didn't want to rebid

3870
01:34:22,709 --> 01:34:22,719
it. This is why I didn't want to rebid
 

3871
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:25,590
it. This is why I didn't want to rebid
because they failed that up here again

3872
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:25,600
because they failed that up here again
 

3873
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,750
because they failed that up here again
the 25s. So we come back down to value

3874
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:27,760
the 25s. So we come back down to value
 

3875
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,510
the 25s. So we come back down to value
area high. If they lose this kind of

3876
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:29,520
area high. If they lose this kind of
 

3877
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:30,950
area high. If they lose this kind of
area here, there's probably a deeper

3878
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:30,960
area here, there's probably a deeper
 

3879
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,270
area here, there's probably a deeper
rotation. All right, because we've now

3880
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:33,280
rotation. All right, because we've now
 

3881
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,669
rotation. All right, because we've now
had a failed break. And if we lose this

3882
01:34:35,669 --> 01:34:35,679
had a failed break. And if we lose this
 

3883
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:37,189
had a failed break. And if we lose this
area now, there'll probably be a deeper

3884
01:34:37,189 --> 01:34:37,199
area now, there'll probably be a deeper
 

3885
01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:45,910
area now, there'll probably be a deeper
rotation.

3886
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:45,920

 

3887
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,270

Vic starting to find a bit of a bid

3888
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:47,280
Vic starting to find a bit of a bid
 

3889
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,990
Vic starting to find a bit of a bid
here. Now

3890
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:50,000
here. Now
 

3891
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,310
here. Now
the next pivot for VIX is really 1611.

3892
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:54,320
the next pivot for VIX is really 1611.
 

3893
01:34:54,320 --> 01:35:01,430
the next pivot for VIX is really 1611.
It's got room. It has got room.

3894
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:01,440

 

3895
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:02,470

All right. Right. So, previous week

3896
01:35:02,470 --> 01:35:02,480
All right. Right. So, previous week
 

3897
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,310
All right. Right. So, previous week
value area high tagged this little node

3898
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:04,320
value area high tagged this little node
 

3899
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,629
value area high tagged this little node
here tagged. If we fail this then you

3900
01:35:06,629 --> 01:35:06,639
here tagged. If we fail this then you
 

3901
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:11,270
here tagged. If we fail this then you
know maybe 775 750s.

3902
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:11,280
know maybe 775 750s.
 

3903
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,629
know maybe 775 750s.
This is the previous week value area

3904
01:35:12,629 --> 01:35:12,639
This is the previous week value area
 

3905
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:14,149
This is the previous week value area
high. The question is do they bid down

3906
01:35:14,149 --> 01:35:14,159
high. The question is do they bid down
 

3907
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:15,669
high. The question is do they bid down
here? I don't know folks. I don't know

3908
01:35:15,669 --> 01:35:15,679
here? I don't know folks. I don't know
 

3909
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:18,229
here? I don't know folks. I don't know
if they do. We can just sit and watch

3910
01:35:18,229 --> 01:35:18,239
if they do. We can just sit and watch
 

3911
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:19,830
if they do. We can just sit and watch
now for a minute. But momentum

3912
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:19,840
now for a minute. But momentum
 

3913
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:22,790
now for a minute. But momentum
definitely came strong off this rotation

3914
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:22,800
definitely came strong off this rotation
 

3915
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,110
definitely came strong off this rotation
of 25s. All right. So, we're 100 points

3916
01:35:25,110 --> 01:35:25,120
of 25s. All right. So, we're 100 points
 

3917
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:28,149
of 25s. All right. So, we're 100 points
down already back into this area.

3918
01:35:28,149 --> 01:35:28,159
down already back into this area.
 

3919
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:30,070
down already back into this area.
And if we lose this, we've got other

3920
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:30,080
And if we lose this, we've got other
 

3921
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,990
And if we lose this, we've got other
blocks and nodes down below that we can

3922
01:35:31,990 --> 01:35:32,000
blocks and nodes down below that we can
 

3923
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,750
blocks and nodes down below that we can
look at. But question is, are we going

3924
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:33,760
look at. But question is, are we going
 

3925
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:36,229
look at. But question is, are we going
to base above previous week's value or

3926
01:35:36,229 --> 01:35:36,239
to base above previous week's value or
 

3927
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:37,990
to base above previous week's value or
not? If we're not, it means there's no

3928
01:35:37,990 --> 01:35:38,000
not? If we're not, it means there's no
 

3929
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,990
not? If we're not, it means there's no
acceptance above previous week's value.

3930
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:40,000
acceptance above previous week's value.
 

3931
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,470
acceptance above previous week's value.
Previous week's value comes all the way

3932
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:42,480
Previous week's value comes all the way
 

3933
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:45,510
Previous week's value comes all the way
down to here, right? And previous days

3934
01:35:45,510 --> 01:35:45,520
down to here, right? And previous days
 

3935
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,110
down to here, right? And previous days
value area high is here. And this right

3936
01:35:47,110 --> 01:35:47,120
value area high is here. And this right
 

3937
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:49,510
value area high is here. And this right
here is your gap,

3938
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:49,520
here is your gap,
 

3939
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,189
here is your gap,
right? So if they lose this, they might

3940
01:35:51,189 --> 01:35:51,199
right? So if they lose this, they might
 

3941
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:53,110
right? So if they lose this, they might
check this. Maybe they reclaim this and

3942
01:35:53,110 --> 01:35:53,120
check this. Maybe they reclaim this and
 

3943
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:55,350
check this. Maybe they reclaim this and
squeeze. If they lose this, then they

3944
01:35:55,350 --> 01:35:55,360
squeeze. If they lose this, then they
 

3945
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:56,950
squeeze. If they lose this, then they
probably go gap fill and test these

3946
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:56,960
probably go gap fill and test these
 

3947
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,149
probably go gap fill and test these
areas.

3948
01:35:58,149 --> 01:35:58,159
areas.
 

3949
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:00,790
areas.
because we're in a rotation

3950
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:00,800
because we're in a rotation
 

3951
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:01,990
because we're in a rotation
right now. We're going to come back

3952
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:02,000
right now. We're going to come back
 

3953
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,910
right now. We're going to come back
probably test these sort of 60s initial

3954
01:36:03,910 --> 01:36:03,920
probably test these sort of 60s initial
 

3955
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:05,750
probably test these sort of 60s initial
balance. This is a look below so far of

3956
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:05,760
balance. This is a look below so far of
 

3957
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,229
balance. This is a look below so far of
IB, but it's only been for a minute. And

3958
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:08,239
IB, but it's only been for a minute. And
 

3959
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:09,990
IB, but it's only been for a minute. And
give it a bit of time to develop here, I

3960
01:36:09,990 --> 01:36:10,000
give it a bit of time to develop here, I
 

3961
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,590
give it a bit of time to develop here, I
think.

3962
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:11,600
think.
 

3963
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,750
think.
Apple now gone red. Google now 1% down.

3964

Apple now gone red. Google now 1% down.
 

3965

3967
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,390
Microsoft 0.27% down. Nvidia losing
about a percent off its peak today now.

3968
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:20,400
about a percent off its peak today now.

about a percent off its peak today now.
So, you're starting to see this market

3970
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:21,600
So, you're starting to see this market
 

3971
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:36,709
So, you're starting to see this market
pull back a bit.

3972
01:36:36,709 --> 01:36:36,719

 

3973
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:40,149

Hey Joe, no nothing. No external

01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:43,520
mate. If you're using top step X which
 

3979

is I assume what you mean you can't use

3980
01:36:46,149 --> 01:36:46,159
is I assume what you mean you can't use
 

3981
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:47,990
is I assume what you mean you can't use
a third party indicator. You can only

3982
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:48,000
a third party indicator. You can only
 

3983
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:58,550
a third party indicator. You can only
use what they provide.

3984
01:36:58,550 --> 01:36:58,560

 

3985
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,790

Jason just nuked a funded account on my

3986
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:00,800
Jason just nuked a funded account on my
 

3987
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,470
Jason just nuked a funded account on my
first trade. Ouch, that sucks. I should

3988
01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:02,480
first trade. Ouch, that sucks. I should
 

3989
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:04,229
first trade. Ouch, that sucks. I should
have taken a loss sooner. Well, yeah,

3990
01:37:04,229 --> 01:37:04,239
have taken a loss sooner. Well, yeah,
 

3991
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:05,430
have taken a loss sooner. Well, yeah,
you should have either taken a loss

3992
01:37:05,430 --> 01:37:05,440
you should have either taken a loss
 

3993
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:08,310
you should have either taken a loss
sooner or under or size down. Sounds

3994
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:08,320
sooner or under or size down. Sounds
 

3995
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:11,510
sooner or under or size down. Sounds
like you're using way too much size.

3996
01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:11,520
like you're using way too much size.
 

3997
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:14,070
like you're using way too much size.
All right, ES back into its 24hour VW

3998
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:14,080
All right, ES back into its 24hour VW
 

3999
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:19,350
All right, ES back into its 24hour VW
up. We're around the same point here.

4000
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:19,360

 

4001
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,709

They're not bidding on this. It's an

4002
01:37:20,709 --> 01:37:20,719
They're not bidding on this. It's an
 

4003
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:22,870
They're not bidding on this. It's an
area of interest,

4004
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:22,880
area of interest,
 

4005
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,149
area of interest,
but I'm not bidding on this right now.

4006
01:37:26,149 --> 01:37:26,159
but I'm not bidding on this right now.
 

4007
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:27,990
but I'm not bidding on this right now.
I think this market knows what wants to

4008
01:37:27,990 --> 01:37:28,000
I think this market knows what wants to
 

4009
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,750
I think this market knows what wants to
do. I can show you my scorecard for the

4010
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:29,760
do. I can show you my scorecard for the
 

4011
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,669
do. I can show you my scorecard for the
day. Again, not linking anything yet.

4012
01:37:33,669 --> 01:37:33,679
day. Again, not linking anything yet.
 

4013
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:55,830
day. Again, not linking anything yet.
Only my second day back. Nice and slow.

4014
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:55,840

 

4015
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:58,070

Yeah, Felix. Two to three micros. Just

4016
01:37:58,070 --> 01:37:58,080
Yeah, Felix. Two to three micros. Just
 

4017
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,750
Yeah, Felix. Two to three micros. Just
just two to three micros are all you

4018
01:37:59,750 --> 01:37:59,760
just two to three micros are all you
 

4019
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,229
just two to three micros are all you
need. All right. If you're getting a 100

4020
01:38:02,229 --> 01:38:02,239
need. All right. If you're getting a 100
 

4021
01:38:02,239 --> 01:38:04,790
need. All right. If you're getting a 100
point move on two micros, it's $400.

4022
01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:04,800
point move on two micros, it's $400.
 

4023
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,149
point move on two micros, it's $400.
That's all you need. You don't need to

4024
01:38:06,149 --> 01:38:06,159
That's all you need. You don't need to
 

4025
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:09,030
That's all you need. You don't need to
be People try and make all the money in

4026
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:09,040
be People try and make all the money in
 

4027
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,510
be People try and make all the money in
one trade. It's where they go wrong.

4028
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:11,520
one trade. It's where they go wrong.
 

4029
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,830
one trade. It's where they go wrong.
It's just like psychopath moves, you

4030
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:13,840
It's just like psychopath moves, you
 

4031
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:20,790
It's just like psychopath moves, you
know.

4032
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:20,800

 

4033
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,870

Yeah, I'm I definitely am checking order

4034
01:38:22,870 --> 01:38:22,880
Yeah, I'm I definitely am checking order
 

4035
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,229
Yeah, I'm I definitely am checking order
flow here. I'm watching everything right

4036
01:38:24,229 --> 01:38:24,239
flow here. I'm watching everything right
 

4037
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:25,590
flow here. I'm watching everything right
now. I mean, I know there's sellers at

4038
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:25,600
now. I mean, I know there's sellers at
 

4039
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,109
now. I mean, I know there's sellers at
the lower day at 820. I know we've

4040
01:38:27,109 --> 01:38:27,119
the lower day at 820. I know we've
 

4041
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:29,430
the lower day at 820. I know we've
reclaimed previous week value area high

4042
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:29,440
reclaimed previous week value area high
 

4043
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,189
reclaimed previous week value area high
now. I know there's an imbalance we just

4044
01:38:31,189 --> 01:38:31,199
now. I know there's an imbalance we just
 

4045
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:34,629
now. I know there's an imbalance we just
tapped into into uh 40 all the way up to

4046
01:38:34,629 --> 01:38:34,639
tapped into into uh 40 all the way up to
 

4047
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:36,870
tapped into into uh 40 all the way up to
44. We have a sellside imbalance there.

4048
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:36,880
44. We have a sellside imbalance there.
 

4049
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,229
44. We have a sellside imbalance there.
And I know there's big sellers that came

4050
01:38:38,229 --> 01:38:38,239
And I know there's big sellers that came
 

4051
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:40,070
And I know there's big sellers that came
in at 45. So, that's where their pain

4052
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:40,080
in at 45. So, that's where their pain
 

4053
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,629
in at 45. So, that's where their pain
point is,

4054
01:38:42,629 --> 01:38:42,639
point is,
 

4055
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:44,470
point is,
but we're rejecting initial balance

4056
01:38:44,470 --> 01:38:44,480
but we're rejecting initial balance
 

4057
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:46,790
but we're rejecting initial balance
right now.

4058
01:38:46,790 --> 01:38:46,800
right now.
 

4059
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,149
right now.
So, I really don't want to be counter

4060
01:38:48,149 --> 01:38:48,159
So, I really don't want to be counter
 

4061
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:58,550
So, I really don't want to be counter
trend long at the moment.

4062
01:38:58,550 --> 01:38:58,560

 

4063
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,390

They're bidding right now down at 800 is

4064
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:00,400
They're bidding right now down at 800 is
 

4065
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:02,149
They're bidding right now down at 800 is
much below.

4066
01:39:02,149 --> 01:39:02,159
much below.
 

4067
01:39:02,159 --> 01:39:12,229
much below.
Not really.

4068
01:39:12,229 --> 01:39:12,239

 

4069
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:14,149

So, we're back into the GlobeEx session.

4070
01:39:14,149 --> 01:39:14,159
So, we're back into the GlobeEx session.
 

4071
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:16,629
So, we're back into the GlobeEx session.
The GlobeEx pivot is really 800 or just

4072
01:39:16,629 --> 01:39:16,639
The GlobeEx pivot is really 800 or just
 

4073
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:23,109
The GlobeEx pivot is really 800 or just
underneath. Yeah, 800.

4074
01:39:23,109 --> 01:39:23,119

 

4075
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:25,669

We really lack structure from that 5

4076
01:39:25,669 --> 01:39:25,679
We really lack structure from that 5
 

4077
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:27,430
We really lack structure from that 5
a.m. candle. That's the bigger problem.

4078
01:39:27,430 --> 01:39:27,440
a.m. candle. That's the bigger problem.
 

4079
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:30,229
a.m. candle. That's the bigger problem.
That could take us down to 760

4080
01:39:30,229 --> 01:39:30,239
That could take us down to 760
 

4081
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:41,510
That could take us down to 760
if we lose the bid.

4082
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:41,520

 

4083
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:42,950

Still planning to shed the mountain. I

4084
01:39:42,950 --> 01:39:42,960
Still planning to shed the mountain. I
 

4085
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:45,030
Still planning to shed the mountain. I
mean, I wanted to go. Um, obviously I've

4086
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:45,040
mean, I wanted to go. Um, obviously I've
 

4087
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:46,870
mean, I wanted to go. Um, obviously I've
had to deal with some personal matters

4088
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:46,880
had to deal with some personal matters
 

4089
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,870
had to deal with some personal matters
and also

4090
01:39:48,870 --> 01:39:48,880
and also
 

4091
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:51,430
and also
it wasn't we had some landslides here,

4092
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:51,440
it wasn't we had some landslides here,
 

4093
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,270
it wasn't we had some landslides here,
so all the roads were blocked, so you

4094
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:53,280
so all the roads were blocked, so you
 

4095
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:55,910
so all the roads were blocked, so you
couldn't actually get up to the mountain

4096
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:55,920
couldn't actually get up to the mountain
 

4097
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:57,990
couldn't actually get up to the mountain
and it's been like 80° here since. So,

4098
01:39:57,990 --> 01:39:58,000
and it's been like 80° here since. So,
 

4099
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,750
and it's been like 80° here since. So,
probably probably all the snow's gone

4100
01:39:59,750 --> 01:39:59,760
probably probably all the snow's gone
 

4101
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,470
probably probably all the snow's gone
already. I would like to get up to Mount

4102
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:02,480
already. I would like to get up to Mount
 

4103
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:03,990
already. I would like to get up to Mount
High at least for a day or something.

4104
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:04,000
High at least for a day or something.
 

4105
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:11,189
High at least for a day or something.
Yeah,

4106
01:40:11,189 --> 01:40:11,199

 

4107
01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:13,030

you and every coach out there say not to

4108
01:40:13,030 --> 01:40:13,040
you and every coach out there say not to
 

4109
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,709
you and every coach out there say not to
copy trade, but the last four weeks or

4110
01:40:14,709 --> 01:40:14,719
copy trade, but the last four weeks or
 

4111
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:16,550
copy trade, but the last four weeks or
so whenever I try my own thing, I get

4112
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:16,560
so whenever I try my own thing, I get
 

4113
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:19,270
so whenever I try my own thing, I get
cooked. When I copy coaches, I win.

4114
01:40:19,270 --> 01:40:19,280
cooked. When I copy coaches, I win.
 

4115
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,669
cooked. When I copy coaches, I win.
Maybe the nuance to copy trade strategy.

4116
01:40:21,669 --> 01:40:21,679
Maybe the nuance to copy trade strategy.
 

4117
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:23,030
Maybe the nuance to copy trade strategy.
I'm not sure what you mean there, Joe.

4118
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:23,040
I'm not sure what you mean there, Joe.
 

4119
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:26,070
I'm not sure what you mean there, Joe.
As in not copy trade, copy me. I mean,

4120
01:40:26,070 --> 01:40:26,080
As in not copy trade, copy me. I mean,
 

4121
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:28,149
As in not copy trade, copy me. I mean,
it's important that you don't copy

4122
01:40:28,149 --> 01:40:28,159
it's important that you don't copy
 

4123
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:30,550
it's important that you don't copy
people because you have to be in charge

4124
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:30,560
people because you have to be in charge
 

4125
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:31,669
people because you have to be in charge
of your own money and you're going to

4126
01:40:31,669 --> 01:40:31,679
of your own money and you're going to
 

4127
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:33,669
of your own money and you're going to
have to learn to stand up. Like there's

4128
01:40:33,669 --> 01:40:33,679
have to learn to stand up. Like there's
 

4129
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:35,430
have to learn to stand up. Like there's
nothing wrong with being in a group and

4130
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:35,440
nothing wrong with being in a group and
 

4131
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,189
nothing wrong with being in a group and
like saying this is what I'm looking at

4132
01:40:37,189 --> 01:40:37,199
like saying this is what I'm looking at
 

4133
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:39,910
like saying this is what I'm looking at
and understanding and learning,

4134
01:40:39,910 --> 01:40:39,920
and understanding and learning,
 

4135
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:41,750
and understanding and learning,
but I think uh you've got to understand

4136
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:41,760
but I think uh you've got to understand
 

4137
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,270
but I think uh you've got to understand
the markets because at some point you

4138
01:40:43,270 --> 01:40:43,280
the markets because at some point you
 

4139
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,470
the markets because at some point you
might want to travel the world and be

4140
01:40:44,470 --> 01:40:44,480
might want to travel the world and be
 

4141
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,870
might want to travel the world and be
able to trade on your own instead of

4142
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:46,880
able to trade on your own instead of
 

4143
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,550
able to trade on your own instead of
watching some 40-year-old with long hair

4144
01:40:48,550 --> 01:40:48,560
watching some 40-year-old with long hair
 

4145
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:52,149
watching some 40-year-old with long hair
on YouTube. Okay, so here's the drift.

4146
01:40:52,149 --> 01:40:52,159
on YouTube. Okay, so here's the drift.
 

4147
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:53,590
on YouTube. Okay, so here's the drift.
Potentially, if they don't hold a bid

4148
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:53,600
Potentially, if they don't hold a bid
 

4149
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:55,270
Potentially, if they don't hold a bid
here, potentially they come down here

4150
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:55,280
here, potentially they come down here
 

4151
01:40:55,280 --> 01:41:02,229
here, potentially they come down here
into the 760s.

4152
01:41:02,229 --> 01:41:02,239

 

4153
01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:07,350

still going. So 18 sorry 1586

4154
01:41:07,350 --> 01:41:07,360
still going. So 18 sorry 1586
 

4155
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,030
still going. So 18 sorry 1586
would be the next drive and then that

4156
01:41:09,030 --> 01:41:09,040
would be the next drive and then that
 

4157
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:12,390
would be the next drive and then that
would take it to 16s.

4158
01:41:12,390 --> 01:41:12,400
would take it to 16s.
 

4159
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,149
would take it to 16s.
Question here is do we reject previous

4160
01:41:14,149 --> 01:41:14,159
Question here is do we reject previous
 

4161
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:16,070
Question here is do we reject previous
week value area high now? And if we do

4162
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:16,080
week value area high now? And if we do
 

4163
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:17,270
week value area high now? And if we do
that means we're going back inside

4164
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:17,280
that means we're going back inside
 

4165
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,189
that means we're going back inside
previous week's value which means this

4166
01:41:19,189 --> 01:41:19,199
previous week's value which means this
 

4167
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:21,030
previous week's value which means this
there's no acceptance above value. If we

4168
01:41:21,030 --> 01:41:21,040
there's no acceptance above value. If we
 

4169
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:22,629
there's no acceptance above value. If we
reclaim previous week value area high

4170
01:41:22,629 --> 01:41:22,639
reclaim previous week value area high
 

4171
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:24,709
reclaim previous week value area high
it's just a dip below that's like a sign

4172
01:41:24,709 --> 01:41:24,719
it's just a dip below that's like a sign
 

4173
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:26,950
it's just a dip below that's like a sign
of strength. But how we act here becomes

4174
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:26,960
of strength. But how we act here becomes
 

4175
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:29,350
of strength. But how we act here becomes
I'd say pretty important now for

4176
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:29,360
I'd say pretty important now for
 

4177
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:31,109
I'd say pretty important now for
sentiment. Are we looking to move value

4178
01:41:31,109 --> 01:41:31,119
sentiment. Are we looking to move value
 

4179
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:34,790
sentiment. Are we looking to move value
area high higher or are we saying hey no

4180
01:41:34,790 --> 01:41:34,800
area high higher or are we saying hey no
 

4181
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,030
area high higher or are we saying hey no
this is no acceptance. So this level

4182
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:37,040
this is no acceptance. So this level
 

4183
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:48,470
this is no acceptance. So this level
here is very very very important now.

4184
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:48,480

 

4185
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,229

Yeah you're right. CVD is showing

4186
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:50,239
Yeah you're right. CVD is showing
 

4187
01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:51,990
Yeah you're right. CVD is showing
divergence. It's showing stronger

4188
01:41:51,990 --> 01:41:52,000
divergence. It's showing stronger
 

4189
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,990
divergence. It's showing stronger
aggressive buyers but we're moving lower

4190
01:41:53,990 --> 01:41:54,000
aggressive buyers but we're moving lower
 

4191
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,510
aggressive buyers but we're moving lower
which means there's more passive sellers

4192
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:55,520
which means there's more passive sellers
 

4193
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,189
which means there's more passive sellers
taking control of the market. So it's

4194
01:41:57,189 --> 01:41:57,199
taking control of the market. So it's
 

4195
01:41:57,199 --> 01:42:00,390
taking control of the market. So it's
negative divergence right now.

4196
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:00,400
negative divergence right now.
 

4197
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:05,830
negative divergence right now.
since 9:30.

4198
01:42:05,830 --> 01:42:05,840

 

4199
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,350

The buyers are being aggressive and

4200
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:07,360
The buyers are being aggressive and
 

4201
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,750
The buyers are being aggressive and
losing.

4202
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:09,760
losing.
 

4203
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:14,870
losing.
Price is moving lower. Delta is not.

4204
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:14,880

 

4205
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:17,669

I'd say this value area high is a

4206
01:42:17,669 --> 01:42:17,679
I'd say this value area high is a
 

4207
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:20,709
I'd say this value area high is a
massive, massive, massive level. Do we

4208
01:42:20,709 --> 01:42:20,719
massive, massive, massive level. Do we
 

4209
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:22,629
massive, massive, massive level. Do we
reclaim and squeeze or do they just keep

4210
01:42:22,629 --> 01:42:22,639
reclaim and squeeze or do they just keep
 

4211
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:25,990
reclaim and squeeze or do they just keep
rejecting it?

4212
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:26,000
rejecting it?
 

4213
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,390
rejecting it?
Here's the reclaim. Now, did they base

4214
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:28,400
Here's the reclaim. Now, did they base
 

4215
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:31,270
Here's the reclaim. Now, did they base
or not? Just tapped into that imbalance

4216
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:31,280
or not? Just tapped into that imbalance
 

4217
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:33,030
or not? Just tapped into that imbalance
that I talked about maybe five minutes

4218
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:33,040
that I talked about maybe five minutes
 

4219
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,350
that I talked about maybe five minutes
ago, the 40 to 44 imbalance. You won't

4220
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:35,360
ago, the 40 to 44 imbalance. You won't
 

4221
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:37,030
ago, the 40 to 44 imbalance. You won't
see it if you use fair value gaps

4222
01:42:37,030 --> 01:42:37,040
see it if you use fair value gaps
 

4223
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:38,310
see it if you use fair value gaps
because it's not there, but it is a

4224
01:42:38,310 --> 01:42:38,320
because it's not there, but it is a
 

4225
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:40,790
because it's not there, but it is a
legit imbalance which just got tapped

4226
01:42:40,790 --> 01:42:40,800
legit imbalance which just got tapped
 

4227
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:52,709
legit imbalance which just got tapped
into.

4229
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:55,750

Nice, Jason. Great work, man. Awesome

4230
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:55,760
Nice, Jason. Great work, man. Awesome
 

4231
01:42:55,760 --> 01:43:01,510
Nice, Jason. Great work, man. Awesome
work.

4232
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:01,520

 

4233
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:03,510

If they catch a bid here, it's very very

4234
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:03,520
If they catch a bid here, it's very very
 

4235
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,270
If they catch a bid here, it's very very
thin for the drive up. That's the one

4236
01:43:05,270 --> 01:43:05,280
thin for the drive up. That's the one
 

4237
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:06,709
thin for the drive up. That's the one
thing I would say. If they catch a bid

4238
01:43:06,709 --> 01:43:06,719
thing I would say. If they catch a bid
 

4239
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:07,990
thing I would say. If they catch a bid
here, it's very very thin. We're

4240
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:08,000
here, it's very very thin. We're
 

4241
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,590
here, it's very very thin. We're
starting to try and base over previous

4242
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:09,600
starting to try and base over previous
 

4243
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,149
starting to try and base over previous
week. Value area high. Value area low on

4244
01:43:12,149 --> 01:43:12,159
week. Value area high. Value area low on
 

4245
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:15,510
week. Value area high. Value area low on
the day is 56es. Um, don't want to be

4246
01:43:15,510 --> 01:43:15,520
the day is 56es. Um, don't want to be
 

4247
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:18,310
the day is 56es. Um, don't want to be
early to this. So,

4248
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:18,320
early to this. So,
 

4249
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:20,149
early to this. So,
if we base, I am interested. They've got

4250
01:43:20,149 --> 01:43:20,159
if we base, I am interested. They've got
 

4251
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:21,910
if we base, I am interested. They've got
to start basing, building out, trapping.

4252
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:21,920
to start basing, building out, trapping.
 

4253
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:23,510
to start basing, building out, trapping.
There is shorts caught down here for

01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:28,080
caught underneath 20 which is what right
 

4259
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,830
caught underneath 20 which is what right
here underneath 20 there's sellside

4260
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:29,840
here underneath 20 there's sellside
 

4261
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:32,629
here underneath 20 there's sellside
caught in this c in these candles here.

4262
01:43:32,629 --> 01:43:32,639
caught in this c in these candles here.
 

4263
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:39,669
caught in this c in these candles here.
This one right here

4264
01:43:39,669 --> 01:43:39,679

 

4265
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:41,750

but otherwise

4266
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:41,760
but otherwise
 

4267
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:49,590
but otherwise
not convinced.

4268
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:49,600

 

4269
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:50,629

So we can't even get through that

4270
01:43:50,629 --> 01:43:50,639
So we can't even get through that
 

4271
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:52,550
So we can't even get through that
imbalance of 40 I keep talking about.

4272
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:52,560
imbalance of 40 I keep talking about.
 

4273
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,709
imbalance of 40 I keep talking about.
It's got to get through that to uh have

4274
01:43:54,709 --> 01:43:54,719
It's got to get through that to uh have
 

4275
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:59,109
It's got to get through that to uh have
a chance of doing anything at all.

4276
01:43:59,109 --> 01:43:59,119

 

4277
01:43:59,119 --> 01:44:01,990

That initial balance big level 40s. It's

4278
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:02,000
That initial balance big level 40s. It's
 

4279
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,790
That initial balance big level 40s. It's
the IB. Remember? Whoa. Someone sold

4280
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:04,800
the IB. Remember? Whoa. Someone sold
 

4281
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:08,149
the IB. Remember? Whoa. Someone sold
that IB.

4282
01:44:08,149 --> 01:44:08,159

 

4283
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:09,669

Someone tried to aggressively sell that

4284
01:44:09,669 --> 01:44:09,679
Someone tried to aggressively sell that
 

4285
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:11,669
Someone tried to aggressively sell that
IB and sellers got caught at the lows

4286
01:44:11,669 --> 01:44:11,679
IB and sellers got caught at the lows
 

4287
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:13,590
IB and sellers got caught at the lows
there. This could be interesting. Now,

4288
01:44:13,590 --> 01:44:13,600
there. This could be interesting. Now,
 

4289
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,030
there. This could be interesting. Now,
if enough sellers just got caught in

4290
01:44:15,030 --> 01:44:15,040
if enough sellers just got caught in
 

4291
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:16,390
if enough sellers just got caught in
that flush trying to play the follow

4292
01:44:16,390 --> 01:44:16,400
that flush trying to play the follow
 

4293
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,470
that flush trying to play the follow
through, we might start squeezing. It's

4294
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:18,480
through, we might start squeezing. It's
 

4295
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:21,030
through, we might start squeezing. It's
got to get back through the IB now. 40s

4296
01:44:21,030 --> 01:44:21,040
got to get back through the IB now. 40s
 

4297
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,189
got to get back through the IB now. 40s
to 45s big level. There's an imbalance

4298
01:44:23,189 --> 01:44:23,199
to 45s big level. There's an imbalance
 

4299
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:24,550
to 45s big level. There's an imbalance
there. We have the initial balance

4300
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:24,560
there. We have the initial balance
 

4301
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,390
there. We have the initial balance
there. They just tried to reflush that.

4302
01:44:26,390 --> 01:44:26,400
there. They just tried to reflush that.
 

4303

there. They just tried to reflush that.
Sellers just got caught again under 20s

4304
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:28,480
Sellers just got caught again under 20s
 

4305
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,790
Sellers just got caught again under 20s
on this long wick under 20s. They came

4306
01:44:30,790 --> 01:44:30,800
on this long wick under 20s. They came
 

4307
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,790
on this long wick under 20s. They came
aggressive and got caught again. So,

4308
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:32,800
aggressive and got caught again. So,
 

4309
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,390
aggressive and got caught again. So,
we've got like three lots of sellers

4310
01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:34,400
we've got like three lots of sellers
 

4311
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,950
we've got like three lots of sellers
down there now. Caught under 20. So,

4312
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:36,960
down there now. Caught under 20. So,
 

4313
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:39,189
down there now. Caught under 20. So,
bids need to hold over 20 and start to

4314
01:44:39,189 --> 01:44:39,199
bids need to hold over 20 and start to
 

4315
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:40,629
bids need to hold over 20 and start to
accelerate upside for a squeeze.

4316
01:44:40,629 --> 01:44:40,639
accelerate upside for a squeeze.
 

4317
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:41,669
accelerate upside for a squeeze.
Otherwise, we're not going to see

4318
01:44:41,669 --> 01:44:41,679
Otherwise, we're not going to see
 

4319
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:47,189
Otherwise, we're not going to see
anything happen.

4320
01:44:47,189 --> 01:44:47,199

 

4321
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:49,430

Here we go. Here we go. All right. Can

4322
01:44:49,430 --> 01:44:49,440
Here we go. Here we go. All right. Can
 

4323
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,350
Here we go. Here we go. All right. Can
we get going here now? Looking long

4324
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:51,360
we get going here now? Looking long
 

4325
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:54,229
we get going here now? Looking long
here, trying to accelerate higher.

4326
01:44:54,229 --> 01:44:54,239
here, trying to accelerate higher.
 

4327
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:56,790
here, trying to accelerate higher.
Want to get a uh move back through value

4328
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:56,800
Want to get a uh move back through value
 

4329
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:59,590
Want to get a uh move back through value
area low minimum. Really want to see us

4330
01:44:59,590 --> 01:44:59,600
area low minimum. Really want to see us
 

4331
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,229
area low minimum. Really want to see us
bid through 50s. Uh delta there was at

4332
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:02,239
bid through 50s. Uh delta there was at
 

4333
01:45:02,239 --> 01:45:04,470
bid through 50s. Uh delta there was at
60s. We had a big seller at 60s. Once we

4334
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:04,480
60s. We had a big seller at 60s. Once we
 

4335
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:05,510
60s. We had a big seller at 60s. Once we
get through that, we're going to start

4336
01:45:05,510 --> 01:45:05,520
get through that, we're going to start
 

4337
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,510
get through that, we're going to start
squeezing and we're going to have to

4338
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:07,520
squeezing and we're going to have to
 

4339
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:12,550
squeezing and we're going to have to
hold bids. Can't hold bids yet.

4340
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:12,560

 

4341
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,629

Feathering into this very small size.

4342
01:45:14,629 --> 01:45:14,639
Feathering into this very small size.
 

4343
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:18,149
Feathering into this very small size.
Stops very, very, very tight here.

Stops very, very, very tight here.
 

4345
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:20,229
Stops very, very, very tight here.
I do not want to see a flush below 20.

4346
01:45:20,229 --> 01:45:20,239
I do not want to see a flush below 20.
 

4347
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:22,310
I do not want to see a flush below 20.
Like, we cannot go down to 20. It's as

4348
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:22,320
Like, we cannot go down to 20. It's as
 

4349
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,470
Like, we cannot go down to 20. It's as
simple as that.

4350
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:24,480
simple as that.
 

4351
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:27,109
simple as that.

01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:41,990
through these 45s.
Through 40 through 45.

4360
01:45:41,990 --> 01:45:42,000

 

4361
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,629

Suck a nut.

4362
01:45:44,629 --> 01:45:44,639
Suck a nut.
 

4363
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:46,229
Suck a nut.
Ah,

4364
01:45:46,229 --> 01:45:46,239
Ah,
 

4365
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:48,470
Ah,
let's go.

4366
01:45:48,470 --> 01:45:48,480
let's go.
 

4367
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,390
let's go.
All right. Straight straight into target

4368
01:45:50,390 --> 01:45:50,400
All right. Straight straight into target
 

4369
01:45:50,400 --> 01:46:01,510
All right. Straight straight into target
one.

4370
01:46:01,510 --> 01:46:01,520

 

4371
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:05,510

Beauty. What a beauty.

4372
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:05,520
Beauty. What a beauty.
 

4373
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:06,790
Beauty. What a beauty.
All right, let's see if we can trail

4374
01:46:06,790 --> 01:46:06,800
All right, let's see if we can trail
 

4375
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,550
All right, let's see if we can trail
now. I want to see it hold a bid over

4376
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:08,560
now. I want to see it hold a bid over
 

4377
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:11,830
now. I want to see it hold a bid over
56s. We just took out all those stops

4378
01:46:11,830 --> 01:46:11,840
56s. We just took out all those stops
 

4379
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,590
56s. We just took out all those stops
just got wrecked like I talked about

4380
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:13,600
just got wrecked like I talked about
 

4381
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,470
just got wrecked like I talked about
through the 45s. Damage is done. We're

4382
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:16,480
through the 45s. Damage is done. We're
 

4383
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:26,229
through the 45s. Damage is done. We're
locking in no matter what.

4384
01:46:26,229 --> 01:46:26,239

 

4385
01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:28,229

And let's see. We've repriced this big

4386
01:46:28,229 --> 01:46:28,239
And let's see. We've repriced this big
 

4387
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:29,830
And let's see. We've repriced this big
kill candle. We've gone straight back.

4388
01:46:29,830 --> 01:46:29,840
kill candle. We've gone straight back.
 

4389
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,350
kill candle. We've gone straight back.
Look at the same level. What do we talk

4390
01:46:31,350 --> 01:46:31,360
Look at the same level. What do we talk
 

4391
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,669
Look at the same level. What do we talk
about earlier? The ' 90s. All day. These

4392
01:46:33,669 --> 01:46:33,679
about earlier? The ' 90s. All day. These
 

4393
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:36,390
about earlier? The ' 90s. All day. These
90s. These flipping 90s. So, we've got

4394
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:36,400
90s. These flipping 90s. So, we've got
 

4395
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:37,830
90s. These flipping 90s. So, we've got
to see a bid over that if we're going to

4396
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:37,840
to see a bid over that if we're going to
 

4397
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,590
to see a bid over that if we're going to
see acceleration. So, we were long from

4398
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:39,600
see acceleration. So, we were long from
 

4399
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,350
see acceleration. So, we were long from
here. Trim some here. If we get

4400
01:46:41,350 --> 01:46:41,360
here. Trim some here. If we get
 

4401
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:42,629
here. Trim some here. If we get
acceleration now, it's going to be

4402
01:46:42,629 --> 01:46:42,639
acceleration now, it's going to be
 

4403
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:45,750
acceleration now, it's going to be
really fun. But like, pay yourself like

4404
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:45,760
really fun. But like, pay yourself like
 

4405
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,750
really fun. But like, pay yourself like
don't expect it, right? Pay yourself as

4406
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:47,760
don't expect it, right? Pay yourself as
 

4407
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:59,430
don't expect it, right? Pay yourself as
if it's not going to happen.

4408
01:46:59,430 --> 01:46:59,440

 

4409
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:00,790

What the hell happened? I'll tell you

4410
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:00,800
What the hell happened? I'll tell you
 

4411
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,310
What the hell happened? I'll tell you
what happened in here. A big seller

4412
01:47:04,310 --> 01:47:04,320
what happened in here. A big seller
 

4413
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:07,109
what happened in here. A big seller
stepped in under 20. He readded on this

4414
01:47:07,109 --> 01:47:07,119
stepped in under 20. He readded on this
 

4415
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:10,070
stepped in under 20. He readded on this
flush, right? So, he now had a huge sell

4416
01:47:10,070 --> 01:47:10,080
flush, right? So, he now had a huge sell
 

4417
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:13,510
flush, right? So, he now had a huge sell
position here and once we broke the 45s,

4418
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:13,520
position here and once we broke the 45s,
 

4419
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:15,430
position here and once we broke the 45s,
he was offside. So, he stopped out and

4420
01:47:15,430 --> 01:47:15,440
he was offside. So, he stopped out and
 

4421
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:17,189
he was offside. So, he stopped out and
that increased

4422
01:47:17,189 --> 01:47:17,199
that increased
 

4423
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:19,350
that increased
the push higher. As simple as that. So,

4424
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:19,360
the push higher. As simple as that. So,
 

4425
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,350
the push higher. As simple as that. So,
we had a look below initial balance into

4426
01:47:21,350 --> 01:47:21,360
we had a look below initial balance into
 

4427
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:23,189
we had a look below initial balance into
our key level, the blue box that we've

4428
01:47:23,189 --> 01:47:23,199
our key level, the blue box that we've
 

4429
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:25,270
our key level, the blue box that we've
had. We reclaimed and now we start to

4430
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:25,280
had. We reclaimed and now we start to
 

4431
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:26,790
had. We reclaimed and now we start to
squeeze. Now, can we find acceptance

4432
01:47:26,790 --> 01:47:26,800
squeeze. Now, can we find acceptance
 

4433
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:29,030
squeeze. Now, can we find acceptance
over 90s now and go all the way up?

4434
01:47:29,030 --> 01:47:29,040
over 90s now and go all the way up?
 

4435
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:35,109
over 90s now and go all the way up?
That's the big question. Now

4436
01:47:35,109 --> 01:47:35,119

 

4437
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:52,790

that's the big question.

4438
01:47:52,790 --> 01:47:52,800

 

4439
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,149

Back up to these N. Just trying to see

4440
01:47:54,149 --> 01:47:54,159
Back up to these N. Just trying to see
 

4441
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:56,390
Back up to these N. Just trying to see
if I can get a runner to go here. Trying

4442
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:56,400
if I can get a runner to go here. Trying
 

4443
01:47:56,400 --> 01:48:04,950
if I can get a runner to go here. Trying
to see if I can get a runner to go here.

4444
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:04,960

 

4445
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:07,669

point control now sat at 73. Value area

4446
01:48:07,669 --> 01:48:07,679
point control now sat at 73. Value area
 

4447
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:09,750
point control now sat at 73. Value area
low down at 56es. So you want dips to

4448
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:09,760
low down at 56es. So you want dips to
 

4449
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:13,189
low down at 56es. So you want dips to
hold that this node. I don't really want

4450
01:48:13,189 --> 01:48:13,199
hold that this node. I don't really want
 

4451
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:15,830
hold that this node. I don't really want
to add in this node. It's not the best.

4452
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:15,840
to add in this node. It's not the best.
 

4453
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:19,990
to add in this node. It's not the best.
This rotational node again.

4454
01:48:19,990 --> 01:48:20,000
This rotational node again.
 

4455
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,750
This rotational node again.
What was the blue box level? It was uh a

4456
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:23,760
What was the blue box level? It was uh a
 

4457
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:27,910
What was the blue box level? It was uh a
big node from the previous week.

4458
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:27,920
big node from the previous week.
 

4459
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:32,229
big node from the previous week.
I'll show you.

4460
01:48:32,229 --> 01:48:32,239

 

4461
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:35,669

It was this guy right here.

4462
01:48:35,669 --> 01:48:35,679
It was this guy right here.
 

4463
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:37,510
It was this guy right here.
Yeah. So, I was trading against that.

4464
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:37,520
Yeah. So, I was trading against that.
 

4465
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,350
Yeah. So, I was trading against that.
Can that hold? That's a dip down against

4466
01:48:39,350 --> 01:48:39,360
Can that hold? That's a dip down against
 

4467
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:41,510
Can that hold? That's a dip down against
it. And we went wick to wick. So, it

4468
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:41,520
it. And we went wick to wick. So, it
 

4469
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:43,590
it. And we went wick to wick. So, it
lined up with confluence node here. Wick

4470
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:43,600
lined up with confluence node here. Wick
 

4471
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,590
lined up with confluence node here. Wick
to wick for pivot, right? Resistance

4472
01:48:45,590 --> 01:48:45,600
to wick for pivot, right? Resistance
 

4473
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,350
to wick for pivot, right? Resistance
becomes support. And we look to

4474
01:48:47,350 --> 01:48:47,360
becomes support. And we look to
 

4475
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:48,870
becomes support. And we look to
accelerate if we can. So, we might look

4476
01:48:48,870 --> 01:48:48,880
accelerate if we can. So, we might look
 

4477
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:50,550
accelerate if we can. So, we might look
for a giant inverted head and shoulders

4478
01:48:50,550 --> 01:48:50,560
for a giant inverted head and shoulders
 

4479
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,390
for a giant inverted head and shoulders
here if we can really get going. All the

4480
01:48:52,390 --> 01:48:52,400
here if we can really get going. All the
 

4481
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:54,870
here if we can really get going. All the
stops are still up here. doesn't have to

4482
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:54,880
stops are still up here. doesn't have to
 

4483
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:56,870
stops are still up here. doesn't have to
do that move today, but that's what

4484
01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:56,880
do that move today, but that's what
 

4485
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,870
do that move today, but that's what
would be nice if we can find acceptance

4486
01:48:58,870 --> 01:48:58,880
would be nice if we can find acceptance
 

4487
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:01,590
would be nice if we can find acceptance
higher. Really good through the 90s.

4488
01:49:01,590 --> 01:49:01,600
higher. Really good through the 90s.
 

4489
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,350
higher. Really good through the 90s.
Come on. Through the 90s. We'd like to

4490
01:49:03,350 --> 01:49:03,360
Come on. Through the 90s. We'd like to
 

4491
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,950
Come on. Through the 90s. We'd like to
go through the 90s. Continue this

4492
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:04,960
go through the 90s. Continue this
 

4493
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:07,750
go through the 90s. Continue this
squeeze. Can we get up to 25s? Can we

4494
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:07,760
squeeze. Can we get up to 25s? Can we
 

4495
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,189
squeeze. Can we get up to 25s? Can we
get up to the 25s? If we get through

4496
01:49:09,189 --> 01:49:09,199
get up to the 25s? If we get through
 

4497
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:19,270
get up to the 25s? If we get through
25s, I'd love to see acceleration.

4498
01:49:19,270 --> 01:49:19,280

 

4499
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:26,870

When I speak, I'm mostly 50/50.

4500
01:49:26,870 --> 01:49:26,880

 

4501
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,950

Definitely not.

4502
01:49:28,950 --> 01:49:28,960
Definitely not.
 

4503
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,430
Definitely not.
Go to the I'm I'm not even going to

4504
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:31,440
Go to the I'm I'm not even going to
 

4505
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,790
Go to the I'm I'm not even going to
bother. I'm not even going to answer

4506
01:49:32,790 --> 01:49:32,800
bother. I'm not even going to answer
 

4507
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:41,830
bother. I'm not even going to answer
that.

4508
01:49:41,830 --> 01:49:41,840

 

4509
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:44,390

You, my friend, need to learn to trade.

4510
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:44,400
You, my friend, need to learn to trade.
 

4511
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:46,390
You, my friend, need to learn to trade.
There's always two options. I'm telling

4512
01:49:46,390 --> 01:49:46,400
There's always two options. I'm telling
 

4513
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:48,790
There's always two options. I'm telling
you, if we do this, it does this. If it

4514
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:48,800
you, if we do this, it does this. If it
 

4515
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,790
you, if we do this, it does this. If it
does this, it does that. That's how the

4516
01:49:50,790 --> 01:49:50,800
does this, it does that. That's how the
 

4517
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:54,950
does this, it does that. That's how the
market moves.

4518
01:49:54,950 --> 01:49:54,960

 

4519
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,910

[\h__\h] me. I've been very clear on what

I've been looking for today. I've been

I've been looking for today. I've been
 

4523
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:01,750
I've been looking for today. I've been
looking for longs off the blue area

4524
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:01,760
looking for longs off the blue area
 

4525
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:03,910
looking for longs off the blue area
because we've pushed value higher. I've

4526
01:50:03,910 --> 01:50:03,920
because we've pushed value higher. I've
 

4527
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:07,350
because we've pushed value higher. I've
literally gone over it since 9:15 this

4528
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:07,360
literally gone over it since 9:15 this
 

4529
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:11,669
literally gone over it since 9:15 this

Oh my god. I don't have the patience for

Oh my god. I don't have the patience for
 

4537
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:34,229
Oh my god. I don't have the patience for
it. All

4538
01:50:34,229 --> 01:50:34,239

 

4539
01:50:34,239 --> 01:50:36,709

right. Looking to see if we hold 90s

4540
01:50:36,709 --> 01:50:36,719
right. Looking to see if we hold 90s
 

4541
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:38,310
right. Looking to see if we hold 90s
now. All right. This node looking to see

4542
01:50:38,310 --> 01:50:38,320
now. All right. This node looking to see
 

4543
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:40,310
now. All right. This node looking to see
if we hold 90s now. Here's your if

4544
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:40,320
if we hold 90s now. Here's your if
 

4545
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,709
if we hold 90s now. Here's your if
button. Maybe if we hold that, I'm

4546
01:50:42,709 --> 01:50:42,719
button. Maybe if we hold that, I'm
 

4547
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:45,030
button. Maybe if we hold that, I'm
looking to do that. If we lose that, we

4548
01:50:45,030 --> 01:50:45,040
looking to do that. If we lose that, we
 

4549
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:47,590
looking to do that. If we lose that, we
will rotate cuz that's the rule of the

4550
01:50:47,590 --> 01:50:47,600
will rotate cuz that's the rule of the
 

4551
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:49,030
will rotate cuz that's the rule of the
market.

4552
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:49,040
market.
 

4553
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:52,149
market.

[\h__\h] me and [\h__\h] off to someone else
 

4555
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:55,270
[\h__\h] me and [\h__\h] off to someone else
then.

4556
01:50:55,270 --> 01:50:55,280

 

4557
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:58,390

Piss me off, man. No thank you. Just

4560
01:51:15,510 --> 01:51:15,520

 

4561
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:17,750

All right,

4562
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:17,760
All right,
 

4563
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,390
All right,
let's see. I have no patience, chat. I'm

4564
01:51:20,390 --> 01:51:20,400
let's see. I have no patience, chat. I'm
 

4565
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:21,750
let's see. I have no patience, chat. I'm
going through a lot right now. You piss

4566
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:21,760
going through a lot right now. You piss
 

4567
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:23,910
going through a lot right now. You piss

4569
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:35,990
me off, I [\h__\h] You get banned or I
leave. It's really simple.

4570
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:36,000

 

4571
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,510

Yeah, I think we're going to go 50s.

4572
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:37,520
Yeah, I think we're going to go 50s.
 

4573
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:39,669
Yeah, I think we're going to go 50s.
We've got we've got loads of bid of

4574
01:51:39,669 --> 01:51:39,679
We've got we've got loads of bid of
 

4575
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:41,669
We've got we've got loads of bid of
offers up there. We want to come and get

4576
01:51:41,669 --> 01:51:41,679
offers up there. We want to come and get
 

4577
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:54,550
offers up there. We want to come and get
up there.

4578
01:51:54,550 --> 01:51:54,560

 

4579
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:56,550

Trying to just manage this last guy now.

4580
01:51:56,550 --> 01:51:56,560
Trying to just manage this last guy now.
 

4581
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,390
Trying to just manage this last guy now.
Let's see if we can get through the 25s

4582
01:51:58,390 --> 01:51:58,400
Let's see if we can get through the 25s
 

4583
01:51:58,400 --> 01:51:59,589
Let's see if we can get through the 25s
and then we're going to accelerate

4584
01:51:59,589 --> 01:51:59,599
and then we're going to accelerate
 

4585
01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:01,910
and then we're going to accelerate
through 50s if we can get to 25s. So, if

4586
01:52:01,910 --> 01:52:01,920
through 50s if we can get to 25s. So, if
 

4587
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:03,350
through 50s if we can get to 25s. So, if
you haven't trimmed some, you might want

4588
01:52:03,350 --> 01:52:03,360
you haven't trimmed some, you might want
 

4589
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:16,629
you haven't trimmed some, you might want
to trim some into this node up here.

4590
01:52:16,629 --> 01:52:16,639

 

4591
01:52:16,639 --> 01:52:19,109

Come on. Through the 25s. Let's go. Turn

4592
01:52:19,109 --> 01:52:19,119
Come on. Through the 25s. Let's go. Turn
 

4593
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:23,510
Come on. Through the 25s. Let's go. Turn
the boosters on.

4594
01:52:23,510 --> 01:52:23,520

 

4595
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,350

I'll consider an add- on a dip down to

4596
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:25,360
I'll consider an add- on a dip down to
 

4597
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:28,310
I'll consider an add- on a dip down to
90s.

4598
01:52:28,310 --> 01:52:28,320
90s.
 

4599
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:30,470
90s.
If it holds, if they trap sellers down

4600
01:52:30,470 --> 01:52:30,480
If it holds, if they trap sellers down
 

4601
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:35,750
If it holds, if they trap sellers down
there,

4602
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:35,760

 

4603
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:37,669

we're trading right value area high for

4604
01:52:37,669 --> 01:52:37,679
we're trading right value area high for
 

4605
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:39,109
we're trading right value area high for
the day. So, if we're going to go in a

4606
01:52:39,109 --> 01:52:39,119
the day. So, if we're going to go in a
 

4607
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:58,470
the day. So, if we're going to go in a
rotation, that's going to be annoying.

4608
01:52:58,470 --> 01:52:58,480

 

4609
01:52:58,480 --> 01:52:59,910

Sellers just got caught in that last

4610
01:52:59,910 --> 01:52:59,920
Sellers just got caught in that last
 

4611
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:02,390
Sellers just got caught in that last
little flush to 900s. Someone's

4612
01:53:02,390 --> 01:53:02,400
little flush to 900s. Someone's
 

4613
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:03,750
little flush to 900s. Someone's
absorbing, trying to step in to be

4614
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:03,760
absorbing, trying to step in to be
 

4615
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:05,270
absorbing, trying to step in to be
aggressive. They're trying to step in to

4616
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:05,280
aggressive. They're trying to step in to
 

4617
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,950
aggressive. They're trying to step in to
be aggressive. I just want to see a dry

4618
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:06,960
be aggressive. I just want to see a dry
 

4619
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:09,669
be aggressive. I just want to see a dry
325s. I think we'll get a really nice

4620
01:53:09,669 --> 01:53:09,679
325s. I think we'll get a really nice
 

4621
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:12,470
325s. I think we'll get a really nice
squeeze if we can drive 325s.

4622
01:53:12,470 --> 01:53:12,480
squeeze if we can drive 325s.
 

4623
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,470
squeeze if we can drive 325s.
So interested if they hold dips into

4624
01:53:14,470 --> 01:53:14,480
So interested if they hold dips into
 

4625
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:16,390
So interested if they hold dips into
8.90. Not interested really underneath

4626
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:16,400
8.90. Not interested really underneath
 

4627
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,070
8.90. Not interested really underneath
that.

4628
01:53:18,070 --> 01:53:18,080
that.
 

4629
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,830
that.
And I'd like to see an acceleration

4630
01:53:19,830 --> 01:53:19,840
And I'd like to see an acceleration
 

4631
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,070
And I'd like to see an acceleration
325s. We haven't pulled back yet since

4632
01:53:22,070 --> 01:53:22,080
325s. We haven't pulled back yet since
 

4633
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:23,910
325s. We haven't pulled back yet since
this drive up. So, I'm expecting that

4634
01:53:23,910 --> 01:53:23,920
this drive up. So, I'm expecting that
 

4635
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:46,709
this drive up. So, I'm expecting that
they might well pull back.

4636
01:53:46,709 --> 01:53:46,719

 

4637
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:50,149

Yes, right at that IB high.

4638
01:53:50,149 --> 01:53:50,159
Yes, right at that IB high.
 

4639
01:53:50,159 --> 01:53:51,990
Yes, right at that IB high.
See if it bases and squeezes New York

4640
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:52,000
See if it bases and squeezes New York
 

4641
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,910
See if it bases and squeezes New York
open and IB high here on ES. That will

4642
01:53:53,910 --> 01:53:53,920
open and IB high here on ES. That will
 

4643
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,669
open and IB high here on ES. That will
help us if we get breath to the market

4644
01:53:55,669 --> 01:53:55,679
help us if we get breath to the market
 

4645
01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:57,750
help us if we get breath to the market
increasing. Sellers keep adding at the

4646
01:53:57,750 --> 01:53:57,760
increasing. Sellers keep adding at the
 

4647
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:59,669
increasing. Sellers keep adding at the
lows of each M1 right now, which is a

4648
01:53:59,669 --> 01:53:59,679
lows of each M1 right now, which is a
 

4649
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:09,910
lows of each M1 right now, which is a
good sign. They're being absorbed,

4650
01:54:09,910 --> 01:54:09,920

 

4651
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:11,830

stagnating here a little bit. Might be

4652
01:54:11,830 --> 01:54:11,840
stagnating here a little bit. Might be
 

4653
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:22,470
stagnating here a little bit. Might be
that they flush this down to the 90s.

4654
01:54:22,470 --> 01:54:22,480

 

4655
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:23,910

still being absorbed. Still passive

4656
01:54:23,910 --> 01:54:23,920
still being absorbed. Still passive
 

4657
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:25,830
still being absorbed. Still passive
buying there.

4658
01:54:25,830 --> 01:54:25,840
buying there.
 

4659
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:27,910
buying there.
So everything under 9 or around 900 is

4660
01:54:27,910 --> 01:54:27,920
So everything under 9 or around 900 is
 

4661
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:29,990
So everything under 9 or around 900 is
being gobbled up. I'm not adding up

4662
01:54:29,990 --> 01:54:30,000
being gobbled up. I'm not adding up
 

4663
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,669
being gobbled up. I'm not adding up
here. I want to see if we come back down

4664
01:54:31,669 --> 01:54:31,679
here. I want to see if we come back down
 

4665
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:33,430
here. I want to see if we come back down
to the 90s. I'll consider it. But I want

4666
01:54:33,430 --> 01:54:33,440
to the 90s. I'll consider it. But I want
 

4667
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:34,629
to the 90s. I'll consider it. But I want
to be careful now because we've been

4668
01:54:34,629 --> 01:54:34,639
to be careful now because we've been
 

4669
01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:35,990
to be careful now because we've been
trading between two nodes. So I don't

4670
01:54:35,990 --> 01:54:36,000
trading between two nodes. So I don't
 

4671
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,350
trading between two nodes. So I don't
want to leave one node and get trapped

4672
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:37,360
want to leave one node and get trapped
 

4673
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:38,709
want to leave one node and get trapped
between these two and rotate between

4674
01:54:38,709 --> 01:54:38,719
between these two and rotate between
 

4675
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:40,390
between these two and rotate between
these.

4676
01:54:40,390 --> 01:54:40,400
these.
 

4677
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,470
these.
So I don't want to add up here. I'll

4678
01:54:42,470 --> 01:54:42,480
So I don't want to add up here. I'll
 

4679
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:43,990
So I don't want to add up here. I'll
consider an ad down here. It's not

4680
01:54:43,990 --> 01:54:44,000
consider an ad down here. It's not
 

4681
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,310
consider an ad down here. It's not
ideal, but I will consider it. Um

4682
01:54:46,310 --> 01:54:46,320
ideal, but I will consider it. Um
 

4683
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:48,790
ideal, but I will consider it. Um
because maybe we can do this.

4684
01:54:48,790 --> 01:54:48,800
because maybe we can do this.
 

4685
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:50,870
because maybe we can do this.
Alternatively, and I'm not going to add

4686
01:54:50,870 --> 01:54:50,880
Alternatively, and I'm not going to add
 

4687
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,310
Alternatively, and I'm not going to add
up here, but alternatively, if we just

4688
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:52,320
up here, but alternatively, if we just
 

4689
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:53,510
up here, but alternatively, if we just
squeeze through this and come through

4690
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:53,520
squeeze through this and come through
 

4691
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,030
squeeze through this and come through
higher day, that would be ideal. That'd

4692
01:54:55,030 --> 01:54:55,040
higher day, that would be ideal. That'd
 

4693
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:56,790
higher day, that would be ideal. That'd
be the most ideal scenario. Not even

4694
01:54:56,790 --> 01:54:56,800
be the most ideal scenario. Not even
 

4695
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:58,470
be the most ideal scenario. Not even
offering me an ad and just keep

4696
01:54:58,470 --> 01:54:58,480
offering me an ad and just keep
 

4697
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:16,390
offering me an ad and just keep
squeezing

4698
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:16,400

 

4699
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:20,310

Yeah, the bidding 900 95s and 890s and

4700
01:55:20,310 --> 01:55:20,320
Yeah, the bidding 900 95s and 890s and
 

4701
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:22,470
Yeah, the bidding 900 95s and 890s and
880s. Don't really want it into 880s.

4702
01:55:22,470 --> 01:55:22,480
880s. Don't really want it into 880s.
 

4703
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:25,589
880s. Don't really want it into 880s.
It's right back down into the midpoint.

4704
01:55:25,589 --> 01:55:25,599
It's right back down into the midpoint.
 

4705
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:27,030
It's right back down into the midpoint.
I'd like to see these passive buyers

4706
01:55:27,030 --> 01:55:27,040
I'd like to see these passive buyers
 

4707
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:36,470
I'd like to see these passive buyers
walk up. Not seeing that right now.

4708
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:36,480

 

4709
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:38,709

Really nice if went back through 88s as

4710
01:55:38,709 --> 01:55:38,719
Really nice if went back through 88s as
 

4711
01:55:38,719 --> 01:55:41,750
Really nice if went back through 88s as
well. Here we go.

4712
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:41,760
well. Here we go.
 

4713
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:44,790
well. Here we go.
Come on. Retake IB, please.

4714
01:55:44,790 --> 01:55:44,800
Come on. Retake IB, please.
 

4715
01:55:44,800 --> 01:56:03,109
Come on. Retake IB, please.
Yes.

4716
01:56:03,109 --> 01:56:03,119

 

4717
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:04,149

Want to be careful because we're

4718
01:56:04,149 --> 01:56:04,159
Want to be careful because we're
 

4719
01:56:04,159 --> 01:56:05,510
Want to be careful because we're
straight up, but I want a straight down.

4720
01:56:05,510 --> 01:56:05,520
straight up, but I want a straight down.
 

4721
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:07,189
straight up, but I want a straight down.
So, here's a move to 90s. This is what

4722
01:56:07,189 --> 01:56:07,199
So, here's a move to 90s. This is what
 

4723
01:56:07,199 --> 01:56:13,750
So, here's a move to 90s. This is what
I'm aware of.

4724
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:13,760

 

4725
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:15,589

For me, it must hold 90s. Don't want it

4726
01:56:15,589 --> 01:56:15,599
For me, it must hold 90s. Don't want it
 

4727
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:17,669
For me, it must hold 90s. Don't want it
into this thick of this node. And it's

4728
01:56:17,669 --> 01:56:17,679
into this thick of this node. And it's
 

4729
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:19,510
into this thick of this node. And it's
got to protect in front of 90s. I don't

4730
01:56:19,510 --> 01:56:19,520
got to protect in front of 90s. I don't
 

4731
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:22,070
got to protect in front of 90s. I don't
want to be in the thick of that node

4732
01:56:22,070 --> 01:56:22,080
want to be in the thick of that node
 

4733
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:25,510
want to be in the thick of that node
because we were straight up.

4734
01:56:25,510 --> 01:56:25,520
because we were straight up.
 

4735
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:27,030
because we were straight up.
Big starting trying to find a bit of a

4736
01:56:27,030 --> 01:56:27,040
Big starting trying to find a bit of a
 

4737
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:28,390
Big starting trying to find a bit of a
bid. So, I want to be a little bit

4738
01:56:28,390 --> 01:56:28,400
bid. So, I want to be a little bit
 

4739
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:30,229
bid. So, I want to be a little bit
cautious here. Not adding yet. Just

4740
01:56:30,229 --> 01:56:30,239
cautious here. Not adding yet. Just
 

4741
01:56:30,239 --> 01:56:31,350
cautious here. Not adding yet. Just
waiting to see. Remember, we're

4742
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:31,360
waiting to see. Remember, we're
 

4743
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:32,950
waiting to see. Remember, we're
positioned all the way from down here.

4744
01:56:32,950 --> 01:56:32,960
positioned all the way from down here.
 

4745
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:34,950
positioned all the way from down here.
So, can give this a little bit of room

4746
01:56:34,950 --> 01:56:34,960
So, can give this a little bit of room
 

4747
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:37,750
So, can give this a little bit of room
on the runner.

4748
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:37,760
on the runner.
 

4749
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:40,390
on the runner.
Good absorption there again.

4750
01:56:40,390 --> 01:56:40,400
Good absorption there again.
 

4751
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:42,390
Good absorption there again.
Great absorption there again. Sellers

4752
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:42,400
Great absorption there again. Sellers
 

4753
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:44,870
Great absorption there again. Sellers
came flying in there at 900s and haven't

4754
01:56:44,870 --> 01:56:44,880
came flying in there at 900s and haven't
 

4755
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:47,430
came flying in there at 900s and haven't
won. So, I want to see this accelerate

4756
01:56:47,430 --> 01:56:47,440
won. So, I want to see this accelerate
 

4757
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:48,709
won. So, I want to see this accelerate
higher now because we just trapped all

4758
01:56:48,709 --> 01:56:48,719
higher now because we just trapped all
 

4759
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:50,790
higher now because we just trapped all
the sellers. Here we go. Go, go, go, go,

4760
01:56:50,790 --> 01:56:50,800
the sellers. Here we go. Go, go, go, go,
 

4761
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:52,310
the sellers. Here we go. Go, go, go, go,
go. You just trapped them all. Let's do

4762
01:56:52,310 --> 01:56:52,320
go. You just trapped them all. Let's do
 

4763
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,070
go. You just trapped them all. Let's do
it.

4764
01:56:54,070 --> 01:56:54,080
it.
 

4765
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:56,790
it.
Push. Break 25 and start squeezing.

4766
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:56,800
Push. Break 25 and start squeezing.
 

4767
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:57,990
Push. Break 25 and start squeezing.
Let's go. You just trapped them all.

4768
01:56:57,990 --> 01:56:58,000
Let's go. You just trapped them all.

4807
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:42,470
starting to lose faith in this.
If they don't hold this now, I'm going

4808

If they don't hold this now, I'm going
 

4809
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:44,870
If they don't hold this now, I'm going
to cut. This is the pain point for them

4810
01:57:44,870 --> 01:57:44,880
to cut. This is the pain point for them
 

4811
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:51,589
to cut. This is the pain point for them
right here, right now.

4812
01:57:51,589 --> 01:57:51,599

 

4813
01:57:51,599 --> 01:57:53,750

Can show you what I'm looking at map.

4814
01:57:53,750 --> 01:57:53,760
Can show you what I'm looking at map.
 

4815
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:55,030
Can show you what I'm looking at map.
All right, I'm probably going to cut

4816
01:57:55,030 --> 01:57:55,040
All right, I'm probably going to cut
 

4817
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:57,910
All right, I'm probably going to cut
this here. All right, so these sellers

4818
01:57:57,910 --> 01:57:57,920
this here. All right, so these sellers
 

4819
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:01,430
this here. All right, so these sellers
here are the guys that got caught,

4820
01:58:01,430 --> 01:58:01,440
here are the guys that got caught,
 

4821
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:03,589
here are the guys that got caught,
right? They just tried to take the break

4822
01:58:03,589 --> 01:58:03,599
right? They just tried to take the break
 

4823
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:05,750
right? They just tried to take the break
underneath. We used their stops to drive

4824
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:05,760
underneath. We used their stops to drive
 

4825
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:07,669
underneath. We used their stops to drive
higher. We are now retesting their

4826
01:58:07,669 --> 01:58:07,679
higher. We are now retesting their
 

4827
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:09,830
higher. We are now retesting their
stops. It must hold this and accelerate

4828
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:09,840
stops. It must hold this and accelerate
 

4829
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,990
stops. It must hold this and accelerate
higher. Otherwise, I'm out. I'm out now.

4830
01:58:11,990 --> 01:58:12,000
higher. Otherwise, I'm out. I'm out now.
 

4831
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,350
higher. Otherwise, I'm out. I'm out now.
I don't care even if they send it

4832
01:58:13,350 --> 01:58:13,360
I don't care even if they send it
 

4833
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:14,709
I don't care even if they send it
higher. I'm not willing to sit through

4834
01:58:14,709 --> 01:58:14,719
higher. I'm not willing to sit through
 

4835
01:58:14,719 --> 01:58:16,310
higher. I'm not willing to sit through
this. We had They had the chance to do

4836
01:58:16,310 --> 01:58:16,320
this. We had They had the chance to do
 

4837
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,589
this. We had They had the chance to do
it. They just trapped everyone. Maybe

4838
01:58:17,589 --> 01:58:17,599
it. They just trapped everyone. Maybe
 

4839
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:19,990
it. They just trapped everyone. Maybe
they retrap again on a second leg, but

4840
01:58:19,990 --> 01:58:20,000
they retrap again on a second leg, but
 

4841
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,550
they retrap again on a second leg, but
I'm I'm good with that. I can always

4842
01:58:22,550 --> 01:58:22,560
I'm I'm good with that. I can always
 

4843
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:25,510
I'm I'm good with that. I can always
read in back over 25s. Need to uh stick

4844
01:58:25,510 --> 01:58:25,520
read in back over 25s. Need to uh stick
 

4845
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:27,510
read in back over 25s. Need to uh stick

effectively.
 

4849
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:32,870
effectively.
All

4850
01:58:32,870 --> 01:58:32,880

 

4851
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:34,149

right, I'm going to take a bathroom

4852
01:58:34,149 --> 01:58:34,159
right, I'm going to take a bathroom
 

4853
01:58:34,159 --> 02:01:41,830
right, I'm going to take a bathroom
break. I'll be back.

4854
02:01:41,830 --> 02:01:41,840

 

4855
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:45,910

Okay,

4856
02:01:45,910 --> 02:01:45,920

 

4857
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:48,310

as you notice guys, I have zero patience

4858
02:01:48,310 --> 02:01:48,320
as you notice guys, I have zero patience
 

4859
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:50,070
as you notice guys, I have zero patience
right now. And when you go through what

4860
02:01:50,070 --> 02:01:50,080
right now. And when you go through what
 

4861
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:52,070
right now. And when you go through what
I'm going through, neither would you.

4862
02:01:52,070 --> 02:01:52,080
I'm going through, neither would you.
 

4863
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:55,030
I'm going through, neither would you.
So, I would advise you not to test me on

4864
02:01:55,030 --> 02:01:55,040
So, I would advise you not to test me on
 

4865
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:57,189
So, I would advise you not to test me on
stream because I'm doing my best to be

4866
02:01:57,189 --> 02:01:57,199
stream because I'm doing my best to be
 

4867
02:01:57,199 --> 02:01:58,870
stream because I'm doing my best to be
here. If you test me, I'm likely to

4868
02:01:58,870 --> 02:01:58,880
here. If you test me, I'm likely to
 

4869
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:07,350
here. If you test me, I'm likely to
blow.

4870
02:02:07,350 --> 02:02:07,360

 

4871
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:09,109

just joined and subscribed. What stocks

4872
02:02:09,109 --> 02:02:09,119
just joined and subscribed. What stocks
 

4873
02:02:09,119 --> 02:02:10,790
just joined and subscribed. What stocks
you trading? We're trading futures. This

4874
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:10,800
you trading? We're trading futures. This
 

4875
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:15,270
you trading? We're trading futures. This
is the NQ

4876
02:02:15,270 --> 02:02:15,280

 

4877
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:17,030

level. Holding well. Yes, holding very

4878
02:02:17,030 --> 02:02:17,040
level. Holding well. Yes, holding very
 

4879
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:20,550
level. Holding well. Yes, holding very
well actually. Maybe I was a bit uh can

4880
02:02:20,550 --> 02:02:20,560
well actually. Maybe I was a bit uh can
 

4881
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:24,470
well actually. Maybe I was a bit uh can
give it enough room. But for me, the dip

4882
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:24,480
give it enough room. But for me, the dip
 

4883
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:27,030
give it enough room. But for me, the dip
I think was it this one. Whichever dip

4884
02:02:27,030 --> 02:02:27,040
I think was it this one. Whichever dip
 

4885
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:29,030
I think was it this one. Whichever dip
that was, one of those dips, it trapped

4886
02:02:29,030 --> 02:02:29,040
that was, one of those dips, it trapped
 

4887
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:31,270
that was, one of those dips, it trapped
enough in. It shouldn't it shouldn't

4888
02:02:31,270 --> 02:02:31,280
enough in. It shouldn't it shouldn't
 

4889
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:36,149
enough in. It shouldn't it shouldn't
need to do it again.

4890
02:02:36,149 --> 02:02:36,159

 

4891
02:02:36,159 --> 02:02:38,790

Shouldn't need to do it again. So, you

4892
02:02:38,790 --> 02:02:38,800
Shouldn't need to do it again. So, you
 

4893
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:40,550
Shouldn't need to do it again. So, you
got to be careful if we go in rotation,

4894
02:02:40,550 --> 02:02:40,560
got to be careful if we go in rotation,
 

4895
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:41,589
got to be careful if we go in rotation,
right? If we're going to stay in

4896
02:02:41,589 --> 02:02:41,599
right? If we're going to stay in
 

4897
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:44,550
right? If we're going to stay in
rotation, it's going to be a pain.

4898
02:02:44,550 --> 02:02:44,560
rotation, it's going to be a pain.
 

4899
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:46,709
rotation, it's going to be a pain.
Make sure this lines up. 56 is Yeah,

4900
02:02:46,709 --> 02:02:46,719
Make sure this lines up. 56 is Yeah,
 

4901
02:02:46,719 --> 02:02:49,109
Make sure this lines up. 56 is Yeah,
it's pretty much there. So, that's what

4902
02:02:49,109 --> 02:02:49,119
it's pretty much there. So, that's what
 

4903
02:02:49,119 --> 02:02:51,350
it's pretty much there. So, that's what
I'm aware of.

4904
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:51,360
I'm aware of.
 

4905
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:53,270
I'm aware of.
It can still absorb, right? The problem

4906
02:02:53,270 --> 02:02:53,280
It can still absorb, right? The problem
 

4907
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:55,109
It can still absorb, right? The problem
you've got now is if you've developed a

4908
02:02:55,109 --> 02:02:55,119
you've got now is if you've developed a
 

4909
02:02:55,119 --> 02:02:57,270
you've got now is if you've developed a
node here,

4910
02:02:57,270 --> 02:02:57,280
node here,
 

4911
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:59,910
node here,
right, and buyers get stuck here and you

4912
02:02:59,910 --> 02:02:59,920
right, and buyers get stuck here and you
 

4913
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:02,149
right, and buyers get stuck here and you
drift down here and buyers bid this,

4914
02:03:02,149 --> 02:03:02,159
drift down here and buyers bid this,
 

4915
02:03:02,159 --> 02:03:04,550
drift down here and buyers bid this,
your rotation takes place in here until

4916
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:04,560
your rotation takes place in here until
 

4917
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:07,430
your rotation takes place in here until
you find acceptance or unfortunately for

4918
02:03:07,430 --> 02:03:07,440
you find acceptance or unfortunately for
 

4919
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:09,589
you find acceptance or unfortunately for
a person who got very upset or we will

4920
02:03:09,589 --> 02:03:09,599
a person who got very upset or we will
 

4921
02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:12,149
a person who got very upset or we will
do that because those are the rules,

4922
02:03:12,149 --> 02:03:12,159
do that because those are the rules,
 

4923
02:03:12,159 --> 02:03:15,669
do that because those are the rules,
right? There's never one trade.

4924
02:03:15,669 --> 02:03:15,679
right? There's never one trade.
 

4925
02:03:15,679 --> 02:03:17,510
right? There's never one trade.
You believe that market can only do one

4926
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:17,520
You believe that market can only do one
 

4927
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:19,189
You believe that market can only do one
thing, then why doesn't it always go up

4928
02:03:19,189 --> 02:03:19,199
thing, then why doesn't it always go up
 

4929
02:03:19,199 --> 02:03:31,510
thing, then why doesn't it always go up
or always go down? It's just nonsense.

4930
02:03:31,510 --> 02:03:31,520

 

4931
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:33,030

could be trapping more for the run to

4932
02:03:33,030 --> 02:03:33,040
could be trapping more for the run to
 

4933
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:35,830
could be trapping more for the run to
26116. Yeah, I I would agree with you.

4934
02:03:35,830 --> 02:03:35,840
26116. Yeah, I I would agree with you.
 

4935
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:37,990
26116. Yeah, I I would agree with you.
It's very possible. Um but the first

4936
02:03:37,990 --> 02:03:38,000
It's very possible. Um but the first
 

4937
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,470
It's very possible. Um but the first
problem is

4938
02:03:40,470 --> 02:03:40,480
problem is
 

4939
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:42,629
problem is
it could be trapping. It's got to get

4940
02:03:42,629 --> 02:03:42,639
it could be trapping. It's got to get
 

4941
02:03:42,639 --> 02:03:44,310
it could be trapping. It's got to get
through. You've got a big node which we

4942
02:03:44,310 --> 02:03:44,320
through. You've got a big node which we
 

4943
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:47,589
through. You've got a big node which we
tapped into this morning 950 to 970 and

4944
02:03:47,589 --> 02:03:47,599
tapped into this morning 950 to 970 and
 

4945
02:03:47,599 --> 02:03:51,109
tapped into this morning 950 to 970 and
that's before you've even got to 26 uh

4946
02:03:51,109 --> 02:03:51,119
that's before you've even got to 26 uh
 

4947
02:03:51,119 --> 02:03:54,310
that's before you've even got to 26 uh
042, right? I see what you're looking

4948
02:03:54,310 --> 02:03:54,320
042, right? I see what you're looking
 

4949
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:55,589
042, right? I see what you're looking
looking at. I agree with you. From a

4950
02:03:55,589 --> 02:03:55,599
looking at. I agree with you. From a
 

4951
02:03:55,599 --> 02:03:56,950
looking at. I agree with you. From a
swing point of view, it makes sense.

4952
02:03:56,950 --> 02:03:56,960
swing point of view, it makes sense.
 

4953
02:03:56,960 --> 02:03:58,550
swing point of view, it makes sense.
Absolutely it makes sense. From a swing

4954
02:03:58,550 --> 02:03:58,560
Absolutely it makes sense. From a swing
 

4955
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:03,830
Absolutely it makes sense. From a swing
point of view,

4956
02:04:03,830 --> 02:04:03,840

 

4957
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:05,270

still hasn't broken the orb. Yeah, I

4958
02:04:05,270 --> 02:04:05,280
still hasn't broken the orb. Yeah, I
 

4959
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:07,189
still hasn't broken the orb. Yeah, I
mean failed look below. Hasn't traded

4960
02:04:07,189 --> 02:04:07,199
mean failed look below. Hasn't traded
 

4961
02:04:07,199 --> 02:04:08,550
mean failed look below. Hasn't traded
through the top side. Yeah, same as the

4962
02:04:08,550 --> 02:04:08,560
through the top side. Yeah, same as the
 

4963
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:09,830
through the top side. Yeah, same as the
initial balance. Still trading midpoint

4964
02:04:09,830 --> 02:04:09,840
initial balance. Still trading midpoint
 

4965
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:11,669
initial balance. Still trading midpoint
of IB.

4966
02:04:11,669 --> 02:04:11,679
of IB.
 

4967
02:04:11,679 --> 02:04:13,669
of IB.
Absolutely. Absolutely agree with you

4968
02:04:13,669 --> 02:04:13,679
Absolutely. Absolutely agree with you
 

4969
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:23,669
Absolutely. Absolutely agree with you
all saying that

4979
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:33,430

900s again. So they're going to try and

4980
02:04:33,430 --> 02:04:33,440
900s again. So they're going to try and
 

4981
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:34,870
900s again. So they're going to try and
do that move. They are trying to hold

4982
02:04:34,870 --> 02:04:34,880
do that move. They are trying to hold
 

4983
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:36,629
do that move. They are trying to hold
the 90s. They are trying to get that

4984
02:04:36,629 --> 02:04:36,639
the 90s. They are trying to get that
 

4985
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:38,390
the 90s. They are trying to get that
squeeze up. They're trying to develop

4986
02:04:38,390 --> 02:04:38,400
squeeze up. They're trying to develop
 

4987
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:39,750
squeeze up. They're trying to develop
this inverse head and shoulders we

4988
02:04:39,750 --> 02:04:39,760
this inverse head and shoulders we
 

4989
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:40,790
this inverse head and shoulders we
talked about. The problem is you've got

4990
02:04:40,790 --> 02:04:40,800
talked about. The problem is you've got
 

4991
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:42,629
talked about. The problem is you've got
this little node here, right? Get

4992
02:04:42,629 --> 02:04:42,639
this little node here, right? Get
 

4993
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:44,229
this little node here, right? Get
through that and you've got a shot. Get

4994
02:04:44,229 --> 02:04:44,239
through that and you've got a shot. Get
 

4995
02:04:44,239 --> 02:04:46,070
through that and you've got a shot. Get
through that and you've got a shot. But

4996
02:04:46,070 --> 02:04:46,080
through that and you've got a shot. But
 

4997
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:47,750
through that and you've got a shot. But
you must get through this right here. So

4998
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:47,760
you must get through this right here. So
 

4999
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:48,870
you must get through this right here. So
these are the nodes that you're looking

5000
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:48,880
these are the nodes that you're looking
 

5001
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:50,390
these are the nodes that you're looking
at right now. We can just do them as

5002
02:04:50,390 --> 02:04:50,400
at right now. We can just do them as
 

5003
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:53,990
at right now. We can just do them as
gray. Right? One there

5004
02:04:53,990 --> 02:04:54,000
gray. Right? One there
 

5005
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:57,189
gray. Right? One there
and a big fat one here.

5006
02:04:57,189 --> 02:04:57,199
and a big fat one here.
 

5007
02:04:57,199 --> 02:04:58,950
and a big fat one here.
Right? These are the nodes. That's the

5008
02:04:58,950 --> 02:04:58,960
Right? These are the nodes. That's the
 

5009
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:14,470
Right? These are the nodes. That's the
rotation.

5010
02:05:14,470 --> 02:05:14,480

 

5011
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:17,030

The best day for me. I made 13K. That's

5012
02:05:17,030 --> 02:05:17,040
The best day for me. I made 13K. That's
 

5013
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:22,390
The best day for me. I made 13K. That's
awesome work.

5014
02:05:22,390 --> 02:05:22,400

 

5015
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:24,149

Let's see if they rebid above that or

5016
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:24,159
Let's see if they rebid above that or
 

5017
02:05:24,159 --> 02:05:33,830
Let's see if they rebid above that or
not.

5018
02:05:33,830 --> 02:05:33,840

 

5019
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:45,350

Here

5020
02:05:45,350 --> 02:05:45,360

 

5021
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:48,550

we go. All right. Rebidding above this.

5022
02:05:48,550 --> 02:05:48,560
we go. All right. Rebidding above this.
 

5023
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:51,189
we go. All right. Rebidding above this.
Let's see if we can go now then. See if

5024
02:05:51,189 --> 02:05:51,199
Let's see if we can go now then. See if
 

5025
02:05:51,199 --> 02:05:57,350
Let's see if we can go now then. See if
there's a way of getting involved here.

5026
02:05:57,350 --> 02:05:57,360

 

5027
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:59,189

Value area high on the day 12s. I want

5028
02:05:59,189 --> 02:05:59,199
Value area high on the day 12s. I want
 

5029
02:05:59,199 --> 02:06:02,149
Value area high on the day 12s. I want
to see acceleration through 25s.

5030
02:06:02,149 --> 02:06:02,159
to see acceleration through 25s.
 

5031
02:06:02,159 --> 02:06:03,830
to see acceleration through 25s.
want dips to hold now and I want

5032
02:06:03,830 --> 02:06:03,840
want dips to hold now and I want
 

5033
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:07,350
want dips to hold now and I want
acceleration through 25s

5034
02:06:07,350 --> 02:06:07,360
acceleration through 25s
 

5035
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:08,629
acceleration through 25s
if we're going to build this inverse

5036
02:06:08,629 --> 02:06:08,639
if we're going to build this inverse
 

5037
02:06:08,639 --> 02:06:10,709
if we're going to build this inverse
right shoulder and come up to this IB

5038
02:06:10,709 --> 02:06:10,719
right shoulder and come up to this IB
 

5039
02:06:10,719 --> 02:06:16,790
right shoulder and come up to this IB
high maybe accelerate through it.

5040
02:06:16,790 --> 02:06:16,800

 

5041
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:28,629

There we go.

5042
02:06:28,629 --> 02:06:28,639

 

5043
02:06:28,639 --> 02:06:30,709

Lots of liquidity at 25. Should go and

5044
02:06:30,709 --> 02:06:30,719
Lots of liquidity at 25. Should go and
 

5045
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:34,550
Lots of liquidity at 25. Should go and
take that out. There we go. Come on. So,

5046
02:06:34,550 --> 02:06:34,560
take that out. There we go. Come on. So,
 

5047
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:36,390
take that out. There we go. Come on. So,
imbalance here. We just tapped into old

5048
02:06:36,390 --> 02:06:36,400
imbalance here. We just tapped into old
 

5049
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:39,430
imbalance here. We just tapped into old
imbalance from uh 1040 this morning.

5050
02:06:39,430 --> 02:06:39,440
imbalance from uh 1040 this morning.
 

5051
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:43,189
imbalance from uh 1040 this morning.
That's up to 17. Yeah, 17.25.

5052
02:06:43,189 --> 02:06:43,199
That's up to 17. Yeah, 17.25.
 

5053
02:06:43,199 --> 02:06:48,069
That's up to 17. Yeah, 17.25.
We need to trade through that imbalance.

5054
02:06:48,069 --> 02:06:48,079

 

5055
02:06:48,079 --> 02:06:49,669

Feeling an old sellside imbalance there.

5056
02:06:49,669 --> 02:06:49,679
Feeling an old sellside imbalance there.
 

5057
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:50,950
Feeling an old sellside imbalance there.
Once we trade through that, I think we

5058
02:06:50,950 --> 02:06:50,960
Once we trade through that, I think we
 

5059
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:53,430
Once we trade through that, I think we
can really start accelerating. We will

5060
02:06:53,430 --> 02:06:53,440
can really start accelerating. We will
 

5061
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:59,910
can really start accelerating. We will
see if it's able to do it.

5062
02:06:59,910 --> 02:06:59,920

 

5063
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:01,669

the top of value there as well. I'll be

5064
02:07:01,669 --> 02:07:01,679
the top of value there as well. I'll be
 

5065
02:07:01,679 --> 02:07:03,589
the top of value there as well. I'll be
careful of that.

5066
02:07:03,589 --> 02:07:03,599
careful of that.
 

5067
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:05,430
careful of that.
16s there. What if I got it on mine?

5068
02:07:05,430 --> 02:07:05,440
16s there. What if I got it on mine?
 

5069
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:10,550
16s there. What if I got it on mine?
12elves. Not matching up quite right.

5070
02:07:10,550 --> 02:07:10,560

 

5071
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:12,149

So, this gray box needs to hold now for

5072
02:07:12,149 --> 02:07:12,159
So, this gray box needs to hold now for
 

5073
02:07:12,159 --> 02:07:15,270
So, this gray box needs to hold now for
the longs.

5074
02:07:15,270 --> 02:07:15,280
the longs.
 

5075
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:17,350
the longs.
How long we got left? Ages left. 40

5076
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:17,360
How long we got left? Ages left. 40
 

5077
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:18,709
How long we got left? Ages left. 40

Can't find an volume profile on NT. Um

5160

Can't find an volume profile on NT. Um
 

5161
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:43,910
Can't find an volume profile on NT. Um
you have to manually

5162
02:09:43,910 --> 02:09:43,920
you have to manually
 

5163
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:45,669
you have to manually
I think it's in data series. You will

5164
02:09:45,669 --> 02:09:45,679
I think it's in data series. You will
 

5165
02:09:45,679 --> 02:09:47,830
I think it's in data series. You will
need to create a condition. I can't

5166
02:09:47,830 --> 02:09:47,840
need to create a condition. I can't
 

5167
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:48,950
need to create a condition. I can't
remember how to do it off the top of my

5168
02:09:48,950 --> 02:09:48,960
remember how to do it off the top of my
 

5169
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:51,510
remember how to do it off the top of my
head. My head is fried. But uh you

5170
02:09:51,510 --> 02:09:51,520
head. My head is fried. But uh you
 

5171
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:53,109
head. My head is fried. But uh you
basically need to create a setting. You

5172
02:09:53,109 --> 02:09:53,119
basically need to create a setting. You
 

5173
02:09:53,119 --> 02:09:54,950
basically need to create a setting. You
can call it whatever your name is, which

5174
02:09:54,950 --> 02:09:54,960
can call it whatever your name is, which
 

5175
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:57,030
can call it whatever your name is, which
starts the volume profile at 9:30 each

5176
02:09:57,030 --> 02:09:57,040
starts the volume profile at 9:30 each
 

5177
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:59,189
starts the volume profile at 9:30 each
day. There is definitely a way to do it

5178
02:09:59,189 --> 02:09:59,199
day. There is definitely a way to do it
 

5179
02:09:59,199 --> 02:10:07,589
day. There is definitely a way to do it
cuz I've done it.

5180
02:10:07,589 --> 02:10:07,599

I think it will come sooner rather than
 

5185
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:14,709
I think it will come sooner rather than
later. Let's see if I can find the um

5186
02:10:14,709 --> 02:10:14,719
later. Let's see if I can find the um

close which be in the 940s? I'd really

5244
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:42,480
close which be in the 940s? I'd really
 

5245
02:11:42,480 --> 02:11:45,109
close which be in the 940s? I'd really
like acceleration through that as well.

5246
02:11:45,109 --> 02:11:45,119
like acceleration through that as well.
 

5247
02:11:45,119 --> 02:11:46,470
like acceleration through that as well.
So, if you haven't paid yourself yet,

So, if you haven't paid yourself yet,
 

5249
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:51,030
So, if you haven't paid yourself yet,
make sure you're paying yourself.

5250
02:11:51,030 --> 02:11:51,040

 

5251
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:57,589

I've just wicked everyone out. They have

5260
02:12:09,669 --> 02:12:09,679
I've just wicked everyone out. They have
 

5261
02:12:09,679 --> 02:12:11,030
I've just wicked everyone out. They have
got a chance to move higher at this

5262
02:12:11,030 --> 02:12:11,040
got a chance to move higher at this
 

5263
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:14,550
got a chance to move higher at this
point.

5265
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:16,629

And you'd want dips to hold really this

5266
02:12:16,629 --> 02:12:16,639
And you'd want dips to hold really this
 

5267
02:12:16,639 --> 02:12:18,790
And you'd want dips to hold really this
edge at 14s if you're going to look for

5268
02:12:18,790 --> 02:12:18,800
edge at 14s if you're going to look for
 

5269
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:20,790
edge at 14s if you're going to look for
continuation. I'm not going to add any

There's a lot of aggressive buying

taking place here, which concerns me
 

5299
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:58,069
taking place here, which concerns me
because we're not moving higher. We just

5300
02:12:58,069 --> 02:12:58,079
because we're not moving higher. We just
 

5301
02:12:58,079 --> 02:13:02,550
because we're not moving higher. We just
had like a 286 lot, 101 lot, and we've

5302
02:13:02,550 --> 02:13:02,560
had like a 286 lot, 101 lot, and we've
 

5303
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:03,990
had like a 286 lot, 101 lot, and we've
faded back away from that. Don't like

5304
02:13:03,990 --> 02:13:04,000
faded back away from that. Don't like
 

5305
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,669
faded back away from that. Don't like
it. I do not like that we haven't

5306
02:13:05,669 --> 02:13:05,679
it. I do not like that we haven't
 

5307
02:13:05,679 --> 02:13:07,589
it. I do not like that we haven't
accelerated away from that now. So,

5308
02:13:07,589 --> 02:13:07,599
accelerated away from that now. So,
 

5309
02:13:07,599 --> 02:13:09,510
accelerated away from that now. So,
buyers starting to get trapped there at

5310
02:13:09,510 --> 02:13:09,520
buyers starting to get trapped there at
 

5311
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:11,510
buyers starting to get trapped there at
25s.

5312
02:13:11,510 --> 02:13:11,520
25s.
 

5313
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:13,510
25s.
I might be done with this now. Locked

5314
02:13:13,510 --> 02:13:13,520

5315
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:22,950

5317
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:25,270

I did, but you used a downloaded

5318
02:13:25,270 --> 02:13:25,280
I did, but you used a downloaded
 

5319
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:27,910
I did, but you used a downloaded
anchored profile. I didn't use a

5320
02:13:27,910 --> 02:13:27,920
anchored profile. I didn't use a
 

5321
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:30,229
anchored profile. I didn't use a
downloaded anchored profile. That's not

5322
02:13:30,229 --> 02:13:30,239
downloaded anchored profile. That's not
 

5323
02:13:30,239 --> 02:13:34,950
downloaded anchored profile. That's not
what I used at all.

5324
02:13:34,950 --> 02:13:34,960

 

5325
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:37,350

I used the orderflow volume profile and

5326
02:13:37,350 --> 02:13:37,360
I used the orderflow volume profile and
 

5327
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:39,910
I used the orderflow volume profile and
I create

5328
02:13:39,910 --> 02:13:39,920
I create
 

5329
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:42,950
I create
my own 9:30 to 4:00 which I show you how

5330
02:13:42,950 --> 02:13:42,960
my own 9:30 to 4:00 which I show you how
 

5331
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:44,069
my own 9:30 to 4:00 which I show you how
to do in there. There's nothing

5332
02:13:44,069 --> 02:13:44,079
to do in there. There's nothing
 

5333
02:13:44,079 --> 02:14:02,229
to do in there. There's nothing
downloaded for it.

5334
02:14:02,229 --> 02:14:02,239

 

5335
02:14:02,239 --> 02:14:03,589

all right definitely seeing those buyers

5336
02:14:03,589 --> 02:14:03,599
all right definitely seeing those buyers
 

5337
02:14:03,599 --> 02:14:09,669
all right definitely seeing those buyers
get trapped up there under 25s now

5338
02:14:09,669 --> 02:14:09,679

 

5339
02:14:09,679 --> 02:14:11,270

back to this gray box we just talked

5340
02:14:11,270 --> 02:14:11,280
back to this gray box we just talked
 

5341
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:14,629
back to this gray box we just talked
about P

5342
02:14:14,629 --> 02:14:14,639
about P
 

5343
02:14:14,639 --> 02:14:16,550
about P
for the day it's also P for the current

5344
02:14:16,550 --> 02:14:16,560
for the day it's also P for the current
 

5345
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:18,550
for the day it's also P for the current
week so this is fair value for the week

5346
02:14:18,550 --> 02:14:18,560
week so this is fair value for the week
 

5347
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:19,830
week so this is fair value for the week
so it's becoming less and less

5348
02:14:19,830 --> 02:14:19,840
so it's becoming less and less
 

5349
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:22,629
so it's becoming less and less
interesting to trade around here now.

5350
02:14:22,629 --> 02:14:22,639
interesting to trade around here now.
 

5351
02:14:22,639 --> 02:14:25,109
interesting to trade around here now.

02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:20,069
sense, I will cut,
right? If this took an hour to take

5394
02:16:20,069 --> 02:16:20,079
right? If this took an hour to take
 

5395
02:16:20,079 --> 02:16:24,870

5399
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:28,310
then I would have waited an hour for it
to hit TP. But we did it very quickly,

5400
02:16:28,310 --> 02:16:28,320
to hit TP. But we did it very quickly,
 

5401
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:29,910
to hit TP. But we did it very quickly,
didn't we? What's been the level all

5402
02:16:29,910 --> 02:16:29,920
didn't we? What's been the level all

5405
02:16:35,599 --> 02:16:37,669
day? this here 90s and the 25s
and this was the buy opportunity here

5406
02:16:37,669 --> 02:16:37,679
and this was the buy opportunity here
 

5407
02:16:37,679 --> 02:16:42,790
and this was the buy opportunity here
once we trapped that was the long TP1

5408
02:16:42,790 --> 02:16:42,800

for the next leg up or is it a bull trap
that sells? That's why we're stuck. If

5550
02:21:38,070 --> 02:21:38,080
that sells? That's why we're stuck. If
 

5551
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:42,469
that sells? That's why we're stuck. If
we move down to from a daily

5552
02:21:42,469 --> 02:21:42,479
we move down to from a daily
 

5553
02:21:42,479 --> 02:21:44,950
we move down to from a daily
into an hourly,

5554
02:21:44,950 --> 02:21:44,960
into an hourly,
 

5555
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:47,990
into an hourly,
right, you can see

5556
02:21:47,990 --> 02:21:48,000
right, you can see
 

5557
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:49,910
right, you can see
this is in the old contract. This is a

5558
02:21:49,910 --> 02:21:49,920
this is in the old contract. This is a
 

5559
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:52,070
this is in the old contract. This is a
two weeks balance range that we left.

5560
02:21:52,070 --> 02:21:52,080
two weeks balance range that we left.
 

5561
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:54,070
two weeks balance range that we left.
Remember, the nicest trade we had here

5562
02:21:54,070 --> 02:21:54,080
Remember, the nicest trade we had here
 

5563
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:55,510
Remember, the nicest trade we had here
at the end of last year was this here.

5564
02:21:55,510 --> 02:21:55,520
at the end of last year was this here.
 

5565
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:57,670
at the end of last year was this here.
We left a two weeks balance range and we

5566
02:21:57,670 --> 02:21:57,680
We left a two weeks balance range and we
 

5567
02:21:57,680 --> 02:22:00,790
We left a two weeks balance range and we
faded away from it. Ever since then,

5568
02:22:00,790 --> 02:22:00,800
faded away from it. Ever since then,
 

5569
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:04,070
faded away from it. Ever since then,
since I don't know, mid December, we've

5570
02:22:04,070 --> 02:22:04,080
since I don't know, mid December, we've
 

5571
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:06,790
since I don't know, mid December, we've
just been trading between this range

5572
02:22:06,790 --> 02:22:06,800
just been trading between this range
 

5573
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:09,030
just been trading between this range
here and this range here and building

5574
02:22:09,030 --> 02:22:09,040
here and this range here and building
 

5575
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:13,270
here and this range here and building
out. Look at this. 1 2 3 4 weeks going

5576
02:22:13,270 --> 02:22:13,280
out. Look at this. 1 2 3 4 weeks going
 

5577
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:16,230
out. Look at this. 1 2 3 4 weeks going
nowhere. We are quite literally going

5578
02:22:16,230 --> 02:22:16,240
nowhere. We are quite literally going
 

5579
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:19,030
nowhere. We are quite literally going
nowhere in the market. All right. while

5580
02:22:19,030 --> 02:22:19,040
nowhere in the market. All right. while
 

5581
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:32,309
nowhere in the market. All right. while
we build out liquidity.

5582
02:22:32,309 --> 02:22:32,319

 

5583
02:22:32,319 --> 02:22:34,070

What does it say about me that my best

5584
02:22:34,070 --> 02:22:34,080
What does it say about me that my best
 

5585
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:35,910
What does it say about me that my best
trading comes when I'm trying to lose

5586
02:22:35,910 --> 02:22:35,920
trading comes when I'm trying to lose
 

5587
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:39,510
trading comes when I'm trying to lose
money?

5588
02:22:39,510 --> 02:22:39,520

 

5589
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:41,190

Oh man, that's the worst. E, so you've

5590
02:22:41,190 --> 02:22:41,200
Oh man, that's the worst. E, so you've
 

5591
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:43,429
Oh man, that's the worst. E, so you've
made too much. You're trying to lose

5592
02:22:43,429 --> 02:22:43,439
made too much. You're trying to lose
 

5593
02:22:43,439 --> 02:22:45,349
made too much. You're trying to lose
more. You're trying to lose some and

5594
02:22:45,349 --> 02:22:45,359
more. You're trying to lose some and
 

5595
02:22:45,359 --> 02:22:47,670
more. You're trying to lose some and
you're making more. The best thing to

5596
02:22:47,670 --> 02:22:47,680
you're making more. The best thing to
 

5597
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:50,870
you're making more. The best thing to
do, mate, is not worry about um the

5598
02:22:50,870 --> 02:22:50,880
do, mate, is not worry about um the
 

5599
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:53,590
do, mate, is not worry about um the
trade. Run your costs up, right? If you

5600
02:22:53,590 --> 02:22:53,600
trade. Run your costs up, right? If you
 

5601
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:55,030
trade. Run your costs up, right? If you
want to do that, run your costs up. Buy,

5602
02:22:55,030 --> 02:22:55,040
want to do that, run your costs up. Buy,
 

5603
02:22:55,040 --> 02:22:56,550
want to do that, run your costs up. Buy,
sell, buy, sell, buy, sell, buy, sell.

5604
02:22:56,550 --> 02:22:56,560
sell, buy, sell, buy, sell, buy, sell.
 

5605
02:22:56,560 --> 02:22:58,150
sell, buy, sell, buy, sell, buy, sell.
Just non-stop run your costs up. That's

5606
02:22:58,150 --> 02:22:58,160
Just non-stop run your costs up. That's
 

5607
02:22:58,160 --> 02:23:07,030
Just non-stop run your costs up. That's
the best way to do it.

5608
02:23:07,030 --> 02:23:07,040

 

5609
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:09,990

Have I been naughty today?

5610
02:23:09,990 --> 02:23:10,000
Have I been naughty today?
 

5611
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:20,630
Have I been naughty today?
That's a weird question.

5612
02:23:20,630 --> 02:23:20,640

 

5613
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:21,910

Like I said, if we lose this, we'll come

5614
02:23:21,910 --> 02:23:21,920
Like I said, if we lose this, we'll come
 

5615
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:23,590
Like I said, if we lose this, we'll come
back down to this gray box. Here's the

5616
02:23:23,590 --> 02:23:23,600
back down to this gray box. Here's the
 

5617
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:25,910
back down to this gray box. Here's the
90s again. And the dip in the 90s again.

5618
02:23:25,910 --> 02:23:25,920
90s again. And the dip in the 90s again.
 

5619
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:27,670
90s again. And the dip in the 90s again.
Right.

5620
02:23:27,670 --> 02:23:27,680
Right.
 

5621
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:33,510
Right.
We're running out of range to play with.

5622
02:23:33,510 --> 02:23:33,520

 

5623
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:35,110

Yeah, that's a that's a good idea,

5624
02:23:35,110 --> 02:23:35,120
Yeah, that's a that's a good idea,
 

5625
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:37,270
Yeah, that's a that's a good idea,
Ransom. That's a good idea. Something

5626
02:23:37,270 --> 02:23:37,280
Ransom. That's a good idea. Something
 

5627
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:38,950
Ransom. That's a good idea. Something
with a bigger spread and flip them.

5628
02:23:38,950 --> 02:23:38,960
with a bigger spread and flip them.
 

5629
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:40,630
with a bigger spread and flip them.
That's a great idea. And hit the market

5630
02:23:40,630 --> 02:23:40,640
That's a great idea. And hit the market
 

5631
02:23:40,640 --> 02:23:42,230
That's a great idea. And hit the market
each side. Buy the market, sell the

5632
02:23:42,230 --> 02:23:42,240
each side. Buy the market, sell the
 

5633
02:23:42,240 --> 02:23:43,910
each side. Buy the market, sell the
market. So you you get filled the spread

5634
02:23:43,910 --> 02:23:43,920
market. So you you get filled the spread
 

5635
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:45,830
market. So you you get filled the spread
and you get filled the cost of it. It's

5636
02:23:45,830 --> 02:23:45,840
and you get filled the cost of it. It's
 

5637
02:23:45,840 --> 02:23:48,469
and you get filled the cost of it. It's
a good idea. What would be a good one

5638
02:23:48,469 --> 02:23:48,479
a good idea. What would be a good one
 

5639
02:23:48,479 --> 02:23:50,389
a good idea. What would be a good one
for that? Like cattle or something? Is

5640
02:23:50,389 --> 02:23:50,399
for that? Like cattle or something? Is
 

5641
02:23:50,399 --> 02:23:53,190
for that? Like cattle or something? Is
it something that lacks liquidity with a

5642
02:23:53,190 --> 02:23:53,200
it something that lacks liquidity with a
 

5643
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:58,230
it something that lacks liquidity with a
bigger spread?

5644
02:23:58,230 --> 02:23:58,240

 

5645
02:23:58,240 --> 02:24:01,670

Soybeans, maybe

5646
02:24:01,670 --> 02:24:01,680
Soybeans, maybe
 

5647
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:03,830
Soybeans, maybe
coffee,

5648
02:24:03,830 --> 02:24:03,840
coffee,
 

5649
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:14,469
coffee,
something like that.

5650
02:24:14,469 --> 02:24:14,479

 

5651
02:24:14,479 --> 02:24:18,230

All right, market's not moving. If we've

5652
02:24:18,230 --> 02:24:18,240
All right, market's not moving. If we've
 

5653
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:19,670
All right, market's not moving. If we've
got enough likes, I'll do a giveaway

5654
02:24:19,670 --> 02:24:19,680
got enough likes, I'll do a giveaway
 

5655
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:35,750
got enough likes, I'll do a giveaway
now. We'll do it a little bit earlier.

5656
02:24:35,750 --> 02:24:35,760

 

5657
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:39,510

We need 12 likes.

5658
02:24:39,510 --> 02:24:39,520
We need 12 likes.
 

5659
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:41,030
We need 12 likes.

5660
02:24:41,030 --> 02:24:41,040
12 more likes and we'll give away an
 

5661
02:24:41,040 --> 02:25:04,150
12 more likes and we'll give away an
Apex account.

5662
02:25:04,150 --> 02:25:04,160

 

5663
02:25:04,160 --> 02:25:05,910

You had some. Yeah, I see that, Steve.

5664
02:25:05,910 --> 02:25:05,920
You had some. Yeah, I see that, Steve.
 

5665
02:25:05,920 --> 02:25:07,990
You had some. Yeah, I see that, Steve.
Well, it was the it was the reflush on

5666
02:25:07,990 --> 02:25:08,000
Well, it was the it was the reflush on
 

5667
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,389
Well, it was the it was the reflush on
silver, wasn't it?

5668
02:25:10,389 --> 02:25:10,399
silver, wasn't it?
 

5669
02:25:10,399 --> 02:25:18,070
silver, wasn't it?
After that giant squeeze out.

5670
02:25:18,070 --> 02:25:18,080

 

5671
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:22,870

There was the flush last night on silver

5672
02:25:22,870 --> 02:25:22,880

 

5673
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:26,230

taking out the squeeze rebid. I don't I

5674
02:25:26,230 --> 02:25:26,240
taking out the squeeze rebid. I don't I
 

5675
02:25:26,240 --> 02:25:27,349
taking out the squeeze rebid. I don't I
really don't think this thing's done

5676
02:25:27,349 --> 02:25:27,359
really don't think this thing's done
 

5677
02:25:27,359 --> 02:25:30,150
really don't think this thing's done
yet. From a macro perspective, it's got

5678
02:25:30,150 --> 02:25:30,160
yet. From a macro perspective, it's got
 

5679
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:32,150
yet. From a macro perspective, it's got
more juice in it. I mean, maybe they

5680
02:25:32,150 --> 02:25:32,160
more juice in it. I mean, maybe they
 

5681
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:34,950
more juice in it. I mean, maybe they
offer a reshort and then accumulate. Um,

5682
02:25:34,950 --> 02:25:34,960
offer a reshort and then accumulate. Um,
 

5683
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:37,270
offer a reshort and then accumulate. Um,
bit like gold did

5684
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:37,280
bit like gold did
 

5685
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:39,510
bit like gold did
uh a while ago when it had its flush

5686
02:25:39,510 --> 02:25:39,520
uh a while ago when it had its flush
 

5687
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:41,030
uh a while ago when it had its flush
moment

5688
02:25:41,030 --> 02:25:41,040
moment
 

5689
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:43,830
moment
down here.

5690
02:25:43,830 --> 02:25:43,840
down here.
 

5691
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:47,190
down here.
Right, there's the flush off the squeeze

5692
02:25:47,190 --> 02:25:47,200
Right, there's the flush off the squeeze
 

5693
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:49,670
Right, there's the flush off the squeeze
reaccumulation. It takes a while and now

5694
02:25:49,670 --> 02:25:49,680
reaccumulation. It takes a while and now
 

5695
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:53,110
reaccumulation. It takes a while and now
we're basing above the old high on gold.

5696
02:25:53,110 --> 02:25:53,120
we're basing above the old high on gold.
 

5697
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:54,550
we're basing above the old high on gold.
They've they've got room in them.

5698
02:25:54,550 --> 02:25:54,560
They've they've got room in them.
 

5699
02:25:54,560 --> 02:26:04,870
They've they've got room in them.
They've got room in them. Honestly,

5700
02:26:04,870 --> 02:26:04,880

 

5701
02:26:04,880 --> 02:26:06,469

they were just trailing from box to box

5702
02:26:06,469 --> 02:26:06,479
they were just trailing from box to box
 

5703
02:26:06,479 --> 02:26:07,830
they were just trailing from box to box
right now. All right, we got enough

5704
02:26:07,830 --> 02:26:07,840
right now. All right, we got enough
 

5705
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:10,070
right now. All right, we got enough

just there's no momentum or follow
 

5947
02:36:56,880 --> 02:36:59,349

5964
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:16,080
there's just been no follow through
 

5965
02:37:16,080 --> 02:37:17,110
there's just been no follow through
through these areas. Once you get

5966
02:37:17,110 --> 02:37:17,120
through these areas. Once you get
 

5967
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:18,150
through these areas. Once you get
through these areas, there's a good

5968
02:37:18,150 --> 02:37:18,160
through these areas, there's a good
 

5969
02:37:18,160 --> 02:37:19,830
through these areas, there's a good
chance for it to try and like lift up to

5970

chance for it to try and like lift up to
 

5971
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:22,230
chance for it to try and like lift up to
50. It's just really struggled to get

5972
02:37:22,230 --> 02:37:22,240
50. It's just really struggled to get
 

5973
02:37:22,240 --> 02:37:27,830
50. It's just really struggled to get
through these areas.

5974

5975
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:29,830

Here it goes. There's 25. So, did you

get acceptance above this all the way up
here? Now, for those of you who are

5980
02:37:32,790 --> 02:37:32,800

here? Now, for those of you who are
still holding your longs is the

5982
02:37:35,349 --> 02:37:35,359
still holding your longs is the
 

5983
02:37:35,359 --> 02:38:03,830
still holding your longs is the
question.

5984
02:38:03,830 --> 02:38:03,840

higher. It's probably going to go

5992
02:38:10,469 --> 02:38:10,479
higher. It's probably going to go
 

5993
02:38:10,479 --> 02:38:13,429
higher. It's probably going to go
without me now into lunch. Probably see

5994
02:38:13,429 --> 02:38:13,439
without me now into lunch. Probably see
 

5995

wouldn't say it's dead. Um, and I like
 

6021
02:38:56,960 --> 02:38:59,429
wouldn't say it's dead. Um, and I like
the personality of ENQ. I've learned the

6022
02:38:59,429 --> 02:38:59,439
the personality of ENQ. I've learned the
 

6023
02:38:59,439 --> 02:39:01,270
the personality of ENQ. I've learned the
pal personality of ENQ. I'm very

6024
02:39:01,270 --> 02:39:01,280
pal personality of ENQ. I'm very
 

6025
02:39:01,280 --> 02:39:02,710
pal personality of ENQ. I'm very
comfortable trading it. And half the

6026
02:39:02,710 --> 02:39:02,720
comfortable trading it. And half the
 

6027
02:39:02,720 --> 02:39:05,429
comfortable trading it. And half the
reason I trade futures and not trade

6028
02:39:05,429 --> 02:39:05,439
reason I trade futures and not trade
 

6029
02:39:05,439 --> 02:39:07,349
reason I trade futures and not trade
lots of small caps and large caps is I

6030
02:39:07,349 --> 02:39:07,359
lots of small caps and large caps is I
 

6031
02:39:07,359 --> 02:39:08,710
lots of small caps and large caps is I
don't want to keep having to change my

6032
02:39:08,710 --> 02:39:08,720
don't want to keep having to change my
 

6033
02:39:08,720 --> 02:39:10,309
don't want to keep having to change my
screens and looking around and losing

6034
02:39:10,309 --> 02:39:10,319
screens and looking around and losing
 

6035
02:39:10,319 --> 02:39:12,070
screens and looking around and losing
focus and understanding the different

6036
02:39:12,070 --> 02:39:12,080
focus and understanding the different
 

6037
02:39:12,080 --> 02:39:15,030
focus and understanding the different
lot size and different reward per lot

6038
02:39:15,030 --> 02:39:15,040
lot size and different reward per lot
 

6039
02:39:15,040 --> 02:39:17,510
lot size and different reward per lot
size per tick, etc., etc. So, I feel

6040
02:39:17,510 --> 02:39:17,520
size per tick, etc., etc. So, I feel
 

6041
02:39:17,520 --> 02:39:19,190
size per tick, etc., etc. So, I feel
comfortable here. So, I stay here. It's

6042
02:39:19,190 --> 02:39:19,200
comfortable here. So, I stay here. It's
 

6043
02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:23,030
comfortable here. So, I stay here. It's
what I'm good at. Here

6044
02:39:23,030 --> 02:39:23,040
what I'm good at. Here
 

6045
02:39:23,040 --> 02:39:25,349
what I'm good at. Here
it goes. So there's the 30s. Here's

6046
02:39:25,349 --> 02:39:25,359
it goes. So there's the 30s. Here's
 

6047
02:39:25,359 --> 02:39:27,910
it goes. So there's the 30s. Here's
previous week closed tap into 38. This

6048
02:39:27,910 --> 02:39:27,920
previous week closed tap into 38. This
 

6049
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:29,750
previous week closed tap into 38. This
gray line here. And once you get through

6050
02:39:29,750 --> 02:39:29,760
gray line here. And once you get through
 

6051
02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:31,270
gray line here. And once you get through
that, you got IB high. There's a big

6052
02:39:31,270 --> 02:39:31,280
that, you got IB high. There's a big
 

6053
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:32,790
that, you got IB high. There's a big
node up here, which is where I was

6054
02:39:32,790 --> 02:39:32,800
node up here, which is where I was
 

6055
02:39:32,800 --> 02:39:34,469
node up here, which is where I was
trying to lift through. So we were

6056
02:39:34,469 --> 02:39:34,479
trying to lift through. So we were
 

6057
02:39:34,479 --> 02:39:37,590
trying to lift through. So we were
trying to trade from here to there. Uh I

6058
02:39:37,590 --> 02:39:37,600
trying to trade from here to there. Uh I
 

6059
02:39:37,600 --> 02:39:39,510
trying to trade from here to there. Uh I
failed you doing that. We got this and

6060
02:39:39,510 --> 02:39:39,520
failed you doing that. We got this and
 

6061
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:42,230
failed you doing that. We got this and
this and we went sideways so long I'd

6062
02:39:42,230 --> 02:39:42,240
this and we went sideways so long I'd
 

6063
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:44,630
this and we went sideways so long I'd
lost interest. But this dip here into

6064
02:39:44,630 --> 02:39:44,640
lost interest. But this dip here into
 

6065
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:46,550
lost interest. But this dip here into
this node held and we reclaimed this

6066
02:39:46,550 --> 02:39:46,560
this node held and we reclaimed this
 

6067
02:39:46,560 --> 02:39:48,469
this node held and we reclaimed this
node and we should now come up into

6068
02:39:48,469 --> 02:39:48,479
node and we should now come up into
 

6069
02:39:48,479 --> 02:39:49,910
node and we should now come up into
this. And if we get acceptance above

6070
02:39:49,910 --> 02:39:49,920
this. And if we get acceptance above
 

6071
02:39:49,920 --> 02:39:52,309
this. And if we get acceptance above
that, you got previous week high and an

6072
02:39:52,309 --> 02:39:52,319
that, you got previous week high and an
 

6073
02:39:52,319 --> 02:39:55,030
that, you got previous week high and an
old value area way up higher. But if

6074
02:39:55,030 --> 02:39:55,040
old value area way up higher. But if
 

6075
02:39:55,040 --> 02:39:56,550
old value area way up higher. But if
you're still long in this, I would trim

6076
02:39:56,550 --> 02:39:56,560
you're still long in this, I would trim
 

6077
02:39:56,560 --> 02:39:58,309
you're still long in this, I would trim
a little bit into 50s if you can get

6078
02:39:58,309 --> 02:39:58,319
a little bit into 50s if you can get
 

6079
02:39:58,319 --> 02:39:59,750
a little bit into 50s if you can get
there and then see if you can get

6080
02:39:59,750 --> 02:39:59,760
there and then see if you can get
 

6081
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:02,950
there and then see if you can get
acceptance above.

6082
02:40:02,950 --> 02:40:02,960
acceptance above.
 

6083
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:05,830
acceptance above.
If you're very very very very lucky

6084
02:40:05,830 --> 02:40:05,840
If you're very very very very lucky
 

6085
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:08,710
If you're very very very very lucky
today, you'll get 26,044s

6086
02:40:08,710 --> 02:40:08,720
today, you'll get 26,044s
 

6087
02:40:08,720 --> 02:40:25,190
today, you'll get 26,044s
up here.

6088
02:40:25,190 --> 02:40:25,200

 

6089
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:27,030

There's a probability that if it makes a

6090
02:40:27,030 --> 02:40:27,040
There's a probability that if it makes a
 

6091
02:40:27,040 --> 02:40:30,070
There's a probability that if it makes a
new high of day, the probability is 67%

6092
02:40:30,070 --> 02:40:30,080
new high of day, the probability is 67%
 

6093
02:40:30,080 --> 02:40:32,070
new high of day, the probability is 67%
that it will search for low of day on

6094
02:40:32,070 --> 02:40:32,080
that it will search for low of day on
 

6095
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:34,550
that it will search for low of day on
the same day. I very very very much

6096
02:40:34,550 --> 02:40:34,560
the same day. I very very very much
 

6097
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:37,590
the same day. I very very very much
would doubt that today. Um unless you

6098
02:40:37,590 --> 02:40:37,600
would doubt that today. Um unless you
 

6099
02:40:37,600 --> 02:40:39,110
would doubt that today. Um unless you
make mean low of day in the New York

6100
02:40:39,110 --> 02:40:39,120
make mean low of day in the New York
 

6101
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:41,429
make mean low of day in the New York
session. I

6102
02:40:41,429 --> 02:40:41,439
session. I
 

6103
02:40:41,439 --> 02:40:44,550
session. I
absolutely have

6104
02:40:44,550 --> 02:40:44,560
absolutely have
 

6105
02:40:44,560 --> 02:40:46,389
absolutely have
I can almost guarantee you it's not

6106
02:40:46,389 --> 02:40:46,399
I can almost guarantee you it's not
 

6107
02:40:46,399 --> 02:40:49,030
I can almost guarantee you it's not
coming back down to here. It's just not

6108
02:40:49,030 --> 02:40:49,040
coming back down to here. It's just not
 

6109
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:51,990
coming back down to here. It's just not
happening. So I don't know why they said

6110
02:40:51,990 --> 02:40:52,000
happening. So I don't know why they said
 

6111
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:53,590
happening. So I don't know why they said
that. Maybe you mean of the New York

6112
02:40:53,590 --> 02:40:53,600
that. Maybe you mean of the New York
 

6113
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:56,150
that. Maybe you mean of the New York
session. If you make a new high of day,

6114
02:40:56,150 --> 02:40:56,160
session. If you make a new high of day,
 

6115
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:58,630
session. If you make a new high of day,
comes back down to a low of day of New

6116
02:40:58,630 --> 02:40:58,640
comes back down to a low of day of New
 

6117
02:40:58,640 --> 02:41:01,030
comes back down to a low of day of New
York session. Even that I find hard to

6118
02:41:01,030 --> 02:41:01,040
York session. Even that I find hard to
 

6119
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:03,030
York session. Even that I find hard to
believe. We've had no acceptance outside

6120
02:41:03,030 --> 02:41:03,040
believe. We've had no acceptance outside
 

6121
02:41:03,040 --> 02:41:05,190
believe. We've had no acceptance outside
of initial balance high. I find it

6122
02:41:05,190 --> 02:41:05,200
of initial balance high. I find it
 

6123
02:41:05,200 --> 02:41:07,030
of initial balance high. I find it
highly improbable that we come down to

6124
02:41:07,030 --> 02:41:07,040
highly improbable that we come down to
 

6125
02:41:07,040 --> 02:41:09,190
highly improbable that we come down to
here again. Maybe we do a false break

6126
02:41:09,190 --> 02:41:09,200
here again. Maybe we do a false break
 

6127
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:11,110
here again. Maybe we do a false break
and we trade inside of range, but I'd

6128
02:41:11,110 --> 02:41:11,120
and we trade inside of range, but I'd
 

6129
02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:12,950
and we trade inside of range, but I'd
find it very unlikely that we trade down

6130
02:41:12,950 --> 02:41:12,960
find it very unlikely that we trade down
 

6131
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:15,190
find it very unlikely that we trade down
to here. And I'd find it I'd say almost

6132
02:41:15,190 --> 02:41:15,200
to here. And I'd find it I'd say almost
 

6133
02:41:15,200 --> 02:41:16,710
to here. And I'd find it I'd say almost
99.9%

6134
02:41:16,710 --> 02:41:16,720
99.9%
 

6135
02:41:16,720 --> 02:41:18,710
99.9%
chance we will not come down to here

6136
02:41:18,710 --> 02:41:18,720
chance we will not come down to here
 

6137
02:41:18,720 --> 02:41:20,550
chance we will not come down to here
today and close this gap. Why would it

6138
02:41:20,550 --> 02:41:20,560
today and close this gap. Why would it
 

6139
02:41:20,560 --> 02:41:22,870
today and close this gap. Why would it
why would it suddenly want to do a 400

6140
02:41:22,870 --> 02:41:22,880
why would it suddenly want to do a 400
 

6141
02:41:22,880 --> 02:41:24,790
why would it suddenly want to do a 400

6144
02:41:27,510 --> 02:41:27,520
out? I just But maybe maybe they're
 

6145
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:33,670

referring to something different.

6146
02:41:33,670 --> 02:41:33,680

 

6147
02:41:33,680 --> 02:41:40,389

Maybe they mean the New York session.

6148
02:41:40,389 --> 02:41:40,399

 

6149
02:41:40,399 --> 02:41:42,389

New York sess New York session makes
 

6153
02:41:44,080 --> 02:41:46,550
New York sess New York session makes
sense to me. That that that's possible

6154
02:41:46,550 --> 02:41:46,560
sense to me. That that that's possible
 

6155
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:47,830
sense to me. That that that's possible
because we're not talking we're talking

6156
02:41:47,830 --> 02:41:47,840
because we're not talking we're talking
 

6157
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:49,670
because we're not talking we're talking
only about 100 points, right? That makes

6158
02:41:49,670 --> 02:41:49,680
only about 100 points, right? That makes
 

6159
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:52,070
only about 100 points, right? That makes
sense to me. That makes sense to me.

6160
02:41:52,070 --> 02:41:52,080
sense to me. That makes sense to me.
 

6161
02:41:52,080 --> 02:41:56,389

That's possible.

6162
02:41:56,389 --> 02:41:56,399

 

6163
02:41:56,399 --> 02:41:58,790

That's possible.

6164
02:41:58,790 --> 02:41:58,800
That's possible.
 

6165
02:41:58,800 --> 02:42:00,790
That's possible.
All right, seven minutes left, folks. I

6166
02:42:00,790 --> 02:42:00,800
All right, seven minutes left, folks. I
 

6167
02:42:00,800 --> 02:42:02,790
All right, seven minutes left, folks. I
can't see this going anywhere. I might

6168
02:42:02,790 --> 02:42:02,800
can't see this going anywhere. I might
 

6169
02:42:02,800 --> 02:42:04,469
can't see this going anywhere. I might
get off early here unless you guys have

6170
02:42:04,469 --> 02:42:04,479
get off early here unless you guys have
 

6171
02:42:04,479 --> 02:42:07,270
get off early here unless you guys have
got any more questions for me. There's

6172
02:42:07,270 --> 02:42:07,280
got any more questions for me. There's
 

6173
02:42:07,280 --> 02:42:09,030
got any more questions for me. There's

6180
02:42:16,630 --> 02:42:16,640

 

6181
02:42:16,640 --> 02:42:19,349

We're drifting higher. Um we've had

6182
02:42:19,349 --> 02:42:19,359
We're drifting higher. Um we've had

we've had the trades today out of the
 

6185
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:22,230
we've had the trades today out of the
locations. Remember these are the

6186
02:42:22,230 --> 02:42:22,240
locations. Remember these are the
 

6187
02:42:22,240 --> 02:42:24,389
locations. Remember these are the
locations we had on before the market

6188
02:42:24,389 --> 02:42:24,399
locations we had on before the market
 

6189
02:42:24,399 --> 02:42:27,349
locations we had on before the market
opened. We were looking for what was it?

6190
02:42:27,349 --> 02:42:27,359
opened. We were looking for what was it?
 

6191
02:42:27,359 --> 02:42:29,830
opened. We were looking for what was it?
70 to 30 was the first level and then

6192
02:42:29,830 --> 02:42:29,840
70 to 30 was the first level and then
 

6193
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:31,349
70 to 30 was the first level and then
down here if not. All right. So, we

6194
02:42:31,349 --> 02:42:31,359
down here if not. All right. So, we
 

6195
02:42:31,359 --> 02:42:33,190
down here if not. All right. So, we
would we would dip long here. We would

6196
02:42:33,190 --> 02:42:33,200
would we would dip long here. We would
 

6197
02:42:33,200 --> 02:42:35,590
would we would dip long here. We would
dip long here. And then we were waiting

6198
02:42:35,590 --> 02:42:35,600
dip long here. And then we were waiting
 

6199
02:42:35,600 --> 02:42:37,830
dip long here. And then we were waiting
for the trap and long here. Those are

6200
02:42:37,830 --> 02:42:37,840
for the trap and long here. Those are
 

6201
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:39,270
for the trap and long here. Those are
the three plays. They were planned out

6202
02:42:39,270 --> 02:42:39,280
the three plays. They were planned out
 

6203
02:42:39,280 --> 02:42:42,630
the three plays. They were planned out
pre-market. You can go back 9:15 to 9:30
