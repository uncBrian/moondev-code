8
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
shorter stream today. I've got stuff I
 

9
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,990
shorter stream today. I've got stuff I
need to deal with personally off the

00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
need to deal with personally off the
 

11
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,029
need to deal with personally off the
chart. So, we'll be here until

00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
chart. So, we'll be here until
 

13
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,070
chart. So, we'll be here until
um about uh 11:00. All right,

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,749
um about uh 11:00. All right,
let's go over it all. [sighs and gasps]

16
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
let's go over it all. [sighs and gasps]
 

17
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,670
let's go over it all. [sighs and gasps]
What are we looking at? Daily chart, no

18
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
What are we looking at? Daily chart, no
 

19

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,110
much opening inside the current weekly
range and the previous weekly range,

00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
range and the previous weekly range,
 

25
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,110

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120
right? So, we can see yesterday, even
 

27
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,629
right? So, we can see yesterday, even
though

00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
though
 

29
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,710
though
many of you may disagree. Yesterday, we

30
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
many of you may disagree. Yesterday, we
 

31
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,469
many of you may disagree. Yesterday, we
had another inside bar. So, here's

32
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
had another inside bar. So, here's
 

33
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,749
had another inside bar. So, here's
Friday, Monday inside of Friday, Tuesday

34
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759
Friday, Monday inside of Friday, Tuesday
 

35
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,749
Friday, Monday inside of Friday, Tuesday
inside of Monday. Currently we have

36
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
inside of Monday. Currently we have
 

37
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,749
inside of Monday. Currently we have
Wednesday and so Tuesday. This is

38
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
Wednesday and so Tuesday. This is
 

39
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,390
Wednesday and so Tuesday. This is
compression. This is not trend. It is

40
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,400
compression. This is not trend. It is
 

41
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,309
compression. This is not trend. It is
nothing else other than compression. Uh

42
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
nothing else other than compression. Uh
 

43
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,990
nothing else other than compression. Uh
the market will make a decision soon

44
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
the market will make a decision soon
 

45
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,749
the market will make a decision soon
enough when it's ready probably after

46
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
enough when it's ready probably after
 

47
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,390
enough when it's ready probably after
FORMC on what it wants to do. Okay? But

48
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
FORMC on what it wants to do. Okay? But
 

49
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,230
FORMC on what it wants to do. Okay? But
right now we are trapped. Here's the

50
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
right now we are trapped. Here's the
 

51
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,309
right now we are trapped. Here's the
edge. That's what we're trapped in. This

52
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
edge. That's what we're trapped in. This
 

53
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,029
edge. That's what we're trapped in. This
is rotation. It is not trend. If you buy

54
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
is rotation. It is not trend. If you buy
 

55
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,630
is rotation. It is not trend. If you buy
the top of this, you will get hurt. If

56
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
the top of this, you will get hurt. If
 

57
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,070
the top of this, you will get hurt. If
you short the bottom of this, you will

58
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
you short the bottom of this, you will
 

59
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,990
you short the bottom of this, you will
get hurt. Unless you get very lucky and

60
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
get hurt. Unless you get very lucky and
 

61
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,750
get hurt. Unless you get very lucky and
you end up timing the breakout or the

62
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
you end up timing the breakout or the
 

63
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,829
you end up timing the breakout or the
breakdown, you will get hurt. So, the

64
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
breakdown, you will get hurt. So, the
 

65
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,829
breakdown, you will get hurt. So, the
best thing to do is follow the rules of

66
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
best thing to do is follow the rules of
 

67
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,829
best thing to do is follow the rules of
rotation. You want to play the edges and

68
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
rotation. You want to play the edges and
 

69
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,190
rotation. You want to play the edges and
nothing else. All right, you can see

70
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
nothing else. All right, you can see
 

71
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,750
nothing else. All right, you can see
we've been developing quite a big node

72
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
we've been developing quite a big node
 

73
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,509
we've been developing quite a big node
here, which is starting to stick out

74
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519
here, which is starting to stick out
 

75
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,350
here, which is starting to stick out
like a bit of a sore thumb here. Sort of

76
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
like a bit of a sore thumb here. Sort of
 

77
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,470
like a bit of a sore thumb here. Sort of
650 to 600 worth paying attention to.

78
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,480
650 to 600 worth paying attention to.
 

79
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,269
650 to 600 worth paying attention to.
Um, once we start to break below the

80
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
Um, once we start to break below the
 

81
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,550
Um, once we start to break below the
fives, and we're going to go over this

82
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
fives, and we're going to go over this
 

83
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,110
fives, and we're going to go over this
in the hourly, there is room for us to

84
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
in the hourly, there is room for us to
 

85
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,350
in the hourly, there is room for us to
come and repric some of this, right? And

86
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
come and repric some of this, right? And
 

87
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,509
come and repric some of this, right? And
we have some support down here. And we

88
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
we have some support down here. And we
 

89
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,430
we have some support down here. And we
also have the 50-day and 20-day. the

90
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
also have the 50-day and 20-day. the
 

91
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,110
also have the 50-day and 20-day. the
mean reversion to there would be the

92
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
mean reversion to there would be the
 

93
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,350
mean reversion to there would be the
healthiest thing for this market. It may

94
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
healthiest thing for this market. It may
 

95
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,269
healthiest thing for this market. It may
very be that it doesn't want to do it.

96
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
very be that it doesn't want to do it.
 

97
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,030
very be that it doesn't want to do it.
But in terms of bullish progress, you

98
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
But in terms of bullish progress, you
 

99
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,870
But in terms of bullish progress, you
know, if we actually did this and set a

100
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
know, if we actually did this and set a
 

101
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,910
know, if we actually did this and set a
firm higher low here on a daily and then

102
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
firm higher low here on a daily and then
 

103
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,509
firm higher low here on a daily and then
reclaimed this, then guess what? That

104
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
reclaimed this, then guess what? That
 

105
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,230
reclaimed this, then guess what? That
move there becomes much much easier than

106
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240
move there becomes much much easier than
 

107
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,750
move there becomes much much easier than
trying to just have a pause for a moment

108
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
trying to just have a pause for a moment
 

109
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,670
trying to just have a pause for a moment
and continue that. That's a much harder

110
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
and continue that. That's a much harder
 

111
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,350
and continue that. That's a much harder
move for the market to do, which is why

112
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360
move for the market to do, which is why
 

113
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,190
move for the market to do, which is why
it's struggling. We have exhaustion and

114
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
it's struggling. We have exhaustion and
 

115
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,550
it's struggling. We have exhaustion and
we still have the buyers trapped up

116
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
we still have the buyers trapped up
 

117
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,590
we still have the buyers trapped up
here. But we're going to have a look at

118
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
here. But we're going to have a look at
 

119
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,190
here. But we're going to have a look at
these levels.

120
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,200
these levels.
 

121
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,070
these levels.
uh on the hourly now to make it all make

122
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
uh on the hourly now to make it all make
 

123
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,030
uh on the hourly now to make it all make
sense. Let's go over to this.

124
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040

 

125
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,910

Uh let's make sure you can see this down

126
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
Uh let's make sure you can see this down
 

127
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,949
Uh let's make sure you can see this down
a bit. Okay. Hourly here.

128
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
a bit. Okay. Hourly here.
 

129
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,190
a bit. Okay. Hourly here.
This is your previous week's balance.

130
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
This is your previous week's balance.
 

131
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,750
This is your previous week's balance.
All right. Previous week's balance. Nice

132
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
All right. Previous week's balance. Nice
 

133
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,630
All right. Previous week's balance. Nice
clear L shape. All right.

134
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
clear L shape. All right.
 

135
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,870
clear L shape. All right.
Clean distribution. All right. Just in

136
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
Clean distribution. All right. Just in
 

137
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,750
Clean distribution. All right. Just in
rotation. You can see Friday we failed

138
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760
rotation. You can see Friday we failed
 

139
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,829
rotation. You can see Friday we failed
to get outside of balance. Monday we

140
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
to get outside of balance. Monday we
 

141
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,430
to get outside of balance. Monday we
failed to get outside of balance. So

142
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
failed to get outside of balance. So
 

143
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,190
failed to get outside of balance. So
what are we doing? Right? If we can't

144
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200
what are we doing? Right? If we can't
 

145
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,310
what are we doing? Right? If we can't
get out of balance, we're going to

146
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
get out of balance, we're going to
 

147
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,670
get out of balance, we're going to
search for balance. Right? If we can't

148
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680
search for balance. Right? If we can't
 

149
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,710
search for balance. Right? If we can't
get out of balance, we're going to

150
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
get out of balance, we're going to
 

151
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,710
get out of balance, we're going to
search for fair value. What is the

152
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
search for fair value. What is the
 

153
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,630
search for fair value. What is the
biggest fair value from the week before?

154
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
biggest fair value from the week before?
 

155
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,630
biggest fair value from the week before?
Point of control. Right? That's your

156
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
Point of control. Right? That's your
 

157
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,990
Point of control. Right? That's your
fair value from the week before. We

158
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
fair value from the week before. We
 

159
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,310
fair value from the week before. We
cannot get a close underneath previous

160
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320
cannot get a close underneath previous
 

161
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,069
cannot get a close underneath previous
week's point of control. So what are we

162
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
week's point of control. So what are we
 

163
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,269
week's point of control. So what are we
going to do? We're going to create more

164
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
going to do? We're going to create more
 

165
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,550
going to do? We're going to create more
rotation. All right. Where's the

166
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
rotation. All right. Where's the
 

167
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,949
rotation. All right. Where's the
rotation inside previous week's balance?

168
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:32,959
rotation inside previous week's balance?
 

169
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,269
rotation inside previous week's balance?
We are creating current weak rotation.

170
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:35,279
We are creating current weak rotation.
 

171
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,949
We are creating current weak rotation.
That is all there is to say on this. You

172
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
That is all there is to say on this. You
 

173
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,350
That is all there is to say on this. You
you don't need to make it any harder.

174
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
you don't need to make it any harder.
 

175
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,949
you don't need to make it any harder.
Right? These these are the conditions

176
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
Right? These these are the conditions
 

177
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,750
Right? These these are the conditions
we've got. This is your support system.

178
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
we've got. This is your support system.
 

179
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,550
we've got. This is your support system.
This is fair value right now uh from the

180
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
This is fair value right now uh from the
 

181
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,949
This is fair value right now uh from the
previous week. We cannot get above fair

182
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
previous week. We cannot get above fair
 

183
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,470
previous week. We cannot get above fair
value of the current week. You can see

184
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,480
value of the current week. You can see
 

185
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,949
value of the current week. You can see
every time we're driving up to current,

186
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
every time we're driving up to current,
 

187
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,030
every time we're driving up to current,
this is developing. This is a developing

188
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
this is developing. This is a developing
 

189
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,350
this is developing. This is a developing
profile. Current week's value area high.

190
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,360
profile. Current week's value area high.
 

191
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,949
profile. Current week's value area high.
Current week's point of control. We

192
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
Current week's point of control. We
 

193
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,790
Current week's point of control. We
can't get through it. every time we come

194
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
can't get through it. every time we come
 

195
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,150
can't get through it. every time we come
down to previous week's point of

196
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
down to previous week's point of
 

197
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,750
down to previous week's point of
control. All right, it was naked on

198
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
control. All right, it was naked on
 

199
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,110
control. All right, it was naked on
Monday. It's not naked anymore. We've

200
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
Monday. It's not naked anymore. We've
 

201
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,190
Monday. It's not naked anymore. We've
revisited a few times. Every time we get

202
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
revisited a few times. Every time we get
 

203
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,110
revisited a few times. Every time we get
down to there, we're not seeing the move

204
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
down to there, we're not seeing the move
 

205
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,030
down to there, we're not seeing the move
back down to previous week's value area

206
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
back down to previous week's value area
 

207
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,630
back down to previous week's value area
low. So, what are the range rotations?

208
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
low. So, what are the range rotations?
 

209
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,030
low. So, what are the range rotations?
Well, it's just within this. All we have

210
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
Well, it's just within this. All we have
 

211
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,750
Well, it's just within this. All we have
right now is fading this back down to

212
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
right now is fading this back down to
 

213
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,470
right now is fading this back down to
here, buying this back up to here. Once

214
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
here, buying this back up to here. Once
 

215
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,069
here, buying this back up to here. Once
that breaks, if we get a breakout of

216
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:22,079
that breaks, if we get a breakout of
 

217
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,509
that breaks, if we get a breakout of
previous week point of control and we

218
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:23,519
previous week point of control and we
 

219
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,509
previous week point of control and we
stay heavy, then we can think about that

220
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
stay heavy, then we can think about that
 

221
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,750
stay heavy, then we can think about that
move to previous week value area high.

222
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:27,760
move to previous week value area high.
 

223
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,470
move to previous week value area high.
If we get a breakout of current value

224
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
If we get a breakout of current value
 

225
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,550
If we get a breakout of current value
area high and previous week value area

226
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,560
area high and previous week value area
 

227
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,110
area high and previous week value area
high maybe you can think about the longs

228
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,120
high maybe you can think about the longs
 

229
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,630
high maybe you can think about the longs
but then you have to be aware of what

230
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,640
but then you have to be aware of what
 

231
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,389
but then you have to be aware of what
you're coming into right you're coming

232
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
you're coming into right you're coming
 

233
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,150
you're coming into right you're coming
into this level here uh sort of 8 885900

234
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
into this level here uh sort of 8 885900
 

235
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,870
into this level here uh sort of 8 885900
massive level massive massive massive

236
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
massive level massive massive massive
 

237
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,550
massive level massive massive massive
level so that's where we're at and

238
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:46,560
level so that's where we're at and
 

239
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,910
level so that's where we're at and
that's what you need to be aware of this

240
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
that's what you need to be aware of this
 

241
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,150
that's what you need to be aware of this
is why yesterday I was very adamant and

242
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
is why yesterday I was very adamant and
 

243
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,110
is why yesterday I was very adamant and
animated you cannot be long up here it

244
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
animated you cannot be long up here it
 

245
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,190
animated you cannot be long up here it
is not a trend I don't care what you

246
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
is not a trend I don't care what you
 

247
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,670
is not a trend I don't care what you
think this is telling you All you have

248
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
think this is telling you All you have
 

249
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,310
think this is telling you All you have
to do is follow right what is in front

250
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
to do is follow right what is in front
 

251
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,269
to do is follow right what is in front
of you range and new range. Do not get

252
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:03,279
of you range and new range. Do not get
 

253
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,310
of you range and new range. Do not get
caught. This morning is likely to be low

254
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
caught. This morning is likely to be low
 

255
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,790
caught. This morning is likely to be low
volatility. It's likely to set traps for

256
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:08,800
volatility. It's likely to set traps for
 

257
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,030
volatility. It's likely to set traps for
later. It doesn't have to. There have

258
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
later. It doesn't have to. There have
 

259
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,629
later. It doesn't have to. There have
been times on the past where the morning

260
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
been times on the past where the morning
 

261
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,470
been times on the past where the morning
before FOMC has been absolutely

262
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
before FOMC has been absolutely
 

263
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,269
before FOMC has been absolutely
beautiful to trade. The range on FOMC

264
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:17,279
beautiful to trade. The range on FOMC
 

265
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,790
beautiful to trade. The range on FOMC
has been getting smaller and smaller and

266
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:18,800
has been getting smaller and smaller and
 

267
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,790
has been getting smaller and smaller and
smaller because we're not actually as

268
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
smaller because we're not actually as
 

269
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,389
smaller because we're not actually as
interested in the rate cuts. You can see

270
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
interested in the rate cuts. You can see
 

271
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,110
interested in the rate cuts. You can see
we know it's going to be a 0.25 cut,

272
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
we know it's going to be a 0.25 cut,
 

273
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,910
we know it's going to be a 0.25 cut,
right? There's a 95% chance that it's

274
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
right? There's a 95% chance that it's
 

275
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,990
right? There's a 95% chance that it's
0.25. What does that mean? Well, it's

276
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
0.25. What does that mean? Well, it's
 

277
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,910
0.25. What does that mean? Well, it's
probably already in the price. Then it's

278
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
probably already in the price. Then it's
 

279
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,590
probably already in the price. Then it's
already baked in. So maybe we get an

280
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
already baked in. So maybe we get an
 

281
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,389
already baked in. So maybe we get an
algo move off it as in a news algo move.

282
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:36,399
algo move off it as in a news algo move.
 

283
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,750
algo move off it as in a news algo move.
What everyone's going to be interested

284
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
What everyone's going to be interested
 

285
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,990
What everyone's going to be interested
in is what Pal says afterwards. All

286
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,000
in is what Pal says afterwards. All
 

287
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,310
in is what Pal says afterwards. All
right. It's all because last time it was

288
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
right. It's all because last time it was
 

289
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,230
right. It's all because last time it was
a 50/50 split and whe whether we did

290
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
a 50/50 split and whe whether we did
 

291
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,230
a 50/50 split and whe whether we did
more cuts in the future. People will be

292
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,240
more cuts in the future. People will be
 

293
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,670
more cuts in the future. People will be
listening to are we going to do more

294
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
listening to are we going to do more
 

295
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,829
listening to are we going to do more
cuts in the future? Do they even care

296
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:49,839
cuts in the future? Do they even care
 

297
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,990
cuts in the future? Do they even care
about inflationary pressure? My guess

298
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
about inflationary pressure? My guess
 

299
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,430
about inflationary pressure? My guess
would be no. what they're going to care

300
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
would be no. what they're going to care
 

301
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,790
would be no. what they're going to care
about is the jobs market because the

302
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
about is the jobs market because the
 

303
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,069
about is the jobs market because the
jobs market is in a bad bad way. All

304
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,079
jobs market is in a bad bad way. All
 

305
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,750
jobs market is in a bad bad way. All
right? Worse and worse and worse and

306
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
right? Worse and worse and worse and
 

307
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,509
right? Worse and worse and worse and
worse and worse. People are not actually

308
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:01,519
worse and worse. People are not actually
 

309
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,269
worse and worse. People are not actually
quitting their jobs now because they're

310
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
quitting their jobs now because they're
 

311
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,030
quitting their jobs now because they're
scared. They're staying in their jobs,

312
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
scared. They're staying in their jobs,
 

313
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,670
scared. They're staying in their jobs,
but jobs are scarce. That is what I

314
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
but jobs are scarce. That is what I
 

315
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,870
but jobs are scarce. That is what I
think he's going to talk about is the

316
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
think he's going to talk about is the
 

317
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,629
think he's going to talk about is the
labor market. And that's what will shake

318
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:10,639
labor market. And that's what will shake
 

319
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,350
labor market. And that's what will shake
the market. I would imagine people will

320
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,360
the market. I would imagine people will
 

321
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,910
the market. I would imagine people will
ask him some questions about liquidity,

322
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
ask him some questions about liquidity,
 

323
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,430
ask him some questions about liquidity,
the JPY carry trade and our current uh

treasuries and bonds and the fact that

326
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,360

327
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,110
treasuries and bonds and the fact that
the 10 and 20 and 30 year look like they

328
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
the 10 and 20 and 30 year look like they
 

329
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,710
the 10 and 20 and 30 year look like they
might break out. That is what the tone

330
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
might break out. That is what the tone
 

331
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,389
might break out. That is what the tone
is going to be. I would imagine when we

332
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
is going to be. I would imagine when we
 

333
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,230
is going to be. I would imagine when we
get to the Q&As's that is what the news

334
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
get to the Q&As's that is what the news
 

335
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,110
get to the Q&As's that is what the news
algos are going to move off. If you like

336
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,120
algos are going to move off. If you like
 

337
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,350
algos are going to move off. If you like
being risky, by all means trade it. For

338
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:33,360
being risky, by all means trade it. For
 

339
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,509
being risky, by all means trade it. For
me, I like putting size on tomorrow

340
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:35,519
me, I like putting size on tomorrow
 

341
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,750
me, I like putting size on tomorrow
because I think we get, you know, a move

342
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:37,760
because I think we get, you know, a move
 

343
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,829
because I think we get, you know, a move
on liquidity today. Maybe we wash both

344
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
on liquidity today. Maybe we wash both
 

345
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,910
on liquidity today. Maybe we wash both
sides today. All right. It wouldn't

346
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:41,920
sides today. All right. It wouldn't
 

347
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,550
sides today. All right. It wouldn't
surprise me at all to see either

348
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
surprise me at all to see either
 

349
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,590
surprise me at all to see either

All right. The big move for me is going

354
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,240
All right. The big move for me is going
 

355
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,150
All right. The big move for me is going
to come once we get out of here. Once we

356
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,160
to come once we get out of here. Once we
 

357
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,150
to come once we get out of here. Once we
can get if if we're going to get out of

00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
can get if if we're going to get out of
 

359
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,750
can get if if we're going to get out of
here to the downside, once we get

360
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:57,760
here to the downside, once we get
 

361
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,509
here to the downside, once we get
outside of previous week value area

362
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519
outside of previous week value area
 

363
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,069
outside of previous week value area

which lines up perfectly down here. This
 

367
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,150
which lines up perfectly down here. This
for me is the buying opportunity. That's

368
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,160
for me is the buying opportunity. That's
 

369
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,230

Right. If we come down here, do a double
 

373

I'll be looking for that probably next
 

377
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,189
I'll be looking for that probably next
week. If if if today is a sell the news

and they use it tomorrow as liquidity
 

383
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,629
and they use it tomorrow as liquidity
for a sell news event, this is where I'm

384
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:24,639
for a sell news event, this is where I'm
 

385
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,710
for a sell news event, this is where I'm
interested in really getting potential

386
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
interested in really getting potential

388
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
buys from. Right? So that's what I'm
 

389
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,790
buys from. Right? So that's what I'm
watching. Uh we can look at what

390
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
watching. Uh we can look at what
 

391
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,550
watching. Uh we can look at what
happened overnight. Not a lot is the

happened overnight. Not a lot is the
 

393
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,030
happened overnight. Not a lot is the
answer. All right. So yesterday, believe

00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,040
answer. All right. So yesterday, believe
 

395
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,350
answer. All right. So yesterday, believe
it or not, even though [clears throat]

here, it was not a trend day. It was a

400
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:40,880
here, it was not a trend day. It was a
 

401
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,710
here, it was not a trend day. It was a
rotation back inside. All right, it took

402
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:42,720
rotation back inside. All right, it took
 

403
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,430
rotation back inside. All right, it took
a long time to do that. Why? I'm going

404
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
a long time to do that. Why? I'm going
 

405
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,430
a long time to do that. Why? I'm going
to go over the spiders shortly, but we

406
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:47,440
to go over the spiders shortly, but we
 

407
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,509
to go over the spiders shortly, but we
had recessionary

408

00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:09,600
still finding a bid on Oracle, which has
 

429

Fails. Surprise, surprise. Because we're

436
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
Fails. Surprise, surprise. Because we're
 

437
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,829
Fails. Surprise, surprise. Because we're
in range rotation. We fail the high. We

438
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
in range rotation. We fail the high. We
 

439
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,590
in range rotation. We fail the high. We
come back down to the low. We're now at

440
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
come back down to the low. We're now at
 

441
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,350
come back down to the low. We're now at
previous day value area low. There's not

442
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,360
previous day value area low. There's not
 

443
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,030
previous day value area low. There's not
a lot to do here, folks. like the range

444
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,040
a lot to do here, folks. like the range
 

445
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,470
a lot to do here, folks. like the range
is going to get tighter and tighter and

446
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:26,480
is going to get tighter and tighter and
 

447
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,030
is going to get tighter and tighter and
tighter. Current range if we look at

448
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
tighter. Current range if we look at
 

449
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,870
tighter. Current range if we look at
previous day value area high is set

450
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880
previous day value area high is set
 

451
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,949
previous day value area high is set
around 25730s

452
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:32,959
around 25730s
 

453
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,550
around 25730s
and previous day value area low 25 653.

454
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:36,560
and previous day value area low 25 653.
 

455
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,470
and previous day value area low 25 653.
So it's not even 100 points of range for

456
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480
So it's not even 100 points of range for
 

457
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,110
So it's not even 100 points of range for
rotation right now. We can easily set

458
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
rotation right now. We can easily set
 

459
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,750
rotation right now. We can easily set
traps each side of it. So just be aware

460
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:43,760
traps each side of it. So just be aware
 

461
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,269
traps each side of it. So just be aware
of that as you're coming to the charts

462
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
of that as you're coming to the charts
 

463
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,350
of that as you're coming to the charts
today. Understand what the uh

464
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
today. Understand what the uh
 

465
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,749
today. Understand what the uh
environment is right now. Must

466
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
environment is right now. Must
 

467
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,350
environment is right now. Must
understand what that environment is. So

468
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360
understand what that environment is. So
 

469
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,030
understand what that environment is. So
here you can see again overnight all

470
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,040
here you can see again overnight all
 

471
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,269
here you can see again overnight all
we've done

472
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
we've done
 

473
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,949
we've done
failed above

474
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959

 

475
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,350

come down back to value bounce back to

476
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
come down back to value bounce back to
 

477
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,189
come down back to value bounce back to
point control back to value back to

478
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
point control back to value back to
 

479
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,030
point control back to value back to
point of control back to value that's it

480
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
point of control back to value that's it
 

481
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,790
point of control back to value that's it
that's all we're doing boxed in all

482
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
that's all we're doing boxed in all
 

483
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,990
that's all we're doing boxed in all
right so like I said the range is going

484
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
right so like I said the range is going
 

485
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,350
right so like I said the range is going
to get tighter and tighter and tighter

486
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
to get tighter and tighter and tighter
 

487
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,629
to get tighter and tighter and tighter
you don't want to be risk in this

488
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
you don't want to be risk in this
 

489
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,110
you don't want to be risk in this
environment just let it figure itself

490
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120
environment just let it figure itself
 

491
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,030
environment just let it figure itself
out um what I do want to talk about

492
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,040
out um what I do want to talk about
 

493
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,829
out um what I do want to talk about
though is the divergences in this market

494
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
though is the divergences in this market
 

495
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,430
though is the divergences in this market
so let's go to ES move to five Yeah. All

496
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
so let's go to ES move to five Yeah. All
 

497
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,670
so let's go to ES move to five Yeah. All
right. ES yesterday, like I talked

498
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
right. ES yesterday, like I talked
 

499
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,389
right. ES yesterday, like I talked
about, much much heavier,

500
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:28,399
about, much much heavier,
 

501
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,269
about, much much heavier,
right? And exactly the same fails the

502
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:31,279
right? And exactly the same fails the
 

503
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,030
right? And exactly the same fails the
top of its range. Look above and fail.

504
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
top of its range. Look above and fail.
 

505
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,710
top of its range. Look above and fail.
Traps liquidity. And there's the full

506
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
Traps liquidity. And there's the full
 

507
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,069
Traps liquidity. And there's the full
roll. Right. That's what I was hoping

508
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
roll. Right. That's what I was hoping
 

509
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,550
roll. Right. That's what I was hoping
ENQ would do, but we just did it on this

510
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:38,560
ENQ would do, but we just did it on this
 

511
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,389
ENQ would do, but we just did it on this
single market. And that's all from the

512
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
single market. And that's all from the
 

513
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,230
single market. And that's all from the
banking sector. All right. Finance is in

514
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240
banking sector. All right. Finance is in
 

515
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,069
banking sector. All right. Finance is in
trouble. And now we've gone back into

516
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:44,079
trouble. And now we've gone back into
 

517
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,870
trouble. And now we've gone back into
test this level, fail back to the low,

518
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:46,880
test this level, fail back to the low,
 

519
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,030
test this level, fail back to the low,
found a bid, back up here, you can see

520
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,040
found a bid, back up here, you can see
 

521
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,030
found a bid, back up here, you can see
the rotation. All right. So on ES your

522
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,040
the rotation. All right. So on ES your
 

523
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,829
the rotation. All right. So on ES your
big level is 35s. Now what I'd be

524
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:53,839
big level is 35s. Now what I'd be
 

525
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,590
big level is 35s. Now what I'd be
watching is the gamma levels on SPY

526
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600
watching is the gamma levels on SPY
 

527
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,590
watching is the gamma levels on SPY
because they are what keep coming up

528
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600
because they are what keep coming up
 

529
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,990
because they are what keep coming up
over and over and over again. So you can

530
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000
over and over and over again. So you can
 

531
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,230
over and over and over again. So you can
see my price alerts. They're still here.

532
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,240
see my price alerts. They're still here.
 

533
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,429
see my price alerts. They're still here.
85. All right, is your call wall right

534
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
85. All right, is your call wall right
 

535
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,429
85. All right, is your call wall right
now. Um they have got room above it if

536
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:07,439
now. Um they have got room above it if
 

537
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,470
now. Um they have got room above it if
they get through on FOMC. Um 82 was a

538
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
they get through on FOMC. Um 82 was a
 

539
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,949
they get through on FOMC. Um 82 was a
cool wall uh a put wall yesterday, but I

540
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,959
cool wall uh a put wall yesterday, but I
 

541
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,630
cool wall uh a put wall yesterday, but I
would imagine they've probably moved

542
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
would imagine they've probably moved
 

543
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,949
would imagine they've probably moved
some down into 80. I know beneath 80

544
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
some down into 80. I know beneath 80
 

545
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,630
some down into 80. I know beneath 80
we've got about a 10point room right

546
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:18,640
we've got about a 10point room right
 

547
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,829
we've got about a 10point room right
now.

548
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:19,839
now.
 

549
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,750
now.
right beneath 80. If they start letting

550
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:21,760
right beneath 80. If they start letting
 

551
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,429
right beneath 80. If they start letting
go of this, I think the next one was

552
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439
go of this, I think the next one was
 

553
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,069
go of this, I think the next one was
like 75 and even 70. Right the way down

554
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,079
like 75 and even 70. Right the way down
 

555
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,630
like 75 and even 70. Right the way down
here, right, a long, long way. So, this

556
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
here, right, a long, long way. So, this
 

557
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,230
here, right, a long, long way. So, this
is the range. Once we get outside of

558
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,240
is the range. Once we get outside of
 

559
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,830
is the range. Once we get outside of
that range, if there's gamma exposure,

560
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:31,840
that range, if there's gamma exposure,
 

561
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,750
that range, if there's gamma exposure,
it's going to move. Is worth watching

562
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
it's going to move. Is worth watching
 

563
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,549
it's going to move. Is worth watching
the spy. It's trading between 85 and 82.

564
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:36,559
the spy. It's trading between 85 and 82.
 

565
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,150
the spy. It's trading between 85 and 82.
If it lets go of 82, it will trade

566
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
If it lets go of 82, it will trade
 

567
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,390
If it lets go of 82, it will trade
between 82 and 80. If it lets go of

568
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:40,400
between 82 and 80. If it lets go of
 

569
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,669
between 82 and 80. If it lets go of
that, there is a deeper move. I think

570
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679
that, there is a deeper move. I think
 

571
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,430
that, there is a deeper move. I think
there was some exposure at 78 and then

572
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
there was some exposure at 78 and then
 

573
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,350
there was some exposure at 78 and then
there's potential flush on this market.

574
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,360
there's potential flush on this market.
 

575
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,830
there's potential flush on this market.
So, just be aware of what broader

576
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:47,840
So, just be aware of what broader
 

577
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,750
So, just be aware of what broader
markets are doing. Uh we can have a

578
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
markets are doing. Uh we can have a
 

579
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,230
markets are doing. Uh we can have a
quick look at Dixie

580
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,240
quick look at Dixie
 

581
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,909
quick look at Dixie
just trying to find a bid recently is

582
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
just trying to find a bid recently is
 

583
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,270
just trying to find a bid recently is
trying to get back up to this top side

584
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
trying to get back up to this top side
 

585
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,870
trying to get back up to this top side
for this 100 break and VIX is now

586
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:58,880
for this 100 break and VIX is now
 

587
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,710
for this 100 break and VIX is now
trapped between some key levels. So VIX

588
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:00,720
trapped between some key levels. So VIX
 

589
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,190
trapped between some key levels. So VIX
on the daily you can see we have started

590
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
on the daily you can see we have started
 

591
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,990
on the daily you can see we have started
to base out starting to find a bid here

592
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
to base out starting to find a bid here
 

593
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,310
to base out starting to find a bid here
at 15s. All right, but we're coming into

594
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,320
at 15s. All right, but we're coming into
 

595
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,150
at 15s. All right, but we're coming into
a couple of key resistance points. So it

596
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,160
a couple of key resistance points. So it
 

597
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,830
a couple of key resistance points. So it
really depends, you know, is VIX

598
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840
really depends, you know, is VIX
 

599
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,230
really depends, you know, is VIX
actually going to have a push and fail

600
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,240
actually going to have a push and fail
 

601
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,070
actually going to have a push and fail
here. Remember, as we get down into

602
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,080
here. Remember, as we get down into
 

603
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,310
here. Remember, as we get down into
here, this is low vol and that's in this

604
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
here, this is low vol and that's in this
 

605
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,710
here, this is low vol and that's in this
kind of area here is where we expect N E

606
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720
kind of area here is where we expect N E
 

607
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,110
kind of area here is where we expect N E
N E N E N E N E N E N E N E N E N E NQ

608
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,120
N E N E N E N E N E N E N E N E N E NQ
 

609
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,990
N E N E N E N E N E N E N E N E N E NQ
and SPY to do like those slow grind

610
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,000
and SPY to do like those slow grind
 

611
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,190
and SPY to do like those slow grind
steady steady steady grind days. Okay,

612
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,200
steady steady steady grind days. Okay,
 

613
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,029
steady steady steady grind days. Okay,
so down here very bullish for the

614
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039
so down here very bullish for the
 

615
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,950
so down here very bullish for the
market. Up here we're going to increase

616
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:32,960
market. Up here we're going to increase
 

617
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,110
market. Up here we're going to increase
volatility. I would imagine during FOMC

618
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120
volatility. I would imagine during FOMC
 

619
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,710
volatility. I would imagine during FOMC
it will come up here. All right, it

620
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
it will come up here. All right, it
 

621
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,150
it will come up here. All right, it
probably comes up here because we're

622
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,160
probably comes up here because we're
 

623
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,830
probably comes up here because we're
going to get volatility coming into the

624
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:39,840
going to get volatility coming into the
 

625
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,909
going to get volatility coming into the
market.

626
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:41,919
market.
 

627
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,510
market.
Uh let's have a look at the mag. How we

628
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:43,520
Uh let's have a look at the mag. How we
 

629
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,310
Uh let's have a look at the mag. How we
doing for time? 5 minutes. All right.

630
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,320

 

631
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,789

All right. Apple doing actually not too

632
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
All right. Apple doing actually not too
 

633
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,230
All right. Apple doing actually not too
bad. All right. We did start to roll

634
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,240
bad. All right. We did start to roll
 

635
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,230
bad. All right. We did start to roll
over yesterday. Um but like we talked

636
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
over yesterday. Um but like we talked
 

637
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,510
over yesterday. Um but like we talked
about, it's not letting go of the key

638
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:55,520
about, it's not letting go of the key
 

639
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,510
about, it's not letting go of the key
levels. Same thing that we talked about

640
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:57,520
levels. Same thing that we talked about
 

641
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,270
levels. Same thing that we talked about
yesterday. There's your neckline.

642
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,280
yesterday. There's your neckline.
 

643
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,270
yesterday. There's your neckline.
There's your pin. All right. If it can

644
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:01,280
There's your pin. All right. If it can
 

645
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,190
There's your pin. All right. If it can
reclaim 80, it's got a chance to go back

646
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,200
reclaim 80, it's got a chance to go back
 

647
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,789
reclaim 80, it's got a chance to go back
to highs. We can build liquidity on

648
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:04,799
to highs. We can build liquidity on
 

649
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,630
to highs. We can build liquidity on
here. 80 is the chance to go back to

650
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:06,640
here. 80 is the chance to go back to
 

651
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,590
here. 80 is the chance to go back to
highs. 75 failures is that neckline

652
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:09,600
highs. 75 failures is that neckline
 

653
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,430
highs. 75 failures is that neckline
fail. If we did a neckline fail, you'd

654
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,440
fail. If we did a neckline fail, you'd
 

655
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,830
fail. If we did a neckline fail, you'd
be expecting a measured move probably

656
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:13,840
be expecting a measured move probably
 

657
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,990
be expecting a measured move probably
the size of this, right? And we'd be

658
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
the size of this, right? And we'd be
 

659
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,990
the size of this, right? And we'd be
looking for a move back to 65s, which is

660
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
looking for a move back to 65s, which is
 

661
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,669
looking for a move back to 65s, which is
where that liquidity is sat. All right,

662
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:19,679
where that liquidity is sat. All right,
 

663
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,470
where that liquidity is sat. All right,
so all to play for on Apple. It's got to

664
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,480
so all to play for on Apple. It's got to
 

665
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,470
so all to play for on Apple. It's got to
make a decision much like the uh Q's

666
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,480
make a decision much like the uh Q's
 

667
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,190
make a decision much like the uh Q's
right now, just stuck in between.

668
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,200

 

669
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,830

Amazon gap up there.

670
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:31,840
Amazon gap up there.
 

671
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,830
Amazon gap up there.
Uh kind of similar, not quite as weak,

672
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:33,840
Uh kind of similar, not quite as weak,
 

673
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,110
Uh kind of similar, not quite as weak,
but kind of similar. There's your

674
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120
but kind of similar. There's your
 

675
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,029
but kind of similar. There's your
breakout. All right, there's the low.

676
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
breakout. All right, there's the low.
 

677
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,310
breakout. All right, there's the low.
There's the start of the higher low.

678
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,320
There's the start of the higher low.
 

679
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,750
There's the start of the higher low.
That's your pullback. If Amazon wants to

680
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
That's your pullback. If Amazon wants to
 

681
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,190
That's your pullback. If Amazon wants to
hold, then it's got a chance to get

682
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200
hold, then it's got a chance to get
 

683
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,789
hold, then it's got a chance to get
going here. So, it just needs to hold a

684
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:42,799
going here. So, it just needs to hold a
 

685
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,669
going here. So, it just needs to hold a
bid at 26es. You can call it 25s if you

686
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
bid at 26es. You can call it 25s if you
 

687
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,630
bid at 26es. You can call it 25s if you
want. Break out over 38 will be uh you

688
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:48,640
want. Break out over 38 will be uh you
 

689
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,070
want. Break out over 38 will be uh you
can see this clear level on the chart

690
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,080
can see this clear level on the chart
 

691
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,230
can see this clear level on the chart
right here. Right. Over 38, oh, uh we

692
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,240
right here. Right. Over 38, oh, uh we
 

693
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,510
right here. Right. Over 38, oh, uh we
get motoring. So, if you want to set

694
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:55,520
get motoring. So, if you want to set
 

695
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,870
get motoring. So, if you want to set
price alerts, I'll be setting price

696
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:56,880
price alerts, I'll be setting price
 

697
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,870
price alerts, I'll be setting price
alerts. Under 15, it's risk off. Over 38

698
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:00,880
alerts. Under 15, it's risk off. Over 38
 

699
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,950
alerts. Under 15, it's risk off. Over 38
is potential risk on other than fail

700
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:02,960
is potential risk on other than fail
 

701
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,549
is potential risk on other than fail
breakouts. Goo. Uh not a lot happening

702
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:06,559
breakouts. Goo. Uh not a lot happening
 

703
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,230
breakouts. Goo. Uh not a lot happening
there. That's not something I'd be very

704
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,240
there. That's not something I'd be very
 

705
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,789
there. That's not something I'd be very
interested in right now.

706
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:10,799
interested in right now.
 

707
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,029
interested in right now.
Lower highs and lower lows, but uh this

708
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:13,039
Lower highs and lower lows, but uh this
 

709
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,070
Lower highs and lower lows, but uh this
can easily easily easily be absorbed for

can easily easily easily be absorbed for
 

711
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,470
can easily easily easily be absorbed for
this move. Right. So again, just in that

712
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
this move. Right. So again, just in that
 

713
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,549
this move. Right. So again, just in that
range. You can see there's the rotation.

Microsoft gapping down. It's left trap
volume at the highs. I'd be concerned

about that if I was a trader. left trap

about that if I was a trader. left trap
 

755
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,390
about that if I was a trader. left trap

volume at the highs there from the last
 

757
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,909
volume at the highs there from the last
few days. Starting to break away from

00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:07,919
few days. Starting to break away from
 

759
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,669
few days. Starting to break away from
it. That is not a good look. Yes, we're

760
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:09,679
it. That is not a good look. Yes, we're
 

761
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,029
it. That is not a good look. Yes, we're
coming back down to potential support,

00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:11,039
coming back down to potential support,
 

763
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,029
coming back down to potential support,
but you can see every time it gets up

764
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
but you can see every time it gets up
 

765
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,950
but you can see every time it gets up
here, it's failing. It's got to hold

766
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:14,960
here, it's failing. It's got to hold
 

767
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,270
here, it's failing. It's got to hold
this uh 82s now for a chance. I've got a

768
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,280
this uh 82s now for a chance. I've got a
 

769
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,270
this uh 82s now for a chance. I've got a
price alert in case it breaks out, but

770
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,280
price alert in case it breaks out, but
 

771
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,110
price alert in case it breaks out, but
yeah, that doesn't look great. Uh

772
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120
yeah, that doesn't look great. Uh
 

773
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,390
yeah, that doesn't look great. Uh

we got Oracle tonight. That will
 

777
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,990
we got Oracle tonight. That will
probably affect Nvidia. They have their

778
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
probably affect Nvidia. They have their
 

779
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,590
probably affect Nvidia. They have their
chips approved to be sent to China. And

780
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600
chips approved to be sent to China. And
 

781
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,750

00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:29,760
then I read news this morning saying

that um Deepseek have got some of their
 

785
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,070
that um Deepseek have got some of their
uh chips which they shouldn't be allowed

786
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,080
uh chips which they shouldn't be allowed
 

787
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,789
uh chips which they shouldn't be allowed
to have. So, you know, all sorts of sort

788
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:36,799
to have. So, you know, all sorts of sort
 

789
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,390
to have. So, you know, all sorts of sort
of political events going on with this

790
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,400
of political events going on with this
 

791
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,230
of political events going on with this
company. Um we will just have to see. Uh

792
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
company. Um we will just have to see. Uh
 

793
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,789
company. Um we will just have to see. Uh
it's trying to base and curl. It is

794
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:44,799
it's trying to base and curl. It is
 

795
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,470
it's trying to base and curl. It is
trying to base and curl. It's not up to

796
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:46,480
trying to base and curl. It's not up to
 

797
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,710
trying to base and curl. It's not up to
those highs yet. Let's move this out a

798
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:48,720
those highs yet. Let's move this out a
 

799
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,029
those highs yet. Let's move this out a
sec. Uh

800
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:51,039
sec. Uh
 

801
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,950
sec. Uh
let's see where volume is trapped here.

802
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:52,960
let's see where volume is trapped here.
 

803
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,190
let's see where volume is trapped here.
If we just do one of these from here,

804
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
If we just do one of these from here,
 

805
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,149
If we just do one of these from here,
where we at? Yeah, you can see. So, it's

806
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:00,159
where we at? Yeah, you can see. So, it's
 

807
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,149
where we at? Yeah, you can see. So, it's
just in a rotation.

808
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:02,159
just in a rotation.
 

809
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,710
just in a rotation.
All right, there's your rotation.

810
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:04,720
All right, there's your rotation.
 

811
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,630
All right, there's your rotation.
No acceptance above, let's call it 90

812
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
No acceptance above, let's call it 90
 

813
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,190
No acceptance above, let's call it 90
and no acceptance below 74. That's your

814
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,200
and no acceptance below 74. That's your
 

815
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,310
and no acceptance below 74. That's your
rotation. Nothing else. Tesla, uh, looks

816
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,320
rotation. Nothing else. Tesla, uh, looks
 

817
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,310
rotation. Nothing else. Tesla, uh, looks
good. This looks really, really, really

818
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,320
good. This looks really, really, really
 

819
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,830
good. This looks really, really, really
strong, isn't it, for a while now. Um,

820
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
strong, isn't it, for a while now. Um,
 

821
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,230
strong, isn't it, for a while now. Um,
big moves last week and early this week.

822
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240
big moves last week and early this week.
 

823
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,149
big moves last week and early this week.
Still holding on. So as long as Tesla

824
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:22,159
Still holding on. So as long as Tesla
 

825
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,470
Still holding on. So as long as Tesla
holds dips into 440, it can continue

826
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
holds dips into 440, it can continue
 

827
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,430
holds dips into 440, it can continue
higher. Lose 440 and lose previous day

828
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:27,440
higher. Lose 440 and lose previous day
 

829
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,750
higher. Lose 440 and lose previous day
low and uh well the next support system

830
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
low and uh well the next support system
 

831
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,190
low and uh well the next support system
is back here. It's built out good

833
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,029
is back here. It's built out good
liquidity here. 15s to 8 to 380s. Big

834
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:35,039
liquidity here. 15s to 8 to 380s. Big
 

835

liquidity built been built out there. I

836
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
liquidity built been built out there. I
 

837
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,029
liquidity built been built out there. I
don't expect it to drop beneath this

838
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:39,039
don't expect it to drop beneath this
 

839
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,950
don't expect it to drop beneath this

absolutely no reason other than fear

absolutely no reason other than fear
being created uh to me seems a little

878
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,280
being created uh to me seems a little
 

879
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,870
being created uh to me seems a little
ridiculous. 46% down, right? So,

880
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:22,880
ridiculous. 46% down, right? So,
 

881
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,110
ridiculous. 46% down, right? So,
ideally, I just wanted before earnings

882
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,120
ideally, I just wanted before earnings
 

883
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,990
ideally, I just wanted before earnings
to set a higher low in here and look for

884
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
to set a higher low in here and look for
 

885
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,110
to set a higher low in here and look for
that rotation back up for a trade, but

886
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,120
that rotation back up for a trade, but
 

887
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,390
that rotation back up for a trade, but
can't really position myself into

888

can't really position myself into
 

889
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,230
can't really position myself into
earnings, but I wouldn't be short. So, I

890
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:34,240
earnings, but I wouldn't be short. So, I
 

891
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,909
earnings, but I wouldn't be short. So, I
definitely are not new money short. Lots

892
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:35,919
definitely are not new money short. Lots
 

893
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,270
definitely are not new money short. Lots

Probably a whole lot of nothing would be
 

907

I don't expect the market to do a lot

968
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:21,200
I don't expect the market to do a lot
 

969
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,630
I don't expect the market to do a lot
here. It might. Like I said, there have

970
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:22,640
here. It might. Like I said, there have
 

971
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,990
here. It might. Like I said, there have
been days where prefc we've had amazing

00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,000
been days where prefc we've had amazing
 

973
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,390
been days where prefc we've had amazing
trends develop, but uh I find it

974
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:28,400
trends develop, but uh I find it
 

975
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,070
trends develop, but uh I find it
somewhat unlikely that we're going to do

976
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,080
somewhat unlikely that we're going to do
 

977
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,789
somewhat unlikely that we're going to do
that when the market's in such big

978
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:32,799
that when the market's in such big
 

979
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,789
that when the market's in such big
balance. Why let the air out? And if

980
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:34,799
balance. Why let the air out? And if
 

981
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,990
balance. Why let the air out? And if
they do, I'm going to make the

982
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,000
they do, I'm going to make the
 

983
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,350
they do, I'm going to make the
assumption that it's going to be a trap

984
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,360
assumption that it's going to be a trap
 

985
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,390
assumption that it's going to be a trap
for later. All right, let's see.

986
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:40,400

If they lose it previous day value area

1008

If they lose it previous day value area
 

1009
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,230
If they lose it previous day value area
low, that would be an indication that

00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,240
low, that would be an indication that
 

1011
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,669
low, that would be an indication that
we're staying heavy on the day for a

Okay, so we had strong selling coming in

1026
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:35,760
Okay, so we had strong selling coming in
 

1027
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,669
Okay, so we had strong selling coming in
here at 35. If they reclaim this, I

1028
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:37,679
here at 35. If they reclaim this, I
 

1029
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,430
here at 35. If they reclaim this, I
expect we go to previous day value area

1030
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:39,440
expect we go to previous day value area
 

1031
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,510
expect we go to previous day value area
low, which would be 650. Then we have to

1032
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:41,520
low, which would be 650. Then we have to
 

1033
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,390
low, which would be 650. Then we have to
see if sellers defend that. If not, then

1034
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:44,400
see if sellers defend that. If not, then
 

1035
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,909
see if sellers defend that. If not, then
we've come right to the top side. We've

1036
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:45,919
we've come right to the top side. We've
 

1037
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,190
we've come right to the top side. We've
got old VWAP sitting at 71s, 24-hour

1038

Really not expecting much today. So,

1042
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:52,960
Really not expecting much today. So,
 

1043
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,990
Really not expecting much today. So,
unless I see an opportunity which stands

1044
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,000
unless I see an opportunity which stands
 

1045
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,549
unless I see an opportunity which stands
out, I'm going to just sort of let the

00:26:58,549 --> 00:26:58,559
out, I'm going to just sort of let the
 

1047
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,350
out, I'm going to just sort of let the
market do what it needs to do.

1048
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,360
market do what it needs to do.
 

1049
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,710

actually having a go. It's trying to
break out. What's that? Yesterday's

1054
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:06,400
break out. What's that? Yesterday's
 

1055
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,909
break out. What's that? Yesterday's
highs. Pre-market highs. Pre-market

1056
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:07,919
highs. Pre-market highs. Pre-market
 

1057

pre-market highs. Not successful yet,

1060
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:10,559
pre-market highs. Not successful yet,
 

1061
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,870
pre-market highs. Not successful yet,
but it's trying. We did just catch a few

1062
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:12,880
but it's trying. We did just catch a few
 

1063
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,750
but it's trying. We did just catch a few
buys here into 34s. They're trying again

1064
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:15,760
buys here into 34s. They're trying again
 

1065
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,390
buys here into 34s. They're trying again
here for a delta flip. So, we did just

1066
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:18,400
here for a delta flip. So, we did just
 

1067
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,430
here for a delta flip. So, we did just
catch a few buys there into 34s on that

1068
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:21,440
catch a few buys there into 34s on that
 

1069
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:31,590
catch a few buys there into 34s on that
last move.

1070
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:31,600

 

1071
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,390

They're trying again here. So, I'd say

1072
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:34,400
They're trying again here. So, I'd say
 

1073
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,710
They're trying again here. So, I'd say
34 to 36. There were some buyers caught

1074
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:36,720
34 to 36. There were some buyers caught
 

1075
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,909
34 to 36. There were some buyers caught
through there. That's where the strong

1076
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:37,919
through there. That's where the strong
 

1077
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,430
through there. That's where the strong
sellers came in last time. So, there's

1078
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:39,440
sellers came in last time. So, there's
 

1079
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,590
sellers came in last time. So, there's
probably a passive seller there. If we

1080
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:41,600
probably a passive seller there. If we
 

1081
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,269
probably a passive seller there. If we
get through that, then buyers will want

1082
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:43,279
get through that, then buyers will want
 

1083
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,390
get through that, then buyers will want
to rotate to uh 650s.

1084
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:48,400

 

1085
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,230

Amazon finding a bid. Tesla finding a

1086
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:50,240
Amazon finding a bid. Tesla finding a
 

1087
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,190
Amazon finding a bid. Tesla finding a
bid. Both about 1% up.

1088
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,200
bid. Both about 1% up.
 

1089
00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:04,389
bid. Both about 1% up.
Rest or flat.

1090
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:04,399

 

1091
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,029

What's going on here? Big flush here

1092
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:07,039
What's going on here? Big flush here
 

1093
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,750
What's going on here? Big flush here
come previous week point of control.

1094
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:09,760
come previous week point of control.
 

1095
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,269
come previous week point of control.
Like I said, those buyers were stuck up

1096
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:11,279
Like I said, those buyers were stuck up
 

1097
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,669
Like I said, those buyers were stuck up
here. Could see them stuck. It's a nice

1098
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:13,679
here. Could see them stuck. It's a nice
 

1099
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,990
here. Could see them stuck. It's a nice
rejection of VW up there. There are some

1100
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,000
rejection of VW up there. There are some
 

1101
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,510
rejection of VW up there. There are some
aggressive buying into there who got

1102
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:17,520
aggressive buying into there who got
 

1103
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,510
aggressive buying into there who got
themselves caught. Here's your cover

1104
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:19,520
themselves caught. Here's your cover
 

1105
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,430
themselves caught. Here's your cover
point.1. Now, if we do flush this, you

1106
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:21,440
point.1. Now, if we do flush this, you
 

1107
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,149
point.1. Now, if we do flush this, you
can look for previous day low here, but

1108
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:24,159
can look for previous day low here, but
 

1109
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,830
can look for previous day low here, but
just be careful. I'm expecting sort of

1110
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:25,840
just be careful. I'm expecting sort of
 

1111
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:53,909
just be careful. I'm expecting sort of
whipsaw action.

1112
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:53,919

 

1113
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,230

There we go.

1114
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:56,240
There we go.
 

1115
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,549
There we go.
Sorry folks, just having to sort

1116
00:28:58,549 --> 00:28:58,559
Sorry folks, just having to sort
 

1117
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,909
Sorry folks, just having to sort
something out. There we go. So through

1118
00:28:59,909 --> 00:28:59,919
something out. There we go. So through
 

1119
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,110
something out. There we go. So through
previous week point control, next

1120
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,120
previous week point control, next
 

1121
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,470
previous week point control, next
targets previous day low. So those

1122
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:02,480
targets previous day low. So those
 

1123
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,750
targets previous day low. So those
buyers getting themselves caught there

1124
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:03,760
buyers getting themselves caught there
 

1125
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,990
buyers getting themselves caught there
this morning. Previous day low probably

1126
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,000
this morning. Previous day low probably
 

1127
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,230
this morning. Previous day low probably
coming up here. Uh you must be covering

1128
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,240
coming up here. Uh you must be covering
 

1129
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,549
coming up here. Uh you must be covering
into this. These are the 600s. This is

1130
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:10,559
into this. These are the 600s. This is
 

1131
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,149
into this. These are the 600s. This is
where we keep finding a bid over and

1132
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:12,159
where we keep finding a bid over and
 

1133
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,590
where we keep finding a bid over and
over and over. This is like been the

1134
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:13,600
over and over. This is like been the
 

1135
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,389
over and over. This is like been the
edge of the range all week. Maybe they

1136
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:16,399
edge of the range all week. Maybe they
 

1137
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,830
edge of the range all week. Maybe they
dip through it, but this is definitely

1138
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:17,840
dip through it, but this is definitely
 

1139
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,990
dip through it, but this is definitely
the edge.

1140
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,000
the edge.
 

1141
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,590
the edge.
Spy coming down into Oh, it's lost 82s.

1142
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:23,600
Spy coming down into Oh, it's lost 82s.
 

1143
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,269
Spy coming down into Oh, it's lost 82s.
There you go. So, it's lost 82s on the

1144
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:25,279
There you go. So, it's lost 82s on the
 

1145
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,950
There you go. So, it's lost 82s on the
spy. That's key.

1146
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:28,960
spy. That's key.
 

1147
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,389
spy. That's key.
You can see there's some bids here into

1148
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:30,399
You can see there's some bids here into
 

1149
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,630
You can see there's some bids here into
60s. You need a drift back up to sell

1150
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:32,640
60s. You need a drift back up to sell
 

1151
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,070
60s. You need a drift back up to sell
back into if you want to resize into

1152
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,080
back into if you want to resize into
 

1153
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,110
back into if you want to resize into
this. Otherwise, we're going to take

1154
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,120
this. Otherwise, we're going to take
 

1155
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,389
this. Otherwise, we're going to take
previous day low and there's going to be

1156
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:36,399
previous day low and there's going to be
 

1157
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,149
previous day low and there's going to be
nothing left to do.

1158
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:40,159

 

1159
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,269

Remember, this is where they keep

1160
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:41,279
Remember, this is where they keep
 

1161
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,430
Remember, this is where they keep
bidding from this kind of area.

1162
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:45,440
bidding from this kind of area.
 

1163
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,789
bidding from this kind of area.
This kind of area they've enjoyed

1164
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:46,799
This kind of area they've enjoyed
 

1165
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,029
This kind of area they've enjoyed
bidding from

1166
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:49,039
bidding from
 

1167
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,350
bidding from
value on the day now back at 600. So,

1168
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:51,360
value on the day now back at 600. So,
 

1169
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,549
value on the day now back at 600. So,
maybe a retest of there.

1170
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
maybe a retest of there.
 

1171
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,149
maybe a retest of there.
and see if they just drive back through

1172
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:56,159
and see if they just drive back through
 

1173
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:02,630
and see if they just drive back through
it again.

1174
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:02,640

 

1175
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,669

Previous week point of control.

1176
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:03,679
Previous week point of control.
 

1177
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,190
Previous week point of control.
Remember, this is fair value for the

1178
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,200
Remember, this is fair value for the
 

1179
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,710
Remember, this is fair value for the
last week or so. There you go. So,

1180
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:06,720
last week or so. There you go. So,
 

1181
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,549
last week or so. There you go. So,
there's the drift back to it. What they

1182
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:08,559
there's the drift back to it. What they
 

1183
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,310
there's the drift back to it. What they
do now is important. If they don't sell

1184
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:10,320
do now is important. If they don't sell
 

1185
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,990
do now is important. If they don't sell
this, we go straight back to the upside.

1186
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,000
this, we go straight back to the upside.
 

1187
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,190
this, we go straight back to the upside.
This is the same thing that they've done

1188
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,200
This is the same thing that they've done
 

1189
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,669
This is the same thing that they've done
all week long. So, how we act here

1190
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:15,679
all week long. So, how we act here
 

1191
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,909
all week long. So, how we act here
becomes important. Are they going to

1192
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:17,919
becomes important. Are they going to
 

1193
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,510
becomes important. Are they going to
just bid straight off this like they

1194
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:19,520
just bid straight off this like they
 

1195
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,190
just bid straight off this like they
have all week?

1196
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:23,200

 

1197
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,310

Time will tell.

1198
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:26,320
Time will tell.
 

1199
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,830
Time will tell.
And the place where the buyers were

1200
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:27,840
And the place where the buyers were
 

1201
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,070
And the place where the buyers were
stuck is 30. So if we let them out,

1202
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,080
stuck is 30. So if we let them out,
 

1203
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,830
stuck is 30. So if we let them out,
that's where we let them out. Up at 30s.

1204
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:33,840
that's where we let them out. Up at 30s.
 

1205
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,909
that's where we let them out. Up at 30s.
You can see just reclaimed 60 straight

1206
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:35,919
You can see just reclaimed 60 straight
 

1207
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,350
You can see just reclaimed 60 straight
away. 60 600. God, get your words out,

1208
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:39,360
away. 60 600. God, get your words out,
 

1209
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,350
away. 60 600. God, get your words out,
mate. This is the same move we've done

1210
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:41,360
mate. This is the same move we've done
 

1211
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,590
mate. This is the same move we've done
every day this week. Come to this low

1212
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:43,600
every day this week. Come to this low
 

1213
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,870
every day this week. Come to this low
kind of area previous week. Point of

1214
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:44,880
kind of area previous week. Point of
 

1215
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,310
kind of area previous week. Point of
control, find a bid. We went over it

1216
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:46,320
control, find a bid. We went over it
 

1217
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:52,710
control, find a bid. We went over it
premarket.

1218
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:52,720

 

1219
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,470

the big scoop of those lows. Look at the

1220
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:54,480
the big scoop of those lows. Look at the
 

1221
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,750
the big scoop of those lows. Look at the
drive. Like, it's mad, man.

1222
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:57,760
drive. Like, it's mad, man.
 

1223
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,430
drive. Like, it's mad, man.
Just range rotation. We're never going

1224
00:30:59,430 --> 00:30:59,440
Just range rotation. We're never going
 

1225
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,909
Just range rotation. We're never going
to move out of this range rotation. It

1226
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:01,919
to move out of this range rotation. It
 

1227
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,190
to move out of this range rotation. It
feels like it's been months now of

1228
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:05,200
feels like it's been months now of
 

1229
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,416
feels like it's been months now of
sitting in rotation. Look at that drive.

1230
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:07,426
sitting in rotation. Look at that drive.
 

1231
00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:09,830
sitting in rotation. Look at that drive.

1233
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,029

What a [\h__\h] stupid market. [laughter]

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,750

And bid up. And here you go. are right

1236
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:17,760
And bid up. And here you go. are right
 

1237
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,549
And bid up. And here you go. are right
to the upside now

1238
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:20,559
to the upside now
 

1239
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,230
to the upside now
and probably if we break previous day

1240
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:22,240
and probably if we break previous day
 

1241
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,230
and probably if we break previous day
value area low we start screaming higher

1242
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:24,240
value area low we start screaming higher
 

1243
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,669
value area low we start screaming higher
and coming and testing previous day

1244
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:25,679
and coming and testing previous day
 

1245
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,070
and coming and testing previous day
value area high. So look below this was

1246
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,080
value area high. So look below this was
 

1247
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,350
value area high. So look below this was
the level we talked about. Remember

1248
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:29,360
the level we talked about. Remember
 

1249
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,870
the level we talked about. Remember
pre-market we kept talking about

1250
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:30,880
pre-market we kept talking about
 

1251
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,630
pre-market we kept talking about
previous week point of control. Every

1252
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:32,640
previous week point of control. Every
 

1253
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,710
previous week point of control. Every
time we come into this level all it does

1254
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:34,720
time we come into this level all it does
 

1255
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,350
time we come into this level all it does
is find a bid. Never even sweeps. It's

1256
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:37,360
is find a bid. Never even sweeps. It's
 

1257
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,950
is find a bid. Never even sweeps. It's
the same thing again. Here's the edge of

1258
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:38,960
the same thing again. Here's the edge of
 

1259
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,350
the same thing again. Here's the edge of
your range. Everyone wants to call this

1260
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,360
your range. Everyone wants to call this
 

1261
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,029
your range. Everyone wants to call this
a trend. We are not in a trend. There's

1262
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:43,039
a trend. We are not in a trend. There's
 

1263
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,029
a trend. We are not in a trend. There's
your rotation. All right. There's your

1264
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:45,039
your rotation. All right. There's your
 

1265
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,909
your rotation. All right. There's your
rotation back inside. Same rotation.

1266
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:47,919
rotation back inside. Same rotation.
 

1267
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,710
rotation back inside. Same rotation.
Rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat.

1268
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:50,720
Rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat.
 

1269
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,710
Rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat.

you love rotation, which obviously we
 

1275
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:05,590
you love rotation, which obviously we
all know I absolutely hate.

1276
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:05,600

 

1277
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,430

Absolutely hate these type of markets.

These are not not not things that I
 

1281
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:16,847
These are not not not things that I
personally enjoy trading.

1282
00:32:16,847 --> 00:32:16,857

 

1283
00:32:16,857 --> 00:32:47,430

>> [sighs]

1284
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:47,440

 

1285
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,029

>> All right. So, back to value, back to

1286
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:49,039
>> All right. So, back to value, back to
 

1287
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,350
>> All right. So, back to value, back to
that New York open.

1288
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:51,360
that New York open.
 

1289
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,870
that New York open.
Bulls can't reclaim it. Remember, this

1290
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:52,880
Bulls can't reclaim it. Remember, this
 

1291
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,230
Bulls can't reclaim it. Remember, this
was the area where I said bulls got

1292
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:54,240
was the area where I said bulls got
 

1293
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,669
was the area where I said bulls got
stuck into the sort of these 30s.

1294
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:57,679
stuck into the sort of these 30s.
 

1295
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,669
stuck into the sort of these 30s.
So, [sighs] the rotation now will be to

1296
00:32:59,669 --> 00:32:59,679
So, [sighs] the rotation now will be to
 

1297
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,269
So, [sighs] the rotation now will be to
retry and retest 600 and hold it. Um,

1298
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:03,279
retry and retest 600 and hold it. Um,
 

1299
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,590
retry and retest 600 and hold it. Um,
bears will want a drift down underneath

1300
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:05,600
bears will want a drift down underneath
 

1301
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,149
bears will want a drift down underneath
that.

1302
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:10,159

 

1303
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,149

Just a 100 point move there.

1304
00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:14,159
Just a 100 point move there.
 

1305
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,070
Just a 100 point move there.
Don't know why that went to that. Sorry

1306
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,080
Don't know why that went to that. Sorry
 

1307
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,230
Don't know why that went to that. Sorry
folks. That should be like this.

1308
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:20,240

 

1309
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,389

So here's the bulls trying to hold 600.

1310
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:22,399
So here's the bulls trying to hold 600.
 

1311
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,590
So here's the bulls trying to hold 600.
All right. They're trying to hold it.

1312
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:23,600
All right. They're trying to hold it.
 

1313
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,430
All right. They're trying to hold it.
There isn't that much excess underneath

1314
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:25,440
There isn't that much excess underneath
 

1315
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,789
There isn't that much excess underneath
it really if I'm honest. So

1316
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:28,799
it really if I'm honest. So
 

1317
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,430
it really if I'm honest. So
just for me it's a it's a leave alone a

1318
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:31,440
just for me it's a it's a leave alone a
 

1319
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,110
just for me it's a it's a leave alone a
leave alone day for me personally at the

1320
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,120
leave alone day for me personally at the
 

1321
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,310
leave alone day for me personally at the
moment.

1322
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:34,320
moment.
 

1323
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,070
moment.
I just want to wait for this market to

1324
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,080
I just want to wait for this market to
 

1325
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,350
I just want to wait for this market to
get outside of its uh

1326
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,360

 

1327
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,669

of the range. I don't like I don't like

1328
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:45,679
of the range. I don't like I don't like
 

1329
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,590
of the range. I don't like I don't like
trading rotation. I think it's just the

1330
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:47,600
trading rotation. I think it's just the
 

1331
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,750
trading rotation. I think it's just the
the

1332
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:49,760
the
 

1333
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,230
the
the antithesis of what I like to do. So,

1334
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,240
the antithesis of what I like to do. So,
 

1335
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,710
the antithesis of what I like to do. So,
just let it develop. For me, all I have

1336
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:54,720
just let it develop. For me, all I have
 

1337
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,710
just let it develop. For me, all I have
to do is wait one more day. Once we get

1338
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:56,720
to do is wait one more day. Once we get
 

1339
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,149
to do is wait one more day. Once we get
to tomorrow, I've probably got some

1340
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:00,159
to tomorrow, I've probably got some
 

1341
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,549
to tomorrow, I've probably got some
really nice uh breakouts or fail

1342
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:02,559
really nice uh breakouts or fail
 

1343
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,950
really nice uh breakouts or fail
breakouts.

1344
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:04,960
breakouts.
 

1345
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,710
breakouts.
So, it's just a question. Can Can I just

1346
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:06,720
So, it's just a question. Can Can I just
 

1347
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:21,909
So, it's just a question. Can Can I just
get through to tomorrow?

1348
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:21,919

 

1349
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:24,310

All right. Testing between 600. Like I

1350
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:24,320
All right. Testing between 600. Like I
 

1351
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,230
All right. Testing between 600. Like I
talked about bulls want to defend same

1352
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,240
talked about bulls want to defend same
 

1353
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,349
talked about bulls want to defend same
level I gave you 600. Bulls will want to

1354
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:29,359
level I gave you 600. Bulls will want to
 

1355
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,190
level I gave you 600. Bulls will want to
defend this. I there is not that much

1356
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,200
defend this. I there is not that much
 

1357
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,109
defend this. I there is not that much
excess here. So one thing I would say

1358
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:33,119
excess here. So one thing I would say
 

1359
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,869
excess here. So one thing I would say
not a lot of excess here but bulls can

1360
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:34,879
not a lot of excess here but bulls can
 

1361
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,310
not a lot of excess here but bulls can
defend this they try and get back to

1362
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:36,320
defend this they try and get back to
 

1363
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,750
defend this they try and get back to
previous day value area low. If we get

1364
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:37,760
previous day value area low. If we get
 

1365
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,190
previous day value area low. If we get
acceptance through previous day value

1366
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,200
acceptance through previous day value
 

1367
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,869
acceptance through previous day value
area low they'll want to come and test

1368
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:40,879
area low they'll want to come and test
 

1369
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,389
area low they'll want to come and test
point of control and previous day value

1370
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:42,399
point of control and previous day value
 

1371
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,310
point of control and previous day value
area high. So bulls are trying to look

1372
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:44,320
area high. So bulls are trying to look
 

1373
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,349
area high. So bulls are trying to look
for this. Bears are trying to look for

1374
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:47,359
for this. Bears are trying to look for
 

1375
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,389
for this. Bears are trying to look for
this and acceptance lower. That's that's

1376
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:50,399
this and acceptance lower. That's that's
 

1377
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:58,790
this and acceptance lower. That's that's
what we have right now.

1378
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:58,800

 

1379
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,950

I know, Julian, but calling them and

1380
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:00,960
I know, Julian, but calling them and
 

1381
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,310
I know, Julian, but calling them and
enjoying them is two different things,

1382
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:02,320
enjoying them is two different things,
 

1383
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,950
enjoying them is two different things,
right? Like maybe I just need to be more

1384
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:04,960
right? Like maybe I just need to be more
 

1385
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,390
right? Like maybe I just need to be more
willing to trade them, but they're just

1386
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:06,400
willing to trade them, but they're just
 

1387
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,349
willing to trade them, but they're just
it's I try and trade where my personal

1388
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:09,359
it's I try and trade where my personal
 

1389
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,430
it's I try and trade where my personal
edges, my personal edge is in breakout

1390
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:11,440
edges, my personal edge is in breakout
 

1391
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,150
edges, my personal edge is in breakout
and fail breakout moves. And um it's

1392
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,160
and fail breakout moves. And um it's
 

1393
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,950
and fail breakout moves. And um it's
just what I I just enjoy. If I went

1394
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:16,960
just what I I just enjoy. If I went
 

1395
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,109
just what I I just enjoy. If I went
through all my data for forever and ever

1396
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:19,119
through all my data for forever and ever
 

1397
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,630
through all my data for forever and ever
and ever, I know my edge will be

1398
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:22,640
and ever, I know my edge will be
 

1399
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,390
and ever, I know my edge will be
uh when we're trading outside and when

1400
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:24,400
uh when we're trading outside and when
 

1401
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,550
uh when we're trading outside and when
we're trading inside, I know I don't

1402
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:26,560
we're trading inside, I know I don't
 

1403
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,829
we're trading inside, I know I don't
trade it as well. So, by knowing that, I

1404
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:29,839
trade it as well. So, by knowing that, I
 

1405
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,430
trade it as well. So, by knowing that, I
just try and stick to where my edges.

1406
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:31,440
just try and stick to where my edges.
 

1407
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,270
just try and stick to where my edges.
Like, for me, you make more money as a

1408
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:35,280
Like, for me, you make more money as a
 

1409
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,030
Like, for me, you make more money as a
trader by, how do I put this? By not

1410
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,040
trader by, how do I put this? By not
 

1411
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,870
trader by, how do I put this? By not
doing what you're bad at. Does that make

1412
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:40,880
doing what you're bad at. Does that make
 

1413
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,750
doing what you're bad at. Does that make
sense? I'll make more money. my P&L at

1414
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:43,760
sense? I'll make more money. my P&L at
 

1415
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,069
sense? I'll make more money. my P&L at
the end of the year is is bigger if I

1416
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:46,079
the end of the year is is bigger if I
 

1417
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,589
the end of the year is is bigger if I
cut out the trades which I'm not as good

1418
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:47,599
cut out the trades which I'm not as good
 

1419
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,470
cut out the trades which I'm not as good
at. So rather than adding more trades,

1420
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:50,480
at. So rather than adding more trades,
 

1421
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,829
at. So rather than adding more trades,
what I want to do is just cut out the

1422
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:51,839
what I want to do is just cut out the
 

1423
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,310
what I want to do is just cut out the
ones that I'm not very good at. And the

1424
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:54,320
ones that I'm not very good at. And the
 

1425
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:07,750
ones that I'm not very good at. And the
impact of that's massive.

1426
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:07,760

 

1427
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,910

Yeah. Like I talked about, I always use
that golf analogy, going around the golf

1430
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:11,520
that golf analogy, going around the golf
 

1431
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,630
that golf analogy, going around the golf
course with an eight iron. If you're

1432
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:12,640
course with an eight iron. If you're
 

1433
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,990
course with an eight iron. If you're
good with an eight iron, if you get a

1434
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,000
good with an eight iron, if you get a
 

1435
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,069
good with an eight iron, if you get a
driver out,

1436
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:16,079
driver out,
 

1437
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,870
driver out,
maybe for a couple holes, you perform

1438
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:18,880
maybe for a couple holes, you perform
 

1439
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,270
maybe for a couple holes, you perform
really well. Maybe you get you get to

1440
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:21,280
really well. Maybe you get you get to
 

1441
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,349
really well. Maybe you get you get to
those holes in less shots and you know,

1442
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:23,359
those holes in less shots and you know,
 

1443
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,510
those holes in less shots and you know,
you make a birdie or whatever. But every

1444
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:25,520
you make a birdie or whatever. But every
 

1445
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,750
you make a birdie or whatever. But every
now and again, because you're not that

1446
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:27,760
now and again, because you're not that
 

1447
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,109
now and again, because you're not that
controlled with the driver, you're going

1448
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:29,119
controlled with the driver, you're going
 

1449
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,030

Okay, so here you go. Here's the test

00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:32,400
Okay, so here you go. Here's the test
 

1453

Okay, so here you go. Here's the test
previous day value area low. So there's

1454
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:33,839
previous day value area low. So there's
 

1455
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,870
previous day value area low. So there's
the rotation failed under previous week

1456
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:36,880
the rotation failed under previous week
 

1457

the rotation failed under previous week

1461
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,510

previous day value. Now, this is last

1462
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:43,520
previous day value. Now, this is last
 

1463
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,950

chance for bears because if they don't

1464
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:44,960
chance for bears because if they don't
 

1465
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,190
chance for bears because if they don't
defend value area low, then what do we

1466
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,200
defend value area low, then what do we
 

1467
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,710
defend value area low, then what do we
have? We have a move. We have a fail

1468
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:48,720
have? We have a move. We have a fail
 

1469
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,589
have? We have a move. We have a fail
break outside of value. Think about

1470
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:51,599
break outside of value. Think about
 

1471
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,990
break outside of value. Think about
yesterday's profile. Yesterday's volume

1472
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,000
yesterday's profile. Yesterday's volume
 

1473
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,270
yesterday's profile. Yesterday's volume
is all here. All right. So, bears must

1474
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:57,280
is all here. All right. So, bears must
 

1475
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,870
is all here. All right. So, bears must
defend this if they want this. If they

1476
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:58,880
defend this if they want this. If they
 

1477
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,230
defend this if they want this. If they
don't defend that, then we're going to

1478
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:00,240
don't defend that, then we're going to
 

1479
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,910
don't defend that, then we're going to
go where? Back to these points like we

1480
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:01,920
go where? Back to these points like we

attempt to come up to previous day point

1544
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,200
attempt to come up to previous day point
 

1545
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,190
attempt to come up to previous day point
of control if they can find acceptance

1546
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:21,200
of control if they can find acceptance
 

1547
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,670
of control if they can find acceptance
inside yesterday's value. That is what

1548
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:23,680
inside yesterday's value. That is what
 

1549
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,510
inside yesterday's value. That is what
they will attempt to do. Whether they

1550
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,520
they will attempt to do. Whether they
 

1551
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,710
they will attempt to do. Whether they
can do it or not is different, but that

1552
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:26,720
can do it or not is different, but that
 

1553
00:39:26,720 --> 00:40:08,790
can do it or not is different, but that
is what they would attempt to do.

1554
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:08,800

 

1555
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,150

as a a trader I know always says do more

1556
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:12,160
as a a trader I know always says do more
 

1557
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,670
as a a trader I know always says do more
of what works and less of what does.

1558
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:13,680
of what works and less of what does.
 

1559
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,430
of what works and less of what does.
Yeah, that's it. That is literally the

1560
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:15,440
Yeah, that's it. That is literally the
 

1561
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,870
Yeah, that's it. That is literally the
biggest rule. Like if you want to

1562
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:16,880
biggest rule. Like if you want to
 

1563
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,069
biggest rule. Like if you want to
increase your profit factor, that's for

1564
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:20,079
increase your profit factor, that's for
 

1565
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,710
increase your profit factor, that's for
me that's the number one rule.

1566
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:22,720
me that's the number one rule.
 

1567
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:31,030
me that's the number one rule.
The number one rule.

1568
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,040

 

1569
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,790

That's it right there. Exactly what you

1570
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:32,800
That's it right there. Exactly what you
 

1571
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:45,349
That's it right there. Exactly what you
just said. That is it.

1572
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:45,359

 

1573
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,150

So, here we go. Still driving. Still
trying to get up to previous day point

1580
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:52,640
trying to get up to previous day point
 

1581
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,430
trying to get up to previous day point
of control and then probably up to um

1582
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:55,440
of control and then probably up to um
 

1583
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:05,670
of control and then probably up to um
previous day value area low if it can.

1584
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:05,680

 

1585
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,349

I've got like another hour with you here

1586
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:07,359
I've got like another hour with you here
 

1587
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,390
I've got like another hour with you here
and then I'm going to have to get off

1588
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:08,400
and then I'm going to have to get off
 

1589
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,750
and then I'm going to have to get off
early today. I'm afraid got some stuff

1590
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:09,760
early today. I'm afraid got some stuff
 

1591
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:21,190
early today. I'm afraid got some stuff
I' got to deal with.

1592
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:21,200

 

1593
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,470

So, uh, spy like

1594
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:24,480
So, uh, spy like
 

1595
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,309
So, uh, spy like
that first 5m minutee candle came

1596
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:26,319
that first 5m minutee candle came
 

1597
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,870
that first 5m minutee candle came
straight under 82s down to 8130s.

1598
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:28,880
straight under 82s down to 8130s.
 

1599
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,430
straight under 82s down to 8130s.
Literally closed back above 82s and is

1600
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:31,440
Literally closed back above 82s and is
 

1601
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,270
Literally closed back above 82s and is
now driving higher and the next place it

1602
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:33,280
now driving higher and the next place it
 

1603
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,670
now driving higher and the next place it
will want to go is probably 85s if it

1604
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:35,680
will want to go is probably 85s if it
 

1605
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,990
will want to go is probably 85s if it
can go there. I don't expect like my

1606
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,000
can go there. I don't expect like my
 

1607
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,069
can go there. I don't expect like my
anticipation with this market is we do

1608
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:40,079
anticipation with this market is we do
 

1609
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,829
anticipation with this market is we do
not move outside of range. I can't see

1610
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:43,839
not move outside of range. I can't see
 

1611
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,230
not move outside of range. I can't see
why we would move outside of range right

1612
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:46,240
why we would move outside of range right
 

1613
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,270
why we would move outside of range right
now. Um

1614
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:49,280
now. Um
 

1615
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,510
now. Um
prior to uh

1616
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:53,520

 

1617
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,309

I can't talk prior to uh FOMC. I I don't

1618
00:41:58,309 --> 00:41:58,319
I can't talk prior to uh FOMC. I I don't
 

1619
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,589
I can't talk prior to uh FOMC. I I don't
see why we would do that. There's no

1620
00:41:59,589 --> 00:41:59,599
see why we would do that. There's no
 

1621
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:08,150
see why we would do that. There's no
reason for it to do that in my opinion.

1622
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:08,160

 

1623
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,829

Unless unless something spooks the

1624
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:09,839
Unless unless something spooks the
 

1625
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,990
Unless unless something spooks the
market, uh, all this would be about

1626
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,000
market, uh, all this would be about
 

1627
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,589
market, uh, all this would be about
doing is building liquidity into the

1628
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:13,599
doing is building liquidity into the
 

1629
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,550
doing is building liquidity into the
market, I would imagine. Anyway, that's

1630
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:16,560
market, I would imagine. Anyway, that's
 

1631
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,750
market, I would imagine. Anyway, that's
that's my anticipation.

1632
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:19,760
that's my anticipation.
 

1633
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:41,589
that's my anticipation.
That is my anticipation.

1634
00:42:41,589 --> 00:42:41,599

 

1635
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,510

Okay, back down towards VW up. So,

1636
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:43,520
Okay, back down towards VW up. So,
 

1637
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,270
Okay, back down towards VW up. So,
failing previous day value area low.

1638
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:45,280
failing previous day value area low.
 

1639
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,950
failing previous day value area low.
Let's put some current profile on there

1640
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:46,960
Let's put some current profile on there
 

1641
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,349
Let's put some current profile on there
as well.

1642
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:49,359
as well.
 

1643
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,990
as well.
So, there's your rotation.

1644
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,000
So, there's your rotation.
 

1645
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:17,670
So, there's your rotation.
Current rotation anyway.

1646
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:17,680

1703
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,870
Back to Vup we go.
Man, this uh trade copy, I really like

1704
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:18,880
Man, this uh trade copy, I really like
 

1705
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,870
Man, this uh trade copy, I really like
it, but it definitely keeps

1706
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:20,880
it, but it definitely keeps
 

1707
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,349
it, but it definitely keeps
disconnecting me from stuff. I think

1708
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:23,359
disconnecting me from stuff. I think
 

1709
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,190
disconnecting me from stuff. I think
it's that I've never had an issue before

1710
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:25,200
it's that I've never had an issue before
 

1711
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,349
it's that I've never had an issue before
using it.

1712
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:27,359
using it.
 

1713
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,430
using it.
Maybe I'm wrong.

1714
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:29,440
Maybe I'm wrong.
 

1715
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:47,589
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe it's my computer.

1716
00:45:47,589 --> 00:45:47,599

 

1717
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,030

Okay, back to VW up. So, we're trapped

1718
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:49,040
Okay, back to VW up. So, we're trapped
 

1719
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,390
Okay, back to VW up. So, we're trapped
between 24hour VWOP and uh New York VWOP

1720
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:52,400
between 24hour VWOP and uh New York VWOP
 

1721
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,510
between 24hour VWOP and uh New York VWOP
here.

1722
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:55,520

 

1723
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,510

Just in range. No, no, no. Uh big moves

1724
00:45:59,510 --> 00:45:59,520
Just in range. No, no, no. Uh big moves
 

1725
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,109
Just in range. No, no, no. Uh big moves
here like we talked about. We're just in

1726
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:01,119
here like we talked about. We're just in
 

1727
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,589
here like we talked about. We're just in
range. The only thing I'd say is we

1728
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:03,599
range. The only thing I'd say is we
 

1729
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,030
range. The only thing I'd say is we
didn't complete, we didn't take out the

1730
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:05,040
didn't complete, we didn't take out the
 

1731
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,870
didn't complete, we didn't take out the
previous day lows, but now just drifting

1732
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:06,880
previous day lows, but now just drifting
 

1733
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,390
previous day lows, but now just drifting
back down to current value area low on

1734
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:08,400
back down to current value area low on
 

1735
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,950
back down to current value area low on
the day. Some stronger selling coming in

1736
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:10,960
the day. Some stronger selling coming in
 

1737
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,430
the day. Some stronger selling coming in
here, but I'd imagine they just bid off

1738
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:13,440
here, but I'd imagine they just bid off
 

1739
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,829
here, but I'd imagine they just bid off
it like they've uh wanted to do numerous

1740
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:15,839
it like they've uh wanted to do numerous
 

1741
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,270
it like they've uh wanted to do numerous
times, but we will see. Maybe we come

1742
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:17,280
times, but we will see. Maybe we come
 

1743
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,790
times, but we will see. Maybe we come
down to that previous day low. I don't

1744
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:18,800
down to that previous day low. I don't
 

1745
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,710
down to that previous day low. I don't
know.

1746
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:24,720

 

1747
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,750

Okay, that's developing profile, is it?

1748
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:27,760
Okay, that's developing profile, is it?
 

1749
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,230
Okay, that's developing profile, is it?
Yes. Okay, that's uh current weekly

1750
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:30,240
Yes. Okay, that's uh current weekly
 

1751
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,069
Yes. Okay, that's uh current weekly
profile though. So, I was just trying to

1752
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:32,079
profile though. So, I was just trying to
 

1753
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,150
profile though. So, I was just trying to
work out what that was. [snorts]

1754
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:34,160
work out what that was. [snorts]
 

1755
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,309
work out what that was. [snorts]
Okay, so back up to New York, back up to

1756
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:36,319
Okay, so back up to New York, back up to
 

1757
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,550
Okay, so back up to New York, back up to
point of control on the day. Stuck in

1758
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:38,560
point of control on the day. Stuck in
 

1759
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,950
point of control on the day. Stuck in
this rotation.

1760
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:40,960
this rotation.
 

1761
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,550
this rotation.
Uh did we have a lot of selling at those

1762
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:42,560
Uh did we have a lot of selling at those
 

1763
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,870
Uh did we have a lot of selling at those
lows? I'd say yeah, under 600. There was

1764
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:44,880
lows? I'd say yeah, under 600. There was
 

1765
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,550
lows? I'd say yeah, under 600. There was
a fair bit of selling that's probably

1766
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:46,560
a fair bit of selling that's probably
 

1767
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,550
a fair bit of selling that's probably
stuck.

1768
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:48,560
stuck.
 

1769
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,630
stuck.
And where's the buyers came in? Buys

1770
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:50,640
And where's the buyers came in? Buys
 

1771
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,190
And where's the buyers came in? Buys
over 50s right now. So, buyers over 50s

1772
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:53,200
over 50s right now. So, buyers over 50s
 

1773
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,510
over 50s right now. So, buyers over 50s
are stuck. Sellers under 600 stuck. 50

1774
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:55,520
are stuck. Sellers under 600 stuck. 50
 

1775
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,270
are stuck. Sellers under 600 stuck. 50
points there to play either side. That's

1776
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:57,280
points there to play either side. That's
 

1777
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,390
points there to play either side. That's
about it.

1778
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:00,400
about it.
 

1779
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,510
about it.
VIX want to pick up 1850 to FOMC. I

1780
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:03,520
VIX want to pick up 1850 to FOMC. I
 

1781
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,510
VIX want to pick up 1850 to FOMC. I
mean, no, Peter, definitely not. Look,

1782
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:05,520
mean, no, Peter, definitely not. Look,
 

1783
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,950
mean, no, Peter, definitely not. Look,
it's just failed to break out this

1784
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:06,960
it's just failed to break out this
 

1785
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,190
it's just failed to break out this
morning. It looked above 1766. I don't

1786
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:09,200
morning. It looked above 1766. I don't
 

1787
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,897
morning. It looked above 1766. I don't
see why it would come up to 1850 before

1788
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:12,907
see why it would come up to 1850 before
 

1789
00:47:12,907 --> 00:47:14,470
see why it would come up to 1850 before
[clears throat] FOMC that you'd be

1790
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:14,480
[clears throat] FOMC that you'd be
 

1791
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,990
[clears throat] FOMC that you'd be
asking for a lot of volatility to come

1792
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:16,000
asking for a lot of volatility to come
 

1793
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,510
asking for a lot of volatility to come
on the market. Like I find it unlikely,

1794
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:19,520
on the market. Like I find it unlikely,
 

1795
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,150
on the market. Like I find it unlikely,
but we'll no I could easily be wrong,

1796
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:22,160
but we'll no I could easily be wrong,
 

1797
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,670
but we'll no I could easily be wrong,
but at the moment all we're doing is B

1798
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:23,680
but at the moment all we're doing is B
 

1799
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,270
but at the moment all we're doing is B
is bouncing between basically 1750 and

1800
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:27,280
is bouncing between basically 1750 and
 

1801
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,870
is bouncing between basically 1750 and
1720. Yeah. So like the previous high

1802
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:30,880
1720. Yeah. So like the previous high
 

1803
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,270
1720. Yeah. So like the previous high
from Tuesday, December 9th, acting as a

1804
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:33,280
from Tuesday, December 9th, acting as a
 

1805
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,430
from Tuesday, December 9th, acting as a
support system. If we fade that, we

1806
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:35,440
support system. If we fade that, we
 

1807
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,109
support system. If we fade that, we
probably come all the way down to 17s,

1808
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:37,119
probably come all the way down to 17s,
 

1809
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,870
probably come all the way down to 17s,
close the gap in VIX to 1693s.

1810
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:40,880
close the gap in VIX to 1693s.
 

1811
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,870
close the gap in VIX to 1693s.
uh it will need to sustain a bid over

1812
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:42,880
uh it will need to sustain a bid over
 

1813
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,670
uh it will need to sustain a bid over
1750 or 1760 really to get anywhere near

1814
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:45,680
1750 or 1760 really to get anywhere near
 

1815
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,990
1750 or 1760 really to get anywhere near
those 18s and I'll be looking at 1820s

1816
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:48,000
those 18s and I'll be looking at 1820s
 

1817
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,630
those 18s and I'll be looking at 1820s
first stop. So yeah, for me for me it's

1818
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:50,640
first stop. So yeah, for me for me it's
 

1819
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,470
first stop. So yeah, for me for me it's
just a

1820
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:52,480
just a
 

1821
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,630
just a
it's just going to go chill. It's just

1822
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:54,640
it's just going to go chill. It's just
 

1823
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,230
it's just going to go chill. It's just
going to go it's just going to go into

1824
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:56,240
going to go it's just going to go into
 

1825
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,510
going to go it's just going to go into
what we're seeing here. All right,

1826
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:57,520
what we're seeing here. All right,
 

1827
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,829
what we're seeing here. All right,
here's your profile. Now

1828
00:47:59,829 --> 00:47:59,839
here's your profile. Now
 

1829
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,510
here's your profile. Now
we are rejecting previous days value

1830
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:01,520
we are rejecting previous days value
 

1831
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,430
we are rejecting previous days value
area lows. The one thing I'd say at the

1832
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:03,440
area lows. The one thing I'd say at the
 

1833
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,430
area lows. The one thing I'd say at the
moment we have not got back into

1834
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:05,440
moment we have not got back into
 

1835
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,230
moment we have not got back into
previous days value. All right. So

1836
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:08,240
previous days value. All right. So
 

1837
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,030
previous days value. All right. So
really they need to do this to get us

1838
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:11,040
really they need to do this to get us
 

1839
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,790
really they need to do this to get us
inside value. All the time we're outside

1840
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:12,800
inside value. All the time we're outside
 

1841
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,230
inside value. All the time we're outside
of value. This is open. Um but this is

1842
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:16,240
of value. This is open. Um but this is
 

1843
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,589
of value. This is open. Um but this is
key. That previous week point of

1844
00:48:17,589 --> 00:48:17,599
key. That previous week point of
 

1845
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:18,870
key. That previous week point of
control. If we start letting go of

1846
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:18,880
control. If we start letting go of
 

1847
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,390
control. If we start letting go of
previous week point control and we start

1848
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:20,400
previous week point control and we start
 

1849
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,950
previous week point control and we start
getting like a fade underneath these

1850
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:22,960
getting like a fade underneath these
 

1851
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,030
getting like a fade underneath these
previous day lows, then previous week

1852
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:25,040
previous day lows, then previous week
 

1853
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,349
previous day lows, then previous week
value area high becomes more probable.

1854
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:29,359
value area high becomes more probable.
 

1855
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:32,069
value area high becomes more probable.
But it's a big if right now. Sellers

1856
00:48:32,069 --> 00:48:32,079
But it's a big if right now. Sellers
 

1857
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,670
But it's a big if right now. Sellers
trying to be aggressive here. We might

1858
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:33,680
trying to be aggressive here. We might
 

1859
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,349
trying to be aggressive here. We might
get a breakdown here if they really let

1860
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:35,359
get a breakdown here if they really let
 

1861
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:41,750
get a breakdown here if they really let
this out underneath the 600.

1862
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:41,760

 

1863
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,510

Watching this 600. They're trying to

1864
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:43,520
Watching this 600. They're trying to
 

1865
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,589
Watching this 600. They're trying to
sell very aggressively. If they sell

1866
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:45,599
sell very aggressively. If they sell
 

1867
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,150
sell very aggressively. If they sell
this, it is potential that they want to

1868
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:48,160
this, it is potential that they want to
 

1869
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,069
this, it is potential that they want to
wash it. But uh remember this previous

1870
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:50,079
wash it. But uh remember this previous
 

1871
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,470
wash it. But uh remember this previous
week point control is what we bid off

1872
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:52,480
week point control is what we bid off
 

1873
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,990
week point control is what we bid off
nonstop, right? Nonstop. Big selling

coming in here back to this same level.
 

1877
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,870

This is where they got stuck this

1878
00:48:58,870 --> 00:48:58,880
This is where they got stuck this
 

1879
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,950
This is where they got stuck this
morning, but they are trying. Mag is all

1880
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:00,960
morning, but they are trying. Mag is all
 

1881
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,549
morning, but they are trying. Mag is all
going red other than Amazon and Apple.

1882
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:02,559
going red other than Amazon and Apple.
 

1883
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,309
going red other than Amazon and Apple.
Worth noting MAG is going red other than

1884
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:04,319
Worth noting MAG is going red other than
 

1885
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,309
Worth noting MAG is going red other than
Amazon and Apple. But I'd say this

1886
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:06,319
Amazon and Apple. But I'd say this
 

1887
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,910
Amazon and Apple. But I'd say this
previous week point of control and now

1888
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:07,920
previous week point of control and now
 

1889
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,230
previous week point of control and now
I'd even say 612 becomes important. That

1890
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:10,240
I'd even say 612 becomes important. That
 

1891
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,790
I'd even say 612 becomes important. That
big sell candle.

1892
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:12,800
big sell candle.
 

1893
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,470

morning until we get to uh FRMC, but you

1928
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:00,800
morning until we get to uh FRMC, but you
 

1929
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,910
morning until we get to uh FRMC, but you
never know. Some days it's not what

1930
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:03,920
never know. Some days it's not what
 

1931
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,349
never know. Some days it's not what
happens. But that's what it feels like

1932
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:05,359
happens. But that's what it feels like
 

1933
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:10,790
happens. But that's what it feels like
at the moment. There's that 610 test.

1934
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:10,800

 

1935
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,309

They've got definitely got bears, a

1936
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:12,319
They've got definitely got bears, a
 

1937
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,309
They've got definitely got bears, a
little bears trapped under 600 again for

1938
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:14,319
little bears trapped under 600 again for
 

1939
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:15,750
little bears trapped under 600 again for
the second time today. So bears will

1940
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:15,760
the second time today. So bears will
 

1941
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,750
the second time today. So bears will
need to get closed well under 600

1942
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:17,760
need to get closed well under 600
 

1943
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,710
need to get closed well under 600
otherwise they're going to be in

1944
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:18,720
otherwise they're going to be in
 

1945
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:25,750
otherwise they're going to be in
trouble.

1946
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:25,760

 

1947
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,790

this edge. Yeah, we are rejecting value.

1948
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:28,800
this edge. Yeah, we are rejecting value.
 

1949
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,309
this edge. Yeah, we are rejecting value.
Potential that they move lower here, but

1950
00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:30,319
Potential that they move lower here, but
 

1951
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:34,950
Potential that they move lower here, but
they're going to have to get under 600.

1952
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:34,960

 

1953
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,870

I don't like it for me personally, but

1954
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:36,880
I don't like it for me personally, but
 

1955
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,589
I don't like it for me personally, but
just saying what I'm seeing.

1956
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:41,599

 

1957
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,109

Yes, back above New York open. Back

1958
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:43,119
Yes, back above New York open. Back
 

1959
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:49,190
Yes, back above New York open. Back
above both the VWAPs. Divergence there.

1960
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:49,200

 

1961
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,990

Vicks at previous day high

1962
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:52,000
Vicks at previous day high
 

1963
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,069
Vicks at previous day high
was traded downside. Might make a new

1964
00:50:54,069 --> 00:50:54,079
was traded downside. Might make a new
 

1965
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,829
was traded downside. Might make a new
low here if it does spike and squeeze

1966
00:50:55,829 --> 00:50:55,839
low here if it does spike and squeeze
 

1967
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,549
low here if it does spike and squeeze
and then NQ might want to follow. We

1968
00:50:58,549 --> 00:50:58,559
and then NQ might want to follow. We
 

1969
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,870
and then NQ might want to follow. We
don't know. So no close below 600. These

1970
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:02,880
don't know. So no close below 600. These
 

1971
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,270
don't know. So no close below 600. These
bears are struggling right now. Back

00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:05,280
bears are struggling right now. Back
 

1973
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,589
bears are struggling right now. Back
inside current value for the day.

inside current value for the day.
There's liquidity up at 40. I don't know

1976
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:11,359
There's liquidity up at 40. I don't know
 

1977
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,710
There's liquidity up at 40. I don't know
why they're dangling it up there, but

1978
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:12,720
why they're dangling it up there, but
 

1979
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,910
why they're dangling it up there, but
they are.

1980
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:17,920

 

1981
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,910

Yeah, I watch the Q's as well.

Yeah, I watch the Q's as well.
 

1983
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,829
Yeah, I watch the Q's as well.
I don't have to pay as much uh attention

1984
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:23,839
I don't have to pay as much uh attention
 

1985
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:25,829
I don't have to pay as much uh attention
to the Q's because I'm trading NQ. But

1986
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:25,839
to the Q's because I'm trading NQ. But
 

1987
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,950
to the Q's because I'm trading NQ. But
yeah, I I'm watching the Q's as well. Q

1988
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:28,960
yeah, I I'm watching the Q's as well. Q
 

1989
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:35,990
yeah, I I'm watching the Q's as well. Q
spy VIX. That's what I'm watching.

1990
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:36,000

 

1991
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,270

This doesn't look good for the bears.

1992
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:39,280
This doesn't look good for the bears.
 

1993
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,790
This doesn't look good for the bears.
Think there's potential squeeze out

1994
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:40,800
Think there's potential squeeze out
 

1995
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,030
Think there's potential squeeze out
here. They might get themselves caught.

1996
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:43,040
here. They might get themselves caught.
 

1997
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,950
here. They might get themselves caught.
They need to get under 600. These bears,

1998
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:44,960
They need to get under 600. These bears,
 

1999
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,150
They need to get under 600. These bears,
they're having another go here.

2000
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:48,160
they're having another go here.
 

2001
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,589
they're having another go here.
They've got to get a clo definitely

2002
00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:49,599
They've got to get a clo definitely
 

2003
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,150
They've got to get a clo definitely
under 607s. It's point of control from

2004
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:52,160
under 607s. It's point of control from
 

2005
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,430
under 607s. It's point of control from
that last candle and it's being

2006
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:53,440
that last candle and it's being
 

2007
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,589
that last candle and it's being
absorbed. Delta in this candle is

2008
00:51:55,589 --> 00:51:55,599
absorbed. Delta in this candle is
 

2009
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,349
absorbed. Delta in this candle is
negative and we've gone higher. So

2010
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:57,359
negative and we've gone higher. So
 

2011
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:03,750
negative and we've gone higher. So
there's a passive buyer on the tape.

2012
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:03,760

 

2013
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,349

There's passive buyer on the tape down

2014
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:05,359
There's passive buyer on the tape down
 

2015
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,069
There's passive buyer on the tape down
here. Surprise, surprise. At that

2016
00:52:08,069 --> 00:52:08,079
here. Surprise, surprise. At that
 

2017
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,349
here. Surprise, surprise. At that
previous week point of control, there's

2018
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:09,359
previous week point of control, there's
 

2019
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:13,349
previous week point of control, there's
a passive buyer. Same thing for

2020
00:52:13,349 --> 00:52:13,359
a passive buyer. Same thing for
 

2021
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,430
a passive buyer. Same thing for
well five days last week and where are

2022
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:15,440
well five days last week and where are
 

2023
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,476
well five days last week and where are
we today? three days this week. So,

2024
00:52:17,476 --> 00:52:17,486
we today? three days this week. So,
 

2025
00:52:17,486 --> 00:52:18,630
we today? three days this week. So,
[snorts] same thing as we talked about

2026
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:18,640
[snorts] same thing as we talked about
 

2027
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,150
[snorts] same thing as we talked about
this morning. And there we go. So, there

2028
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:20,160
this morning. And there we go. So, there
 

2029
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,349
this morning. And there we go. So, there
there's the squeeze we just talked

2030
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:21,359
there's the squeeze we just talked
 

2031
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,109
there's the squeeze we just talked
about. This is why I just don't I have

about. This is why I just don't I have
 

2033
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:31,270

no interest in trading this. None.

2034

2038
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:35,520

If it gets through this, it will just
scream higher because all those bears

this is the market condition we have. I

00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:01,200
this is the market condition we have. I
 

2059
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,270
this is the market condition we have. I
cannot do anything with it. If if

they're going to do this, we have to

00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:04,720
they're going to do this, we have to
 

2063
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,069
they're going to do this, we have to
respect what they're going to do. We

2064
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:06,079
respect what they're going to do. We
 

2065
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:08,549
respect what they're going to do. We
can't fight them the way I respect what

00:53:08,549 --> 00:53:08,559
can't fight them the way I respect what
 

2067
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,630
can't fight them the way I respect what
they're going to do is by staying away

2068
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:10,640
they're going to do is by staying away
 

2069
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,750
they're going to do is by staying away
from it.

I'm not saying it's going to be

trying to sell through it again. So, I'd

2092
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:37,599
trying to sell through it again. So, I'd
 

2093

trying to sell through it again. So, I'd
say sort of 608s now is going to become

2161
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,510
the current value area low on the week.
We are just going to trade from one side

2162
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:33,520
We are just going to trade from one side
 

2163
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,589
We are just going to trade from one side
to the other. You can see it. All you

2164
00:55:35,589 --> 00:55:35,599
to the other. You can see it. All you
 

2165
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,270
to the other. You can see it. All you
got to do is put a profile on this week

2166
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:37,280
got to do is put a profile on this week
 

2167
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,790
got to do is put a profile on this week
and last week and look at an hourly

2168
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:38,800
and last week and look at an hourly
 

2169
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,230
and last week and look at an hourly
chart and that is just telling you the

2170
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:40,240
chart and that is just telling you the
 

2171
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,510
chart and that is just telling you the
whole story that you need to know.

2172
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:41,520
whole story that you need to know.
 

2173
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,870
whole story that you need to know.
There's nothing you need to know beyond

2174
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:42,880
There's nothing you need to know beyond
 

2175
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,510
There's nothing you need to know beyond
that. Look at that. What one,

2176
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:45,520
that. Look at that. What one,
 

2177
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,150
that. Look at that. What one,
two, three drives we've had off this

2178
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:48,160
two, three drives we've had off this
 

2179
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,230
two, three drives we've had off this
kind of level we're at now and three

2180
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:50,240
kind of level we're at now and three
 

2181
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,789
kind of level we're at now and three
failures from seven just over 700 back

2182
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:52,799
failures from seven just over 700 back
 

2183
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,670
failures from seven just over 700 back
to this level. We're just pinned 100

2184
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:55,680
to this level. We're just pinned 100
 

2185
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,069
to this level. We're just pinned 100
point pin. That's basically what we're

2186
00:55:58,069 --> 00:55:58,079
point pin. That's basically what we're
 

2187
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:03,030
point pin. That's basically what we're
in. 100 point pin

2188
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:03,040

 

2189
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:10,150

six to seven basically.

2190
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:10,160

 

2191
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:18,150

Yeah. Agreed. Agreed. Sigma agreed.

2192
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:18,160

 

2193
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,950

So here we go. Cellis failed.

2194
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:22,960

 

2195
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,030

It was they had three candles there of

2196
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:25,040
It was they had three candles there of
 

2197
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,549
It was they had three candles there of
heavy delta and we didn't move lower.

2198
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:26,559
heavy delta and we didn't move lower.
 

2199
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:27,829
heavy delta and we didn't move lower.
That's telling the story. We're coming

2200
00:56:27,829 --> 00:56:27,839
That's telling the story. We're coming
 

2201
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,750
That's telling the story. We're coming
back into where these sellers are at 35s

2202
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:29,760
back into where these sellers are at 35s
 

2203
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,829
back into where these sellers are at 35s
again. And if we squeeze through this,

2204
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:31,839
again. And if we squeeze through this,
 

2205
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:33,670
again. And if we squeeze through this,
we probably go straight back to previous

2206
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:33,680
we probably go straight back to previous
 

2207
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,069
we probably go straight back to previous
day value area low, which is value area

2208
00:56:36,069 --> 00:56:36,079
day value area low, which is value area
 

2209
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,309
day value area low, which is value area
high on the day, which is 50s. And if we

2210
00:56:38,309 --> 00:56:38,319
high on the day, which is 50s. And if we
 

2211
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:39,589
high on the day, which is 50s. And if we
get through that, we're going to go high

2212
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:39,599
get through that, we're going to go high
 

2213
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,390
get through that, we're going to go high
of day probably.

2214
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:42,400
of day probably.
 

2215
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:57,670
of day probably.
This is the game right now.

2216
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:57,680

 

2217
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,309

This is point of control on the day now.

2218
00:57:00,309 --> 00:57:00,319
This is point of control on the day now.
 

2219
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:03,190
This is point of control on the day now.
Almost traded level.

2220
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:03,200
Almost traded level.
 

2221
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,390
Almost traded level.
See, look how tight this ranges.

2222
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:06,400
See, look how tight this ranges.
 

2223
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,390
See, look how tight this ranges.
This is why I keep saying like we're

2224
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:08,400
This is why I keep saying like we're
 

2225
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,069
This is why I keep saying like we're
just getting tighter and tighter and

2226
00:57:10,069 --> 00:57:10,079
just getting tighter and tighter and
 

2227
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:11,510
just getting tighter and tighter and
tighter and tighter and tighter.

2228
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:11,520
tighter and tighter and tighter.
 

2229
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,589
tighter and tighter and tighter.
Eventually, this thing is going to

2230
00:57:13,589 --> 00:57:13,599
Eventually, this thing is going to
 

2231
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,910
Eventually, this thing is going to
either implode or explode. Right? So,

2232
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:15,920
either implode or explode. Right? So,
 

2233
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,069
either implode or explode. Right? So,
we've gone from that. Now, we've gone to

2234
00:57:18,069 --> 00:57:18,079
we've gone from that. Now, we've gone to
 

2235
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,870
we've gone from that. Now, we've gone to
this. Right? We're either going to get

2236
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:20,880
this. Right? We're either going to get
 

2237
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,510
this. Right? We're either going to get
one of these or one of these probably

2238
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:23,520
one of these or one of these probably
 

2239
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,270
one of these or one of these probably
after 2 o'clock or maybe even tomorrow

2240
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:25,280
after 2 o'clock or maybe even tomorrow
 

2241
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,870
after 2 o'clock or maybe even tomorrow
to be honest. They might do some

2242
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:26,880
to be honest. They might do some
 

2243
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,870
to be honest. They might do some
nastiness today and then real move comes

2244
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:28,880
nastiness today and then real move comes
 

2245
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,569
nastiness today and then real move comes
tomorrow.

2246
00:57:30,569 --> 00:57:30,579
tomorrow.

It might go red soon.

00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:43,839
It might go red soon.
 

2253
00:57:43,839 --> 00:58:06,950
It might go red soon.
May very well go red soon on Apple.

2254

Like I said, it's having another attempt
 

2287

at 850. See once it gets through 850

should probably just rip some faces to
 

2291
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,710
should probably just rip some faces to
be honest. Probably so many caught in

00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:16,720
be honest. Probably so many caught in
 

2293
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:21,430
be honest. Probably so many caught in
this now.

2295
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,750

There we go. They just caught everyone

2296
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:23,760
There we go. They just caught everyone
 

2297
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,349
There we go. They just caught everyone
with shorts down here. So go straight

2298
00:59:25,349 --> 00:59:25,359
with shorts down here. So go straight
 

2299
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,270
with shorts down here. So go straight
back up to previous day value low. Same

2300
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:27,280
back up to previous day value low. Same
 

2301
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,109
back up to previous day value low. Same
thing applies. Like I'm [\h__\h] bored of

2302
00:59:29,109 --> 00:59:29,119
thing applies. Like I'm [\h__\h] bored of
 

2303
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,589
thing applies. Like I'm [\h__\h] bored of
saying it, but we get through value low

2304
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:31,599
saying it, but we get through value low
 

2305
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:32,950
saying it, but we get through value low
and try and test up here. If we can't

2306
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:32,960
and try and test up here. If we can't
 

2307
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,309
and try and test up here. If we can't
get through value low, it's going to

2308
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:34,319
get through value low, it's going to
 

2309
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:35,750
get through value low, it's going to
come back down to here. And you're

2310
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:35,760
come back down to here. And you're
 

2311
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,430
come back down to here. And you're
playing in 50 points range. That's

2312
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:37,440
playing in 50 points range. That's
 

2313
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,430
playing in 50 points range. That's
that's literally all you are playing in.

2314
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:41,440
that's literally all you are playing in.
 

2315
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,430
that's literally all you are playing in.
The spy trying to break out. It is

00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:45,680
attempting to break out of those 850s.
 

2319
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,270
attempting to break out of those 850s.
It's trying to drag the market up with

00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:47,280
It's trying to drag the market up with
 

2321
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,190
It's trying to drag the market up with
it. Um,

2322
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:49,200
it. Um,
 

2323
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,710
it. Um,
Tesla has just gone red to green just

2324
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:50,720
Tesla has just gone red to green just
 

2325
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,109
Tesla has just gone red to green just
about. Nvidia's red, Microsoft's red,

2326
00:59:53,109 --> 00:59:53,119
about. Nvidia's red, Microsoft's red,
 

2327
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,910
about. Nvidia's red, Microsoft's red,
Meta's red, Apple's flat, Google's half%

2328
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:55,920
Meta's red, Apple's flat, Google's half%
 

2329
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,829
Meta's red, Apple's flat, Google's half%
up, Amazon's one and a half% up. It's

2330
00:59:57,829 --> 00:59:57,839
up, Amazon's one and a half% up. It's
 

2331
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:00,950
up, Amazon's one and a half% up. It's
just a mixed bag. Again, I cannot

2332
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:00,960
just a mixed bag. Again, I cannot
 

2333
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,549
just a mixed bag. Again, I cannot
remember a day where I've looked at the

2334
01:00:02,549 --> 01:00:02,559
remember a day where I've looked at the
 

2335
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,069
remember a day where I've looked at the
Mag 7 and they're all doing the same

2336
01:00:04,069 --> 01:00:04,079
Mag 7 and they're all doing the same
 

2337
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,630
Mag 7 and they're all doing the same
thing for a long time, a long, long

2338
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:06,640
thing for a long time, a long, long
 

2339
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,150
thing for a long time, a long, long
time. And you might say, why does that

2340
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:08,160
time. And you might say, why does that
 

2341
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,910
time. And you might say, why does that
matter? Well, they're worth 60% of the

2342
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:09,920
matter? Well, they're worth 60% of the
 

2343
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,470
matter? Well, they're worth 60% of the
cues, so it matters. So, if you've got

2344
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:12,480
cues, so it matters. So, if you've got
 

2345
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,750
cues, so it matters. So, if you've got
half red, half green,

2346
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:15,760
half red, half green,
 

2347
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,910
half red, half green,
probably not a lot you can do with it in

2348
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:17,920
probably not a lot you can do with it in
 

2349
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,069
probably not a lot you can do with it in
terms of confluence.

2350
01:00:20,069 --> 01:00:20,079
terms of confluence.
 

2351
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:22,950
terms of confluence.
Am I trading later? Um, if price

2352

action's good, I will trade with my team

2354
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:24,720
action's good, I will trade with my team
 

2355
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,549
action's good, I will trade with my team
in Discord.

2356
01:00:26,549 --> 01:00:26,559

in Discord.
Generally speaking, I normally don't

2358
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:27,760
Generally speaking, I normally don't
 

2359
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,549
Generally speaking, I normally don't
trade FOMC. I normally let the move

2360
01:00:30,549 --> 01:00:30,559
trade FOMC. I normally let the move
 

2361
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,390
trade FOMC. I normally let the move
happen, but if we come to an extreme and

2362
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:32,400
happen, but if we come to an extreme and
 

2363
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,630
happen, but if we come to an extreme and
I think there's something to do, then

2364
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:34,640
I think there's something to do, then
 

2365
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,750
I think there's something to do, then
yes. But we will see.

2366
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:37,760
yes. But we will see.
 

2367
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:42,470
yes. But we will see.
I'll be here for it, that's for sure.

2368
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:42,480

 

2369
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:48,390

Nice. Keeping safe. Good work.

2370
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:48,400

 

2371
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,390

Spy trying to break out of 850. Failing

2372
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:50,400
Spy trying to break out of 850. Failing
 

2373
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,270
Spy trying to break out of 850. Failing
850 again.

2374
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:53,280
850 again.
 

2375
01:00:53,280 --> 01:01:00,470
850 again.
Feels like it wants to go though.

2376
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:00,480

 

2377
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,230

Seeing a rotation now. Tesla's gone

2378
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:02,240
Seeing a rotation now. Tesla's gone
 

2379
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,910
Seeing a rotation now. Tesla's gone
green. Apple very close to going red.

2380
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:03,920
green. Apple very close to going red.
 

2381
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,630
green. Apple very close to going red.
It's just like rotation between the

2382
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:06,640
It's just like rotation between the
 

2383
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,652
It's just like rotation between the
names.

2384
01:01:10,652 --> 01:01:10,662

 

2385
01:01:10,662 --> 01:01:20,069

[sighs and gasps]

2386
01:01:20,069 --> 01:01:20,079

 

2387
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:24,710

What's this

2388
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:24,720

 

2389
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,510

level that we're at? Oh, it's the

2390
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:27,520
level that we're at? Oh, it's the
 

2391
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,510
level that we're at? Oh, it's the
playback's low. Asia low. Okay. I was

2392
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:29,520
playback's low. Asia low. Okay. I was
 

2393
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,957
playback's low. Asia low. Okay. I was
thinking, what the hell is that?

2394
01:01:30,957 --> 01:01:30,967
thinking, what the hell is that?
 

2395
01:01:30,967 --> 01:01:35,750
thinking, what the hell is that?
[snorts]

2396
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:35,760

 

2397
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,349

Spy really looks like it wants to break

2398
01:01:37,349 --> 01:01:37,359
Spy really looks like it wants to break
 

2399
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:39,030
Spy really looks like it wants to break
out. It's just struggling at that 850.

2400
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:39,040
out. It's just struggling at that 850.
 

2401
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:57,030
out. It's just struggling at that 850.
There must be some exposure there.

2402
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:57,040

 

2403
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,030

Control now down at 30. So that's you

2404
01:01:59,030 --> 01:01:59,040
Control now down at 30. So that's you
 

2405
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:04,630
Control now down at 30. So that's you
can use that as sentiment.

2406
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:04,640

 

2407
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,710

There's 30s. There's the tap. They just

2408
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:06,720
There's 30s. There's the tap. They just
 

2409
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,190
There's 30s. There's the tap. They just
tapped it in hell. There you go. So

2410
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:09,200
tapped it in hell. There you go. So
 

2411
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,710
tapped it in hell. There you go. So
literally just called it and they just

2412
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:10,720
literally just called it and they just
 

2413
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,190
literally just called it and they just
absorbed it there.

2414
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:13,200
absorbed it there.
 

2415
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,710
absorbed it there.
So buyers are sat at 30s right now.

2416
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:16,720
So buyers are sat at 30s right now.
 

2417
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,870
So buyers are sat at 30s right now.
Right here.

2418
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:18,880
Right here.
 

2419
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,230
Right here.
Came straight in and said, "No, we'll

2420
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:20,240
Came straight in and said, "No, we'll
 

2421
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,630
Came straight in and said, "No, we'll
gobble that up. We want to go higher."

2422
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:22,640
gobble that up. We want to go higher."
 

2423
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:28,150
gobble that up. We want to go higher."
So buy still trying to break out of 850.

2424
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:28,160

 

2425
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,750

Don't understand really why hasn't just

2426
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:29,760
Don't understand really why hasn't just
 

2427
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,270
Don't understand really why hasn't just
gone for it. Why isn't just absolutely

2428
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:31,280
gone for it. Why isn't just absolutely
 

2429
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,630
gone for it. Why isn't just absolutely
ripped faces at this point?

2430
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:34,640
ripped faces at this point?
 

2431
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,349
ripped faces at this point?
Got them caught. Just rip the faces. You

2432
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:37,359
Got them caught. Just rip the faces. You
 

2433
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:38,710
Got them caught. Just rip the faces. You
have them caught spy. What are you

2434
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:38,720
have them caught spy. What are you
 

2435
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:43,750
have them caught spy. What are you
doing?

2436
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:43,760

 

2437
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,789

Q's stuck at VW up. Back to point of

2438
01:02:46,789 --> 01:02:46,799
Q's stuck at VW up. Back to point of
 

2439
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:49,270
Q's stuck at VW up. Back to point of
control maybe here to these 30s again.

2440
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:49,280
control maybe here to these 30s again.
 

2441
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,349
control maybe here to these 30s again.
We do have big buy side delta there. So

2442
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:51,359
We do have big buy side delta there. So
 

2443
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:52,950
We do have big buy side delta there. So
everyone there has been a buyer at 30s.

2444
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:52,960
everyone there has been a buyer at 30s.
 

2445
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,349
everyone there has been a buyer at 30s.
If you flip under that then maybe you

2446
01:02:55,349 --> 01:02:55,359
If you flip under that then maybe you
 

2447
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,510
If you flip under that then maybe you
get exposure lower again. So this is

2448
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:57,520
get exposure lower again. So this is
 

2449
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,349
get exposure lower again. So this is
just the range rotation. So back to 30s

2450
01:02:59,349 --> 01:02:59,359
just the range rotation. So back to 30s
 

2451
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:00,710
just the range rotation. So back to 30s
we go again like we just talked about.

2452
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:00,720
we go again like we just talked about.
 

2453
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,150
we go again like we just talked about.
This is key. Now if we start flushing

2454
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:02,160
This is key. Now if we start flushing
 

2455
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,990
This is key. Now if we start flushing
this we can get really really heavy

2456
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:04,000
this we can get really really heavy
 

2457
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,589
this we can get really really heavy
because they've come in very very heavy

2458
01:03:05,589 --> 01:03:05,599
because they've come in very very heavy
 

2459
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:08,309
because they've come in very very heavy
by side here. So 30s is your level. They

2460
01:03:08,309 --> 01:03:08,319
by side here. So 30s is your level. They
 

2461
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:10,069
by side here. So 30s is your level. They
will need to absorb around these 30s

2462
01:03:10,069 --> 01:03:10,079
will need to absorb around these 30s
 

2463
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,589
will need to absorb around these 30s
these buyers otherwise they're going to

2464
01:03:11,589 --> 01:03:11,599
these buyers otherwise they're going to
 

2465
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:13,990
these buyers otherwise they're going to
get themselves caught by failing to

2466
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:14,000
get themselves caught by failing to
 

2467
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,430
get themselves caught by failing to
break out again.

2468
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:17,440
break out again.
 

2469
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,829
break out again.
Problem is the the rotation. This is why

2470
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:19,839
Problem is the the rotation. This is why
 

2471
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,029
Problem is the the rotation. This is why
I don't like it when some of you have

2472
01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:21,039
I don't like it when some of you have
 

2473

2575
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,510
It's amazing to me that we're even
holding on. This is what I mean by it's

2576
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:47,520
holding on. This is what I mean by it's
 

2577
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,630
holding on. This is what I mean by it's
a bit weird. I don't know if you can see

2578
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:48,640
a bit weird. I don't know if you can see
 

2579
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,870
a bit weird. I don't know if you can see
this. These are like what I would call B

2580
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:50,880
this. These are like what I would call B
 

2581
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,870
this. These are like what I would call B
and C list names in tech. They're all

2583
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,549
and C list names in tech. They're all
getting absolutely clobbered. Then we

2584
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:54,559
getting absolutely clobbered. Then we
 

2585
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,150
getting absolutely clobbered. Then we
come to here. Can you guys see this?

2586

2591
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,510
we're having big drive out, but we're
just holding on. Which is why I've been

2592
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:01,520
just holding on. Which is why I've been
 

2593
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,510
just holding on. Which is why I've been
so focused on the spiders and the gamma

2603
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:14,870
It's just the option traders. I don't
think it's anything else genuinely.

2609
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,150
Still can't hold its gains. Traded
straight back down to 50. If they don't

2610
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:20,160
straight back down to 50. If they don't
 

2611
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,829
straight back down to 50. If they don't
get a confirmed breakout soon, they are

2612
01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:21,839
get a confirmed breakout soon, they are
 

2613
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:23,990
get a confirmed breakout soon, they are
going to get absolutely whacked. Back to

2614
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:24,000
going to get absolutely whacked. Back to
 

2615
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,670
going to get absolutely whacked. Back to
point of control again. This is where

2616
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:25,680
point of control again. This is where
 

2617
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,670
point of control again. This is where
the biggest level traded again and it's

2618
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:27,680
the biggest level traded again and it's
 

2619
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,309
the biggest level traded again and it's
all buy side into 30s.

2620
01:06:30,309 --> 01:06:30,319
all buy side into 30s.
 

2621
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,150
all buy side into 30s.
So buyers will need to protect this. If

2622
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:32,160
So buyers will need to protect this. If
 

2623
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:39,670
So buyers will need to protect this. If
they sell under this is a big problem.

2624

gap. Gap fill on the VIX will be 1694.

2628
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:44,960
gap. Gap fill on the VIX will be 1694.
 

2629
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,069
gap. Gap fill on the VIX will be 1694.
So, I can't remember which one of you

2630
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:46,079
So, I can't remember which one of you
 

2631
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:47,430
So, I can't remember which one of you
said you were looking for 18s. And I was

2632
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:47,440
said you were looking for 18s. And I was
 

2633
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,190
said you were looking for 18s. And I was
like, why? Why? It doesn't need to go

2634
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:49,200
like, why? Why? It doesn't need to go
 

2635
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,670
like, why? Why? It doesn't need to go
there before FMC does it. 18s is very

2636
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:51,680
there before FMC does it. 18s is very
 

2637
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,430
there before FMC does it. 18s is very
high.

2638
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:53,440
high.
 

2639
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,390
high.
All right. If we're having a low

2640
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:54,400
All right. If we're having a low
 

2641
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,230
All right. If we're having a low
volatility day, we'll go low teens.

2642
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:56,240
volatility day, we'll go low teens.
 

2643
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:02,549
volatility day, we'll go low teens.
We're not going to go high teens.

2644
01:07:02,549 --> 01:07:02,559

 

2645
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,069

Yeah. Just bouncing between gamma walls.

2646
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:04,079
Yeah. Just bouncing between gamma walls.
 

2647
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,510
Yeah. Just bouncing between gamma walls.
Yeah, exactly. That's all we're doing.

2648
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:07,520
Yeah, exactly. That's all we're doing.
 

2649
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:26,309
Yeah, exactly. That's all we're doing.
Okay, back to these 30s again.

2650
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:26,319

 

2651
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:28,230

They lose this. We might test that value

2652
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:28,240
They lose this. We might test that value
 

2653
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:39,750
They lose this. We might test that value
area low at 600 609s.

2654
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:39,760

 

2655
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,309

if you lot trading this, you you got

2660
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:47,520
if you lot trading this, you you got
 

2661
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,109
if you lot trading this, you you got
balls of steel. I don't know what to

2662
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:49,119
balls of steel. I don't know what to
 

2663
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,789
balls of steel. I don't know what to
say. I don't know how you trade this

2664
01:07:50,789 --> 01:07:50,799
say. I don't know how you trade this
 

2665
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:53,190
say. I don't know how you trade this
chop. I don't know how you're even

2666
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:53,200
chop. I don't know how you're even
 

2667
01:07:53,200 --> 01:08:00,309
chop. I don't know how you're even
attracted to trade it either.

2668
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:00,319

 

2669
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:02,549

failed breakout on spy again over 650.

2670
01:08:02,549 --> 01:08:02,559
failed breakout on spy again over 650.
 

2671
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:05,029
failed breakout on spy again over 650.
That's starting to fail now.

2672
01:08:05,029 --> 01:08:05,039
That's starting to fail now.
 

2673
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,789
That's starting to fail now.
There's still absorption on this tape

2674
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:06,799
There's still absorption on this tape
 

2675
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,870
There's still absorption on this tape
here this morning. But uh if he gets out

2676
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:08,880
here this morning. But uh if he gets out
 

2677
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,990
here this morning. But uh if he gets out
the way because we've had a failed

2678
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:10,000
the way because we've had a failed
 

2679
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,270
the way because we've had a failed
breakout on the spy and we start to

2680
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:11,280
breakout on the spy and we start to
 

2681
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,470
breakout on the spy and we start to
roll, we're going to come back down to

2682
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:12,480
roll, we're going to come back down to
 

2683
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,710
roll, we're going to come back down to
fiero low which sort of 6, we just call

2684
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:14,720
fiero low which sort of 6, we just call
 

2685
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,390
fiero low which sort of 6, we just call
it 610.

2686
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:16,400
it 610.
 

2687
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,309
it 610.
And then if they get close below that,

2688
01:08:18,309 --> 01:08:18,319
And then if they get close below that,
 

2689
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:19,669
And then if they get close below that,
then they can look for low day and

2690
01:08:19,669 --> 01:08:19,679
then they can look for low day and
 

2691
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,709
then they can look for low day and
previous day lows. But uh that's kind of

2692
01:08:22,709 --> 01:08:22,719
previous day lows. But uh that's kind of
 

2693
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:33,510
previous day lows. But uh that's kind of
where we're at at the moment.

2694
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:33,520

 

2695
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,789

I will just remind you that uh at these

2696
01:08:36,789 --> 01:08:36,799
I will just remind you that uh at these
 

2697
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:39,030
I will just remind you that uh at these
levels sellers have had no success for

2698
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:39,040
levels sellers have had no success for
 

2699
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,349
levels sellers have had no success for
two weeks. I'm just going to remind you

2700
01:08:41,349 --> 01:08:41,359
two weeks. I'm just going to remind you
 

2701
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,749
two weeks. I'm just going to remind you
that while we're looking at this two

2702
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:43,759
that while we're looking at this two
 

2703
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:45,910
that while we're looking at this two
weeks, no success at these levels.

2704
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:45,920
weeks, no success at these levels.
 

2705
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:56,229
weeks, no success at these levels.
Anticipation of a Fed rate cut today.

2706
01:08:56,229 --> 01:08:56,239

 

2707
01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:58,709

Yeah, they check. It's so annoying and

2708
01:08:58,709 --> 01:08:58,719
Yeah, they check. It's so annoying and
 

2709
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,309
Yeah, they check. It's so annoying and
contorted. I don't like we were talking

2710
01:09:00,309 --> 01:09:00,319
contorted. I don't like we were talking
 

2711
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:02,149
contorted. I don't like we were talking
about it yesterday. I don't know why

2712
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:02,159
about it yesterday. I don't know why
 

2713
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:04,229
about it yesterday. I don't know why
they've done it. It's so dumb because

2714
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:04,239
they've done it. It's so dumb because
 

2715
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:07,430
they've done it. It's so dumb because
now I don't know who any of you are.

2716
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:07,440
now I don't know who any of you are.
 

2717
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,870
now I don't know who any of you are.
And it's not like they've given me an

2718
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:08,880
And it's not like they've given me an
 

2719
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,630
And it's not like they've given me an
option either. I've I've looked it up to

2720
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:10,640
option either. I've I've looked it up to
 

2721
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,990
option either. I've I've looked it up to
see if there's a setting I can change.

2722
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:12,000
see if there's a setting I can change.
 

2723
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:25,829
see if there's a setting I can change.
There isn't. So stupid. So so stupid.

2724
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:25,839

 

2725
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:29,510

Back to sleep we go then.

2726
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:29,520
Back to sleep we go then.
 

2727
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,030
Back to sleep we go then.
Look at this. [sighs and gasps] This is

2728
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:31,040
Look at this. [sighs and gasps] This is
 

2729
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:39,110
Look at this. [sighs and gasps] This is
what you're dealing with right now.

2730
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:39,120

 

2731
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,630

Seriously.

2732
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:42,640

 

2733
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,149

Cannot close above. Slow grind. Can't

2734
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:46,159
Cannot close above. Slow grind. Can't
 

2735
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:49,510
Cannot close above. Slow grind. Can't
close below. Where's the 82s? Here. So,

2736
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:49,520
close below. Where's the 82s? Here. So,
 

2737
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,229
close below. Where's the 82s? Here. So,
look below 82s. This is the gamma. Come

2738
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:52,239
look below 82s. This is the gamma. Come
 

2739
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:54,470
look below 82s. This is the gamma. Come
back up. The next level is up here at

2740
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:54,480
back up. The next level is up here at
 

2741
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,630
back up. The next level is up here at
85. So, I don't know what they're going

2742
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:56,640
85. So, I don't know what they're going
 

2743
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,149
85. So, I don't know what they're going
to do. Do they want to revisit here or

2744
01:09:58,149 --> 01:09:58,159
to do. Do they want to revisit here or
 

2745
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:01,510
to do. Do they want to revisit here or
revisit here? So, 50/50 right now. No

2746
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:01,520
revisit here? So, 50/50 right now. No
 

2747
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,350
revisit here? So, 50/50 right now. No
idea.

2748
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:03,360
idea.
 

2749
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,910
idea.
It's [\h__\h] stupid. This is This is

2750
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:05,920
It's [\h__\h] stupid. This is This is
 

2751
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,550
It's [\h__\h] stupid. This is This is
what we've been served for

2752
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:08,560
what we've been served for
 

2753
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,229
what we've been served for
as long as I can remember now.

2754
01:10:10,229 --> 01:10:10,239
as long as I can remember now.
 

2755
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:16,390
as long as I can remember now.
Basically, it's getting that long.

2756
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:16,400

 

2757
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,550

Yeah, totally. I agree, contorted. I

2758
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:18,560
Yeah, totally. I agree, contorted. I
 

2759
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,189
Yeah, totally. I agree, contorted. I
totally agree with you. It's I don't get

2760
01:10:21,189 --> 01:10:21,199
totally agree with you. It's I don't get
 

2761
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:22,950
totally agree with you. It's I don't get
why they did it. They did a trial

2762
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:22,960
why they did it. They did a trial
 

2763
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,950
why they did it. They did a trial
earlier in the year and then clearly no

2764
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:24,960
earlier in the year and then clearly no
 

2765
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,709
earlier in the year and then clearly no
one liked the trial because they put it

2766
01:10:26,709 --> 01:10:26,719
one liked the trial because they put it
 

2767
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:28,950
one liked the trial because they put it
back after two days and now it's back

2768
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:28,960
back after two days and now it's back
 

2769
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,510
back after two days and now it's back
again. It's like what? Like what are you

2770
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:31,520
again. It's like what? Like what are you
 

2771
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,189
again. It's like what? Like what are you
doing? No one liked it. That's why you

2772
01:10:33,189 --> 01:10:33,199
doing? No one liked it. That's why you
 

2773
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:34,310
doing? No one liked it. That's why you
got rid of it and now you've brought it

2774
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:34,320
got rid of it and now you've brought it
 

2775
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:38,229
got rid of it and now you've brought it
back again.

2776
01:10:38,229 --> 01:10:38,239

 

2777
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:40,709

Hey spy going to try again at these 50s.

2778
01:10:40,709 --> 01:10:40,719
Hey spy going to try again at these 50s.
 

2779
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:42,790
Hey spy going to try again at these 50s.
It's failed here one, two, three, four,

2780
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:42,800
It's failed here one, two, three, four,
 

2781
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,870
It's failed here one, two, three, four,
five, six times. Six fiveminute candles

2782
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:44,880
five, six times. Six fiveminute candles
 

2783
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:54,950
five, six times. Six fiveminute candles
have all failed here on the spy.

2784
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:54,960

 

2785
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,870

Can we get back inside previous day's

2786
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:56,880
Can we get back inside previous day's
 

2787
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,510
Can we get back inside previous day's
value? That's current value. Area high

2788
01:10:59,510 --> 01:10:59,520
value? That's current value. Area high
 

2789
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,030
value? That's current value. Area high
is basically previous day's value. We

2790
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:01,040
is basically previous day's value. We
 

2791
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,189
is basically previous day's value. We
cannot get acceptance higher. We cannot

2792
01:11:03,189 --> 01:11:03,199
cannot get acceptance higher. We cannot
 

2793
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,189
cannot get acceptance higher. We cannot
get acceptance lower. Which means we're

2794
01:11:05,189 --> 01:11:05,199
get acceptance lower. Which means we're
 

2795
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:22,709
get acceptance lower. Which means we're
just going to do a whole lot of nothing.

2796
01:11:22,709 --> 01:11:22,719

 

2797
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:24,070

at this point. They've done so much

2798
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:24,080
at this point. They've done so much
 

2799
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,149
at this point. They've done so much
work. They should just go back inside

2800
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:26,159
work. They should just go back inside
 

2801
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:28,790
work. They should just go back inside
value, but they just can't.

2802
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:28,800
value, but they just can't.
 

2803
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,870
value, but they just can't.
They can't They can't get They can't get

2804
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:30,880
They can't They can't get They can't get
 

2805
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,990
They can't They can't get They can't get
over 50 and they can't get get below 620

2806
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:34,000
over 50 and they can't get get below 620
 

2807
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,750
over 50 and they can't get get below 620
or 600. Like we've talked about numerous

2808
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:35,760
or 600. Like we've talked about numerous
 

2809
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:40,630
or 600. Like we've talked about numerous
times. You got 50 points to play with.

2810
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:40,640

 

2811
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,550

Do I not use real orderflow instead of

2812
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:42,560
Do I not use real orderflow instead of
 

2813
01:11:42,560 --> 01:12:06,149
Do I not use real orderflow instead of
trading view? Yes, I do.

2814
01:12:06,149 --> 01:12:06,159

 

2815
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:09,030

Spy trying again. failing again. Sellers

2816
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:09,040
Spy trying again. failing again. Sellers
 

2817
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:21,510
Spy trying again. failing again. Sellers
just caught got caught again at 30s.

2818
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:21,520

 

2819
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,350

Buyers again can't get through 50s. Once

2820
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:23,360
Buyers again can't get through 50s. Once
 

2821
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,030
Buyers again can't get through 50s. Once
they break 50s, there's probably a run

2822
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:25,040
they break 50s, there's probably a run
 

2823
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,070
they break 50s, there's probably a run
straight up to these levels up here.

2824
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:28,080
straight up to these levels up here.
 

2825
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,750
straight up to these levels up here.
Once they break 50s, oh, sorry, I've got

2826
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:29,760
Once they break 50s, oh, sorry, I've got
 

2827
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:34,070
Once they break 50s, oh, sorry, I've got
you on this still. My bad.

2828
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:34,080
you on this still. My bad.
 

2829
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,709
you on this still. My bad.
Once they break 50s here, then there's

2830
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:36,719
Once they break 50s here, then there's
 

2831
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,630
Once they break 50s here, then there's
probably a run up potentially close the

2832
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:38,640
probably a run up potentially close the
 

2833
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:44,630
probably a run up potentially close the
gap at 700s if they can get going.

2834
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:44,640

 

2835
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,630

I don't know cap. Yeah, I'm not I'm not

2836
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:46,640
I don't know cap. Yeah, I'm not I'm not
 

2837
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,270
I don't know cap. Yeah, I'm not I'm not
sure. There's value area low, right?

2838
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:49,280
sure. There's value area low, right?
 

2839
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,870
sure. There's value area low, right?
Let's see if they get acceptance now. If

2840
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:50,880
Let's see if they get acceptance now. If
 

2841
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,390
Let's see if they get acceptance now. If
they do, then you're looking for a drive

2842
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:52,400
they do, then you're looking for a drive
 

2843
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,630
they do, then you're looking for a drive
up into 700. So, you got 50 points

2844
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:54,640
up into 700. So, you got 50 points
 

2845
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,630
up into 700. So, you got 50 points
expansion here. If they can get

2846
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:56,640
expansion here. If they can get
 

2847
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,550
expansion here. If they can get
acceptance over this level, they have to

2848
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:58,560
acceptance over this level, they have to
 

2849
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,030
acceptance over this level, they have to
find acceptance over it. If they don't,

2850
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:01,040
find acceptance over it. If they don't,
 

2851
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,390
find acceptance over it. If they don't,
then you're going to go straight back

2852
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:02,400
then you're going to go straight back
 

2853
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,990
then you're going to go straight back
down. You're testing that same with spy.

2854
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:04,000
down. You're testing that same with spy.
 

2855
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,590
down. You're testing that same with spy.
Looks awful. They're testing the same

2856
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:05,600
Looks awful. They're testing the same
 

2857
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,030
Looks awful. They're testing the same
level. You can go straight back down.

2858
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:07,040
level. You can go straight back down.
 

2859
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,630
level. You can go straight back down.
Buyers just got trapped up there again

2860
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:08,640
Buyers just got trapped up there again
 

2861
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,990
Buyers just got trapped up there again
trying to trade through it. This looks

2862
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:10,000
trying to trade through it. This looks
 

2863
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,550
trying to trade through it. This looks
terrible like a failed breakout to me.

2864
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:12,560
terrible like a failed breakout to me.
 

2865
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,149
terrible like a failed breakout to me.
But, you know, who knows? This is moving

2866
01:13:14,149 --> 01:13:14,159
But, you know, who knows? This is moving
 

2867
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:15,669
But, you know, who knows? This is moving
very, very quickly one side to the

2868
01:13:15,669 --> 01:13:15,679
very, very quickly one side to the
 

2869
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:19,990
very, very quickly one side to the
other.

2870
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:20,000

 

2871
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,830

This looks terrible. This looks like a

2872
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:21,840
This looks terrible. This looks like a
 

2873
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,030
This looks terrible. This looks like a
fail breakout.

2874
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:25,040
fail breakout.
 

2875
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,510
fail breakout.
So, back down to point of control on the

2876
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:27,520
So, back down to point of control on the
 

2877
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,510
So, back down to point of control on the
day, which is 30s again. If they absorb

2878
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:29,520
day, which is 30s again. If they absorb
 

2879
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,870
day, which is 30s again. If they absorb
here, they try and go back up. You get

2880
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:30,880
here, they try and go back up. You get
 

2881
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,030
here, they try and go back up. You get
my point? Like your range, there's no

2882
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:33,040
my point? Like your range, there's no
 

2883
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,590
my point? Like your range, there's no
range here to play. There's nothing to

2884
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:35,600
range here to play. There's nothing to
 

2885
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,030
range here to play. There's nothing to
play with. That's a failed breakout

2886
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:37,040
play with. That's a failed breakout
 

2887
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,270
play with. That's a failed breakout
through value. So, they tried to get

2888
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:39,280
through value. So, they tried to get
 

2889
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,270
through value. So, they tried to get
above here. They did all this work,

2890
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:41,280
above here. They did all this work,
 

2891
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,790
above here. They did all this work,
didn't get confirmation. They come

2892
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:42,800
didn't get confirmation. They come
 

2893
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,910
didn't get confirmation. They come
straight down to here. If they lose

2894
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:43,920
straight down to here. If they lose
 

2895
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,030
straight down to here. If they lose
this, they come down to here. So,

2896
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:45,040
this, they come down to here. So,
 

2897
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,790
this, they come down to here. So,
there's a rotation between here, there's

2898
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:46,800
there's a rotation between here, there's
 

2899
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,630
there's a rotation between here, there's
a rotation between here, and there's a

2900
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:48,640
a rotation between here, and there's a
 

2901
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,229
a rotation between here, and there's a
potential rotation between here. Those

2902
01:13:50,229 --> 01:13:50,239
potential rotation between here. Those
 

2903
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:54,149
potential rotation between here. Those
are the levels on the charts right now.

2904
01:13:54,149 --> 01:13:54,159
are the levels on the charts right now.
 

2905
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:56,070
are the levels on the charts right now.
Right? If you like rotation, you like

2906
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:56,080
Right? If you like rotation, you like
 

2907
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,149
Right? If you like rotation, you like
playing for 10 20 points, then this is

2908
01:13:58,149 --> 01:13:58,159
playing for 10 20 points, then this is
 

2909
01:13:58,159 --> 01:13:59,669
playing for 10 20 points, then this is
your market. This is your market where

2910
01:13:59,669 --> 01:13:59,679
your market. This is your market where
 

2911
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:03,750
your market. This is your market where
you can clean up.

2912
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:03,760

 

2913
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,510

That is my idea of hell. I'll be honest.

2914
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:07,520
That is my idea of hell. I'll be honest.
 

2915
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,421
That is my idea of hell. I'll be honest.
Oh, and up we might go again then.

2916
01:14:11,421 --> 01:14:11,431
Oh, and up we might go again then.
 

2917
01:14:11,431 --> 01:14:16,070
Oh, and up we might go again then.
[laughter]

2918
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:16,080

 

2919
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,390

You guys are brave if you like this.

2920
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:18,400
You guys are brave if you like this.
 

2921
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,229
You guys are brave if you like this.
Yeah, exactly. Everything's flat. Like

2922
01:14:20,229 --> 01:14:20,239
Yeah, exactly. Everything's flat. Like
 

2923
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:23,030
Yeah, exactly. Everything's flat. Like
this is a no trade. Look guys, this is

2924
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:23,040
this is a no trade. Look guys, this is
 

2925
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,950
this is a no trade. Look guys, this is
this is why we use profile, right?

2926
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:24,960
this is why we use profile, right?
 

2927
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,350
this is why we use profile, right?
That's your range. This is what you're

2928
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:27,360
That's your range. This is what you're
 

2929
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,590
That's your range. This is what you're
trading. That's your maximum range right

2930
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:29,600
trading. That's your maximum range right
 

2931
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,590
trading. That's your maximum range right
now. That,

2932
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:31,600
now. That,
 

2933
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,110
now. That,
right? Be able to look at the charts and

2934
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:33,120
right? Be able to look at the charts and
 

2935
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,590
right? Be able to look at the charts and
be like, am I interested in trading from

2936
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:35,600
be like, am I interested in trading from
 

2937
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,310
be like, am I interested in trading from
50s to 15s? Cuz that's all it's telling

2938
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:38,320
50s to 15s? Cuz that's all it's telling
 

2939
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,270
50s to 15s? Cuz that's all it's telling
me at the moment that is available. That

2940
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:41,280
me at the moment that is available. That
 

2941
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,270
me at the moment that is available. That
can change, but at this moment,

2942
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:43,280
can change, but at this moment,
 

2943
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,550
can change, but at this moment,
remember, you can only trade what's in

2944
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:44,560
remember, you can only trade what's in
 

2945
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:49,830
remember, you can only trade what's in
front of you now, not what you hope.

2946
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:49,840

 

2947
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,110

acceptance, a drive above with volume

2948
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:53,120
acceptance, a drive above with volume
 

2949
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:57,669
acceptance, a drive above with volume
and a hold, right? Not that that is not

2950
01:14:57,669 --> 01:14:57,679
and a hold, right? Not that that is not
 

2951
01:14:57,679 --> 01:14:59,270
and a hold, right? Not that that is not
acceptance. That is a clear rejection.

2952
01:14:59,270 --> 01:14:59,280
acceptance. That is a clear rejection.
 

2953
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,350
acceptance. That is a clear rejection.
If we come into it and we have trapped

2954
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:01,360
If we come into it and we have trapped
 

2955
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,750
If we come into it and we have trapped
buyers in here and we fail this blue

2956
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:03,760
buyers in here and we fail this blue
 

2957
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,510
buyers in here and we fail this blue
level and we come straight back down to

2958
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:05,520
level and we come straight back down to
 

2959
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,430
level and we come straight back down to
point of control, that's not acceptance.

2960
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:07,440
point of control, that's not acceptance.
 

2961
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,709
point of control, that's not acceptance.
So, this is the like I just talked

2962
01:15:08,709 --> 01:15:08,719
So, this is the like I just talked
 

2963
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:10,709
So, this is the like I just talked
about. There's the rotation. Failed,

2964
01:15:10,709 --> 01:15:10,719
about. There's the rotation. Failed,
 

2965
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,630
about. There's the rotation. Failed,
failed, failed, failed, failed, failed.

2966
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:14,640
failed, failed, failed, failed, failed.
 

2967
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,870
failed, failed, failed, failed, failed.
You need to see this or you need to see

2968
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:16,880
You need to see this or you need to see
 

2969
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,270
You need to see this or you need to see
this. this. If you're playing edge to

2970
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:19,280
this. this. If you're playing edge to
 

2971
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:25,510
this. this. If you're playing edge to
edge, that's your edge.

2972
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:25,520

 

2973
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,830

Like a tap into something doesn't mean

2974
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:27,840
Like a tap into something doesn't mean
 

2975
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,830
Like a tap into something doesn't mean
we're going higher, does it?

2976
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:31,840
we're going higher, does it?
 

2977
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,669
we're going higher, does it?
If we get above it and we pull back and

2978
01:15:33,669 --> 01:15:33,679
If we get above it and we pull back and
 

2979
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:37,030
If we get above it and we pull back and
we hold it, that's a good sign, but not

2980
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:37,040
we hold it, that's a good sign, but not
 

2981
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,310
we hold it, that's a good sign, but not
if we can't do that. Again, they've just

2982
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:38,320
if we can't do that. Again, they've just
 

2983
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,590
if we can't do that. Again, they've just
trapped buyers up there again. They've

2984
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:39,600
trapped buyers up there again. They've
 

2985
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,149
trapped buyers up there again. They've
just run up to 55. It's all buy side and

2986
01:15:42,149 --> 01:15:42,159
just run up to 55. It's all buy side and
 

2987
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:43,270
just run up to 55. It's all buy side and
we haven't moved higher, which means

2988
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:43,280
we haven't moved higher, which means
 

2989
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,950
we haven't moved higher, which means
there's a passive seller up here. They

2990
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:44,960
there's a passive seller up here. They
 

2991
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,630
there's a passive seller up here. They
need to now hold. If they don't hold,

2992
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:46,640
need to now hold. If they don't hold,
 

2993
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,830
need to now hold. If they don't hold,
they're going to get themselves caught

2994
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:47,840
they're going to get themselves caught
 

2995
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,189
they're going to get themselves caught
like I've talked about numerous times

2996
01:15:49,189 --> 01:15:49,199
like I've talked about numerous times
 

2997
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:50,950
like I've talked about numerous times
today.

2998
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:50,960
today.
 

2999
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,550
today.
They need to drive higher now because

3000
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:52,560
They need to drive higher now because
 

3001
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,790
They need to drive higher now because
they've come heavy in by side again.

3002
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:54,800
they've come heavy in by side again.
 

3003
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,470
they've come heavy in by side again.
They came in heavy and buy side up there

3004
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:56,480
They came in heavy and buy side up there
 

3005
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:02,709
They came in heavy and buy side up there
into 55s

3006
01:16:02,709 --> 01:16:02,719

 

3007
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:05,030

failed again.

3008
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:05,040
failed again.
 

3009
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,189
failed again.
You get the point here folks. Are you

3010
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:07,199
You get the point here folks. Are you
 

3011
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:09,270
You get the point here folks. Are you
seeing acceptance over that blue line,

3012
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:09,280
seeing acceptance over that blue line,
 

3013
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,630
seeing acceptance over that blue line,
this horizontal line on your chart? No.

3014
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:12,640
this horizontal line on your chart? No.
 

3015
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,390
this horizontal line on your chart? No.
Are you seeing acceptance over current

3016
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:14,400
Are you seeing acceptance over current
 

3017
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,470
Are you seeing acceptance over current
value? Remember this is previous day,

3018
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:18,480
value? Remember this is previous day,
 

3019
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,550
value? Remember this is previous day,
previous day. Oh my god. Come on,

3020
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:20,560
previous day. Oh my god. Come on,
 

3021
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,110
previous day. Oh my god. Come on,
Trading View. This is previous day. This

3022
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:23,120
Trading View. This is previous day. This
 

3023
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,910
Trading View. This is previous day. This
is current day. Is price above current

3024
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:25,920
is current day. Is price above current
 

3025
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:29,510
is current day. Is price above current
day? No. Is price above previous day?

3026
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:29,520
day? No. Is price above previous day?
 

3027
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,750
day? No. Is price above previous day?
No. So, what are we likely to do? We're

3028
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:31,760
No. So, what are we likely to do? We're
 

3029
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,590
No. So, what are we likely to do? We're
likely to just keep doing this. And at

3030
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:33,600
likely to just keep doing this. And at
 

3031
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,950
likely to just keep doing this. And at
the moment, there's your point control.

3032
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:34,960
the moment, there's your point control.
 

3033
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,030
the moment, there's your point control.
So, this. And if we fail this, probably

3034
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:37,040
So, this. And if we fail this, probably
 

3035
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,189
So, this. And if we fail this, probably
maybe this. And if we fail this, maybe

3036
01:16:39,189 --> 01:16:39,199
maybe this. And if we fail this, maybe
 

3037
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:42,070
maybe this. And if we fail this, maybe
this. If we're going to base above, they

3038
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:42,080
this. If we're going to base above, they
 

3039
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,830
this. If we're going to base above, they
need to squeeze out. They need to hold a

3040
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:43,840
need to squeeze out. They need to hold a
 

3041
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,189
need to squeeze out. They need to hold a
print here. And you got to remember you

3042
01:16:45,189 --> 01:16:45,199
print here. And you got to remember you
 

3043
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:47,030
print here. And you got to remember you
got trap buyers here. And if they get

3044
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:47,040
got trap buyers here. And if they get
 

3045
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,430
got trap buyers here. And if they get
lucky and they use their stops, we can

3046
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:49,440
lucky and they use their stops, we can
 

3047
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,270
lucky and they use their stops, we can
come up here. That is the maximum move

3048
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:51,280
come up here. That is the maximum move
 

3049
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,630
come up here. That is the maximum move
I'd be looking for at the moment would

3050
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:52,640
I'd be looking for at the moment would
 

3051
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,950
I'd be looking for at the moment would
be 700. But it would have to get above

3052
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:54,960
be 700. But it would have to get above
 

3053
01:16:54,960 --> 01:17:00,229
be 700. But it would have to get above
this and find acceptance.

3054
01:17:00,229 --> 01:17:00,239

 

3055
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:02,149

Thanks, Contorted.

3056
01:17:02,149 --> 01:17:02,159
Thanks, Contorted.
 

3057
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,709
Thanks, Contorted.
Like I said, those buyers came in 652

3058
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:04,719
Like I said, those buyers came in 652
 

3059
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:08,470
Like I said, those buyers came in 652
and above and they failed uh again. I

3060
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:08,480
and above and they failed uh again. I
 

3061
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,390
and above and they failed uh again. I
should just say again. They failed

3062
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:10,400
should just say again. They failed
 

3063
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,790
should just say again. They failed
again.

3064
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:12,800
again.
 

3065
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,270
again.
Spy at 650. It's barely moving the spy.

3066
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:15,280
Spy at 650. It's barely moving the spy.
 

3067
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:31,270
Spy at 650. It's barely moving the spy.
It is barely moving.

3068
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:31,280

 

3069
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,830

Totally. I totally agree. And it's not

3070
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:33,840
Totally. I totally agree. And it's not
 

3071
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,189
Totally. I totally agree. And it's not
just today. Remember we talked about it

3072
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:35,199
just today. Remember we talked about it
 

3073
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:37,270
just today. Remember we talked about it
pre-market like zoom out on the daily.

3074
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:37,280
pre-market like zoom out on the daily.
 

3075
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,709
pre-market like zoom out on the daily.
How many inside days are there? This is

3076
01:17:38,709 --> 01:17:38,719
How many inside days are there? This is
 

3077
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:40,149
How many inside days are there? This is
why I got so animated yesterday when

3078
01:17:40,149 --> 01:17:40,159
why I got so animated yesterday when
 

3079
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:42,550
why I got so animated yesterday when
someone's like, "It's a clear trend."

3080
01:17:42,550 --> 01:17:42,560
someone's like, "It's a clear trend."
 

3081
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,070
someone's like, "It's a clear trend."
Do you understand the definition of a

3082
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:44,080
Do you understand the definition of a
 

3083
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,430
Do you understand the definition of a
trend?

3084
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:47,440

 

3085
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,910

I [snorts] get annoyed because

I [snorts] get annoyed because
 

3087
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,669
I [snorts] get annoyed because
saying things like that when we're at

3088
01:17:51,669 --> 01:17:51,679
saying things like that when we're at

expecting like we're going to get a big

3092
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:56,800
expecting like we're going to get a big
 

3093

move and it had another 30 points before

3094
01:17:58,630 --> 01:17:58,640
move and it had another 30 points before
 

3095
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,790
move and it had another 30 points before
it failed. And that's why I get

3096
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:00,800
it failed. And that's why I get
 

3097
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,310
it failed. And that's why I get
frustrated. It's like if you're going to

3098
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:02,320
frustrated. It's like if you're going to
 

3099
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,550
frustrated. It's like if you're going to
call something, you better be have some

3100
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:04,560
call something, you better be have some

call something, you better be have some
good thesis or or know that you're

01:18:06,149 --> 01:18:06,159
good thesis or or know that you're
 

3103
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:07,750
good thesis or or know that you're
right. Otherwise, there are new people

3104
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:07,760
right. Otherwise, there are new people
 

3105
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,669
right. Otherwise, there are new people
here. I remember being a new person

3106
01:18:09,669 --> 01:18:09,679
here. I remember being a new person
 

3107
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:12,790
here. I remember being a new person
many, many years ago, following

3108
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:12,800
many, many years ago, following
 

3109
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,070
many, many years ago, following
people into trades that didn't know what

3110
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:14,080
people into trades that didn't know what
 

3111
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,030
people into trades that didn't know what
they were talking about and getting

3112
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:15,040
they were talking about and getting
 

3113
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,470
they were talking about and getting
stuck. And that's the last thing I want

3114
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:16,480
stuck. And that's the last thing I want
 

3115
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:17,990
stuck. And that's the last thing I want
you guys to do. I want you guys to

3116
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:18,000
you guys to do. I want you guys to
 

3117
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,830
you guys to do. I want you guys to
understand the conditions. Right?

3118
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:19,840
understand the conditions. Right?
 

3119
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:20,950
understand the conditions. Right?
Sellers are trying again here.

3120
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:20,960
Sellers are trying again here.
 

3121
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,630
Sellers are trying again here.
Currently, sellers are stuck at 45s

3122
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:22,640
Currently, sellers are stuck at 45s
 

3123
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:23,990
Currently, sellers are stuck at 45s
again. So, they just came piling in

3124
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:24,000
again. So, they just came piling in
 

3125
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,590
again. So, they just came piling in
there. We're not moving lower. There's a

3126
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:25,600
there. We're not moving lower. There's a
 

3127
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,030
there. We're not moving lower. There's a
passive buyer here at the moment. Let's

3128
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:27,040
passive buyer here at the moment. Let's
 

3129
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,870
passive buyer here at the moment. Let's
see if they come right back down to 30s

3130
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:28,880
see if they come right back down to 30s
 

3131
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,270
see if they come right back down to 30s
point control.

3132
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:31,280
point control.
 

3133
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,910
point control.
Yeah, I use IB levels. And we've got

3134
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:33,920
Yeah, I use IB levels. And we've got
 

3135
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,510
Yeah, I use IB levels. And we've got
another five minutes left until initial

3136
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:35,520
another five minutes left until initial
 

3137
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,550
another five minutes left until initial
balance is set.

3138
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:38,560
balance is set.
 

3139
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,669
balance is set.
Absolutely. If you want to look for

3140
01:18:39,669 --> 01:18:39,679
Absolutely. If you want to look for
 

3141
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:41,910
Absolutely. If you want to look for
auction, failed auction, IB levels, you

3142
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:41,920
auction, failed auction, IB levels, you
 

3143
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:47,830
auction, failed auction, IB levels, you
can use

3144
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:47,840

 

3145
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,510

point control here. If we fail point of

3146
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:49,520
point control here. If we fail point of
 

3147
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,830
point control here. If we fail point of
control, we probably come to 14s. If we

3148
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:51,840
control, we probably come to 14s. If we
 

3149
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,430
control, we probably come to 14s. If we
hold in front of point control, we're

3150
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:53,440
hold in front of point control, we're
 

3151
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:54,630
hold in front of point control, we're
going to retest this. And that's all

3152
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:54,640
going to retest this. And that's all
 

3153
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:55,990
going to retest this. And that's all
we're going to do. Back and forth, back

3154
01:18:55,990 --> 01:18:56,000
we're going to do. Back and forth, back
 

3155
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,229
we're going to do. Back and forth, back
and forth, back and forth.

3156
01:19:00,229 --> 01:19:00,239

 

3157
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:02,149

I agree, Mo. That's why I'm not trading

3158
01:19:02,149 --> 01:19:02,159
I agree, Mo. That's why I'm not trading
 

3159
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:03,270
I agree, Mo. That's why I'm not trading
it.

3160
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:03,280
it.
 

3161
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,270
it.
If we come outside of RA, if for any

3162
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:05,280
If we come outside of RA, if for any
 

3163
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,030
If we come outside of RA, if for any
reason they want to go risk on or risk

3164
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:07,040
reason they want to go risk on or risk
 

3165
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,149
reason they want to go risk on or risk
off before FOMC, I'm all ears for it.

3166
01:19:10,149 --> 01:19:10,159
off before FOMC, I'm all ears for it.
 

3167
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:12,950
off before FOMC, I'm all ears for it.
Like I'm here for it. But if we're going

3168
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:12,960
Like I'm here for it. But if we're going
 

3169
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,630
Like I'm here for it. But if we're going
to just keep doing what we're doing, uh

3170
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:14,640
to just keep doing what we're doing, uh
 

3171
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:24,070
to just keep doing what we're doing, uh
I'm not really interested.

3172
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:24,080

 

3173
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,870

How do I use initial balance? I use it

3174
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:26,880
How do I use initial balance? I use it
 

3175
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,189
How do I use initial balance? I use it
well, there's confluence to to dictate

3176
01:19:29,189 --> 01:19:29,199
well, there's confluence to to dictate
 

3177
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:30,950
well, there's confluence to to dictate
what is a trend day and what is not a

3178
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:30,960
what is a trend day and what is not a
 

3179
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,189
what is a trend day and what is not a
trend day. what is a potential auction

3180
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:33,199
trend day. what is a potential auction
 

3181
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:35,669
trend day. what is a potential auction
and what is a failed auction. Right? So,

3182
01:19:35,669 --> 01:19:35,679
and what is a failed auction. Right? So,
 

3183
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,870
and what is a failed auction. Right? So,
it's no different to what we've just

3184
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:36,880
it's no different to what we've just
 

3185
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,390
it's no different to what we've just
seen here. If you imagine initial

3186
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:38,400
seen here. If you imagine initial
 

3187
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,030
seen here. If you imagine initial
balance high is here and let's just say

3188
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:41,040
balance high is here and let's just say
 

3189
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,430
balance high is here and let's just say
initial balance low is here. Right?

3190
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:43,440
initial balance low is here. Right?
 

3191
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,950
initial balance low is here. Right?
Let's just say that's what we had this

3192
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:44,960
Let's just say that's what we had this
 

3193
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,550
Let's just say that's what we had this
morning. Forget I know we don't because

3194
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:46,560
morning. Forget I know we don't because
 

3195
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,229
morning. Forget I know we don't because
that's not the times. That is a look

3196
01:19:48,229 --> 01:19:48,239
that's not the times. That is a look
 

3197
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:49,990
that's not the times. That is a look
below and fail. Right? So, we're going

3198
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:50,000
below and fail. Right? So, we're going
 

3199
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,590
below and fail. Right? So, we're going
to go to the other side of the auction.

3200
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:51,600
to go to the other side of the auction.
 

3201
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,270
to go to the other side of the auction.
That is a look above and fail to the

3202
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:53,280
That is a look above and fail to the
 

3203
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,630
That is a look above and fail to the
other side of the auction. To the other

3204
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:54,640
other side of the auction. To the other
 

3205
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,630
other side of the auction. To the other
side of the auction. This is the key

3206
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:56,640
side of the auction. This is the key
 

3207
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:57,990
side of the auction. This is the key
level. Now, like we just talked about,

3208
01:19:57,990 --> 01:19:58,000
level. Now, like we just talked about,
 

3209
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,430
level. Now, like we just talked about,
if we fail point of control, we're

3210
01:19:59,430 --> 01:19:59,440
if we fail point of control, we're
 

3211
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,790
if we fail point of control, we're
probably going to test 15. And if we

3212
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:00,800
probably going to test 15. And if we
 

3213
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,550
probably going to test 15. And if we
fail 15, we're going to come to previous

3214
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:02,560
fail 15, we're going to come to previous
 

3215
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:03,990
fail 15, we're going to come to previous
week's point of control. It's just

3216
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:04,000
week's point of control. It's just
 

3217
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,430
week's point of control. It's just
auction theory. It works the same way.

3218
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:05,440
auction theory. It works the same way.
 

3219
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,390
auction theory. It works the same way.
It doesn't matter what you're looking

3220
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:06,400
It doesn't matter what you're looking
 

3221
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,149
It doesn't matter what you're looking
at, whether it's an orb or initial

3222
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:08,159
at, whether it's an orb or initial
 

3223
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:11,189
at, whether it's an orb or initial
balance or profile. It's all about the

3224
01:20:11,189 --> 01:20:11,199
balance or profile. It's all about the
 

3225
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:13,189
balance or profile. It's all about the
auction. Who's stuck? Where are they

3226
01:20:13,189 --> 01:20:13,199
auction. Who's stuck? Where are they
 

3227
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:16,070
auction. Who's stuck? Where are they
stuck?

3228
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:16,080
stuck?
 

3229
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:20,070
stuck?
I don't use premarket P sigma. Um, that

3230
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:20,080
I don't use premarket P sigma. Um, that
 

3231
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,830
I don't use premarket P sigma. Um, that
doesn't mean you shouldn't use it. I

3232
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:21,840
doesn't mean you shouldn't use it. I
 

3233
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,149
doesn't mean you shouldn't use it. I
just don't use it. I I don't pay any

3234
01:20:24,149 --> 01:20:24,159
just don't use it. I I don't pay any
 

3235
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:25,510
just don't use it. I I don't pay any
attention to the volume created

3236
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:25,520
attention to the volume created
 

3237
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,390
attention to the volume created
pre-market unless there's been a decent

3238
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:28,400
pre-market unless there's been a decent
 

3239
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,229
pre-market unless there's been a decent
move and I think there's an edge to

3240
01:20:30,229 --> 01:20:30,239
move and I think there's an edge to
 

3241
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:31,590
move and I think there's an edge to
play, but that doesn't mean you

3242
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:31,600
play, but that doesn't mean you
 

3243
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,430
play, but that doesn't mean you
shouldn't use it. It's just my personal

3244
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:33,440
shouldn't use it. It's just my personal
 

3245
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:38,229
shouldn't use it. It's just my personal
thing. I don't really use it.

3246
01:20:38,229 --> 01:20:38,239

 

3247
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:49,430

This is volume. This is delta.

3248
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:49,440

 

3249
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,430

So rather than cumulative delta, this is

3250
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:51,440
So rather than cumulative delta, this is
 

3251
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,990
So rather than cumulative delta, this is
delta each candle. All right. So you can

3252
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:54,000
delta each candle. All right. So you can
 

3253
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,590
delta each candle. All right. So you can
see at the low, we had strong delta and

3254
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:55,600
see at the low, we had strong delta and
 

3255
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,430
see at the low, we had strong delta and
we flipped, went straight by, had

3256
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:57,440
we flipped, went straight by, had
 

3257
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,229
we flipped, went straight by, had
straight back up.

3258
01:21:00,229 --> 01:21:00,239
straight back up.
 

3259
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:02,630
straight back up.
Okay, so we're at these sort of 30s

3260
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:02,640
Okay, so we're at these sort of 30s
 

3261
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:03,990
Okay, so we're at these sort of 30s
again. This point of control on the

3262
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:04,000
again. This point of control on the
 

3263
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,510
again. This point of control on the
current day. If we wash here, we're

3264
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:05,520
current day. If we wash here, we're
 

3265
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,110
current day. If we wash here, we're
going to test value on the day, which is

3266
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:07,120
going to test value on the day, which is
 

3267
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,110
going to test value on the day, which is
14. If we wash 14, we're going to test

3268
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:09,120
14. If we wash 14, we're going to test
 

3269
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,630
14. If we wash 14, we're going to test
previous week point of control, which is

3270
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:10,640
previous week point of control, which is
 

3271
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,350
previous week point of control, which is
600. SPY has definitely done a failed

3272
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:13,360
600. SPY has definitely done a failed
 

3273
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,030
600. SPY has definitely done a failed
breakout, but it's back to VWAP again.

3274
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:15,040
breakout, but it's back to VWAP again.
 

3275
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,270
breakout, but it's back to VWAP again.
ES back to VWOP as well. Q's relative

3276
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:17,280
ES back to VWOP as well. Q's relative
 

3277
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:21,990
ES back to VWOP as well. Q's relative
weakness on the day.

3278
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:22,000

 

3279
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,070

VIX has found a bid in front of those

3280
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:24,080
VIX has found a bid in front of those
 

3281
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,669
VIX has found a bid in front of those
17s we talked about. So, in that demand

3282
01:21:25,669 --> 01:21:25,679
17s we talked about. So, in that demand
 

3283
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:27,350
17s we talked about. So, in that demand
block we drew out this morning, VIX has

3284
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:27,360
block we drew out this morning, VIX has
 

3285
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,630
block we drew out this morning, VIX has
found a bid. It's going to come up and

3286
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:28,640
found a bid. It's going to come up and
 

3287
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,950
found a bid. It's going to come up and
test 1720 now on the VIX, which is

3288
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:30,960
test 1720 now on the VIX, which is
 

3289
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,350
test 1720 now on the VIX, which is
previous day high. If we fail that,

3290
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:33,360
previous day high. If we fail that,
 

3291
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,149
previous day high. If we fail that,
market can get relief and move um back

3292
01:21:36,149 --> 01:21:36,159
market can get relief and move um back
 

3293
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:39,350
market can get relief and move um back
up. If we rip through 1720 on the VIX,

3294
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:39,360
up. If we rip through 1720 on the VIX,
 

3295
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,189
up. If we rip through 1720 on the VIX,
you might see some weakness coming to

3296
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:41,199
you might see some weakness coming to
 

3297
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:42,870
you might see some weakness coming to
the market. Right now, we're just in

3298
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:42,880
the market. Right now, we're just in
 

3299
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,630
the market. Right now, we're just in
balance.

3300
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:46,640

 

3301
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:49,189

Am I leaning towards a rate cut? Yeah.

3302
01:21:49,189 --> 01:21:49,199
Am I leaning towards a rate cut? Yeah.
 

3303
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:52,550
Am I leaning towards a rate cut? Yeah.
Like 100 million% is priced in. 95%

3304
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:52,560
Like 100 million% is priced in. 95%
 

3305
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,990
Like 100 million% is priced in. 95%
chance we're getting a quarter rate

3306
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:54,000
chance we're getting a quarter rate
 

3307
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,229
chance we're getting a quarter rate
quarter base point cut is priced in. In

3308
01:21:56,229 --> 01:21:56,239
quarter base point cut is priced in. In
 

3309
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:58,229
quarter base point cut is priced in. In
my opinion, we already know that there's

3310
01:21:58,229 --> 01:21:58,239
my opinion, we already know that there's
 

3311
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:00,149
my opinion, we already know that there's
a reason,

3312
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:00,159
a reason,
 

3313
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:02,629
a reason,
right? Let's let's just make sure we all

3314
01:22:02,629 --> 01:22:02,639
right? Let's let's just make sure we all
 

3315
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:04,709
right? Let's let's just make sure we all
understand this.

3316
01:22:04,709 --> 01:22:04,719
understand this.
 

3317
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:07,430
understand this.
when we were here, right? When we were

3318
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:07,440
when we were here, right? When we were
 

3319
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:10,550
when we were here, right? When we were
at these levels, this was the last FOMC.

3320
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:10,560
at these levels, this was the last FOMC.
 

3321
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,110
at these levels, this was the last FOMC.
Remember that. This was the last FOMC.

3322
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:13,120
Remember that. This was the last FOMC.
 

3323
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,950
Remember that. This was the last FOMC.
Don't forget that. The old highs is the

3324
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:14,960
Don't forget that. The old highs is the
 

3325
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,750
Don't forget that. The old highs is the
last FOMC. When we were here, we were

3326
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:17,760
last FOMC. When we were here, we were
 

3327
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,229
last FOMC. When we were here, we were
expecting the rate cut. We was we were

3328
01:22:20,229 --> 01:22:20,239
expecting the rate cut. We was we were
 

3329
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:21,669
expecting the rate cut. We was we were
saying, "Oh, we're going to get a cut in

3330
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:21,679
saying, "Oh, we're going to get a cut in
 

3331
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:22,870
saying, "Oh, we're going to get a cut in
December and then maybe we're going to

3332
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:22,880
December and then maybe we're going to
 

3333
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,790
December and then maybe we're going to
get one in January." And then Pal went,

3334
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:24,800
get one in January." And then Pal went,
 

3335
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,550
get one in January." And then Pal went,
"Um, well, I wouldn't be so sure you're

3336
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:26,560
"Um, well, I wouldn't be so sure you're
 

3337
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,550
"Um, well, I wouldn't be so sure you're
actually going to get one in December."

3338
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:28,560
actually going to get one in December."
 

3339
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,470
actually going to get one in December."
Right down here. And then they were

3340
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:30,480
Right down here. And then they were
 

3341
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,870
Right down here. And then they were
like, "Oh, [\h__\h] Well, we've hurt the

3342
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:32,880
like, "Oh, [\h__\h] Well, we've hurt the
 

3343
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,470
like, "Oh, [\h__\h] Well, we've hurt the
market here." And then what what's said

3344
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:34,480
market here." And then what what's said
 

3345
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,030
market here." And then what what's said
by Fed members here? Oh, we're

3346
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:37,040
by Fed members here? Oh, we're
 

3347
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,870
by Fed members here? Oh, we're
definitely getting at least a quarter

3348
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:38,880
definitely getting at least a quarter
 

3349
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,990
definitely getting at least a quarter
point cut here. Like 100%. Oh, we price

3350
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:42,000
point cut here. Like 100%. Oh, we price
 

3351
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,510
point cut here. Like 100%. Oh, we price
it in. We go straight back to where we

3352
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:43,520
it in. We go straight back to where we
 

3353
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,189
it in. We go straight back to where we
thought that before. All right.

3354
01:22:45,189 --> 01:22:45,199
thought that before. All right.
 

3355
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,590
thought that before. All right.
Remember, we price in ahead of time.

3356
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:47,600
Remember, we price in ahead of time.
 

3357
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,910
Remember, we price in ahead of time.
That's not to say that on a rate cut

3358
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:49,920
That's not to say that on a rate cut
 

3359
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,350
That's not to say that on a rate cut
decision, we don't go higher. That would

3360
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:51,360
decision, we don't go higher. That would
 

3361
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,149
decision, we don't go higher. That would
be a raid of liquidity. But for me, it's

3362
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:54,159
be a raid of liquidity. But for me, it's
 

3363
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:56,629
be a raid of liquidity. But for me, it's
priced in. This was pricing it out. This

3364
01:22:56,629 --> 01:22:56,639
priced in. This was pricing it out. This
 

3365
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,310
priced in. This was pricing it out. This
was pricing it back in. If you go and

3366
01:22:58,310 --> 01:22:58,320
was pricing it back in. If you go and
 

3367
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,149
was pricing it back in. If you go and
look at the timings when pal said we're

3368
01:23:00,149 --> 01:23:00,159
look at the timings when pal said we're
 

3369
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:02,629
look at the timings when pal said we're
no longer we don't guarantee a December

3370
01:23:02,629 --> 01:23:02,639
no longer we don't guarantee a December
 

3371
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:04,870
no longer we don't guarantee a December
cut that's what caused this move the

3372
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:04,880
cut that's what caused this move the
 

3373
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,550
cut that's what caused this move the
moment then he said well I don't think

3374
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:06,560
moment then he said well I don't think
 

3375
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,070
moment then he said well I don't think
it was him it's Besset and some others

3376
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:08,080
it was him it's Besset and some others
 

3377
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,350
it was him it's Besset and some others
yeah yeah we're going to have to do a

3378
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:09,360
yeah yeah we're going to have to do a
 

3379
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,430
yeah yeah we're going to have to do a
cut we came to here like I said this

3380
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:11,440
cut we came to here like I said this
 

3381
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,950
cut we came to here like I said this
morning in a pre-market show I'm not

3382
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:12,960
morning in a pre-market show I'm not
 

3383
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,709
morning in a pre-market show I'm not
worried about the cut I'm more

3384
01:23:14,709 --> 01:23:14,719
worried about the cut I'm more
 

3385
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:15,910
worried about the cut I'm more
interested in what they say about the

3386
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:15,920

01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:19,280

the cut's

3398
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:27,600
the cut's
 

3399
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,350
the cut's
What we don't know is the January cut.

3400
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:29,360
What we don't know is the January cut.
 

3401
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:31,750
What we don't know is the January cut.
January cut is much less likely. I think

3402
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:31,760
January cut is much less likely. I think
 

3403
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:34,470
January cut is much less likely. I think
like 30% chance at the moment or

3404
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:34,480
like 30% chance at the moment or
 

3405
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,750
like 30% chance at the moment or
something is what's priced in.

3406
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:37,760
something is what's priced in.
 

3407
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:40,390
something is what's priced in.
Correct. I don't know whoever said that.

3408
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:40,400
Correct. I don't know whoever said that.

3425
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:07,430
it's been uploaded. My web developer is
just doing some finishing touches. Um,

3426
01:24:07,430 --> 01:24:07,440
just doing some finishing touches. Um,
 

3427
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,950
just doing some finishing touches. Um,
the only thing I haven't been able to do

3428
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:08,960
the only thing I haven't been able to do
 

3429
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,750
the only thing I haven't been able to do
is I want to record a trend day using

3430
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:11,760
is I want to record a trend day using
 

3431
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,070
is I want to record a trend day using
orderflow and um, we haven't had one.

3432
01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:14,080
orderflow and um, we haven't had one.
 

3433
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,990
orderflow and um, we haven't had one.
So,

3434
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:16,000
So,
 

3435
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,990
So,
it's kind of what I'm waiting for. So

3436
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:18,000
it's kind of what I'm waiting for. So
 

3437
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,990
it's kind of what I'm waiting for. So
hopefully [laughter] hopefully we can go

3438
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:20,000
hopefully [laughter] hopefully we can go
 

3439
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,750
hopefully [laughter] hopefully we can go
into a pro trend this week or something

3440
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:21,760
into a pro trend this week or something
 

3441
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,229
into a pro trend this week or something
at some point and then I can record that

3442
01:24:24,229 --> 01:24:24,239
at some point and then I can record that
 

3443
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:25,669
at some point and then I can record that
because at the moment all I've been able

3444
01:24:25,669 --> 01:24:25,679
because at the moment all I've been able
 

3445
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:28,790
because at the moment all I've been able
to record using old flow is rotational

3446
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:28,800
to record using old flow is rotational
 

3447
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:37,430
to record using old flow is rotational
markets but I can't force it.

3448
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:37,440

 

3449
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:41,270

the new course uh $3.99. It's going to

3450
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:41,280
the new course uh $3.99. It's going to
 

3451
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,030
the new course uh $3.99. It's going to
be considerably cheaper if you're

3452
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:43,040
be considerably cheaper if you're
 

3453

01:26:52,709 --> 01:26:52,719
Maybe. Okay. Can we get below that?
 

3541
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:55,030
Maybe. Okay. Can we get below that?
Maybe no. Can we get above that? No. Can

3542
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:55,040
Maybe no. Can we get above that? No. Can
 

3543
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,229
Maybe no. Can we get above that? No. Can
we get Do you see what I'm saying? And

3544
01:26:56,229 --> 01:26:56,239
we get Do you see what I'm saying? And
 

3545
01:26:56,239 --> 01:26:57,590
we get Do you see what I'm saying? And
then it would go, okay, let's try this

3546
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:57,600
then it would go, okay, let's try this
 

3547
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,470
then it would go, okay, let's try this
one. Okay, let's try this one. Okay, no

3548
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:00,480
one. Okay, let's try this one. Okay, no
 

3549
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,709
one. Okay, let's try this one. Okay, no
acceptance. Straight back up, for

3550
01:27:02,709 --> 01:27:02,719
acceptance. Straight back up, for
 

3551
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:06,229
acceptance. Straight back up, for
example.

3552
01:27:06,229 --> 01:27:06,239

 

3553
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,310

It's just a rotation, right? Very

3554
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:08,320
It's just a rotation, right? Very
 

3555
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:09,910
It's just a rotation, right? Very
different to a trend. A trend would just

3556
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:09,920
different to a trend. A trend would just
 

3557
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:12,629
different to a trend. A trend would just
be absorbing and absorbing and absorbing

3558
01:27:12,629 --> 01:27:12,639
be absorbing and absorbing and absorbing
 

3559
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:15,590
be absorbing and absorbing and absorbing
to move higher or move in one direction.

3560
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:15,600
to move higher or move in one direction.
 

3561
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,270
to move higher or move in one direction.
We're creating liquidity right now.

3562
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:17,280
We're creating liquidity right now.
 

3563
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,550
We're creating liquidity right now.
Yeah, ping pong. That's a really good

3564
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:18,560
Yeah, ping pong. That's a really good
 

3565
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:21,350
Yeah, ping pong. That's a really good
way of putting it actually. Ping pong.

3566
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:21,360
way of putting it actually. Ping pong.
 

3567
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,950
way of putting it actually. Ping pong.
Here we go. So, value low about to be

3568
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:22,960
Here we go. So, value low about to be
 

3569
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:26,149
Here we go. So, value low about to be
tested. 7:15 we just talked about 7:15

3570
01:27:26,149 --> 01:27:26,159
tested. 7:15 we just talked about 7:15
 

3571
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:28,950
tested. 7:15 we just talked about 7:15
615. This edge of this blue right here,

3572
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:28,960
615. This edge of this blue right here,
 

3573
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,310
615. This edge of this blue right here,
this is what we're testing now. If we

3574
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:30,320
this is what we're testing now. If we
 

3575
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,310
this is what we're testing now. If we
fail that, probably back down to this

3576
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:32,320
fail that, probably back down to this
 

3577
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,390
fail that, probably back down to this
600. Okay. So, here we go. This is also

3578
01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:34,400
600. Okay. So, here we go. This is also
 

3579
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,229
600. Okay. So, here we go. This is also
the New York open becomes important. But

3580
01:27:36,229 --> 01:27:36,239
the New York open becomes important. But
 

3581
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,229
the New York open becomes important. But
also down to 600 is now possible. So, if

3582
01:27:38,229 --> 01:27:38,239
also down to 600 is now possible. So, if
 

3583
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:40,629
also down to 600 is now possible. So, if
they fail this New York open, then

3584
01:27:40,629 --> 01:27:40,639
they fail this New York open, then
 

3585
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:42,149
they fail this New York open, then
previously point of control. So, if you

3586
01:27:42,149 --> 01:27:42,159
previously point of control. So, if you
 

3587
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:44,229
previously point of control. So, if you
are short here or short up here, here is

3588
01:27:44,229 --> 01:27:44,239
are short here or short up here, here is
 

3589
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:45,750
are short here or short up here, here is
a cover point one. This would be a cover

3590
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:45,760
a cover point one. This would be a cover
 

3591
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,910
a cover point one. This would be a cover
point two. If you fail this previous day

3592
01:27:47,910 --> 01:27:47,920
point two. If you fail this previous day
 

3593
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,070
point two. If you fail this previous day
low, current day's low. And if you fail

3594
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:50,080
low, current day's low. And if you fail
 

3595
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:53,189
low, current day's low. And if you fail
that uh previous

3596
01:27:53,189 --> 01:27:53,199
that uh previous
 

3597
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:55,590
that uh previous
weak value area low, if you get value

3598
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:55,600
weak value area low, if you get value
 

3599
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,030
weak value area low, if you get value
area high, if you get really lucky, we

3600
01:27:57,030 --> 01:27:57,040
area high, if you get really lucky, we
 

3601
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,709
area high, if you get really lucky, we
come down to here if you get very very

3602
01:27:58,709 --> 01:27:58,719
come down to here if you get very very
 

3603
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:01,590
come down to here if you get very very
lucky. I would doubt it, but uh you get

3604
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:01,600
lucky. I would doubt it, but uh you get
 

3605
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,950
lucky. I would doubt it, but uh you get
very very lucky.

3606
01:28:04,950 --> 01:28:04,960
very very lucky.
 

3607
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,870
very very lucky.
So there's the 600 test like we talked

3608
01:28:06,870 --> 01:28:06,880
So there's the 600 test like we talked
 

3609
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:10,070
So there's the 600 test like we talked
about. Okay, so now the ping pong can be

3610
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:10,080
about. Okay, so now the ping pong can be
 

3611
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:13,110
about. Okay, so now the ping pong can be
between 615 and 600 this level. And if

3612
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:13,120
between 615 and 600 this level. And if
 

3613
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:18,790
between 615 and 600 this level. And if
we fail that low day.

3614
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:18,800

 

3615
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,110

Yeah, exactly. Adam, Americans won't get

3616
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,120
Yeah, exactly. Adam, Americans won't get
 

3617
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,896
Yeah, exactly. Adam, Americans won't get
that. To me, to you. To me, to you.

3618
01:28:24,896 --> 01:28:24,906
that. To me, to you. To me, to you.
 

3619
01:28:24,906 --> 01:28:25,430
that. To me, to you. To me, to you.
[laughter]

3620
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:25,440
[laughter]
 

3621
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:28,790
[laughter]
Reminds me of being a kid.

3622
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:28,800
Reminds me of being a kid.
 

3623
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:33,750
Reminds me of being a kid.
Reminds me of being a kid.

3624
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:33,760

 

3625
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,669

Okay. So, now what's going to matter is

3626
01:28:35,669 --> 01:28:35,679
Okay. So, now what's going to matter is
 

3627
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:39,110
Okay. So, now what's going to matter is
these value area lows on the day. Right.

3628
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:39,120
these value area lows on the day. Right.
 

3629
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,550
these value area lows on the day. Right.
So, we've gone to point control again.

3630
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:40,560
So, we've gone to point control again.
 

3631
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:41,990
So, we've gone to point control again.
We might come up here and revisit this

3632
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:42,000
We might come up here and revisit this
 

3633
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,149
We might come up here and revisit this
sort of level again. And how we at there

3634
01:28:44,149 --> 01:28:44,159
sort of level again. And how we at there
 

3635
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:46,550
sort of level again. And how we at there
will become important.

3636
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:46,560
will become important.
 

3637
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,070
will become important.
And these 600s, remember we've talked

3638
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:48,080
And these 600s, remember we've talked
 

3639
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:53,910
And these 600s, remember we've talked
about over and over again.

3640
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:53,920

 

3641
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,590

Heavy selling here, but will they get

3642
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:55,600
Heavy selling here, but will they get
 

3643
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,350
Heavy selling here, but will they get
their way? Will they get low of day,

3644
01:28:57,350 --> 01:28:57,360
their way? Will they get low of day,
 

3645
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,709
their way? Will they get low of day,
which is probably what they're trying to

3646
01:28:58,709 --> 01:28:58,719
which is probably what they're trying to
 

3647
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:00,629
which is probably what they're trying to
get, but uh I'm not convinced in this

3648
01:29:00,629 --> 01:29:00,639
get, but uh I'm not convinced in this
 

3649
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:07,350
get, but uh I'm not convinced in this
market they're going to get their way.

3650
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:07,360

 

3651
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,189

Bids here at 80, bids here at 70.

3652
01:29:09,189 --> 01:29:09,199
Bids here at 80, bids here at 70.
 

3653
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:11,189
Bids here at 80, bids here at 70.
They're they're walking down. I still

3654
01:29:11,189 --> 01:29:11,199
They're they're walking down. I still
 

3655
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:13,030
They're they're walking down. I still
think this needs to pop back up to 15s

3656
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:13,040
think this needs to pop back up to 15s
 

3657
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,629
think this needs to pop back up to 15s
to test that value area low at the

3658
01:29:14,629 --> 01:29:14,639
to test that value area low at the
 

3659
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:24,070
to test that value area low at the
moment.

3660
01:29:24,070 --> 01:29:24,080

 

3661
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,470

No, it's from uh it's from Chuckle

3662
01:29:26,470 --> 01:29:26,480
No, it's from uh it's from Chuckle
 

3663
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,629
No, it's from uh it's from Chuckle
Brothers. Skippy the Bush Kangaroo. That

3664
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:28,639
Brothers. Skippy the Bush Kangaroo. That
 

3665
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:31,110
Brothers. Skippy the Bush Kangaroo. That
was that Australian thing. I I haven't

3666
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:31,120
was that Australian thing. I I haven't
 

3667
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,629
was that Australian thing. I I haven't
heard anyone talk about that since I was

3668
01:29:32,629 --> 01:29:32,639
heard anyone talk about that since I was
 

3669
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:34,229
heard anyone talk about that since I was
like 5 years old. All right, there's the

3670
01:29:34,229 --> 01:29:34,239
like 5 years old. All right, there's the
 

3671
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:36,149
like 5 years old. All right, there's the
600 test again. All right, so if we

3672
01:29:36,149 --> 01:29:36,159
600 test again. All right, so if we
 

3673
01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:37,830
600 test again. All right, so if we
flush here, then initial balance low,

3674
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:37,840
flush here, then initial balance low,
 

3675
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,430
flush here, then initial balance low,
previous day low, and if we get an

3676
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:39,440
previous day low, and if we get an
 

3677
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,870
previous day low, and if we get an
auction lower today, then you can watch

3678
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:40,880
auction lower today, then you can watch
 

3679
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,990
auction lower today, then you can watch
these levels down here into 500s.

3680
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:44,000
these levels down here into 500s.
 

3681
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,350
these levels down here into 500s.
So, we are starting to see some heavy

3682
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:45,360
So, we are starting to see some heavy
 

3683
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,990
So, we are starting to see some heavy
action. Spy failing that that uh 850

3684
01:29:47,990 --> 01:29:48,000
action. Spy failing that that uh 850
 

3685
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:53,189
action. Spy failing that that uh 850
numerous times. Um spy. ES uh spy back

3686
01:29:53,189 --> 01:29:53,199
numerous times. Um spy. ES uh spy back
 

3687
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:54,790
numerous times. Um spy. ES uh spy back
to 82s. Remember this is gamma level

3688
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:54,800
to 82s. Remember this is gamma level
 

3689
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,790
to 82s. Remember this is gamma level
into 82s. Be aware of that. We're into a

3690
01:29:56,790 --> 01:29:56,800

3691
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,830
into 82s. Be aware of that. We're into a
gamma level of 82s. If they hold this,

3692
01:29:59,830 --> 01:29:59,840
gamma level of 82s. If they hold this,
 

3693
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,270
gamma level of 82s. If they hold this,
you want to be careful. But if they drop

3694
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:01,280
you want to be careful. But if they drop
 

3695
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,270
you want to be careful. But if they drop
this then move to 80 is possible based

3696
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:03,280
this then move to 80 is possible based
 

3697
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:05,350
this then move to 80 is possible based
on gamma. Here we go. Previous day low

3698
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:05,360
on gamma. Here we go. Previous day low
 

3699
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,229
on gamma. Here we go. Previous day low
and initial balance low. Now clear

3700
01:30:08,229 --> 01:30:08,239
and initial balance low. Now clear
 

3701
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:09,910
and initial balance low. Now clear
targets down here. Right. This is where

3702
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:09,920
targets down here. Right. This is where
 

3703
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,430
targets down here. Right. This is where
we absorbed earlier. But I kind of

3704
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:11,440
we absorbed earlier. But I kind of
 

3705
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,870
we absorbed earlier. But I kind of
expect this to get taken now. I've been

3706
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:12,880
expect this to get taken now. I've been
 

3707
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,950
expect this to get taken now. I've been
here so many times and if we crack

3708
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:14,960
here so many times and if we crack
 

3709
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,390
here so many times and if we crack
violently then these are your next

3710
01:30:16,390 --> 01:30:16,400
violently then these are your next
 

3711
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:23,669
violently then these are your next
levels if we're going to see expansion

3712
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:23,679

 

3713
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:25,350

550 on the book. There's an old

3714
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:25,360
550 on the book. There's an old
 

3715
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:29,669
550 on the book. There's an old
imbalance down there at 550.

3716
01:30:29,669 --> 01:30:29,679

 

3717
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:37,189

Are we going to trade into him?

3718
01:30:37,189 --> 01:30:37,199

 

3719
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:39,189

IB low coming up. Previous day low just

3720
01:30:39,189 --> 01:30:39,199
IB low coming up. Previous day low just
 

3721
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:42,629
IB low coming up. Previous day low just
beneath that. Under that we've got room

3722
01:30:42,629 --> 01:30:42,639
beneath that. Under that we've got room
 

3723
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:44,870
beneath that. Under that we've got room
Watch this spy at 82s. We've traded

3724
01:30:44,870 --> 01:30:44,880
Watch this spy at 82s. We've traded
 

3725
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,390
Watch this spy at 82s. We've traded
under it. Now, if they trade back to it

3726
01:30:46,390 --> 01:30:46,400
under it. Now, if they trade back to it
 

3727
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,910
under it. Now, if they trade back to it
and reject it, there's a move to lower

3728
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:47,920
and reject it, there's a move to lower
 

3729
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,470
and reject it, there's a move to lower
day and then possibly to 680. I wouldn't

3730
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:50,480
day and then possibly to 680. I wouldn't
 

3731
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,950
day and then possibly to 680. I wouldn't
bank on it because we're technically

3732
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:52,960
bank on it because we're technically
 

3733
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:54,790
bank on it because we're technically
still in a rotational market, but we

3734
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:54,800
still in a rotational market, but we
 

3735
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:57,990
still in a rotational market, but we
have a chance to expand lower if sellers

3736
01:30:57,990 --> 01:30:58,000
have a chance to expand lower if sellers
 

3737
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,229
have a chance to expand lower if sellers
take control. It's a big old if, but

3738
01:31:00,229 --> 01:31:00,239
take control. It's a big old if, but
 

3739
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:10,310
take control. It's a big old if, but
that's the if.

3740
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:10,320

 

3741
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,229

So, IBL your target. If you've already

3742
01:31:12,229 --> 01:31:12,239
So, IBL your target. If you've already
 

3743
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:13,510
So, IBL your target. If you've already
been short in this, then you want to be

3744
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:13,520
been short in this, then you want to be
 

3745
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:18,070
been short in this, then you want to be
covering some here for sure.

3746
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:18,080

 

3747
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,990

You send me indicator Gmail, but

3748
01:31:19,990 --> 01:31:20,000
You send me indicator Gmail, but
 

3749
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,990
You send me indicator Gmail, but
nothing's working. Then you probably

3750
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:22,000
nothing's working. Then you probably
 

3751
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,590
nothing's working. Then you probably
either sent me your wrong name

3752
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:25,600
either sent me your wrong name
 

3753
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,910
either sent me your wrong name

Won't be my end. Be you putting in your

Won't be my end. Be you putting in your

Won't be my end. Be you putting in your
wrong Trading View name or something.

3760
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:01,440

 

3761
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,350

I still think we probably sweep, but we

3762
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:03,360
I still think we probably sweep, but we
 

3763
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:04,550
I still think we probably sweep, but we
might might need a push up to test

3764
01:32:04,550 --> 01:32:04,560
might might need a push up to test
 

3765
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,350
might might need a push up to test
first. We will see. They're offering f

3766
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:07,360
first. We will see. They're offering f
 

3767
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:08,950
first. We will see. They're offering f
they're like bidding at 550. So, I

3768
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:08,960
they're like bidding at 550. So, I
 

3769
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,950
they're like bidding at 550. So, I
expect the market to flush through 70

3770
01:32:10,950 --> 01:32:10,960
expect the market to flush through 70
 

3771
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:14,390
expect the market to flush through 70
6560 5550 to fill these players. But

3772
01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:14,400
6560 5550 to fill these players. But
 

3773
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,550
6560 5550 to fill these players. But
it's just whether it needs a retest of

3774
01:32:16,550 --> 01:32:16,560
it's just whether it needs a retest of
 

3775
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:20,310
it's just whether it needs a retest of
610 615s first.

3776
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:20,320
610 615s first.
 

3777
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,590
610 615s first.
Doesn't look that way though at the

3778
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:21,600
Doesn't look that way though at the
 

3779
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:25,350
Doesn't look that way though at the
moment.

3780
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:25,360

 

3781
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,270

And I would watch those 82s on spy.

3782
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:27,280
And I would watch those 82s on spy.
 

3783
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:28,629
And I would watch those 82s on spy.
We're coming back up for a back test of

01:32:28,629 --> 01:32:28,639
We're coming back up for a back test of
 

3785
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:31,030
We're coming back up for a back test of
82s now.

3786
01:32:31,030 --> 01:32:31,040
82s now.
 

3787
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,110
82s now.
Here it comes. Here's the 82s on spy.

3788
01:32:33,110 --> 01:32:33,120
Here it comes. Here's the 82s on spy.
 

3789
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,390
Here it comes. Here's the 82s on spy.
They reclaim this. We're going straight

3790
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:34,400
They reclaim this. We're going straight
 

3791
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:35,910
They reclaim this. We're going straight
back upside. It just means a dip into

3792
01:32:35,910 --> 01:32:35,920
back upside. It just means a dip into
 

3793
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:43,910
back upside. It just means a dip into
gamma and then straight back upside.

3794
01:32:43,910 --> 01:32:43,920

 

3795
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,750

They're starting to try and reclaim this

3796
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:45,760
They're starting to try and reclaim this
 

3797

They're starting to try and reclaim this
fiveminute candles dropped under it

3798
01:32:47,189 --> 01:32:47,199
fiveminute candles dropped under it
 

3799
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:48,709
fiveminute candles dropped under it
again. So, two 5-minute candles have

3800
01:32:48,709 --> 01:32:48,719
again. So, two 5-minute candles have
 

3801
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:51,030
again. So, two 5-minute candles have
come under 82 and reclaimed. How are we

3802
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:51,040
come under 82 and reclaimed. How are we
 

3803
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,470
come under 82 and reclaimed. How are we
going to close here? 10 seconds left in

3804
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:52,480
going to close here? 10 seconds left in
 

3805
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,830
going to close here? 10 seconds left in
this 5 minute. I want to see if we close

3806
01:32:53,830 --> 01:32:53,840
this 5 minute. I want to see if we close
 

3807
01:32:53,840 --> 01:33:02,950
this 5 minute. I want to see if we close
heavy.

3808
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:02,960

 

3809
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,239

Closed right at 82.

3810
01:33:05,239 --> 01:33:05,249
Closed right at 82.

Like on the money spy. Uh I'm going to

get just a quick refill of my coffee

3816
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:11,840
get just a quick refill of my coffee
 

3817
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:38,470
get just a quick refill of my coffee
here. Look below here.

3818
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:38,480

 

3819
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:39,990

look for lower here. Here we go. So,

3820
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:40,000
look for lower here. Here we go. So,
 

3821
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,189
look for lower here. Here we go. So,
there's your IB low. That's your TP1.

3822
01:33:43,189 --> 01:33:43,199
there's your IB low. That's your TP1.
 

3823
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:45,194
there's your IB low. That's your TP1.
Next level is that previous day low.

3824
01:33:45,194 --> 01:33:45,204
Next level is that previous day low.
 

3825
01:33:45,204 --> 01:33:46,550
Next level is that previous day low.

Sellers got caught down there underneath

3828
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:48,080
Sellers got caught down there underneath
 

3829
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:49,430
Sellers got caught down there underneath
initial balance low. They definitely

3830
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:49,440
initial balance low. They definitely
 

3831
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,590
initial balance low. They definitely
triggered some sellers under 66. All

3832
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:51,600
triggered some sellers under 66. All
 

3833
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,189
triggered some sellers under 66. All
right. So, just be aware at the bottom

3834
01:33:53,189 --> 01:33:53,199
right. So, just be aware at the bottom
 

3835
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:54,470
right. So, just be aware at the bottom
of this candle. There are some sellers

3836
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:54,480
of this candle. There are some sellers
 

3837
01:33:54,480 --> 01:34:03,110

3839
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,430

back testing 82s again. It's definitely

3840
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:05,440
back testing 82s again. It's definitely
 

3841
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:07,510
back testing 82s again. It's definitely
that is the level on spy. That's your

3842
01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:07,520
that is the level on spy. That's your
 

3843
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:16,629
that is the level on spy. That's your

01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:18,390

Yeah, totally agree Sigma. There's a

01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:18,400
Yeah, totally agree Sigma. There's a
 

3847
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,830
Yeah, totally agree Sigma. There's a
seller down there underneath 66. He sold

3848
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:21,840
seller down there underneath 66. He sold
 

3849
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,990
seller down there underneath 66. He sold
665065

3850
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:24,000
665065
 

3851
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,149
665065
this guy here as well. 135 lot and then

3852
01:34:26,149 --> 01:34:26,159
this guy here as well. 135 lot and then
 

3853
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:28,790
this guy here as well. 135 lot and then
a 200 lot right at the low of day. So if

3854
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:28,800
a 200 lot right at the low of day. So if
 

3855
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,390
a 200 lot right at the low of day. So if
this is the end of the auction then the

3856
01:34:30,390 --> 01:34:30,400
this is the end of the auction then the
 

3857
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:33,189
this is the end of the auction then the
last seller sold. But we will see won't

3858
01:34:33,189 --> 01:34:33,199
last seller sold. But we will see won't
 

3859
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:40,470
last seller sold. But we will see won't
we'll see.

3860
01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:40,480

 

3861
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:43,110

82's test here on spy. They're through

3862
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:43,120
82's test here on spy. They're through
 

3863
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:45,189
82's test here on spy. They're through
it. It's just depends how we close on a

3864
01:34:45,189 --> 01:34:45,199
it. It's just depends how we close on a
 

3865
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:46,709
it. It's just depends how we close on a
fivem minutee bar I'd say. and we can

3866
01:34:46,709 --> 01:34:46,719
fivem minutee bar I'd say. and we can
 

3867
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:48,870
fivem minutee bar I'd say. and we can
still afford remember a retest of 608

3868
01:34:48,870 --> 01:34:48,880
still afford remember a retest of 608
 

3869
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:51,590
still afford remember a retest of 608
610 somewhere up there into this value

3870
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:51,600
610 somewhere up there into this value
 

3871
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,189
610 somewhere up there into this value
into previous week point of control. We

3872
01:34:53,189 --> 01:34:53,199
into previous week point of control. We
 

3873
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:54,550
into previous week point of control. We
haven't retested anything. So if they're

3874
01:34:54,550 --> 01:34:54,560
haven't retested anything. So if they're
 

3875
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,229
haven't retested anything. So if they're
going to build out liquidity, they're

3876
01:34:56,229 --> 01:34:56,239
going to build out liquidity, they're
 

3877
01:34:56,239 --> 01:34:57,590
going to build out liquidity, they're
going to build it out here. If they want

3878
01:34:57,590 --> 01:34:57,600
going to build it out here. If they want
 

3879
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,590
going to build it out here. If they want
to build that out for this move, they're

3880
01:34:59,590 --> 01:34:59,600
to build that out for this move, they're
 

3881
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,030
to build that out for this move, they're
going to build it out into here and use

3882
01:35:01,030 --> 01:35:01,040
going to build it out into here and use
 

3883
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,550
going to build it out into here and use
these stops to do it. If it's a failed

3884
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:02,560
these stops to do it. If it's a failed
 

3885
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:03,990
these stops to do it. If it's a failed
break, then they'll do this, this, this,

3886
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:04,000
break, then they'll do this, this, this,
 

3887
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,910
break, then they'll do this, this, this,
and this. And if they reclaim this, then

3888
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:05,920
and this. And if they reclaim this, then
 

3889
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:09,430
and this. And if they reclaim this, then
guess what? You know where we're going.

3890
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:09,440
guess what? You know where we're going.
 

3891
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:10,709
guess what? You know where we're going.
Remember, level to level, level to

3892
01:35:10,709 --> 01:35:10,719
Remember, level to level, level to
 

3893
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:12,709
Remember, level to level, level to

level, level to level. It's all we're
 

3895
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:14,870
level, level to level. It's all we're
doing. come and back test this level now

3896
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:14,880
doing. come and back test this level now
 

3897
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:22,229
doing. come and back test this level now
and see if the sellers are up there.

3898
01:35:22,229 --> 01:35:22,239

 

3899
01:35:22,239 --> 01:35:24,149

625.

3902
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:27,440

 

3903
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,750

Okay, back through. Here we go. Here's

3904
01:35:29,750 --> 01:35:29,760
Okay, back through. Here we go. Here's
 

3905
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:32,149
Okay, back through. Here we go. Here's
the previous week point of control test.

3906
01:35:32,149 --> 01:35:32,159
the previous week point of control test.
 

3907
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:34,149
the previous week point of control test.
Now, this and value will become key. I'd

3908
01:35:34,149 --> 01:35:34,159
Now, this and value will become key. I'd
 

3909
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:37,189
Now, this and value will become key. I'd
say from here to sort of 610

3910
01:35:37,189 --> 01:35:37,199
say from here to sort of 610
 

3911
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:39,030
say from here to sort of 610
sellers will need to sell against,

3912
01:35:39,030 --> 01:35:39,040
sellers will need to sell against,
 

3913
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,189
sellers will need to sell against,
right? To to force the market lower. If

3914
01:35:41,189 --> 01:35:41,199
right? To to force the market lower. If
 

3915
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:43,030
right? To to force the market lower. If
they don't, we can come straight back up

3916
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:43,040
they don't, we can come straight back up
 

3917
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:45,510
they don't, we can come straight back up
to 20 because we're thin all the way up

3918
01:35:45,510 --> 01:35:45,520
to 20 because we're thin all the way up
 

3919
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,750
to 20 because we're thin all the way up
into here, aren't we? So, sellers need

3920
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:47,760
into here, aren't we? So, sellers need
 

3921
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,270
into here, aren't we? So, sellers need
to come here. Otherwise, we're going to

3922
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:49,280
to come here. Otherwise, we're going to
 

3923
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,110
to come here. Otherwise, we're going to
go back up to 20. If sellers confirm

3924
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:51,120
go back up to 20. If sellers confirm
 

3925
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:53,270
go back up to 20. If sellers confirm
here, they will look for a breakdown and

3926
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:53,280
here, they will look for a breakdown and
 

3927
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,870
here, they will look for a breakdown and
a new low. If they get a new low,

3928
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:54,880
a new low. If they get a new low,
 

3929
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,390
a new low. If they get a new low,
there's a chance we see previous day low

3930
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:56,400
there's a chance we see previous day low
 

3931
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:57,830
there's a chance we see previous day low
and get like a bit of a cascade.

3932
01:35:57,830 --> 01:35:57,840
and get like a bit of a cascade.
 

3933
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,830
and get like a bit of a cascade.
Otherwise, back into range, fail

3934
01:35:59,830 --> 01:35:59,840
Otherwise, back into range, fail
 

3935
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,669
Otherwise, back into range, fail
breakdown.

3936
01:36:01,669 --> 01:36:01,679
breakdown.
 

3937
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:03,030
breakdown.
Hopefully, I've made this clear. This is

3938
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:03,040
Hopefully, I've made this clear. This is
 

3939
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:04,629
Hopefully, I've made this clear. This is
everything we talked about pre-market as

3940
01:36:04,629 --> 01:36:04,639
everything we talked about pre-market as
 

3941
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:07,590
everything we talked about pre-market as
well. So, nice rejection there so far.

3942
01:36:07,590 --> 01:36:07,600
well. So, nice rejection there so far.
 

3943
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,110
well. So, nice rejection there so far.
Previous week point control. Watching

3944
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:09,120
Previous week point control. Watching
 

3945
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:11,830
Previous week point control. Watching
this very carefully here. Do we get

3946
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:11,840
this very carefully here. Do we get
 

3947
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:14,229
this very carefully here. Do we get
follow through now? They're trying to

3948
01:36:14,229 --> 01:36:14,239
follow through now? They're trying to
 

3949
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:16,070
follow through now? They're trying to
bid here.

3950
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:16,080
bid here.
 

3951
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:17,270
bid here.
Think we're going to sell through it. I

3952
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:17,280
Think we're going to sell through it. I
 

3953
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,550
Think we're going to sell through it. I
think we're going to get follow through

3954
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:18,560
think we're going to get follow through
 

3955
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,790
think we're going to get follow through
here.

3956
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:20,800
here.
 

3957
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,709
here.
There is tempting. It's a big level into

3958
01:36:22,709 --> 01:36:22,719
There is tempting. It's a big level into
 

3959
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:29,669
There is tempting. It's a big level into
85 where we just broke out from.

3960
01:36:29,669 --> 01:36:29,679

 

3961
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:32,229

Spies reclaimed 82. Very aware of that.

3962
01:36:32,229 --> 01:36:32,239
Spies reclaimed 82. Very aware of that.
 

3963
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:35,510
Spies reclaimed 82. Very aware of that.
Very aware of that on the spiders.

3964
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:35,520
Very aware of that on the spiders.
 

3965
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,030
Very aware of that on the spiders.
might well squeeze up here if they're

3966
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:37,040
might well squeeze up here if they're
 

3967
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:39,189
might well squeeze up here if they're
going to reclaim and just set it go back

3968
01:36:39,189 --> 01:36:39,199
going to reclaim and just set it go back
 

3969
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:42,229
going to reclaim and just set it go back
upside then spy previous day low 8260

3970
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:42,239
upside then spy previous day low 8260
 

3971
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:45,430
upside then spy previous day low 8260
and then 83 is possible on spy so that

3972
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:45,440
and then 83 is possible on spy so that
 

3973
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:48,790
and then 83 is possible on spy so that
will pull this market up if we do

3974
01:36:48,790 --> 01:36:48,800
will pull this market up if we do
 

3975
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:52,629
will pull this market up if we do
no spy is not it be up

3976
01:36:52,629 --> 01:36:52,639
no spy is not it be up
 

3977
01:36:52,639 --> 01:37:06,229
no spy is not it be up
is at 8266 is at 8240 right

3978
01:37:06,229 --> 01:37:06,239

 

3979
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:08,149

Okay, back into previous weekly point

3980
01:37:08,149 --> 01:37:08,159
Okay, back into previous weekly point
 

3981
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:09,350
Okay, back into previous weekly point
control. So, here's the test here to

3982
01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:09,360
control. So, here's the test here to
 

3983
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,030
control. So, here's the test here to
value area low is key. Like I said, up

3984
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:11,040
value area low is key. Like I said, up
 

3985
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:13,990
value area low is key. Like I said, up
to sort of I would say even 610 would be

3986
01:37:13,990 --> 01:37:14,000
to sort of I would say even 610 would be
 

3987
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,590
to sort of I would say even 610 would be
uh appropriate with this little node

3988
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:15,600
uh appropriate with this little node
 

3989
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,870
uh appropriate with this little node
here. If they get acceptance through

3990
01:37:16,870 --> 01:37:16,880
here. If they get acceptance through
 

3991
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:17,990
here. If they get acceptance through
this buyers, then they're going to go

3992
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:18,000
this buyers, then they're going to go
 

3993
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,709
this buyers, then they're going to go
all the way up here to 626. So, sellers

3994
01:37:20,709 --> 01:37:20,719
all the way up here to 626. So, sellers
 

3995
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:22,950
all the way up here to 626. So, sellers
need to defend this level here. They're

3996
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:22,960
need to defend this level here. They're
 

3997
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,030
need to defend this level here. They're
failing to defend this level here will

3998
01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:25,040
failing to defend this level here will
 

3999
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:26,790
failing to defend this level here will
allow relief all the way back up to

4000
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:26,800
allow relief all the way back up to
 

4001
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,470
allow relief all the way back up to
here. And this would be the same thing.

4002
01:37:28,470 --> 01:37:28,480
here. And this would be the same thing.
 

4003
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,709
here. And this would be the same thing.
A look below and a failure and back into

4004
01:37:30,709 --> 01:37:30,719
A look below and a failure and back into
 

4005
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:32,149
A look below and a failure and back into
range. Look below into range. Look

4006
01:37:32,149 --> 01:37:32,159
range. Look below into range. Look
 

4007
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:33,590
range. Look below into range. Look
below. Well, that didn't look below, but

4008
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:33,600
below. Well, that didn't look below, but
 

4009
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,109
below. Well, that didn't look below, but
back into range. So, sellers must sell

4010
01:37:35,109 --> 01:37:35,119
back into range. So, sellers must sell
 

4011
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:37,270
back into range. So, sellers must sell
here. And if they don't, then they've

4012
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:37,280
here. And if they don't, then they've
 

4013
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:40,470
here. And if they don't, then they've
failed to complete the rotation lower.

4014
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:40,480
failed to complete the rotation lower.
 

4015
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:41,990
failed to complete the rotation lower.
So, this needs to be a buildout of

4016
01:37:41,990 --> 01:37:42,000
So, this needs to be a buildout of
 

4017
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,229
So, this needs to be a buildout of
liquidity for sellers. Otherwise, a hold

4018
01:37:44,229 --> 01:37:44,239
liquidity for sellers. Otherwise, a hold
 

4019
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:46,629
liquidity for sellers. Otherwise, a hold
of this and you're right back into this

4020
01:37:46,629 --> 01:37:46,639
of this and you're right back into this
 

4021
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:50,790
of this and you're right back into this
level.

4022
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:50,800

 

4023
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:54,149

It's good drive there. Buyers got stuck

4024
01:37:54,149 --> 01:37:54,159
It's good drive there. Buyers got stuck
 

4025
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:55,830
It's good drive there. Buyers got stuck
at that high. Sellers taking control of

4026
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:55,840
at that high. Sellers taking control of
 

4027
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,350

this current candle. Buyers now stuck

4028
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:57,360
this current candle. Buyers now stuck
 

4029
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:00,149
this current candle. Buyers now stuck

4030
01:38:00,149 --> 01:38:00,159

Great from sellers. Okay, let's play,

4037
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,990

So, in this from 96es once I saw that

4038
01:38:13,990 --> 01:38:14,000
So, in this from 96es once I saw that
 

4039
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,430
So, in this from 96es once I saw that
transition. I'm not going to hold back

4040
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:15,440
transition. I'm not going to hold back
 

4041
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:17,910
transition. I'm not going to hold back
above 600 though. I'll give it four

4042
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:17,920
above 600 though. I'll give it four
 

4043
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:20,709
above 600 though. I'll give it four
points of risk here. I haven't taken

4044
01:38:20,709 --> 01:38:20,719
points of risk here. I haven't taken
 

4045
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:22,470
points of risk here. I haven't taken
profit yet. Just want to see if we can

4046
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:22,480
profit yet. Just want to see if we can
 

4047
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:23,830
profit yet. Just want to see if we can
get a breakdown because I think they've

4048
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:23,840
get a breakdown because I think they've
 

4049
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,189
get a breakdown because I think they've
got the chance to do it. The only thing

4050
01:38:25,189 --> 01:38:25,199
got the chance to do it. The only thing
 

4051
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:26,629
got the chance to do it. The only thing
that's putting me off is what SPY is

4052
01:38:26,629 --> 01:38:26,639
that's putting me off is what SPY is
 

4053
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:27,910
that's putting me off is what SPY is
doing right now. Maybe I need to take

4054
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:27,920
doing right now. Maybe I need to take
 

4055
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,229
doing right now. Maybe I need to take
one off here. Where did that strong

4056
01:38:30,229 --> 01:38:30,239
one off here. Where did that strong
 

4057
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:33,990
one off here. Where did that strong
selling coming in? 94s.

4058
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:34,000
selling coming in? 94s.
 

4059
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,470
selling coming in? 94s.
Think we can get it. SPY's got to

4060
01:38:36,470 --> 01:38:36,480
Think we can get it. SPY's got to
 

4061
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,709
Think we can get it. SPY's got to
reject. Get back under 82. I'm not

4062
01:38:38,709 --> 01:38:38,719
reject. Get back under 82. I'm not
 

4063
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:40,070
reject. Get back under 82. I'm not
seeing what I want to see on spy. That's

4064
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:40,080
seeing what I want to see on spy. That's
 

4065
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,510
seeing what I want to see on spy. That's
the only thing I'm concerned about. And

4066
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:41,520
the only thing I'm concerned about. And

01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:42,800
giving it a tiniest bit of room here,
 

4153
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,310
giving it a tiniest bit of room here,
but I'm at break even now on this

4154
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:44,320
but I'm at break even now on this
 

4155
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:47,750
but I'm at break even now on this
runner.

4156
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:47,760

 

4157
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,510

Buyers have tried again here and are not

4158
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:49,520
Buyers have tried again here and are not
 

4159
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:50,950
Buyers have tried again here and are not
getting their move higher. So, we're

4160
01:40:50,950 --> 01:40:50,960
getting their move higher. So, we're
 

4161
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,870
getting their move higher. So, we're
stuck again in small rotation, but spy

4162
01:40:52,870 --> 01:40:52,880
stuck again in small rotation, but spy
 

4163
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,390
stuck again in small rotation, but spy
is now at VW. If spy doesn't reject

4164
01:40:54,390 --> 01:40:54,400
is now at VW. If spy doesn't reject
 

4165
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,550
is now at VW. If spy doesn't reject
here, I'm going to get stopped out into

4166
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:56,560
here, I'm going to get stopped out into
 

4167
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:04,870
here, I'm going to get stopped out into
600. Very close to tapping me out here.

4168
01:41:04,870 --> 01:41:04,880

 

4169
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,550

O

4170
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:06,560
O
 

4171
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:10,629
O
tick away from taking me pretty much.

4172
01:41:10,629 --> 01:41:10,639
tick away from taking me pretty much.
 

4173
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:13,990
tick away from taking me pretty much.
I'm out. So stopped out on that. Gave it

4174
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:14,000
I'm out. So stopped out on that. Gave it
 

4175
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,430
I'm out. So stopped out on that. Gave it
a chance, but again, this was all

4176
01:41:15,430 --> 01:41:15,440
a chance, but again, this was all
 

4177
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,990
a chance, but again, this was all
because of spite. This might still work.

4178
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:18,000
because of spite. This might still work.
 

4179
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,750
because of spite. This might still work.
But again, like I said, it's option

4180
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:19,760
But again, like I said, it's option
 

4181
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,270
But again, like I said, it's option
dealers are controlling this market.

4182
01:41:21,270 --> 01:41:21,280
dealers are controlling this market.
 

4183
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,030
dealers are controlling this market.
It's [\h__\h] annoying, but that's what

4184
01:41:23,030 --> 01:41:23,040
It's [\h__\h] annoying, but that's what
 

4185
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,910
It's [\h__\h] annoying, but that's what
we've got. No breakdown under 82.

4186
01:41:25,910 --> 01:41:25,920
we've got. No breakdown under 82.
 

4187
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:29,270
we've got. No breakdown under 82.
Reclaim 82 now to 83s. reclaim that 85

4188
01:41:29,270 --> 01:41:29,280
Reclaim 82 now to 83s. reclaim that 85
 

4189
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:30,629
Reclaim 82 now to 83s. reclaim that 85
is possible. That's why I've got price

4190
01:41:30,629 --> 01:41:30,639
is possible. That's why I've got price
 

4191
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:32,470
is possible. That's why I've got price
alert here and here. I think this is the

4192
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:32,480
alert here and here. I think this is the
 

4193
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:35,590
alert here and here. I think this is the
pin at the moment is 80 to 85. So that's

4194
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:35,600
pin at the moment is 80 to 85. So that's
 

4195
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:37,030
pin at the moment is 80 to 85. So that's
what I'm watching is the extremes. But

4196
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:37,040
what I'm watching is the extremes. But
 

4197
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,790
what I'm watching is the extremes. But
they had the chance here. Failed to

4198
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:38,800
they had the chance here. Failed to
 

4199
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:42,550
they had the chance here. Failed to
break down. We took we had a go at it.

4200
01:41:42,550 --> 01:41:42,560
break down. We took we had a go at it.
 

4201
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:45,109
break down. We took we had a go at it.
Got one off in profit and one just a

4202
01:41:45,109 --> 01:41:45,119
Got one off in profit and one just a
 

4203
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:47,189
Got one off in profit and one just a
just uh I gave it a bit more room than

4204
01:41:47,189 --> 01:41:47,199
just uh I gave it a bit more room than
 

4205
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:48,470
just uh I gave it a bit more room than
break even to be honest, but made money

4206
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:48,480
break even to be honest, but made money
 

4207
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,709
break even to be honest, but made money
on that trade either way. Okay. So now

4208
01:41:50,709 --> 01:41:50,719
on that trade either way. Okay. So now
 

4209
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:51,910
on that trade either way. Okay. So now
if they're going to find acceptance,

4210
01:41:51,910 --> 01:41:51,920
if they're going to find acceptance,
 

4211
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:53,030
if they're going to find acceptance,
we're going to come back up to this

4212
01:41:53,030 --> 01:41:53,040
we're going to come back up to this
 

4213
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:56,149
we're going to come back up to this
shelf like we talked about. So, this

4214
01:41:56,149 --> 01:41:56,159
shelf like we talked about. So, this
 

4215
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:57,590
shelf like we talked about. So, this
becomes the area that they're going to

4216
01:41:57,590 --> 01:41:57,600
becomes the area that they're going to
 

4217
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,270
becomes the area that they're going to
attack where we got thick. All right.

4218
01:41:59,270 --> 01:41:59,280
attack where we got thick. All right.
 

4219
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:00,629
attack where we got thick. All right.
And we've had another look below and

4220
01:42:00,629 --> 01:42:00,639
And we've had another look below and
 

4221
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:02,229
And we've had another look below and
fail. And they're going to come right

4222
01:42:02,229 --> 01:42:02,239
fail. And they're going to come right
 

4223
01:42:02,239 --> 01:42:04,950
fail. And they're going to come right
back into this area here. And at this

4224
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:04,960
back into this area here. And at this
 

4225
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,709
back into this area here. And at this
point, I wouldn't be interested really

4226
01:42:06,709 --> 01:42:06,719
point, I wouldn't be interested really
 

4227
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:08,149
point, I wouldn't be interested really
in reshorting this. I'd have to see a

4228
01:42:08,149 --> 01:42:08,159
in reshorting this. I'd have to see a
 

4229
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:09,590
in reshorting this. I'd have to see a
lot of weakness because they just had an

4230
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:09,600
lot of weakness because they just had an
 

4231
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,470
lot of weakness because they just had an
attempt down here and failed.

4232
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:12,480
attempt down here and failed.
 

4233
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,870
attempt down here and failed.
Hopefully that makes sense.

4234
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:14,880
Hopefully that makes sense.
 

4235
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:19,350
Hopefully that makes sense.
Look at spy now at 83s. It's just so

4236
01:42:19,350 --> 01:42:19,360
Look at spy now at 83s. It's just so
 

4237
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:24,629
Look at spy now at 83s. It's just so
predictable with the uh options, guys.

4238
01:42:24,629 --> 01:42:24,639
predictable with the uh options, guys.
 

4239
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:27,430
predictable with the uh options, guys.
kind of wild. I don't remember a market

4240
01:42:27,430 --> 01:42:27,440
kind of wild. I don't remember a market
 

4241
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:30,790
kind of wild. I don't remember a market
that was uh this much pinned

4242
01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:30,800
that was uh this much pinned
 

4243
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:33,990
that was uh this much pinned
uh by options by levels. Yeah, but it

4244
01:42:33,990 --> 01:42:34,000
uh by options by levels. Yeah, but it
 

4245
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,070
uh by options by levels. Yeah, but it
just feel it feels like it's all options

4246
01:42:36,070 --> 01:42:36,080
just feel it feels like it's all options
 

4247
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:37,750
just feel it feels like it's all options
because if you actually like just zoom

4248
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:37,760
because if you actually like just zoom
 

4249
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:40,229
because if you actually like just zoom
out, we're often not taking liquidity at

4250
01:42:40,229 --> 01:42:40,239
out, we're often not taking liquidity at
 

4251
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:41,590
out, we're often not taking liquidity at
the moment. We're just coming back into

4252
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:41,600
the moment. We're just coming back into
 

4253
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:44,790
the moment. We're just coming back into
a level and finding a reaction.

4254
01:42:44,790 --> 01:42:44,800
a level and finding a reaction.
 

4255
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,229
a level and finding a reaction.
VIX still looks like might want to close

4256
01:42:46,229 --> 01:42:46,239
VIX still looks like might want to close
 

4257
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:48,070
VIX still looks like might want to close
that gap. If VIX fails 17s, we're going

4258
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:48,080
that gap. If VIX fails 17s, we're going
 

4259
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,390
that gap. If VIX fails 17s, we're going
to close that gap. So, back to point of

4260
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:50,400
to close that gap. So, back to point of
 

4261
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,990
to close that gap. So, back to point of
control on the day. Back to these 30s.

4262
01:42:51,990 --> 01:42:52,000
control on the day. Back to these 30s.
 

4263
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,510
control on the day. Back to these 30s.
Remember there are buyers stuck above

4264
01:42:53,510 --> 01:42:53,520
Remember there are buyers stuck above
 

4265
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:56,149
Remember there are buyers stuck above
30s today. All right. So buy side is

4266
01:42:56,149 --> 01:42:56,159
30s today. All right. So buy side is
 

4267
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:58,390
30s today. All right. So buy side is
stuck above 30s. But uh you know this is

4268
01:42:58,390 --> 01:42:58,400
stuck above 30s. But uh you know this is
 

4269
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:01,030
stuck above 30s. But uh you know this is
a strong move after a fail breakdown.

4270
01:43:01,030 --> 01:43:01,040
a strong move after a fail breakdown.
 

4271
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:03,109
a strong move after a fail breakdown.
Big buyers coming in here. Big big big

4272
01:43:03,109 --> 01:43:03,119
Big buyers coming in here. Big big big
 

4273
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:04,629
Big buyers coming in here. Big big big
buyers coming in here trying to get that

4274
01:43:04,629 --> 01:43:04,639
buyers coming in here trying to get that
 

4275
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:07,430
buyers coming in here trying to get that
move back through point of control. And

4276
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:07,440
move back through point of control. And
 

4277
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:10,149
move back through point of control. And
all the delta is buy side basically over

4278
01:43:10,149 --> 01:43:10,159
all the delta is buy side basically over
 

4279
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:14,629
all the delta is buy side basically over
31. So big retest up here. SPY looks

4280
01:43:14,629 --> 01:43:14,639
31. So big retest up here. SPY looks
 

4281
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:15,830
31. So big retest up here. SPY looks
like it might go all the way back to

4282
01:43:15,830 --> 01:43:15,840
like it might go all the way back to
 

4283
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:22,070
like it might go all the way back to
higher day at the moment.

4284
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:22,080

 

4285
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:23,750

And sellers are trying to get a close

4286
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:23,760
And sellers are trying to get a close
 

4287
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,270
And sellers are trying to get a close
under 18 at the moment. Just failed.

4288
01:43:25,270 --> 01:43:25,280
under 18 at the moment. Just failed.
 

4289
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:26,629
under 18 at the moment. Just failed.
They just came piling in and failed

4290
01:43:26,629 --> 01:43:26,639
They just came piling in and failed
 

4291
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:28,950
They just came piling in and failed
again. This feels like it's going to go

4292
01:43:28,950 --> 01:43:28,960
again. This feels like it's going to go
 

4293
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,510
again. This feels like it's going to go
higher at this point. To me, sellers

4294
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:31,520
higher at this point. To me, sellers
 

4295
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:33,030
higher at this point. To me, sellers
need a reaction in front of point of

4296
01:43:33,030 --> 01:43:33,040
need a reaction in front of point of
 

4297
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,629
need a reaction in front of point of
control. They keep getting absorbed. So,

4298
01:43:34,629 --> 01:43:34,639
control. They keep getting absorbed. So,
 

4299
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:36,870
control. They keep getting absorbed. So,
we'll see see how this like next minute

4300
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:36,880
we'll see see how this like next minute
 

4301
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:40,310
we'll see see how this like next minute
or so closes out.

4302
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:40,320
or so closes out.
 

4303
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:45,590
or so closes out.
What's that imbalance? 09. So, tens.

4304
01:43:45,590 --> 01:43:45,600
What's that imbalance? 09. So, tens.
 

4305
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:48,709
What's that imbalance? 09. So, tens.
So reaction in front of 30

4306
01:43:48,709 --> 01:43:48,719
So reaction in front of 30
 

4307
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:50,390
So reaction in front of 30
sellers came flying in right where we

4308
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:50,400
sellers came flying in right where we
 

4309
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,390
sellers came flying in right where we
are now. This is their price that they

4310
01:43:52,390 --> 01:43:52,400
are now. This is their price that they
 

4311
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,910
are now. This is their price that they
came flying in and they are being

4312
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:53,920
came flying in and they are being
 

4313
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:59,590
came flying in and they are being
absorbed.

4314
01:43:59,590 --> 01:43:59,600

 

4315
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,030

Like I said, I don't want to play up

4316
01:44:01,030 --> 01:44:01,040
Like I said, I don't want to play up
 

4317
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:03,990
Like I said, I don't want to play up
here. I'll wait to see what we do next.

4318
01:44:03,990 --> 01:44:04,000
here. I'll wait to see what we do next.
 

4319
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,709
here. I'll wait to see what we do next.
It's too risky now. I had my shot.

4320
01:44:06,709 --> 01:44:06,719
It's too risky now. I had my shot.
 

4321
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:18,709
It's too risky now. I had my shot.
That's my one shot at it.

4322
01:44:18,709 --> 01:44:18,719

 

4323
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,229

Oh, the roll over of the new contract.

4324
01:44:20,229 --> 01:44:20,239
Oh, the roll over of the new contract.
 

4325
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:21,830
Oh, the roll over of the new contract.
You think they'll do it then? I think we

4326
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:21,840
You think they'll do it then? I think we
 

4327
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,149
You think they'll do it then? I think we
do. I mean, we'd better do it before

4328
01:44:24,149 --> 01:44:24,159
do. I mean, we'd better do it before
 

4329
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:27,270
do. I mean, we'd better do it before
then. I hope we do it before then, mate.

4330
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:27,280
then. I hope we do it before then, mate.
 

4331
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:28,709
then. I hope we do it before then, mate.
Okay, sellers trying again here. We

4332
01:44:28,709 --> 01:44:28,719
Okay, sellers trying again here. We
 

4333
01:44:28,719 --> 01:44:30,470
Okay, sellers trying again here. We
caught We just caught some buyers above

4334
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:30,480
caught We just caught some buyers above
 

4335
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:32,149
caught We just caught some buyers above
20.

4336
01:44:32,149 --> 01:44:32,159
20.
 

4337
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:33,750
20.
Okay, on those last couple of candles,

4338
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:33,760
Okay, on those last couple of candles,
 

4339
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:34,870
Okay, on those last couple of candles,
some buyers have been caught up there

4340
01:44:34,870 --> 01:44:34,880
some buyers have been caught up there
 

4341
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:36,950
some buyers have been caught up there
above 20s.

4342
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:36,960
above 20s.
 

4343
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:39,030
above 20s.
This is looking a bit more promising,

4344
01:44:39,030 --> 01:44:39,040
This is looking a bit more promising,
 

4345
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:41,510
This is looking a bit more promising,
but value area value area low now is

4346
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:41,520
but value area value area low now is
 

4347
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:44,470
but value area value area low now is
605. Previous week point of control 600.

4348
01:44:44,470 --> 01:44:44,480
605. Previous week point of control 600.
 

4349
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,149
605. Previous week point of control 600.
That's still like your sort of

4350
01:44:46,149 --> 01:44:46,159
That's still like your sort of
 

4351
01:44:46,159 --> 01:44:47,910
That's still like your sort of
sentiment.

4352
01:44:47,910 --> 01:44:47,920
sentiment.
 

4353
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:50,550
sentiment.
It's possible that they did needed to do

4354
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:50,560
It's possible that they did needed to do
 

4355
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:51,990
It's possible that they did needed to do
a big squeeze out into this level that I

4356
01:44:51,990 --> 01:44:52,000
a big squeeze out into this level that I
 

4357
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,669
a big squeeze out into this level that I
just gave you up here. Remember this

4358
01:44:53,669 --> 01:44:53,679
just gave you up here. Remember this
 

4359
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:55,750
just gave you up here. Remember this
shelf here. I said if they get through

4360
01:44:55,750 --> 01:44:55,760
shelf here. I said if they get through
 

4361
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:59,430
shelf here. I said if they get through
where was it? If they get through this,

4362
01:44:59,430 --> 01:44:59,440
where was it? If they get through this,
 

4363
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:01,910
where was it? If they get through this,
we will revisit up here. They are

4364
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:01,920
we will revisit up here. They are
 

4365
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:04,709
we will revisit up here. They are
selling that at the moment. So this is

4366
01:45:04,709 --> 01:45:04,719
selling that at the moment. So this is
 

4367
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:07,350
selling that at the moment. So this is
your twoleg. It's possible that they set

4368
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:07,360
your twoleg. It's possible that they set
 

4369
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:08,709
your twoleg. It's possible that they set
one of these, but again, we're in a

4370
01:45:08,709 --> 01:45:08,719
one of these, but again, we're in a
 

4371
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:11,030
one of these, but again, we're in a
range rotation. I don't want to have too

4372
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:11,040
range rotation. I don't want to have too
 

4373
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:14,470
range rotation. I don't want to have too
many goes at it, but we will see.

4374
01:45:14,470 --> 01:45:14,480
many goes at it, but we will see.
 

4375
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,070
many goes at it, but we will see.
Back to point of control from previous

4376
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:16,080
Back to point of control from previous
 

4377
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,590
Back to point of control from previous
week. If we sell through this, it's got

4378
01:45:17,590 --> 01:45:17,600
week. If we sell through this, it's got
 

4379
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,350
week. If we sell through this, it's got
a chance

4380
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:19,360
a chance
 

4381
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,990
a chance
again. Uh, SPY is still above VWAP right

4382
01:45:21,990 --> 01:45:22,000
again. Uh, SPY is still above VWAP right
 

4383
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:36,310
again. Uh, SPY is still above VWAP right
now. It's just coming to back test it.

4384
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:36,320

 

4385
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,669

They're trying to sell under this.

4386
01:45:37,669 --> 01:45:37,679
They're trying to sell under this.
 

4387
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:39,350
They're trying to sell under this.
Interesting.

4388
01:45:39,350 --> 01:45:39,360
Interesting.
 

4389
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:42,070
Interesting.
Yes. Inspire V. Really? We've done

4390
01:45:42,070 --> 01:45:42,080
Yes. Inspire V. Really? We've done
 

4391
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:44,149
Yes. Inspire V. Really? We've done
nothing. When you zoom out, we've done

4392
01:45:44,149 --> 01:45:44,159
nothing. When you zoom out, we've done
 

4393
01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:49,030
nothing. When you zoom out, we've done
nothing.

4394
01:45:49,030 --> 01:45:49,040

 

4395
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:50,550

Venom. It's probably because you it

4396
01:45:50,550 --> 01:45:50,560
Venom. It's probably because you it
 

4397
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:53,270
Venom. It's probably because you it
means you prefer trading trend and uh

4398
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:53,280
means you prefer trading trend and uh
 

4399
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,790
means you prefer trading trend and uh
you've got to be see money take money

4400
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:54,800
you've got to be see money take money
 

4401
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:57,430
you've got to be see money take money
and play the extreme. So like even I

4402
01:45:57,430 --> 01:45:57,440
and play the extreme. So like even I
 

4403
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:58,550
and play the extreme. So like even I
didn't take the short up here. Even

4404
01:45:58,550 --> 01:45:58,560
didn't take the short up here. Even
 

4405
01:45:58,560 --> 01:45:59,910
didn't take the short up here. Even
though I said it could fail, I don't

4406
01:45:59,910 --> 01:45:59,920
though I said it could fail, I don't
 

4407
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:01,669
though I said it could fail, I don't
like how we got there. I need to see a

4408
01:46:01,669 --> 01:46:01,679
like how we got there. I need to see a
 

4409
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:03,750
like how we got there. I need to see a
lower high form here. This is a two leg,

4410
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:03,760
lower high form here. This is a two leg,
 

4411
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,270
lower high form here. This is a two leg,
but at the moment it looks like they

4412
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:05,280
but at the moment it looks like they
 

4413
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:17,669
but at the moment it looks like they
might just dunk it.

4414
01:46:17,669 --> 01:46:17,679

 

4415
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:19,109

does look like they might dunk at this

4416
01:46:19,109 --> 01:46:19,119
does look like they might dunk at this
 

4417
01:46:19,119 --> 01:46:23,669
does look like they might dunk at this
point. If they reject uh 600s now,

4418
01:46:23,669 --> 01:46:23,679
point. If they reject uh 600s now,
 

4419
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:25,590
point. If they reject uh 600s now,
maybe.

4420
01:46:25,590 --> 01:46:25,600
maybe.
 

4421
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:28,470
maybe.
Maybe. But we're into this little node

4422
01:46:28,470 --> 01:46:28,480
Maybe. But we're into this little node
 

4423
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,790
Maybe. But we're into this little node
here. We sell through this. We can wash.

4424
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:30,800
here. We sell through this. We can wash.
 

4425
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,390
here. We sell through this. We can wash.
But I'd like to see them reject come up

4426
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:32,400
But I'd like to see them reject come up
 

4427
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,550
But I'd like to see them reject come up
here and reject this. If if it's going

4428
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:34,560
here and reject this. If if it's going
 

4429
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:37,510
here and reject this. If if it's going
to be really kind, I'd want to see this

4430
01:46:37,510 --> 01:46:37,520
to be really kind, I'd want to see this
 

4431
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:40,229
to be really kind, I'd want to see this
this this

4432
01:46:40,229 --> 01:46:40,239

01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46,149
reject this. Fail this. Wash this.
Reclaim this.

01:46:46,149 --> 01:46:46,159
Reclaim this.

4439
01:46:50,000 --> 01:47:05,750

if it's going to be kind.

4440
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:05,760

 

4441
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:13,510

Staying heavy here. Let's buy back 82s.

4442
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:13,520

 

4443
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:15,830

Oh man. Can you give me something to get

4444
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:15,840
Oh man. Can you give me something to get
 

4445
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:19,189
Oh man. Can you give me something to get
involved in.

4446
01:47:19,189 --> 01:47:19,199
involved in.
 

4447
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:20,950
involved in.
If shorts fail to break down here

4448
01:47:20,950 --> 01:47:20,960
If shorts fail to break down here
 

4449
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:38,709
If shorts fail to break down here
though, they will get caught.

4450
01:47:38,709 --> 01:47:38,719

 

4451
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:41,910

Come on then, baby.

4452
01:47:41,910 --> 01:47:41,920
Come on then, baby.
 

4453
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:45,510
Come on then, baby.
They're trying.

4454
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:45,520

 

4455
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:47,109

Think we're going to do it. I think

4456
01:47:47,109 --> 01:47:47,119
Think we're going to do it. I think
 

4457
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:51,669
Think we're going to do it. I think
they've got enough core. Come on.

4458
01:47:51,669 --> 01:47:51,679
they've got enough core. Come on.
 

4459
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:57,910
they've got enough core. Come on.
Here we come.

4460
01:47:57,910 --> 01:47:57,920

 

4461
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:00,950

And we see some expansion now.

4462
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:00,960
And we see some expansion now.
 

4463
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:05,750
And we see some expansion now.
Think we're going to get it, folks.

4464
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:05,760

 

4465
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,070

Big sellers coming in at 77. Buyers just

4466
01:48:08,070 --> 01:48:08,080
Big sellers coming in at 77. Buyers just
 

4467
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:09,510
Big sellers coming in at 77. Buyers just
got trapped in this single candle here

4468
01:48:09,510 --> 01:48:09,520
got trapped in this single candle here
 

4469
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:10,470
got trapped in this single candle here
again. I think we're going to flush

4470
01:48:10,470 --> 01:48:10,480
again. I think we're going to flush
 

4471
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:13,270
again. I think we're going to flush
lower. This breaks this current low 71s,

4472
01:48:13,270 --> 01:48:13,280
lower. This breaks this current low 71s,
 

4473
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:15,350
lower. This breaks this current low 71s,
we should flush. Here we go. There we

4474
01:48:15,350 --> 01:48:15,360
we should flush. Here we go. There we
 

4475
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:18,390
we should flush. Here we go. There we
go. Boom.

4476
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:18,400
go. Boom.
 

4477
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,470
go. Boom.
There's your order flow. Oh my god. What

4478
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:20,480
There's your order flow. Oh my god. What
 

4479
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:23,590
There's your order flow. Oh my god. What
did I just say? [laughter]

4480
01:48:23,590 --> 01:48:23,600
did I just say? [laughter]
 

4481
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:25,590
did I just say? [laughter]
[\h__\h] nailed that. You best believe I

4482
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:25,600
[\h__\h] nailed that. You best believe I
 

4483
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,109
[\h__\h] nailed that. You best believe I
absolutely hammered the [\h__\h] out of that

4484
01:48:27,109 --> 01:48:27,119
absolutely hammered the [\h__\h] out of that
 

4485
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:33,510
absolutely hammered the [\h__\h] out of that
once they were caught.

4486
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:33,520

 

4487
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:36,070

What a beauty.

4488
01:48:36,070 --> 01:48:36,080
What a beauty.
 

4489
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:38,149
What a beauty.
Literally saw them get caught right in

4490
01:48:38,149 --> 01:48:38,159
Literally saw them get caught right in
 

4491
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:43,590
Literally saw them get caught right in
front of my eyes.

4492
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:43,600

 

4493
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,030

All right, let's see if we can get any

4494
01:48:45,030 --> 01:48:45,040
All right, let's see if we can get any
 

4495
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:46,790
All right, let's see if we can get any
more here. So, there's previous day low

4496
01:48:46,790 --> 01:48:46,800
more here. So, there's previous day low
 

4497
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,390
more here. So, there's previous day low
now taken. Now, if they're going to

4498
01:48:48,390 --> 01:48:48,400
now taken. Now, if they're going to
 

4499
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:52,229
now taken. Now, if they're going to
rotate this range, 500 469 is possible.

4500
01:48:52,229 --> 01:48:52,239
rotate this range, 500 469 is possible.
 

4501
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:54,390
rotate this range, 500 469 is possible.
If they're going to rotate this range,

4502
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:54,400
If they're going to rotate this range,
 

4503
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,910
If they're going to rotate this range,
okay, this is why we're here today. Just

4504
01:48:55,910 --> 01:48:55,920
okay, this is why we're here today. Just
 

4505
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:58,310
okay, this is why we're here today. Just
in case they do it, there's no guarantee

4506
01:48:58,310 --> 01:48:58,320
in case they do it, there's no guarantee
 

4507
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,470
in case they do it, there's no guarantee
they do it, but just in case they want

4508
01:49:00,470 --> 01:49:00,480
they do it, but just in case they want
 

4509
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:02,070
they do it, but just in case they want
to play ball, that's what we're looking

4510
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:02,080
to play ball, that's what we're looking
 

4511
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:06,550
to play ball, that's what we're looking
at.

4512
01:49:06,550 --> 01:49:06,560

 

4513
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:09,030

So, IB retest here. Remember, if sellers

4514
01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:09,040
So, IB retest here. Remember, if sellers
 

4515
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:11,430
So, IB retest here. Remember, if sellers
fail to move lower um and we get

4516
01:49:11,430 --> 01:49:11,440
fail to move lower um and we get
 

4517
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:13,030
fail to move lower um and we get
acceptance back into initial balance, it

4518
01:49:13,030 --> 01:49:13,040
acceptance back into initial balance, it
 

4519
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:14,470
acceptance back into initial balance, it
would be look below and fail and we're

4520
01:49:14,470 --> 01:49:14,480
would be look below and fail and we're
 

4521
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:16,390
would be look below and fail and we're
going to go right back to 600s if they

4522
01:49:16,390 --> 01:49:16,400
going to go right back to 600s if they
 

4523
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:17,830
going to go right back to 600s if they
want. All right, just be aware of that

4524
01:49:17,830 --> 01:49:17,840
want. All right, just be aware of that
 

4525
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:20,310
want. All right, just be aware of that
of like what we're looking at here.

4526
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:20,320
of like what we're looking at here.
 

4527
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,229
of like what we're looking at here.
Here's the sweep of previous day low. If

4528
01:49:22,229 --> 01:49:22,239
Here's the sweep of previous day low. If
 

4529
01:49:22,239 --> 01:49:24,070
Here's the sweep of previous day low. If
they get no acceptance under here, they

4530
01:49:24,070 --> 01:49:24,080
they get no acceptance under here, they
 

4531
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:25,590
they get no acceptance under here, they
might need to come and check like these

4532
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:25,600
might need to come and check like these
 

4533
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:29,430
might need to come and check like these
82s where we just broke down from this

4534
01:49:29,430 --> 01:49:29,440
82s where we just broke down from this
 

4535
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:31,109
82s where we just broke down from this
here.

4536
01:49:31,109 --> 01:49:31,119
here.
 

4537
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:32,790
here.
Sorry folks, I'm trying. I'm trying

4538
01:49:32,790 --> 01:49:32,800
Sorry folks, I'm trying. I'm trying
 

4539
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,149
Sorry folks, I'm trying. I'm trying
here. They [snorts] might need to come

4540
01:49:34,149 --> 01:49:34,159
here. They [snorts] might need to come
 

4541
01:49:34,159 --> 01:49:35,990
here. They [snorts] might need to come
and test this. If we stay heavy versus

4542
01:49:35,990 --> 01:49:36,000
and test this. If we stay heavy versus
 

4543
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,590
and test this. If we stay heavy versus
this and break down here, then I expect

4544
01:49:37,590 --> 01:49:37,600
this and break down here, then I expect
 

4545
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:40,310
this and break down here, then I expect
a revisit into these areas. Okay? If

4546
01:49:40,310 --> 01:49:40,320
a revisit into these areas. Okay? If
 

4547
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:42,709
a revisit into these areas. Okay? If
they reclaim this and hold a higher low,

4548
01:49:42,709 --> 01:49:42,719
they reclaim this and hold a higher low,
 

4549
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:44,310
they reclaim this and hold a higher low,
I would just be risk off for the shorts

4550
01:49:44,310 --> 01:49:44,320
I would just be risk off for the shorts
 

4551
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,310
I would just be risk off for the shorts
at that point. But buyers are attempting

4552
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:46,320
at that point. But buyers are attempting
 

4553
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:47,669
at that point. But buyers are attempting
here. You're seeing strong buying coming

4554
01:49:47,669 --> 01:49:47,679
here. You're seeing strong buying coming
 

4555
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:49,270
here. You're seeing strong buying coming
in and at the moment, we're not moving

4556
01:49:49,270 --> 01:49:49,280
in and at the moment, we're not moving
 

4557
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:51,270
in and at the moment, we're not moving
higher.

4558
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:51,280
higher.
 

4559
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:52,790
higher.
So, these buyers are going to get stuck

4560
01:49:52,790 --> 01:49:52,800
So, these buyers are going to get stuck
 

4561
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,470
So, these buyers are going to get stuck
here again. If they can't get above,

4562
01:49:54,470 --> 01:49:54,480
here again. If they can't get above,
 

4563
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:57,669
here again. If they can't get above,
they've just come flying in. 62 to 67s,

4564
01:49:57,669 --> 01:49:57,679
they've just come flying in. 62 to 67s,
 

4565
01:49:57,679 --> 01:49:59,270
they've just come flying in. 62 to 67s,
they've come flying in. If we can't move

4566
01:49:59,270 --> 01:49:59,280
they've come flying in. If we can't move
 

4567
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:01,669
they've come flying in. If we can't move
above that and we break down a new low,

4568
01:50:01,669 --> 01:50:01,679
above that and we break down a new low,
 

4569
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:03,189
above that and we break down a new low,
everyone in this candle will get stuck

4570
01:50:03,189 --> 01:50:03,199
everyone in this candle will get stuck
 

4571
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:10,790
everyone in this candle will get stuck
again.

4572
01:50:10,790 --> 01:50:10,800

 

4573
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:21,270

That IB low is a key sentiment now.

4574
01:50:21,270 --> 01:50:21,280

 

4575
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:23,910

Yeah, I do TJ and especially in the

4576
01:50:23,910 --> 01:50:23,920
Yeah, I do TJ and especially in the
 

4577
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:25,990
Yeah, I do TJ and especially in the
orderflow course which should be live in

4578
01:50:25,990 --> 01:50:26,000
orderflow course which should be live in
 

4579
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,590
orderflow course which should be live in
like the next week or two. It's like

4580
01:50:27,590 --> 01:50:27,600
like the next week or two. It's like
 

4581
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:29,430
like the next week or two. It's like
literally what I focus on, but it's in

4582
01:50:29,430 --> 01:50:29,440
literally what I focus on, but it's in
 

4583
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:31,270
literally what I focus on, but it's in
the beginner to advance course as well.

4584
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:31,280
the beginner to advance course as well.
 

4585
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:33,030
the beginner to advance course as well.
If you've not traded me with me before,

4586
01:50:33,030 --> 01:50:33,040
If you've not traded me with me before,
 

4587
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,390
If you've not traded me with me before,
I would advise you do the beginner to

4588
01:50:34,390 --> 01:50:34,400
I would advise you do the beginner to
 

4589
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:37,030
I would advise you do the beginner to
advance course first just so that you

4590
01:50:37,030 --> 01:50:37,040
advance course first just so that you
 

4591
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:38,629
advance course first just so that you
can understand the setups, what I'm

4592
01:50:38,629 --> 01:50:38,639
can understand the setups, what I'm
 

4593
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:40,149
can understand the setups, what I'm
looking at, why I'm looking at it, and

4594
01:50:40,149 --> 01:50:40,159
looking at, why I'm looking at it, and
 

4595
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:42,390
looking at, why I'm looking at it, and
then um afterwards do the order flow one

4596
01:50:42,390 --> 01:50:42,400
then um afterwards do the order flow one
 

4597
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,870
then um afterwards do the order flow one
because you're going to need some bigger

4598
01:50:44,870 --> 01:50:44,880
because you're going to need some bigger
 

4599
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:46,550
because you're going to need some bigger
understanding. All right, so we might be

4600
01:50:46,550 --> 01:50:46,560
understanding. All right, so we might be
 

4601
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:48,310
understanding. All right, so we might be
coming up to these 80s here like I

4602
01:50:48,310 --> 01:50:48,320
coming up to these 80s here like I
 

4603
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,830
coming up to these 80s here like I
talked about. And if we get through

4604
01:50:49,830 --> 01:50:49,840
talked about. And if we get through
 

4605
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:51,990
talked about. And if we get through
that, then there's no acceptance lower.

4606
01:50:51,990 --> 01:50:52,000
that, then there's no acceptance lower.
 

4607
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,189
that, then there's no acceptance lower.
All right, if we get through that, then

4608
01:50:53,189 --> 01:50:53,199
All right, if we get through that, then
 

4609
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:59,350
All right, if we get through that, then
there's no acceptance lower.

4610
01:50:59,350 --> 01:50:59,360

 

4611
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:03,030

Guess what? Spy caught a bid at.

4612
01:51:03,030 --> 01:51:03,040
Guess what? Spy caught a bid at.
 

4613
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:04,870
Guess what? Spy caught a bid at.
Guess what? Spy caught a bid at. Right,

4614
01:51:04,870 --> 01:51:04,880
Guess what? Spy caught a bid at. Right,
 

4615
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,550
Guess what? Spy caught a bid at. Right,
here's the test towards these 80s that

4616
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:06,560
here's the test towards these 80s that
 

4617
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:09,189
here's the test towards these 80s that
we just talked about. It's so funny.

4618
01:51:09,189 --> 01:51:09,199
we just talked about. It's so funny.
 

4619
01:51:09,199 --> 01:51:11,430
we just talked about. It's so funny.
That's like it's literally to the tick

4620
01:51:11,430 --> 01:51:11,440
That's like it's literally to the tick
 

4621
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:15,030
That's like it's literally to the tick
there. What was that low on spy? 68203.

4622
01:51:15,030 --> 01:51:15,040
there. What was that low on spy? 68203.
 

4623
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:17,792
there. What was that low on spy? 68203.
Are you [\h__\h] kidding me?

4624
01:51:17,792 --> 01:51:17,802
Are you [\h__\h] kidding me?
 

4625
01:51:17,802 --> 01:51:19,830
Are you [\h__\h] kidding me?
[laughter]

4626
01:51:19,830 --> 01:51:19,840

 

4627
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,590

All right, so this is the test of 80s.

4628
01:51:21,590 --> 01:51:21,600
All right, so this is the test of 80s.
 

4629
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,030
All right, so this is the test of 80s.
That little volume shelf. Let's see if

4630
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:23,040
That little volume shelf. Let's see if
 

4631
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:25,030
That little volume shelf. Let's see if
they break below initial balance now and

4632
01:51:25,030 --> 01:51:25,040
they break below initial balance now and
 

4633
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:27,189
they break below initial balance now and
create a new low. Here we go. Really

4634
01:51:27,189 --> 01:51:27,199
create a new low. Here we go. Really
 

4635
01:51:27,199 --> 01:51:29,669
create a new low. Here we go. Really
nice

4641
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:35,109
right. Really nice. Really nice
rejection off the 80s. Like we talked

4642
01:51:35,109 --> 01:51:35,119
rejection off the 80s. Like we talked
 

4643
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:36,709
rejection off the 80s. Like we talked
about, they might need to revisit these

4644
01:51:36,709 --> 01:51:36,719
about, they might need to revisit these
 

4645
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:38,470
about, they might need to revisit these
80s. Really nice. Can we see follow

4646
01:51:38,470 --> 01:51:38,480
80s. Really nice. Can we see follow
 

4647
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:41,109
80s. Really nice. Can we see follow
through now? Can we see follow through

4648
01:51:41,109 --> 01:51:41,119
through now? Can we see follow through
 

4649
01:51:41,119 --> 01:51:45,302
through now? Can we see follow through
now?

4650

Spy, you're horrible, Spy. You're
 

4657

Spy, you're horrible, Spy. You're
horrible. Really good. I think we're

4658
01:51:53,109 --> 01:51:53,119
horrible. Really good. I think we're
 

4659
01:51:53,119 --> 01:51:54,629
horrible. Really good. I think we're
going to get breakdown here. Oh, be

4660
01:51:54,629 --> 01:51:54,639
going to get breakdown here. Oh, be
 

4661
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:56,229
going to get breakdown here. Oh, be
careful. Actually big big seller just

4662
01:51:56,229 --> 01:51:56,239
careful. Actually big big seller just
 

4663
01:51:56,239 --> 01:51:58,629
careful. Actually big big seller just
came in there and he got caught. 226 lot

4664
01:51:58,629 --> 01:51:58,639
came in there and he got caught. 226 lot
 

4665
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:00,790
came in there and he got caught. 226 lot
at those lows there. Literally as I said

4666
01:52:00,790 --> 01:52:00,800
at those lows there. Literally as I said
 

4667
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:04,709
at those lows there. Literally as I said
that at 556 you got a 226 lot sellside

4668
01:52:04,709 --> 01:52:04,719
that at 556 you got a 226 lot sellside
 

4669
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:07,030
that at 556 you got a 226 lot sellside
and he is caught. So we need to trade

4670
01:52:07,030 --> 01:52:07,040
and he is caught. So we need to trade
 

4671
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:08,550
and he is caught. So we need to trade
under him. If we trade under him he's

4672
01:52:08,550 --> 01:52:08,560
under him. If we trade under him he's
 

4673
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:09,910
under him. If we trade under him he's
going to be fine but we need to trade

4674
01:52:09,910 --> 01:52:09,920
going to be fine but we need to trade
 

4675
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:13,109
going to be fine but we need to trade
under him

4676
01:52:13,109 --> 01:52:13,119
under him
 

4677
01:52:13,119 --> 01:52:16,070
under him
and he's at about 5.56.

4678
01:52:16,070 --> 01:52:16,080
and he's at about 5.56.
 

4679

This guy here 227 lot. What's his

4682
01:52:22,390 --> 01:52:22,400
This guy here 227 lot. What's his
 

4683
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:24,790
This guy here 227 lot. What's his
average price? 559 is his average price.

4684
01:52:24,790 --> 01:52:24,800
average price? 559 is his average price.
 

4685
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:27,589
average price? 559 is his average price.
He's stuck. There you go. He's stuck.

4686
01:52:27,589 --> 01:52:27,599
He's stuck. There you go. He's stuck.
 

4687
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:31,910
He's stuck. There you go. He's stuck.
So, be careful.

4688
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:31,920

 

4689
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:33,830

Be careful.

4690
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:33,840
Be careful.
 

4691
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:36,550
Be careful.
Back to IB. Those 80s is your guide. If

4692
01:52:36,550 --> 01:52:36,560
Back to IB. Those 80s is your guide. If
 

4693
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:37,990
Back to IB. Those 80s is your guide. If
you get acceptance back through 80s,

4694
01:52:37,990 --> 01:52:38,000
you get acceptance back through 80s,
 

4695
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,510
you get acceptance back through 80s,
then you probably get a drift higher.

4696
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:39,520
then you probably get a drift higher.
 

4697
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,350
then you probably get a drift higher.
All right. If we get back through, you

4698
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:41,360
All right. If we get back through, you
 

4699
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:43,189
All right. If we get back through, you
should call it 90s. Really, the test is

4700
01:52:43,189 --> 01:52:43,199
should call it 90s. Really, the test is
 

4701
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:45,270
should call it 90s. Really, the test is
80s, but if they get back through 90s,

4702
01:52:45,270 --> 01:52:45,280
80s, but if they get back through 90s,
 

4703
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:46,950
80s, but if they get back through 90s,
then it'll be a look below. If they hold

4704
01:52:46,950 --> 01:52:46,960
then it'll be a look below. If they hold
 

4705
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:48,790
then it'll be a look below. If they hold
above here, then we squeeze. If they

4706
01:52:48,790 --> 01:52:48,800
above here, then we squeeze. If they
 

4707
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:50,470
above here, then we squeeze. If they
reject this and build up more liquidity,

4708
01:52:50,470 --> 01:52:50,480
reject this and build up more liquidity,
 

4709
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:52,390
reject this and build up more liquidity,
then this is the target, right? Just be

4710
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:52,400
then this is the target, right? Just be
 

4711
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:53,910
then this is the target, right? Just be
careful because low hanging fruit was

4712
01:52:53,910 --> 01:52:53,920
careful because low hanging fruit was
 

4713
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:55,589
careful because low hanging fruit was
previous day low. We've taken it. This

4714
01:52:55,589 --> 01:52:55,599
previous day low. We've taken it. This
 

4715
01:52:55,599 --> 01:52:57,510
previous day low. We've taken it. This
is all about the weekly profile. Now,

4716
01:52:57,510 --> 01:52:57,520
is all about the weekly profile. Now,
 

4717
01:52:57,520 --> 01:52:59,109
is all about the weekly profile. Now,
are we going to expand the current week

4718
01:52:59,109 --> 01:52:59,119
are we going to expand the current week
 

4719
01:52:59,119 --> 01:53:02,870
are we going to expand the current week
to come and test previous week's edge?

4720
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:02,880
to come and test previous week's edge?
 

4721
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:05,350
to come and test previous week's edge?
All I'd say is there is uh not from the

4722
01:53:05,350 --> 01:53:05,360
All I'd say is there is uh not from the
 

4723
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:06,550
All I'd say is there is uh not from the
previous week, but from the week before

4724
01:53:06,550 --> 01:53:06,560
previous week, but from the week before
 

4725
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:08,149
previous week, but from the week before
that, there is a naked point of control

4726
01:53:08,149 --> 01:53:08,159
that, there is a naked point of control
 

4727
01:53:08,159 --> 01:53:10,229
that, there is a naked point of control
down at two I think it's 200s. Where is

4728
01:53:10,229 --> 01:53:10,239
down at two I think it's 200s. Where is
 

4729
01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:12,629
down at two I think it's 200s. Where is
it?

4730
01:53:12,629 --> 01:53:12,639
it?
 

4731
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:14,870
it?
24950s.

4732
01:53:14,870 --> 01:53:14,880
24950s.
 

4733
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:16,390
24950s.
That's where I want the market to trade

4734
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:16,400
That's where I want the market to trade
 

4735
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,470
That's where I want the market to trade
to.

4736
01:53:18,470 --> 01:53:18,480
to.
 

4737
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:21,270
to.
Yeah, let's go then.

4738
01:53:21,270 --> 01:53:21,280
Yeah, let's go then.
 

4739
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:27,750
Yeah, let's go then.
Give us the puke then.

4740
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:27,760

 

4741
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:32,070

So, can we get now into this and this?

4742
01:53:32,070 --> 01:53:32,080
So, can we get now into this and this?
 

4743
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:33,750
So, can we get now into this and this?
That's my question for the market at the

4744
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:33,760
That's my question for the market at the
 

4745
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:35,189
That's my question for the market at the
moment. Can we get all the way down

4746
01:53:35,189 --> 01:53:35,199
moment. Can we get all the way down
 

4747
01:53:35,199 --> 01:53:38,709
moment. Can we get all the way down
there?

4748
01:53:38,709 --> 01:53:38,719

 

4749
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:40,550

Just trying to zoom out and see what

4750
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:40,560
Just trying to zoom out and see what
 

4751
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:42,390
Just trying to zoom out and see what
levels we have in between these. Just

4752
01:53:42,390 --> 01:53:42,400
levels we have in between these. Just
 

4753
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,470
levels we have in between these. Just
make sure I'm not missing anything.

4754
01:53:44,470 --> 01:53:44,480
make sure I'm not missing anything.
 

4755
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:48,709
make sure I'm not missing anything.
There is a bit of a node

4756
01:53:48,709 --> 01:53:48,719

 

4757
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:51,350

540. I want to be aware of 540. There is

4758
01:53:51,350 --> 01:53:51,360
540. I want to be aware of 540. There is
 

4759
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:53,430
540. I want to be aware of 540. There is
a little bit of a low volume node at 540

4760
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:53,440
a little bit of a low volume node at 540
 

4761
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:57,589
a little bit of a low volume node at 540
and then a spike out to 530. So 540 530

4762
01:53:57,589 --> 01:53:57,599
and then a spike out to 530. So 540 530
 

4763
01:53:57,599 --> 01:53:59,510
and then a spike out to 530. So 540 530
is going to be key. And if we get below

4764
01:53:59,510 --> 01:53:59,520
is going to be key. And if we get below
 

4765
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:04,149
is going to be key. And if we get below
that then I think there is a chance

4766
01:54:04,149 --> 01:54:04,159
that then I think there is a chance
 

4767
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:09,990
that then I think there is a chance
to trade down to 500 or 491 and 470. So

4768
01:54:09,990 --> 01:54:10,000
to trade down to 500 or 491 and 470. So
 

4769
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,350
to trade down to 500 or 491 and 470. So
540 530 is a key level coming up here

4770
01:54:13,350 --> 01:54:13,360
540 530 is a key level coming up here
 

4771
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:14,870
540 530 is a key level coming up here
just based on previous week volume. If

4772
01:54:14,870 --> 01:54:14,880
just based on previous week volume. If
 

4773
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:16,149
just based on previous week volume. If
we trade under that I think we get a

4774
01:54:16,149 --> 01:54:16,159
we trade under that I think we get a
 

4775
01:54:16,159 --> 01:54:22,229
we trade under that I think we get a
snap.

4776
01:54:22,229 --> 01:54:22,239

 

4777
01:54:22,239 --> 01:54:24,790

Guess where spy is.

4778
01:54:24,790 --> 01:54:24,800
Guess where spy is.
 

4779
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:28,229
Guess where spy is.
Guess where spy is.

4780
01:54:28,229 --> 01:54:28,239
Guess where spy is.
 

4781
01:54:28,239 --> 01:54:38,149
Guess where spy is.
Can it let go of this?

4782
01:54:38,149 --> 01:54:38,159

 

4783
01:54:38,159 --> 01:54:39,669

Sellers are coming in here. We're not

4784
01:54:39,669 --> 01:54:39,679
Sellers are coming in here. We're not
 

4785
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:42,149
Sellers are coming in here. We're not
moving lower. Just be aware of that. 540

4786
01:54:42,149 --> 01:54:42,159
moving lower. Just be aware of that. 540
 

4787
01:54:42,159 --> 01:54:43,910
moving lower. Just be aware of that. 540
530. Once we're out of this trade, I can

4788
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:43,920
530. Once we're out of this trade, I can
 

4789
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:45,910
530. Once we're out of this trade, I can
show you why I'm looking at this level.

4790
01:54:45,910 --> 01:54:45,920
show you why I'm looking at this level.
 

4791
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:47,350
show you why I'm looking at this level.
If we can close below this, there's a

4792
01:54:47,350 --> 01:54:47,360
If we can close below this, there's a
 

4793
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:48,950
If we can close below this, there's a
low, if you look at a weekly profile,

4794
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:48,960
low, if you look at a weekly profile,
 

4795
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:51,750
low, if you look at a weekly profile,
there's a little low volume node of sort

4796
01:54:51,750 --> 01:54:51,760
there's a little low volume node of sort
 

4797
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:55,430
there's a little low volume node of sort
of 540 and then we spike out to 5 530.

4798
01:54:55,430 --> 01:54:55,440
of 540 and then we spike out to 5 530.
 

4799
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:58,709
of 540 and then we spike out to 5 530.
So, this is like a little rice on

4800
01:54:58,709 --> 01:54:58,719
So, this is like a little rice on
 

4801
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:00,629
So, this is like a little rice on
previous week. If we close below this,

4802
01:55:00,629 --> 01:55:00,639
previous week. If we close below this,
 

4803
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:03,350
previous week. If we close below this,
we can wash. They're trying. They're

4804
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:03,360
we can wash. They're trying. They're
 

4805
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:04,390
we can wash. They're trying. They're
trying. They're trying. They're trying.

4806
01:55:04,390 --> 01:55:04,400
trying. They're trying. They're trying.
 

4807
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:05,510
trying. They're trying. They're trying.
Have they got any juice? At the moment,

4808
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:05,520
Have they got any juice? At the moment,
 

4809
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:06,709
Have they got any juice? At the moment,
they haven't got any juice, but I think

4810
01:55:06,709 --> 01:55:06,719
they haven't got any juice, but I think
 

4811
01:55:06,719 --> 01:55:09,030
they haven't got any juice, but I think
it's coming. Here's the 40 test. All

4812
01:55:09,030 --> 01:55:09,040
it's coming. Here's the 40 test. All
 

4813
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:10,870
it's coming. Here's the 40 test. All
right. 1430 coming up. If we trade

4814
01:55:10,870 --> 01:55:10,880
right. 1430 coming up. If we trade
 

4815
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,550
right. 1430 coming up. If we trade
through this, this blue box is target

4816
01:55:12,550 --> 01:55:12,560
through this, this blue box is target
 

4817
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:14,470
through this, this blue box is target
500s. If we trade through that this

4818
01:55:14,470 --> 01:55:14,480
500s. If we trade through that this
 

4819
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:15,830
500s. If we trade through that this
previous week value area like you don't

4820
01:55:15,830 --> 01:55:15,840
previous week value area like you don't
 

4821
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,669
previous week value area like you don't
want to be risk on as in you don't want

4822
01:55:17,669 --> 01:55:17,679
want to be risk on as in you don't want
 

4823
01:55:17,679 --> 01:55:20,390
want to be risk on as in you don't want
to be short under here that's the edge

4824
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:20,400
to be short under here that's the edge
 

4825
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:24,870
to be short under here that's the edge
of value

4826
01:55:24,870 --> 01:55:24,880

 

4827
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:26,229

01:55:49,910 --> 01:55:49,920
Yeah, 50 is key. It's where all volume
 

4843
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:51,430
Yeah, 50 is key. It's where all volume
was traded up to 50. We don't want it.

4865
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:22,870
December 4th. And if you look at the

trying to come in aggressively. If we
 

4875
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:32,149
trying to come in aggressively. If we
snap this, we move lower. If we don't

4876
01:56:32,149 --> 01:56:32,159
snap this, we move lower. If we don't
 

4877
01:56:32,159 --> 01:56:33,270
snap this, we move lower. If we don't
snap this, they are going to get

4878
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:33,280
snap this, they are going to get
 

4879
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:35,830
snap this, they are going to get
themselves caught. Cannot trade back

4880
01:56:35,830 --> 01:56:35,840
themselves caught. Cannot trade back
 

4881

above 50. In fact, I don't even want to
 

4883
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:40,229
above 50. In fact, I don't even want to
get that high now. Lots of selling

4884
01:56:40,229 --> 01:56:40,239

coming in here, folks. If we don't move

4886
01:56:42,310 --> 01:56:42,320
coming in here, folks. If we don't move
 

4887
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:43,589
coming in here, folks. If we don't move
lower, it means there's a passive buyer

4888
01:56:43,589 --> 01:56:43,599
lower, it means there's a passive buyer
 

4889
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:45,109
lower, it means there's a passive buyer
in this little node. Remember, I said 40

4890
01:56:45,109 --> 01:56:45,119
in this little node. Remember, I said 40
 

4891
01:56:45,119 --> 01:56:46,709
in this little node. Remember, I said 40
to 30 is a key level if we're going to

4892
01:56:46,709 --> 01:56:46,719
to 30 is a key level if we're going to
 

4893
01:56:46,719 --> 01:56:51,510
to 30 is a key level if we're going to
find acceptance lower.

4894
01:56:51,510 --> 01:56:51,520

 

4895
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:53,109

01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:34,310
Delta's starting to flip from sell side
to buy side. They're trying to expand

01:58:34,310 --> 01:58:34,320
to buy side. They're trying to expand
 

4977
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:35,430
to buy side. They're trying to expand
now. So, they're going to come and test

4978
01:58:35,430 --> 01:58:35,440
now. So, they're going to come and test
 

4979
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:37,910
now. So, they're going to come and test
60s now. That previous day low and

4980
01:58:37,910 --> 01:58:37,920
60s now. That previous day low and
 

4981
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:39,350
60s now. That previous day low and
initial balance. Remember, if we go back

4982
01:58:39,350 --> 01:58:39,360
initial balance. Remember, if we go back
 

4983
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,870
initial balance. Remember, if we go back
inside initial balance, it's to look

4984
01:58:40,870 --> 01:58:40,880
inside initial balance, it's to look
 

4985
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:50,470
inside initial balance, it's to look
below and fail.

4986
01:58:50,470 --> 01:58:50,480

 

4987
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:56,149

Schlomza 11. Right, let's have a look.

4988
01:58:56,149 --> 01:58:56,159

 

4989
01:58:56,159 --> 01:59:07,589

Slow-mo

4990
01:59:07,589 --> 01:59:07,599

 

4991
01:59:07,599 --> 01:59:09,990

11,

4992
01:59:09,990 --> 01:59:10,000
11,
 

4993
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,229
11,
right? It means you put it in wrong to

4994
01:59:12,229 --> 01:59:12,239
right? It means you put it in wrong to
 

4995
01:59:12,239 --> 01:59:17,750
right? It means you put it in wrong to
prove now. It means you put it in wrong.

4996
01:59:17,750 --> 01:59:17,760

 

4997
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:27,990

So, it should work now.

4998
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:28,000

 

4999
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,189

Uh, easy buy. Uh, I don't think so.

5000
01:59:31,189 --> 01:59:31,199
Uh, easy buy. Uh, I don't think so.
 

5001
01:59:31,199 --> 01:59:32,950
Uh, easy buy. Uh, I don't think so.
I don't I don't There's no confirmation

5002
01:59:32,950 --> 01:59:32,960
I don't I don't There's no confirmation
 

5003
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:34,550
I don't I don't There's no confirmation
here that we're going back upside right

5004
01:59:34,550 --> 01:59:34,560
here that we're going back upside right
 

5005
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:36,310
here that we're going back upside right
now.

5006
01:59:36,310 --> 01:59:36,320
now.
 

5007
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:37,669
now.
The only thing I'd say is you got

5008
01:59:37,669 --> 01:59:37,679
The only thing I'd say is you got
 

5009
01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:39,910
The only thing I'd say is you got
sellers trapped under 33s. Momentum is

5010
01:59:39,910 --> 01:59:39,920
sellers trapped under 33s. Momentum is
 

5011
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:41,270
sellers trapped under 33s. Momentum is
downside. You're outside of initial

5012
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:41,280
downside. You're outside of initial
 

5013
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:42,870
downside. You're outside of initial
balance. You're breaking out away from

5014
01:59:42,870 --> 01:59:42,880
balance. You're breaking out away from
 

5015
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:44,950
balance. You're breaking out away from
previous week point of control. I'd say

5016
01:59:44,950 --> 01:59:44,960
previous week point of control. I'd say
 

5017
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:47,990
previous week point of control. I'd say
for me, we've left value. This is the

5018
01:59:47,990 --> 01:59:48,000
for me, we've left value. This is the
 

5019
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,229
for me, we've left value. This is the
first time

5020
01:59:50,229 --> 01:59:50,239
first time
 

5021
01:59:50,239 --> 01:59:56,310
first time
Here's

5022
01:59:56,310 --> 01:59:56,320

 

5023
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:59,669

previous day's value. We've left it. We

5024
01:59:59,669 --> 01:59:59,679
previous day's value. We've left it. We
 

5025
01:59:59,679 --> 02:00:01,589
previous day's value. We've left it. We
rejected it a few times today. We're

5026
02:00:01,589 --> 02:00:01,599
rejected it a few times today. We're
 

5027
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:03,270
rejected it a few times today. We're
searching lower now. We're probably

5028
02:00:03,270 --> 02:00:03,280
searching lower now. We're probably
 

5029
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:04,709
searching lower now. We're probably
likely to search to previous week's

5030
02:00:04,709 --> 02:00:04,719
likely to search to previous week's
 

5031
02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:07,589
likely to search to previous week's
value area high. All right. Maybe here

5032
02:00:07,589 --> 02:00:07,599
value area high. All right. Maybe here
 

5033
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:09,189
value area high. All right. Maybe here
if they absorb or do a look below and

5034
02:00:09,189 --> 02:00:09,199
if they absorb or do a look below and
 

5035
02:00:09,199 --> 02:00:12,149
if they absorb or do a look below and
fail, there's a buying opportunity.

5036
02:00:12,149 --> 02:00:12,159
fail, there's a buying opportunity.
 

5037
02:00:12,159 --> 02:00:14,310
fail, there's a buying opportunity.
But I wouldn't say now now that we're

5038
02:00:14,310 --> 02:00:14,320
But I wouldn't say now now that we're
 

5039
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:16,550
But I wouldn't say now now that we're
breaking away from value. Look at the

5040
02:00:16,550 --> 02:00:16,560
breaking away from value. Look at the
 

5041
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:18,070
breaking away from value. Look at the
volume we've left trap. We're breaking

5042
02:00:18,070 --> 02:00:18,080
volume we've left trap. We're breaking
 

5043
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:20,390
volume we've left trap. We're breaking
away from value. I wouldn't say it's an

5044
02:00:20,390 --> 02:00:20,400
away from value. I wouldn't say it's an
 

5045
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:23,910
away from value. I wouldn't say it's an
easy buy. I'd say that's uh it might be

5046
02:00:23,910 --> 02:00:23,920
easy buy. I'd say that's uh it might be
 

5047
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:25,910
easy buy. I'd say that's uh it might be
what you consider a cheap buy, but I

5048
02:00:25,910 --> 02:00:25,920
what you consider a cheap buy, but I
 

5049
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:27,270
what you consider a cheap buy, but I
wouldn't say momentum's on your side

5050
02:00:27,270 --> 02:00:27,280
wouldn't say momentum's on your side
 

5051
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:29,109
wouldn't say momentum's on your side
yet, other than knowing that the sellers

5052
02:00:29,109 --> 02:00:29,119
yet, other than knowing that the sellers
 

5053
02:00:29,119 --> 02:00:31,830
yet, other than knowing that the sellers
are trapped under 33s. And it also

5054
02:00:31,830 --> 02:00:31,840
are trapped under 33s. And it also
 

5055
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:33,830
are trapped under 33s. And it also
depends what your ambitions are. If we

5056
02:00:33,830 --> 02:00:33,840
depends what your ambitions are. If we
 

5057
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:35,990
depends what your ambitions are. If we
start pivoting here, then yes, I think

5058
02:00:35,990 --> 02:00:36,000
start pivoting here, then yes, I think
 

5059
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,910
start pivoting here, then yes, I think
that's a safer action, but you've still

5060
02:00:37,910 --> 02:00:37,920
that's a safer action, but you've still
 

5061
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:39,910
that's a safer action, but you've still
got to get through this. I'd just be

5062
02:00:39,910 --> 02:00:39,920
got to get through this. I'd just be
 

5063
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:43,030
got to get through this. I'd just be
slightly concerned about this right here

5064
02:00:43,030 --> 02:00:43,040
slightly concerned about this right here
 

5065
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:45,030
slightly concerned about this right here
right on the edge of value. But if you

5066
02:00:45,030 --> 02:00:45,040
right on the edge of value. But if you
 

5067
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:46,550
right on the edge of value. But if you
get acceptance in, then I would have to

5068
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:46,560
get acceptance in, then I would have to
 

5069
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,149
get acceptance in, then I would have to
agree with you. I would definitely say

5070
02:00:48,149 --> 02:00:48,159

once we reclaim initial balance. So,

5190
02:05:46,070 --> 02:05:46,080
once we reclaim initial balance. So,
 

5191
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:48,870
once we reclaim initial balance. So,
whoever asked me earlier about the how

5192
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:48,880
whoever asked me earlier about the how
 

5193
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:50,950

you use initial balance. This is your

5194
02:05:50,950 --> 02:05:50,960
you use initial balance. This is your
 

5195
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:53,350
you use initial balance. This is your
prime example. Holds initial balance,

5196
02:05:53,350 --> 02:05:53,360
prime example. Holds initial balance,
 

5197
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:55,669
prime example. Holds initial balance,
fails initial balance, reclaims initial

5198
02:05:55,669 --> 02:05:55,679
fails initial balance, reclaims initial
 

5199
02:05:55,679 --> 02:05:57,510
fails initial balance, reclaims initial
balance, back inside. That's your

5200
02:05:57,510 --> 02:05:57,520
balance, back inside. That's your
 

5201
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:59,430
balance, back inside. That's your
target. VWOPS are always your target off

the IB trade back inside. So, if Tyson's

5204
02:06:02,149 --> 02:06:02,159
the IB trade back inside. So, if Tyson's
 

5205
02:06:02,159 --> 02:06:04,709
the IB trade back inside. So, if Tyson's
here, I'm sure Tyson just took this

5206
02:06:04,709 --> 02:06:04,719
here, I'm sure Tyson just took this
 

5207
02:06:04,719 --> 02:06:06,790
here, I'm sure Tyson just took this
trade back up to here. That's his trade.

5208
02:06:06,790 --> 02:06:06,800
trade back up to here. That's his trade.
 

5209
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:09,430
trade back up to here. That's his trade.

02:08:39,750 --> 02:08:39,760
we are now coming back to test previous
 

5313
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:41,189
we are now coming back to test previous
week's value. You can see how important

this is. All right, the rotation. And
 

5317
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:44,390
this is. All right, the rotation. And
this is what I was talking about every

02:08:44,390 --> 02:08:44,400
this is what I was talking about every

5331
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:58,950
below currently potentially failing. I
would say you've got a bit longer. How

5332
02:08:58,950 --> 02:08:58,960
would say you've got a bit longer. How
 

5333
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:01,270

02:09:03,109 --> 02:09:03,119
here, then we're going to look, this is
 

5337
02:09:03,119 --> 02:09:04,310
here, then we're going to look, this is
current week's value. Then we're going

5338
02:09:04,310 --> 02:09:04,320
current week's value. Then we're going
 

5339
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:08,310
current week's value. Then we're going
to look to trade underneath this to

5340
02:09:08,310 --> 02:09:08,320
to look to trade underneath this to
 

5341
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:10,629
to look to trade underneath this to

All right. That is a potential long

5344
02:09:12,310 --> 02:09:12,320
All right. That is a potential long
 

5345
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:13,750
All right. That is a potential long
trigger there. All right. If we get down

5346
02:09:13,750 --> 02:09:13,760
trigger there. All right. If we get down
 

5347
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:15,109
trigger there. All right. If we get down
into that and they hold, that's the

5348
02:09:15,109 --> 02:09:15,119
into that and they hold, that's the
 

5349
02:09:15,119 --> 02:09:17,830
into that and they hold, that's the
potential long trigger. If they also get

5350
02:09:17,830 --> 02:09:17,840
potential long trigger. If they also get
 

5351
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:20,229
potential long trigger. If they also get
back inside current week's value and

5352
02:09:20,229 --> 02:09:20,239
back inside current week's value and
 

5353
02:09:20,239 --> 02:09:22,229
back inside current week's value and
previous and current days value and they

previous and current days value and they
 

5355
02:09:22,239 --> 02:09:23,510
previous and current days value and they
can't find acceptance, then what we're

5356
02:09:23,510 --> 02:09:23,520
can't find acceptance, then what we're
 

5357
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:24,709
can't find acceptance, then what we're

Every time we've come up there, we
failed and we haven't actually tested

5376
02:09:44,950 --> 02:09:44,960
failed and we haven't actually tested
 

5377
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:47,109
failed and we haven't actually tested
that volume. Beyond that, if we look

5378
02:09:47,109 --> 02:09:47,119
that volume. Beyond that, if we look
 

5379
02:09:47,119 --> 02:09:48,870
that volume. Beyond that, if we look
left,

5380
02:09:48,870 --> 02:09:48,880
left,
 

5381
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:51,109
left,
look at the confluence.

5382

5384
02:09:53,910 --> 02:09:53,920

5385
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:56,550
Value area high, value area high, value
area high, value area low. I would say

5386
02:09:56,550 --> 02:09:56,560
area high, value area low. I would say
 

5387
02:09:56,560 --> 02:10:00,550
area high, value area low. I would say
from 900 to sort of 700, that is a big

5388
02:10:00,550 --> 02:10:00,560
from 900 to sort of 700, that is a big
 

5389
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:03,589
from 900 to sort of 700, that is a big
supply zone. Now, we get through 900 and

5390
02:10:03,589 --> 02:10:03,599
supply zone. Now, we get through 900 and
 

5391
02:10:03,599 --> 02:10:05,189
supply zone. Now, we get through 900 and
you base above and hold, you find

5392
02:10:05,189 --> 02:10:05,199
you base above and hold, you find
 

5393
02:10:05,199 --> 02:10:09,030
you base above and hold, you find
acceptance, there's a trade up to 26,50.

5394
02:10:09,030 --> 02:10:09,040
acceptance, there's a trade up to 26,50.
 

5395
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:10,950
acceptance, there's a trade up to 26,50.

be careful because I'm sure the algo
 

5409

5410
02:10:27,350 --> 02:10:27,360
will probably want to print higher.
