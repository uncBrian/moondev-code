Morning everyone.
Good morning. Hope you're doing well.

Good morning. Hope you're doing well.

00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
Hope you had a good afternoon. If you
 

7
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,910
Hope you had a good afternoon. If you
continued to trade that range rotation

8
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
continued to trade that range rotation
 

9
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,990
continued to trade that range rotation
yesterday, if you are a range trader,

10
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
yesterday, if you are a range trader,
 

11
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,229
yesterday, if you are a range trader,
well, last couple of days, definitely

12
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
well, last couple of days, definitely
 

13
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,149
well, last couple of days, definitely
yesterday was your market. That was your

14
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
yesterday was your market. That was your
 

15
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,190
yesterday was your market. That was your
time to shine with 200 points rotations

16
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
time to shine with 200 points rotations
 

17
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,070
time to shine with 200 points rotations
happening many, many times over. Okay,

18
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
happening many, many times over. Okay,
 

19
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,509
happening many, many times over. Okay,
we're going to start as always in the

20
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
we're going to start as always in the
 

21
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,990
we're going to start as always in the
daily chart. So let's just zoom into

22
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
daily chart. So let's just zoom into
 

23
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,030
daily chart. So let's just zoom into
here. The first thing I want to point

24
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,040
here. The first thing I want to point
 

25
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,509
here. The first thing I want to point
out is we are developing quite a thick

26
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
out is we are developing quite a thick
 

27
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,830
out is we are developing quite a thick
profile in here. And it's not really

28
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
profile in here. And it's not really
 

29
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,190
profile in here. And it's not really
surprising, is it? Because we were here

30
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
surprising, is it? Because we were here
 

31
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,350
surprising, is it? Because we were here
in September, we were here in October,

32
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360
in September, we were here in October,
 

33
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,949
in September, we were here in October,
we were here in November, and we're here

34
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
we were here in November, and we're here
 

35
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,190
we were here in November, and we're here
in December. All right. So we've spent

36
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
in December. All right. So we've spent
 

37
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,030
in December. All right. So we've spent
now a good portion of four months in

38
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
now a good portion of four months in
 

39
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,030
now a good portion of four months in
this range. And you can see the edges

40
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
this range. And you can see the edges
 

41
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,990
this range. And you can see the edges
are starting to develop and build out.

42
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
are starting to develop and build out.
 

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,909
are starting to develop and build out.
All right. So we know we're in a thick

44
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
All right. So we know we're in a thick
 

45
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,990
All right. So we know we're in a thick
profile, which means in here we will

46
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
profile, which means in here we will
 

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,990
profile, which means in here we will
normally rotate. All right. And when we

48
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
normally rotate. All right. And when we
 

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,590
normally rotate. All right. And when we
leave the profile, we can be drastic,

50
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
leave the profile, we can be drastic,
 

51
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,150
leave the profile, we can be drastic,
but right now probably going to be a bit

52
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
but right now probably going to be a bit
 

53
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,230
but right now probably going to be a bit
like what we saw over here until we

54
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
like what we saw over here until we
 

55
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,710
like what we saw over here until we
prove otherwise. If we zoom into what

56
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
prove otherwise. If we zoom into what
 

57
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,230
prove otherwise. If we zoom into what
we've had this current week, right,

58
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
we've had this current week, right,
 

59
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,590
we've had this current week, right,
we're into Friday. We have to think

60
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
we're into Friday. We have to think
 

61
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,710
we're into Friday. We have to think
about this current week. Here is Monday,

62
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
about this current week. Here is Monday,
 

63
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,110
about this current week. Here is Monday,
Tuesday,

64
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
Tuesday,
 

65
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,830
Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Wednesday is the bar

66
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
Wednesday, and Wednesday is the bar
 

67
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,350
Wednesday, and Wednesday is the bar
right now, which is kind of setting the

68
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
right now, which is kind of setting the
 

69
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,070
right now, which is kind of setting the
tone for the week. So Thursday, like we

70
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
tone for the week. So Thursday, like we
 

71
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,270
tone for the week. So Thursday, like we
talked about yesterday, was highly

72
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
talked about yesterday, was highly
 

73
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,350
talked about yesterday, was highly
likely to be inside of Wednesday. We

74
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
likely to be inside of Wednesday. We
 

75
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,070
likely to be inside of Wednesday. We
currently have Friday inside of Thursday

76
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
currently have Friday inside of Thursday
 

77
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,790
currently have Friday inside of Thursday
and inside of Wednesday. All right, so

78
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
and inside of Wednesday. All right, so
 

79
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,469
and inside of Wednesday. All right, so
this is the rotation. You can see every

80
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
this is the rotation. You can see every
 

81
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,230
this is the rotation. You can see every
time we've poked up into here, we found

82
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
time we've poked up into here, we found
 

83
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,510
time we've poked up into here, we found
sellers. All right, we found sellers

84
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
sellers. All right, we found sellers
 

85
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,150
sellers. All right, we found sellers
here on Tuesday and Wednesday and

86
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
here on Tuesday and Wednesday and
 

87
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,950
here on Tuesday and Wednesday and
Thursday. Has this supply been chewed

88
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
Thursday. Has this supply been chewed
 

89
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,590
Thursday. Has this supply been chewed
through enough or is it time for a bit

90
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
through enough or is it time for a bit
 

91
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,870
through enough or is it time for a bit
of a bigger push? Time will tell. Um,

92
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
of a bigger push? Time will tell. Um,
 

93
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,070
of a bigger push? Time will tell. Um,
we're going to talk about these bowls.

94
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
we're going to talk about these bowls.
 

95
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,990
we're going to talk about these bowls.
All right, they're starting to come into

96
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
All right, they're starting to come into
 

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,230
All right, they're starting to come into
compression. So the longer we sit here,

98
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
compression. So the longer we sit here,
 

99
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,590
compression. So the longer we sit here,
the more these bowls are going to start

100
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
the more these bowls are going to start
 

101
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,590
the more these bowls are going to start
joining. So you might see by next week

102
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
joining. So you might see by next week
 

103
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,790
joining. So you might see by next week
it's going to be a light trading week,

104
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
it's going to be a light trading week,
 

105
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,189
it's going to be a light trading week,
but maybe by next week we end up being

106
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
but maybe by next week we end up being
 

107
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,350
but maybe by next week we end up being
somewhere like this. So we have

108
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
somewhere like this. So we have
 

109
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,189
somewhere like this. So we have
compression in the Ballingers and then

110
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
compression in the Ballingers and then
 

111
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,430
compression in the Ballingers and then
they will start to open up once we break

112
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
they will start to open up once we break
 

113
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,950
they will start to open up once we break
either side of it. So everything's

114
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
either side of it. So everything's
 

115
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,870
either side of it. So everything's
starting to coil and tighten up in this

116
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
starting to coil and tighten up in this
 

117
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,029
starting to coil and tighten up in this
market.

118
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
market.
 

119
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,790
market.
Um things to be aware of today. All

120
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
Um things to be aware of today. All
 

121
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,710
Um things to be aware of today. All
right, it is uh rollover triple

122
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
right, it is uh rollover triple
 

123
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,790
right, it is uh rollover triple
witching. All right, historically quad

124
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
witching. All right, historically quad
 

125
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,870
witching. All right, historically quad
but triple now. Right, so you've got all

126
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
but triple now. Right, so you've got all

129
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,550
contracts rolling over today. It's
expiry day

130
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,909
also for uh futures. All right, there
are over $7 trillion at play right now

140
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
are over $7 trillion at play right now
 

141
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,629
are over $7 trillion at play right now
expiring today in the options market. So

142
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
expiring today in the options market. So
 

143
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,870
expiring today in the options market. So
don't be surprised to see some wonky

144
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
don't be surprised to see some wonky
 

145
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,629
don't be surprised to see some wonky
moves. All right. Some pushes that fail,

146
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
moves. All right. Some pushes that fail,
 

147
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,590
moves. All right. Some pushes that fail,
some dips that rip. Like it all depends

148
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
some dips that rip. Like it all depends
 

149
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,909
some dips that rip. Like it all depends
where these funds need to pin price or

150
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
where these funds need to pin price or
 

151
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,909
where these funds need to pin price or
if they need to pin price. It is indeed

152
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
if they need to pin price. It is indeed
 

153
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,270
if they need to pin price. It is indeed
I just see someone say that apparently

154
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
I just see someone say that apparently
 

155
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,870
I just see someone say that apparently
the largest ever. It is indeed the

156
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
the largest ever. It is indeed the
 

157
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,749
the largest ever. It is indeed the
largest ever options expiry. Options uh

158
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
largest ever options expiry. Options uh
 

159
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,430
largest ever options expiry. Options uh
markets getting bigger and bigger mainly

160
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
markets getting bigger and bigger mainly
 

161
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,830
markets getting bigger and bigger mainly
due to the zero DTE. There's been a lot

162
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
due to the zero DTE. There's been a lot
 

163
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,870
due to the zero DTE. There's been a lot
of hedging taking place over the last uh

164
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
of hedging taking place over the last uh
 

165
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,029
of hedging taking place over the last uh
couple weeks definitely if not months.

166
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039
couple weeks definitely if not months.
 

167
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,790
couple weeks definitely if not months.
All right. And it has been a bit bit

168
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
All right. And it has been a bit bit
 

169
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,550
All right. And it has been a bit bit
heavier than recent than um in recent

170
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
heavier than recent than um in recent
 

171
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,710
heavier than recent than um in recent
times on the put ratio. Okay. Okay,

172
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
times on the put ratio. Okay. Okay,
 

173
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,710
times on the put ratio. Okay. Okay,
let's move into the hourly chart. We'll

174
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:46,720
let's move into the hourly chart. We'll
 

175
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,790
let's move into the hourly chart. We'll
go over the current week, right? So, you

176
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
go over the current week, right? So, you
 

177
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,150
go over the current week, right? So, you
can see current week's profile,

178
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
can see current week's profile,
 

179
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,710
can see current week's profile,
developing profile, nice big D-shape. No

180
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
developing profile, nice big D-shape. No
 

181
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,870
developing profile, nice big D-shape. No
acceptance below, no acceptance above.

182
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
acceptance below, no acceptance above.
 

183
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,550
acceptance below, no acceptance above.
All right, this is a rotational market

184
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
All right, this is a rotational market
 

185
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,390
All right, this is a rotational market
in the current week. Profiles telling

186
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
in the current week. Profiles telling
 

187
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,710
in the current week. Profiles telling
you the current week is in a rotational

188
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
you the current week is in a rotational
 

189
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,950
you the current week is in a rotational
market. If we look at the previous day

190
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
market. If we look at the previous day
 

191
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,230
market. If we look at the previous day
value, well, it's right here. All right,

192
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
value, well, it's right here. All right,
 

193
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,070
value, well, it's right here. All right,
so the only people that are stuck right

194
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
so the only people that are stuck right
 

195
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,670
so the only people that are stuck right
now are these shorts from Wednesday.

196
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
now are these shorts from Wednesday.
 

197
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,990
now are these shorts from Wednesday.
This is why we played long off their

198
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
This is why we played long off their
 

199
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,749
This is why we played long off their
pain point yesterday. So every pain

200
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
pain point yesterday. So every pain
 

201
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,749
pain point yesterday. So every pain
point into here, we were long back up

202
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:15,759
point into here, we were long back up
 

203
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,830
point into here, we were long back up
inside. You can see no breakout of the

204
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
inside. You can see no breakout of the
 

205
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,510
inside. You can see no breakout of the
top side. Why? Because we're in range.

206
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
top side. Why? Because we're in range.
 

207
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,510
top side. Why? Because we're in range.
Nothing's changed. All right. So those

208
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
Nothing's changed. All right. So those
 

209
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,710
Nothing's changed. All right. So those
that were here yesterday, nothing's

210
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:24,720
that were here yesterday, nothing's
 

211
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,870
that were here yesterday, nothing's
changed. We are in exactly the same

212
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
changed. We are in exactly the same
 

213
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,029
changed. We are in exactly the same
situation. Literally, quite literally,

214
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
situation. Literally, quite literally,
 

215
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,550
situation. Literally, quite literally,
absolutely nothing has changed. We might

216
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
absolutely nothing has changed. We might
 

217
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,469
absolutely nothing has changed. We might
be opening up, well, open up almost

218
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
be opening up, well, open up almost
 

219
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,629
be opening up, well, open up almost
identical to yesterday. So what are the

220
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:34,639
identical to yesterday. So what are the
 

221
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,870
identical to yesterday. So what are the
plays? You need to be very aware of

222
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
plays? You need to be very aware of
 

223
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,870
plays? You need to be very aware of
breakouts and failed breakouts today.

224
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
breakouts and failed breakouts today.
 

225
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,390
breakouts and failed breakouts today.
All right. If we're in a range and

226
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
All right. If we're in a range and
 

227
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,790
All right. If we're in a range and
they're going to keep us in a range,

228
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
they're going to keep us in a range,
 

229
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,430
they're going to keep us in a range,
failures are often how we're going to

230
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
failures are often how we're going to
 

231
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,990
failures are often how we're going to
play it. It doesn't have to do that. All

232
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
play it. It doesn't have to do that. All
 

233
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,790
play it. It doesn't have to do that. All
right. The hard thing right now is we

234
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,800
right. The hard thing right now is we
 

235
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,189
right. The hard thing right now is we
are quite clearly in a strong downtrend.

236
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,199
are quite clearly in a strong downtrend.
 

237
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,749
are quite clearly in a strong downtrend.
All right. You got a series of lower

238
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
All right. You got a series of lower
 

239
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,510
All right. You got a series of lower
highs and lower lows and lower highs and

240
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:57,520
highs and lower lows and lower highs and
 

241
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,110
highs and lower lows and lower highs and
lower lows and lower highs and lower

242
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120
lower lows and lower highs and lower
 

243
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,990
lower lows and lower highs and lower
lows. But this is where it gets tricky.

244
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
lows. But this is where it gets tricky.
 

245
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,950
lows. But this is where it gets tricky.
If we think about this rotation,

246
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
If we think about this rotation,
 

247
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,710
If we think about this rotation,
because if you zoom right out,

248
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
because if you zoom right out,
 

249
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,110
because if you zoom right out,
we hit the 61,

250
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
we hit the 61,
 

251
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,350
we hit the 61,
right? And we bid off it. If we think

252
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
right? And we bid off it. If we think
 

253
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,309
right? And we bid off it. If we think
about this rotation,

254
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319

 

255
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,990

we're into golden zone and we're

256
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000
we're into golden zone and we're
 

257
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,790
we're into golden zone and we're
starting to hold. This is where it gets

258
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
starting to hold. This is where it gets
 

259
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,469
starting to hold. This is where it gets
tricky. If bulls are going to do

260
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
tricky. If bulls are going to do
 

261
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,150
tricky. If bulls are going to do
something here, all right, if they're

262
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
something here, all right, if they're
 

263
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,670
something here, all right, if they're
going to try and be like, we want the

264
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
going to try and be like, we want the
 

265
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,230
going to try and be like, we want the
end to this, right? then they need to

266
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
end to this, right? then they need to
 

267
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,870
end to this, right? then they need to
hold this range here and try and and try

268
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
hold this range here and try and and try
 

269
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,909
hold this range here and try and and try
and cause a squeeze out right. They

270
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
and cause a squeeze out right. They
 

271
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,190
and cause a squeeze out right. They
might be better letting it come back

272
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
might be better letting it come back
 

273
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,870
might be better letting it come back
down into here trapping bears and

274
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
down into here trapping bears and
 

275
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,029
down into here trapping bears and
reclaiming to do it. So that's one thing

276
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
reclaiming to do it. So that's one thing
 

277
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,990
reclaiming to do it. So that's one thing
I'm very very aware of. Um they will

278
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm very very aware of. Um they will
 

279
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,590
I'm very very aware of. Um they will
want the break of fours or whatever it

280
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
want the break of fours or whatever it
 

281
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,269
want the break of fours or whatever it
was yesterday. 410 was where those big

282
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
was yesterday. 410 was where those big
 

283
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,470
was yesterday. 410 was where those big
players were. Right? If they can get

284
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
players were. Right? If they can get
 

285
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,470
players were. Right? If they can get
through 410, 430, 440 to 500, that's the

286
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
through 410, 430, 440 to 500, that's the
 

287
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,550
through 410, 430, 440 to 500, that's the
big level, right? If they can get here,

288
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
big level, right? If they can get here,
 

289
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,310
big level, right? If they can get here,
then we wait and see how they act. Are

290
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
then we wait and see how they act. Are
 

291
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,630
then we wait and see how they act. Are
they then able to cause a squeeze up

292
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
they then able to cause a squeeze up
 

293
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,910
they then able to cause a squeeze up
into sort of 480s, 600s? Does that right

294
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:03,920
into sort of 480s, 600s? Does that right
 

295
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,949
into sort of 480s, 600s? Does that right
is 500 or even 410 or 600 used as a big

296
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:08,959
is 500 or even 410 or 600 used as a big
 

297
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,670
is 500 or even 410 or 600 used as a big
bull trap that bears come down and say

298
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
bull trap that bears come down and say
 

299
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,389
bull trap that bears come down and say
no, no, no, no, no. Back into range you

300
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
no, no, no, no, no. Back into range you
 

301
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,870
no, no, no, no, no. Back into range you
go. Very, very possible. All right.

302
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:16,880
go. Very, very possible. All right.
 

303
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,949
go. Very, very possible. All right.
Very, very, very possible. So, you have

304
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
Very, very, very possible. So, you have
 

305
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,710
Very, very, very possible. So, you have
to be flexible today and willing to be

306
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:20,720
to be flexible today and willing to be
 

307
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,230
to be flexible today and willing to be
to play both sides. If you're going to

308
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
to play both sides. If you're going to
 

309
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,150
to play both sides. If you're going to
play, I would say size down. Whatever

310
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
play, I would say size down. Whatever
 

311
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,829
play, I would say size down. Whatever
contract size you're thinking of using,

312
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839
contract size you're thinking of using,
 

313
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,550
contract size you're thinking of using,
half it because uh today could get a

little bit wild, especially as we get
 

317
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,509
little bit wild, especially as we get
closer into the close. These are

a decade. Okay. But quite possibly, like
 

351
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,389

I said, crowded trade. Everyone was

If you go back and historically look, it

00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
If you go back and historically look, it
 

359
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,069
If you go back and historically look, it
can take a while for that to take

00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:20,079
can take a while for that to take

363
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,310
effect. they're really going to start
unwinding. Um, but probably the dramatic

00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
unwinding. Um, but probably the dramatic
 

365
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,550
unwinding. Um, but probably the dramatic

371
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,990
relief right in Asia
we come to here. What was it? 11:00 I

372
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,000
we come to here. What was it? 11:00 I
 

373
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,350
we come to here. What was it? 11:00 I
think it hit or maybe it was here. There

374
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
think it hit or maybe it was here. There
 

375
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,269
think it hit or maybe it was here. There
you go. 10:00 it came early. Right. We

376
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,279
you go. 10:00 it came early. Right. We
 

377
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,870
you go. 10:00 it came early. Right. We
saw relief in the market where everyone

378
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
saw relief in the market where everyone
 

379
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,550
saw relief in the market where everyone
was thinking, "Oh, we're going to die."

380
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
was thinking, "Oh, we're going to die."
 

381
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,150
was thinking, "Oh, we're going to die."
Well, we're above the 200. We're above

382
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
Well, we're above the 200. We're above
 

383
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,230
Well, we're above the 200. We're above
the 5day. We've already priced it in.

384
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
the 5day. We've already priced it in.
 

385
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,389
the 5day. We've already priced it in.
We're seeing relief and relief. All

386
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
We're seeing relief and relief. All
 

387
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,750
We're seeing relief and relief. All
right. So that's the one thing to be

388
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
right. So that's the one thing to be
 

389
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,550
right. So that's the one thing to be
aware of and you're seeing it now

390
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560
aware of and you're seeing it now
 

391
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,110
aware of and you're seeing it now
continuation to drive up. So overnight

392
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
continuation to drive up. So overnight
 

393
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,750
continuation to drive up. So overnight
we really we saw relief but it's inside

394
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
we really we saw relief but it's inside
 

395
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,710
we really we saw relief but it's inside

the big wall came back down found a

400
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
the big wall came back down found a
 

401
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,389
the big wall came back down found a
rebid and we're going to go up and visit

402
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
rebid and we're going to go up and visit
 

403
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,710
rebid and we're going to go up and visit
it again. So this would be one two three

404
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
it again. So this would be one two three
 

405
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,710
it again. So this would be one two three
fourth time up here. Just be aware of

406
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720
fourth time up here. Just be aware of
 

407
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,470
fourth time up here. Just be aware of
that. Eventually you wonder if there's

408
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:12,480
that. Eventually you wonder if there's
 

409
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,990
that. Eventually you wonder if there's
any sellers left up there. They're going

410
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
any sellers left up there. They're going
 

411
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,630
any sellers left up there. They're going
to start to exhaust themselves.

412
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
to start to exhaust themselves.
 

413
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,949
to start to exhaust themselves.
All right, let's go over some of the

414
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
All right, let's go over some of the
 

415
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,550
All right, let's go over some of the
other charts.

416
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560

 

417
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,230

We can have a look at ES relative

418
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
We can have a look at ES relative
 

419
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,990
We can have a look at ES relative
strength over here. This looks messy

420
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
strength over here. This looks messy
 

421
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,310
strength over here. This looks messy
down. Get rid of that all together to be

422
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
down. Get rid of that all together to be
 

423
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,389
down. Get rid of that all together to be
quite honest. Uh still maintains in that

424
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
quite honest. Uh still maintains in that
 

425
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,389
quite honest. Uh still maintains in that
downtrend. Very similar, right? Strong

426
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
downtrend. Very similar, right? Strong
 

427
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,150
downtrend. Very similar, right? Strong
downtrend, but the same kind of thing.

428
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160
downtrend, but the same kind of thing.
 

429
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,310
downtrend, but the same kind of thing.

435
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,310

437
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,829
tone. Six uh 6,900. I very much doubt we
get through that today. I would imagine

438
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:51,839
get through that today. I would imagine
 

439
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,630
get through that today. I would imagine
there's monster monster cool walls up

440

there's monster monster cool walls up
 

441
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,069
there's monster monster cool walls up
there, but that's what they are trying

442
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
there, but that's what they are trying
 

443
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,230
there, but that's what they are trying
to do, but same kind of thing. Have a

444
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
to do, but same kind of thing. Have a
 

445
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,630
to do, but same kind of thing. Have a
look at the spy. All right, you can see

446
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:00,640
look at the spy. All right, you can see
 

447
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,150
look at the spy. All right, you can see
that put wall. We never got into it

448
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,160
that put wall. We never got into it
 

449
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,750
that put wall. We never got into it
earlier in the week. We got close and

450
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
earlier in the week. We got close and
 

451
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,790
earlier in the week. We got close and
everyone covered into it. Um what did I

452
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
everyone covered into it. Um what did I
 

453
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,750
everyone covered into it. Um what did I
say yesterday evening? I did put the

454
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:09,760
say yesterday evening? I did put the
 

455
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,710
say yesterday evening? I did put the
gamma in. Let me just have a look

456
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
gamma in. Let me just have a look
 

457
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:21,509
gamma in. Let me just have a look
just a second.

461
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,470
600 QQQ to 615 are the big expiry walls
today on Q's. So 600. There you go.

462
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
today on Q's. So 600. There you go.

Didn't hit it to 615.
 

465
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,990
Didn't hit it to 615.
Right. See a big expiry is up here. If

Right. See a big expiry is up here. If
 

467

Right. See a big expiry is up here. If
we get over 6 615, we will go into

468
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
we get over 6 615, we will go into
 

469
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,230
we get over 6 615, we will go into
positive gamma and put potential

470
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
positive gamma and put potential
 

471
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,389
positive gamma and put potential
squeezes on. So that would be your 500

472
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
squeezes on. So that would be your 500
 

473
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,110
squeezes on. So that would be your 500
pivot basically on the ENQ, right? So

474
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
pivot basically on the ENQ, right? So
 

475
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,069
pivot basically on the ENQ, right? So
nice and easy um in terms of numbers to

476
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
nice and easy um in terms of numbers to
 

477
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,790
nice and easy um in terms of numbers to
think about. Let's look at the VIX.

478
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
think about. Let's look at the VIX.
 

479
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,710
think about. Let's look at the VIX.
Probably still dancing in range. Why

480
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:50,720
Probably still dancing in range. Why
 

481
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,350
Probably still dancing in range. Why
does it ruin these every day?

482
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360

 

483
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,870

All right, still just in a range. We

484
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880
All right, still just in a range. We
 

485
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,230
All right, still just in a range. We
just zoom out here. Nothing's changing

486
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
just zoom out here. Nothing's changing
 

487
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,629
just zoom out here. Nothing's changing
for a second. Right? You can just see

488
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
for a second. Right? You can just see
 

489
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,949
for a second. Right? You can just see
we're going pivot pivot pivot pivot.

490
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:04,959
we're going pivot pivot pivot pivot.
 

491
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,949
we're going pivot pivot pivot pivot.
Right? It can't find acceptance below.

492
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
Right? It can't find acceptance below.
 

493
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,870
Right? It can't find acceptance below.
It can't find acceptance above 1750 to

494
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
It can't find acceptance above 1750 to
 

495
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,910
It can't find acceptance above 1750 to
let's just call it 16 or 1550.

496
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
let's just call it 16 or 1550.
 

497
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,829
let's just call it 16 or 1550.
That's the rotation. That's the chop.

498
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
That's the rotation. That's the chop.
 

499
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,110
That's the rotation. That's the chop.
That's why we're getting this sort of

500
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
That's why we're getting this sort of
 

501
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,110
That's why we're getting this sort of
sloppy.

502
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
sloppy.
 

503
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,550
sloppy.
I wouldn't know what to call it really.

504
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:20,560
I wouldn't know what to call it really.
 

505
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,870
I wouldn't know what to call it really.
Aggressive aggressive slop. Aggressive

506
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
Aggressive aggressive slop. Aggressive
 

507
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,110
Aggressive aggressive slop. Aggressive
slop maybe is what we call it. Uh let's

508
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,120
slop maybe is what we call it. Uh let's
 

509
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,870
slop maybe is what we call it. Uh let's
just have a look quickly here. Okay.

510
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880
just have a look quickly here. Okay.
 

511
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,389
just have a look quickly here. Okay.
Still fading back in. Still holding

512
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
Still fading back in. Still holding
 

513
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,550
Still fading back in. Still holding
this. Still haven't broken out of this

514
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
this. Still haven't broken out of this
 

515
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,710
this. Still haven't broken out of this
is where disaster strikes in my mind.

516
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
is where disaster strikes in my mind.
 

517
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,430
is where disaster strikes in my mind.
So, still got price alerts. Oh, maybe I

518
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
So, still got price alerts. Oh, maybe I
 

519
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,710
So, still got price alerts. Oh, maybe I
just deleted that. Still got price

520
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:38,720
just deleted that. Still got price
 

521
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,190
just deleted that. Still got price
alerts up here. Let's put that back on.

522
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:43,200

 

523
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,910

All right, let's have a look at the mag.

524
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:47,920

 

525
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,389

Most of them opening up flat, I think.

526
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:52,399
Most of them opening up flat, I think.
 

527
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,350
Most of them opening up flat, I think.
Yeah. So, slight gap down. I'm just

528
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
Yeah. So, slight gap down. I'm just
 

529
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,790
Yeah. So, slight gap down. I'm just
going to call it flat in Apple. Uh if we

530
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
going to call it flat in Apple. Uh if we
 

531
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,990
going to call it flat in Apple. Uh if we
zoom out, it's into this key chop. If it

532
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
zoom out, it's into this key chop. If it
 

533
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,509
zoom out, it's into this key chop. If it
holds this, we've got that same kind of

534
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:03,519
holds this, we've got that same kind of
 

535
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,949
holds this, we've got that same kind of
downtrend. Relief will be there. It

536
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
downtrend. Relief will be there. It
 

537
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,310
downtrend. Relief will be there. It
doesn't have to come today. Might not

538
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
doesn't have to come today. Might not
 

539
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,910
doesn't have to come today. Might not
come at all, but that's where the relief

540
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
come at all, but that's where the relief
 

541
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,110
come at all, but that's where the relief
will come. Amazon, that looks a bit

542
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
will come. Amazon, that looks a bit
 

543
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,030
will come. Amazon, that looks a bit
stronger than the others right now. So,

544
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
stronger than the others right now. So,
 

545
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,269
stronger than the others right now. So,
we've got that sort of W shape double

546
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
we've got that sort of W shape double
 

547
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,509
we've got that sort of W shape double
bottom holding a possible higher low.

548
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
bottom holding a possible higher low.
 

549
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,030
bottom holding a possible higher low.
It's looking for relief out. That looks

550
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040
It's looking for relief out. That looks
 

551
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,870
It's looking for relief out. That looks
better. GooG,

552
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:24,880

 

553
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,430

not great. inside the range still, but

554
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
not great. inside the range still, but
 

555
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,430
not great. inside the range still, but
it's trying. It's gonna have an attempt

556
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:29,440
it's trying. It's gonna have an attempt
 

557
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,790
it's trying. It's gonna have an attempt
to get into this, but you got lots of

558
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
to get into this, but you got lots of
 

559
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,350
to get into this, but you got lots of
stuck buyers up there right now. Uh Meta

560
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360
stuck buyers up there right now. Uh Meta
 

561
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,870
stuck buyers up there right now. Uh Meta
being aggressive.

562
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:38,880

 

563
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,389

That's a good hold. Still inside

564
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
That's a good hold. Still inside
 

565
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,750
That's a good hold. Still inside
yesterday's range, but that's a good

566
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,760
yesterday's range, but that's a good
 

567
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,990
yesterday's range, but that's a good
hold. Uh so all the time Meta's holding

568
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
hold. Uh so all the time Meta's holding
 

569
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,550
hold. Uh so all the time Meta's holding
above 660, you look okay for relief.

570
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
above 660, you look okay for relief.
 

571
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,550
above 660, you look okay for relief.
Microsoft, same kind of story here.

572
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:50,560
Microsoft, same kind of story here.
 

573
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,990
Microsoft, same kind of story here.
You're seeing the same pattern here set

574
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
You're seeing the same pattern here set
 

575
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,430
You're seeing the same pattern here set
up over and over and over again. All

576
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
up over and over and over again. All
 

577
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,030
up over and over and over again. All
right, they've all a lot of these have

578
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
right, they've all a lot of these have
 

579
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,389
right, they've all a lot of these have
sort of feel like they might have

580
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
sort of feel like they might have
 

581
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,069
sort of feel like they might have
bottomed out. They yesterday they start

582
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:58,079
bottomed out. They yesterday they start
 

583
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,069
bottomed out. They yesterday they start
to get a run up as long as they can hold

584
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079
to get a run up as long as they can hold
 

585
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,750
to get a run up as long as they can hold
a base. They've got a chance to come and

586
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:01,760
a base. They've got a chance to come and
 

587
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,509
a base. They've got a chance to come and
test the top side of these ranges. This

588
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519
test the top side of these ranges. This
 

589
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,509
test the top side of these ranges. This
is the equivalent of the 500 level that

590
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
is the equivalent of the 500 level that
 

591
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,509
is the equivalent of the 500 level that
we're looking at in the cues, right? So,

592
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
we're looking at in the cues, right? So,
 

593
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,030
we're looking at in the cues, right? So,
all depends if all the market wants to

594
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,040
all depends if all the market wants to
 

595
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,030
all depends if all the market wants to
move up to supply and what happens when

596
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
move up to supply and what happens when
 

597
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,269
move up to supply and what happens when
we get up there. Uh, well, it's back

598
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
we get up there. Uh, well, it's back
 

599
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,829
we get up there. Uh, well, it's back
inside of 75ish

600
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:15,839
inside of 75ish
 

601
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,829
inside of 75ish
and that's where it needs to stay on

602
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839
and that's where it needs to stay on
 

603
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,230
and that's where it needs to stay on
Nvidia. All right. Needs to stay inside

604
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,240
Nvidia. All right. Needs to stay inside
 

605
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,470
Nvidia. All right. Needs to stay inside
of this to see relief and needs to get

606
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
of this to see relief and needs to get
 

607
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,430
of this to see relief and needs to get
over 78. Right. Over 78. Let's set

608
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
over 78. Right. Over 78. Let's set
 

609
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:38,069
over 78. Right. Over 78. Let's set
another alert there. Over 78.

610
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:38,079

 

611
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,790

It's got a chance.

612
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:40,800
It's got a chance.
 

613
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,790
It's got a chance.
Got four minutes over 78. It's got a

614
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:42,800
Got four minutes over 78. It's got a
 

615
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,750
Got four minutes over 78. It's got a
chance. Tesla looks really good. Really,

616
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:45,760
chance. Tesla looks really good. Really,
 

617
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,949
chance. Tesla looks really good. Really,
really, really good. All right. That

618
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
really, really good. All right. That
 

619
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,790
really, really good. All right. That
one's 500. It is as simple as that.

620
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:48,800
one's 500. It is as simple as that.
 

621
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,870
one's 500. It is as simple as that.
Breaking out on all time frames. Uh

So just waiting for us to get into the

720
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
So just waiting for us to get into the
 

721
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,590
So just waiting for us to get into the
open here. We are currently holding

722
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:33,600
open here. We are currently holding
 

723
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,990
open here. We are currently holding
previous day's value. So you know if we

724
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
previous day's value. So you know if we
 

725
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,909
previous day's value. So you know if we
hold a bid here it means they will look

726
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:37,919
hold a bid here it means they will look
 

727
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,150
hold a bid here it means they will look
to try and expand yesterday's value.

728
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
to try and expand yesterday's value.
 

729
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,750
to try and expand yesterday's value.
We've got all this supply overhead that

730
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:41,760
We've got all this supply overhead that
 

731
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,510
We've got all this supply overhead that
we got stuck at yesterday and this is

732
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:43,520
we got stuck at yesterday and this is
 

733
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,990
we got stuck at yesterday and this is
the current week value. Just think about

734
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,000
the current week value. Just think about
 

735
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,590
the current week value. Just think about
that.

736
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:47,600
that.
 

737
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,190
that.
Yes, exactly the same. We're looking at

738
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,200
Yes, exactly the same. We're looking at
 

739
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,870
Yes, exactly the same. We're looking at
exactly the same kind of thing. Is it

740
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880
exactly the same kind of thing. Is it
 

741
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,510
exactly the same kind of thing. Is it
going to hold previous day value? Can it

742
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:53,520
going to hold previous day value? Can it
 

743
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,350
going to hold previous day value? Can it
hold the PDC

744
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:55,360
hold the PDC
 

745
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,909
hold the PDC
uh 830s and reach up into 855s and

746
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
uh 830s and reach up into 855s and
 

747
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,909
uh 830s and reach up into 855s and
potentially 870s? That's what it's

748
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:01,919
potentially 870s? That's what it's
 

749
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,350
potentially 870s? That's what it's
trying to do. Whether it can do it or

750
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,360
trying to do. Whether it can do it or
 

751
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,590
trying to do. Whether it can do it or
not is a whole different thing. Getting

752
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:05,600
not is a whole different thing. Getting
 

753
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,470
not is a whole different thing. Getting
a bit whippy here into the open as we

754
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
a bit whippy here into the open as we
 

755
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,630
a bit whippy here into the open as we
reach up into this supply block above

756
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:10,640
reach up into this supply block above
 

757
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,909
reach up into this supply block above
and GlobeEx and we just see what we get.

758
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:13,919
and GlobeEx and we just see what we get.
 

759
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,510
and GlobeEx and we just see what we get.
All depends if we're going to hold above

760
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520
All depends if we're going to hold above
 

761
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,990
All depends if we're going to hold above
value or we're going to go back inside

762
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
value or we're going to go back inside
 

763
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,350
value or we're going to go back inside
previous days value. We're already

764
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,360
previous days value. We're already
 

765
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,310
previous days value. We're already
inside the current week value.

winner this morning, Tesla and Nvidia,
 

781
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,190
winner this morning, Tesla and Nvidia,
they had a big gapping up and Oracle

782
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
they had a big gapping up and Oracle
 

783
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,070
they had a big gapping up and Oracle
obviously almost 5% up. So into this

784
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,080
obviously almost 5% up. So into this
 

785
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,669
obviously almost 5% up. So into this
sort of supply block we got stuck at

786
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
sort of supply block we got stuck at
 

787
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,549
sort of supply block we got stuck at
yesterday.

788
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
yesterday.
 

789
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,909
yesterday.
Um, we just want to see if we're going

790
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
Um, we just want to see if we're going
 

791
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,110
Um, we just want to see if we're going
to hold bids this morning for a drive up

792
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,120
to hold bids this morning for a drive up
 

793
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,710
to hold bids this morning for a drive up
or not. Uh, that's what the market

794
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:52,720
or not. Uh, that's what the market
 

795
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,150
or not. Uh, that's what the market
probably wants to do if it's going to

796
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160
probably wants to do if it's going to
 

797
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,990
probably wants to do if it's going to
find relief.

798
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,000
find relief.
 

799
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,270
find relief.
It's going to have to hold bids for

800
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,280
It's going to have to hold bids for
 

801
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,270
It's going to have to hold bids for
drives up if it's going to uh find

802
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
drives up if it's going to uh find
 

803
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,150
drives up if it's going to uh find
relief today. Remember 410 big level

804
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,160
relief today. Remember 410 big level
 

805
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,830
relief today. Remember 410 big level
yesterday where we had that trap bar

806
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:03,840
yesterday where we had that trap bar
 

807
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,190
yesterday where we had that trap bar
yesterday. If we start getting through

808
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,200
yesterday. If we start getting through
 

809
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,070
yesterday. If we start getting through
that, this is value area high on the

810
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080
that, this is value area high on the
 

811
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,830
that, this is value area high on the
current week 30s and then we can think

812
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840
current week 30s and then we can think
 

813
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,950
current week 30s and then we can think
about um 500s. But yesterday we could

814
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:12,960
about um 500s. But yesterday we could
 

815
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,549
about um 500s. But yesterday we could
not get through this block here. This

816
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:14,559
not get through this block here. This
 

817
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,630
not get through this block here. This
was constantly being faded. So be aware

818
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:16,640
was constantly being faded. So be aware
 

819
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,029
was constantly being faded. So be aware
of that.

820
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:21,039

 

821
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,870

If we start holding prints above it, it

822
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
If we start holding prints above it, it
 

823
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,870
If we start holding prints above it, it
is possible that we're going to go. All

824
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:24,880
is possible that we're going to go. All
 

825
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,710
is possible that we're going to go. All
right. So next level, if we can hold

826
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:26,720
right. So next level, if we can hold
 

827
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,590
right. So next level, if we can hold
prints above 410, we're looking at 30s.

828
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:29,600
prints above 410, we're looking at 30s.
 

829
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,310
prints above 410, we're looking at 30s.
So watching this now into the 10. Are we

830
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320
So watching this now into the 10. Are we
 

831
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,750
So watching this now into the 10. Are we
going to get an early morning squeeze up

832
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,760
going to get an early morning squeeze up
 

833
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,070
going to get an early morning squeeze up
into 30s is the question.

834
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,080

 

835
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,909

Big buying coming up here. Big seller

836
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919
Big buying coming up here. Big seller
 

837
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,750
Big buying coming up here. Big seller
just got stuck here. Can they hold above

838
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:41,760
just got stuck here. Can they hold above
 

839
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,430
just got stuck here. Can they hold above
16s? That's his print there.

840
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,440
16s? That's his print there.
 

841
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,430
16s? That's his print there.
16s is the level now. Looking for 30s.

842
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:49,440
16s is the level now. Looking for 30s.
 

843
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,750
16s is the level now. Looking for 30s.
So in this

844
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:51,760
So in this
 

845
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,909
So in this
trimming some here and if we get through

846
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:53,919
trimming some here and if we get through
 

847
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,270
trimming some here and if we get through
30s, we're going to look for more

848
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,280
30s, we're going to look for more
 

849
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,350
30s, we're going to look for more
upside.

850
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,360
upside.
 

851
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,669
upside.
Really nice into 30s. This is current

852
00:20:59,669 --> 00:20:59,679
Really nice into 30s. This is current
 

853
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,590
Really nice into 30s. This is current
week. So trimming some here. And if we

854
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
week. So trimming some here. And if we
 

855
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,990
week. So trimming some here. And if we
drop below 16, I'm out. I'm out now.

856
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,000
drop below 16, I'm out. I'm out now.
 

857
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,669
drop below 16, I'm out. I'm out now.
Just a little squeeze here to start the

858
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:05,679
Just a little squeeze here to start the
 

859
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,549
Just a little squeeze here to start the
day. Just on one account.

860
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:08,559
day. Just on one account.
 

861
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,310
day. Just on one account.
Now we'll just wait. So, we hit current

862
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,320
Now we'll just wait. So, we hit current
 

863
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,029
Now we'll just wait. So, we hit current
uh value area high on the week. So, the

864
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
uh value area high on the week. So, the
 

865
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,710
uh value area high on the week. So, the
trade was just like an early squeeze up

866
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
trade was just like an early squeeze up
 

867
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,390
trade was just like an early squeeze up
into this. We might well get stuck here

868
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
into this. We might well get stuck here
 

869
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,909
into this. We might well get stuck here
and rotate all the way back down. If we

870
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:17,919
and rotate all the way back down. If we
 

871
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,270
and rotate all the way back down. If we
find acceptance here, then we're going

872
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,280
find acceptance here, then we're going
 

873
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,830
find acceptance here, then we're going
to think about a move into 500s, but

874
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:21,840
to think about a move into 500s, but
 

875
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,510
to think about a move into 500s, but
it's going to become very tricky to buy

876
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:23,520
it's going to become very tricky to buy
 

877
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,909
it's going to become very tricky to buy
up here. Now, I was just playing the

878
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:25,919
up here. Now, I was just playing the
 

879
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,149
up here. Now, I was just playing the
tape there. What I saw back into 30s.

880
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:28,159
tape there. What I saw back into 30s.
 

881
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,510
tape there. What I saw back into 30s.
You can see how big this level is at

882
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520
You can see how big this level is at
 

883
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,830
You can see how big this level is at
30s. They keep reacting here. That blue

884
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:31,840
30s. They keep reacting here. That blue
 

885
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,430
30s. They keep reacting here. That blue
line across your uh screen right now is

886
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
line across your uh screen right now is
 

887
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,669
line across your uh screen right now is
value area high on the current week. If

888
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
value area high on the current week. If
 

889
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,870
value area high on the current week. If
we get through this and base, we're

890
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
we get through this and base, we're
 

891
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,350
we get through this and base, we're
going to go for 500s. Um, unfortunately

892
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:41,360
going to go for 500s. Um, unfortunately
 

893
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,270
going to go for 500s. Um, unfortunately
got knocked out of this, but locked in

894
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280
got knocked out of this, but locked in
 

895
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,510
got knocked out of this, but locked in
some money there

896
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
some money there
 

897
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,350
some money there
into the 50s. Offside delta here at 50s.

898
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,360
into the 50s. Offside delta here at 50s.
 

899
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,950
into the 50s. Offside delta here at 50s.
Getting crushed here. Let's go then.

900
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:52,960
Getting crushed here. Let's go then.
 

901
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,190
Getting crushed here. Let's go then.
Love a dip now. Mother pluckers.

902
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
Love a dip now. Mother pluckers.
 

903
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,669
Love a dip now. Mother pluckers.
Always very careful if I do trade the

904
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
Always very careful if I do trade the
 

905
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,390
Always very careful if I do trade the
opening drive.

906
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,400
opening drive.
 

907
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,990
opening drive.
wasn't planning on doing it, but that

908
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,000
wasn't planning on doing it, but that
 

909
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,590
wasn't planning on doing it, but that
was a bit too obvious today to not take.

910
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:09,600
was a bit too obvious today to not take.
 

911
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,909
was a bit too obvious today to not take.
So, I'd say TW those 20s are now the

912
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:11,919
So, I'd say TW those 20s are now the
 

913
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,990
So, I'd say TW those 20s are now the
level. Uh buyers will need to hold above

914
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,000
level. Uh buyers will need to hold above
 

915
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,430
level. Uh buyers will need to hold above
20s

916
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:17,440

 

917
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,430

down here just based on footprint,

918
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,440
down here just based on footprint,
 

919
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,190
down here just based on footprint,
right? Just based on who got stuck

920
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,200
right? Just based on who got stuck
 

921
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,590
right? Just based on who got stuck
there. You might not see it in here.

922
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:23,600
there. You might not see it in here.
 

923
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,190
there. You might not see it in here.
Let's go to a one minute.

924
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,200
Let's go to a one minute.
 

925
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,870
Let's go to a one minute.
All right. Just these lot here. They got

926
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:28,880
All right. Just these lot here. They got
 

927
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,870
All right. Just these lot here. They got
stuck and this guy here. So, we're

928
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:30,880
stuck and this guy here. So, we're
 

929
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,270
stuck and this guy here. So, we're
getting stuck above 50s. Buyers will

930
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,280
getting stuck above 50s. Buyers will
 

931
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,789
getting stuck above 50s. Buyers will
need to hold these 20s, otherwise it's

932
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:34,799
need to hold these 20s, otherwise it's
 

933
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,070
need to hold these 20s, otherwise it's
going to be a problem. They're going to

935
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,070
going to be a problem. They're going to

937
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,510
search for for 500s if they can. At 500,

to 78 looks slightly. Wasn't that the

950
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,400
to 78 looks slightly. Wasn't that the
 

951
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,909
to 78 looks slightly. Wasn't that the
level that we just called for a squee

952
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:55,919
level that we just called for a squee
 

953
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,110
level that we just called for a squee
called for a squeeze out over?

954
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,120
called for a squeeze out over?
 

955
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,390
called for a squeeze out over?
Am I getting confused? Almost there.

956
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:02,400
Am I getting confused? Almost there.
 

957
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,750
Am I getting confused? Almost there.
Almost there. That's the squeeze out

958
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:03,760
Almost there. That's the squeeze out
 

959
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,510
Almost there. That's the squeeze out
level if it can get above and base above

960
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,520
level if it can get above and base above
 

961
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,909
level if it can get above and base above
that on Nvidia. So that's driving the

962
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:07,919
that on Nvidia. So that's driving the
 

963
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,190
that on Nvidia. So that's driving the
market up right now. But remember today

964
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:11,200
market up right now. But remember today
 

965
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,110
market up right now. But remember today
would not be surprised to see look above

966
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,120
would not be surprised to see look above
 

967
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,990
would not be surprised to see look above
and fail. It just depends what depends

968
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
and fail. It just depends what depends
 

969
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,190
and fail. It just depends what depends
where they're going to do that. Is it

970
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,200
where they're going to do that. Is it
 

971
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,710
where they're going to do that. Is it
over yesterday's level which we've just

972
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:18,720
over yesterday's level which we've just
 

973
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,070
over yesterday's level which we've just
done or is it over the 500s?

974
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,080

 

975
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,190

Back down towards these 20s. Remember,

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,190
Back down towards these 20s. Remember,
this is where the sellers got stuck. And

978

this is where the sellers got stuck. And
 

979
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,630
this is where the sellers got stuck. And
if we get under that, we're probably

980
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:30,640
if we get under that, we're probably
 

981

and he's pulled his bid. There you go.

1088
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:40,880
and he's pulled his bid. There you go.
 

1089
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,110
and he's pulled his bid. There you go.
So he's out

1090
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,120
So he's out
 

1091
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,870
So he's out
back down to value area low. This is

1092
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:44,880
back down to value area low. This is
 

1093
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,390
back down to value area low. This is
starting to look more and more messy by

1094
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:46,400
starting to look more and more messy by
 

1095
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,149
starting to look more and more messy by
the minute. So not surprising with OPEX.

1096
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:50,159
the minute. So not surprising with OPEX.
 

1097
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,669
the minute. So not surprising with OPEX.
So we're going to test this entry point

1098
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:51,679
So we're going to test this entry point
 

1099
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,310
So we're going to test this entry point
at 42s again and see if this is a trap.

1100
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,320
at 42s again and see if this is a trap.
 

1101
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,149
at 42s again and see if this is a trap.
And if not, sellers should sell through

1102
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:56,159
And if not, sellers should sell through
 

1103
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,830
And if not, sellers should sell through
now.

1104
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:57,840
now.
 

1105
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,830
now.
If they can stay underneath 42s,

1106
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:01,840
If they can stay underneath 42s,
 

1107
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,909
If they can stay underneath 42s,
that's their job at the moment.

1108
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:07,919

 

1109
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,830

And if we start coming back under VWAP

1110
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:09,840
And if we start coming back under VWAP
 

1111
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,750
And if we start coming back under VWAP
from previous day high, then you know

1112
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:11,760
from previous day high, then you know
 

1113
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,110
from previous day high, then you know
this will be the look above and fail

1114
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,120
this will be the look above and fail
 

1115
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,269
this will be the look above and fail
that we talked about. This red box

1116
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:15,279
that we talked about. This red box
 

1117
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,110
that we talked about. This red box
should become support. So if this does

1118
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,120
should become support. So if this does
 

1119
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,430
should become support. So if this does
not become support, all right, then this

1120
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,440
not become support, all right, then this
 

1121
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,110
not become support, all right, then this
will be the look above we talked about

1122
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,120
will be the look above we talked about
 

1123
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,230
will be the look above we talked about
this morning. This will be the look

1124
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,240
this morning. This will be the look
 

1125
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,990
this morning. This will be the look
above and fail if we start seeing one of

1126
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,000
above and fail if we start seeing one of
 

1127
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,990
above and fail if we start seeing one of
these. All right, which is why I wanted

1128
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,000
these. All right, which is why I wanted
 

1129
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,390
these. All right, which is why I wanted
to be very careful trimming my profits,

1130
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:28,400
to be very careful trimming my profits,
 

1131
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,149
to be very careful trimming my profits,
hoping we got all the way up to 500. We

1132
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:30,159
hoping we got all the way up to 500. We
 

1133
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,470
hoping we got all the way up to 500. We
didn't. The shift in the tape started to

1134
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:32,480
didn't. The shift in the tape started to
 

1135
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,149
didn't. The shift in the tape started to
come.

1136
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:36,159

 

1137
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,830

It just depends if we see this. Oh, I

1138
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:37,840
It just depends if we see this. Oh, I
 

1139
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,669
It just depends if we see this. Oh, I
just thought I just turned that. If we

1140
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:39,679
just thought I just turned that. If we
 

1141
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,750
just thought I just turned that. If we
see this become support now or not. Can

1142
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:41,760
see this become support now or not. Can
 

1143
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,510
see this become support now or not. Can
they offer this as a support range?

1144
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:45,520
they offer this as a support range?
 

1145
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,310
they offer this as a support range?
sure it's correct.

1146
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:48,320
sure it's correct.
 

1147
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,070
sure it's correct.
All right. So, do they hold dips into

1148
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,080
All right. So, do they hold dips into
 

1149
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,990
All right. So, do they hold dips into
these levels? Now, that is your

1150
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,000
these levels? Now, that is your
 

1151
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,149
these levels? Now, that is your
question.

1152
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:54,159
question.
 

1153
00:26:54,159 --> 00:27:00,710
question.
And if not, it's the look above and bel

1154
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:00,720

 

1155
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,190

we're buying very high right now. If you

1156
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,200
we're buying very high right now. If you
 

1157
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,950
we're buying very high right now. If you
if you are participating upside, if you

1158
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:04,960
if you are participating upside, if you
 

1159
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,950
if you are participating upside, if you
look at the swing leg, remember 500 is

1160
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:06,960
look at the swing leg, remember 500 is
 

1161
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,310
look at the swing leg, remember 500 is
the upside swing leg. Uh 4890 is the

1162
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,320
the upside swing leg. Uh 4890 is the
 

1163
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,830
the upside swing leg. Uh 4890 is the
downside swing leg. So, we're buying

1164
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:11,840
downside swing leg. So, we're buying
 

1165
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,350
downside swing leg. So, we're buying
right at the top of the swing leg. All I

1166
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:13,360
right at the top of the swing leg. All I
 

1167
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,710
right at the top of the swing leg. All I
was doing is trying to play some

1168
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:14,720
was doing is trying to play some
 

1169
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,350
was doing is trying to play some
momentum of their pain and I will just

1170
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:17,360
momentum of their pain and I will just
 

1171
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,269
momentum of their pain and I will just
wait now. Let it develop. We're only uh

1172
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:21,279
wait now. Let it develop. We're only uh
 

1173
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,350
wait now. Let it develop. We're only uh
what 7 minutes into the day. Plenty of

1174
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:23,360
what 7 minutes into the day. Plenty of
 

1175
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:32,470
what 7 minutes into the day. Plenty of
time ahead, folks.

1176
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,480

 

1177
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,110

How do I know there was a 373 lot buyer?

1178
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,120
How do I know there was a 373 lot buyer?
 

1179
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,950
How do I know there was a 373 lot buyer?
Because I can literally see him on

1180
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:36,960
Because I can literally see him on
 

1181
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,029
Because I can literally see him on
either footprint or on bookmap. Right.

1182
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:39,039
either footprint or on bookmap. Right.
 

1183
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,870
either footprint or on bookmap. Right.
I'm watching level two data. I'm just I

1184
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
I'm watching level two data. I'm just I
 

1185
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,390
I'm watching level two data. I'm just I
don't just trade candles. I want to know

1186
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:44,400
don't just trade candles. I want to know
 

1187
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,149
don't just trade candles. I want to know
who's actually playing and where they're

1188
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:46,159
who's actually playing and where they're
 

1189
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,830
who's actually playing and where they're
playing.

1190
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:49,840

 

1191
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,990

Sellers just got caught there at 12. All

1192
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,000
Sellers just got caught there at 12. All
 

1193
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,909
Sellers just got caught there at 12. All
right, we're coming back up to that same

1194
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:53,919
right, we're coming back up to that same
 

1195
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,269
right, we're coming back up to that same
little spot. 35 and 42. That's where the

1196
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:57,279
little spot. 35 and 42. That's where the
 

1197
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,630
little spot. 35 and 42. That's where the
big buyers came in. If we start

1198
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:58,640
big buyers came in. If we start
 

1199
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,070
big buyers came in. If we start
repricing through that again, they're

1200
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,080
repricing through that again, they're
 

1201
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,909
repricing through that again, they're
going to take control. So sellers are

1202
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:01,919
going to take control. So sellers are
 

1203
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,830
going to take control. So sellers are
back letting this be back tested now.

1204
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:03,840
back letting this be back tested now.
 

1205
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,029
back letting this be back tested now.
They need to sell it here. If they

1206
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:05,039
They need to sell it here. If they
 

1207
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,549
They need to sell it here. If they
don't, we're going to see a squeeze.

1208
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:06,559
don't, we're going to see a squeeze.
 

1209
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,230
don't, we're going to see a squeeze.
There is a bit of a shelf starting to be

There is a bit of a shelf starting to be
 

1211
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,029
There is a bit of a shelf starting to be
developed above. Let me get this on for

this morning, folks. Sorry.

1216
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:19,039

 

1217
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,950

Where's 30? There we go. So, a bit of a

1218
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:20,960
Where's 30? There we go. So, a bit of a
 

1219
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,669
Where's 30? There we go. So, a bit of a
shelf up here. And if we get through

1220
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:23,679
shelf up here. And if we get through
 

1221
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,269
shelf up here. And if we get through
54s, we're going to really rip some

1222
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:25,279
54s, we're going to really rip some
 

1223
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,110
54s, we're going to really rip some
faces to the upside. So, I'm trying to

1224
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,120
faces to the upside. So, I'm trying to
 

1225
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,149
faces to the upside. So, I'm trying to
join this long now.

1226
00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:32,159

 

1227
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,870

Are you going to let me get in?

1228
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:34,880
Are you going to let me get in?
 

1229
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,510
Are you going to let me get in?
We just got caught all those sellers.

1230
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:39,520
We just got caught all those sellers.
 

1231
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,510
We just got caught all those sellers.
previous week closed by the way at 70

1232
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:41,520

1233
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,029
previous week closed by the way at 70
470.

1234
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:43,039
470.
 

1235
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,870
470.
So we're getting stuck up there waiting

1236
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:44,880
So we're getting stuck up there waiting
 

1237
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,870
So we're getting stuck up there waiting
to see if we dip back down into sort of

1238
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:46,880
to see if we dip back down into sort of
 

1239
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,190
to see if we dip back down into sort of
40s and I can see a buyer on the buyer

1240
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,200
40s and I can see a buyer on the buyer
 

1241
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,909
40s and I can see a buyer on the buyer
here at 50s in front of 50s. This is the

1242
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:51,919
here at 50s in front of 50s. This is the
 

1243
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,430
here at 50s in front of 50s. This is the
same guy that's been spoofing though by

1244
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:53,440
same guy that's been spoofing though by
 

1245
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:01,029
same guy that's been spoofing though by
the looks of it. So trust him yet

1246
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:01,039

 

1247
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,630

they're going to come down to 40s. Let's

1248
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:02,640
they're going to come down to 40s. Let's
 

1249
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,149
they're going to come down to 40s. Let's
see if these sellers get stuck in this

1250
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:04,159
see if these sellers get stuck in this
 

1251
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:12,470
see if these sellers get stuck in this
little block between 43 and 35.

1252
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:12,480

 

1253
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,669

Hands are off the mouse. I'm just

1254
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:13,679
Hands are off the mouse. I'm just
 

1255
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,430
Hands are off the mouse. I'm just
waiting. Missed that little squeeze out

1256
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:15,440
waiting. Missed that little squeeze out
 

1257
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,990
waiting. Missed that little squeeze out
unfortunately. Was really good. Saw the

1258
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,000
unfortunately. Was really good. Saw the
 

1259
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,070
unfortunately. Was really good. Saw the
sellers get caught maybe a nanocond too

1260
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,080
sellers get caught maybe a nanocond too
 

1261
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,590
sellers get caught maybe a nanocond too
late to play that. But that blue block

1262
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:21,600
late to play that. But that blue block
 

1263
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,870
late to play that. But that blue block
held. So if any of you were buying that

1264
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:22,880
held. So if any of you were buying that
 

1265
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,630
held. So if any of you were buying that
dip into that blue block, it held

1266
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:24,640
dip into that blue block, it held
 

1267
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,389
dip into that blue block, it held
nicely. You should have partial out into

1268
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:26,399
nicely. You should have partial out into
 

1269
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,590
nicely. You should have partial out into
this high and then you're looking for

1270
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:27,600
this high and then you're looking for
 

1271
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,590
this high and then you're looking for
acceleration now. And I'd be looking for

1272
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:29,600
acceleration now. And I'd be looking for
 

1273
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,710
acceleration now. And I'd be looking for
470 and 500 if I was you, if you got any

1274
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:32,720
470 and 500 if I was you, if you got any
 

1275
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,990
470 and 500 if I was you, if you got any
of it. So you should have partial out

1276
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,000
of it. So you should have partial out
 

1277
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,350
of it. So you should have partial out
already. If you bought down here, you

1278
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,360
already. If you bought down here, you
 

1279
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,789
already. If you bought down here, you
should be partial out. And you're

1280
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:36,799
should be partial out. And you're
 

1281
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,070
should be partial out. And you're
looking for this little dotted line.

1282
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,080
looking for this little dotted line.
 

1283
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,990
looking for this little dotted line.
This is your previous week close. If you

1284
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,000
This is your previous week close. If you
 

1285
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,590
This is your previous week close. If you
get above that, you get lucky. Get all

1286
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:41,600
get above that, you get lucky. Get all
 

1287
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,669
get above that, you get lucky. Get all
the way into there. But you should have

1288
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:43,679
the way into there. But you should have
 

1289
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,110
the way into there. But you should have
been paying yourself if you bought that

1290
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,120
been paying yourself if you bought that
 

1291
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,070
been paying yourself if you bought that
blue block at the bottom.

1292
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,080
blue block at the bottom.
 

1293
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,750
blue block at the bottom.
They're refreshing up here in front of

00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:49,760
They're refreshing up here in front of
 

1295
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,750
They're refreshing up here in front of
470. They don't want it over previous

1296
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:51,760
470. They don't want it over previous
 

1297
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,269
470. They don't want it over previous
week close right now. ES a little bit

1298
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:53,279
week close right now. ES a little bit
 

1299
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,470
week close right now. ES a little bit
weak up here as well. Nvidia just got

1300
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:56,480
weak up here as well. Nvidia just got
 

1301
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,190
weak up here as well. Nvidia just got
through that squeeze level

1302
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,200
through that squeeze level
 

1303
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,110
through that squeeze level
and got hit straight away. So, it tried

1304
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,120
and got hit straight away. So, it tried
 

1305
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,909
and got hit straight away. So, it tried
and they sold it straight away.

1306
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:03,919
and they sold it straight away.
 

1307
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,070
and they sold it straight away.
So, let's see if it can base above. I

1308
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,080
So, let's see if it can base above. I
 

1309
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,789
So, let's see if it can base above. I
had it at 7842s,

1310
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:08,799
had it at 7842s,
 

1311
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,070
had it at 7842s,
currently trading at 7832s, 7820s. So

1312
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,080
currently trading at 7832s, 7820s. So
 

1313
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,149
currently trading at 7832s, 7820s. So
they obviously tapped into it and found

1314
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:14,159
they obviously tapped into it and found
 

1315
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,510
they obviously tapped into it and found
those sellers. So it might be look above

1316
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:15,520
those sellers. So it might be look above
 

1317
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,190
those sellers. So it might be look above
and fell on uh Nvidia there. All right,

1318
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:19,200
and fell on uh Nvidia there. All right,
 

1319
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,789
and fell on uh Nvidia there. All right,
this is your your point down here. 42s

this is your your point down here. 42s

should be selling profits into this. Be
aware that today failed breakouts can

1392
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:15,840
aware that today failed breakouts can
 

1393
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,750
aware that today failed breakouts can
happen either in front of this or above

1394
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:17,760
happen either in front of this or above
 

1395
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,389
happen either in front of this or above
this. They can fail or they can fail.

1396
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:20,399
this. They can fail or they can fail.
 

1397
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,470
this. They can fail or they can fail.
All right. So we do not get long right

1398
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,480
All right. So we do not get long right
 

1399
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,710
All right. So we do not get long right
at the tops.

1400
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
at the tops.
 

1401
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,590
at the tops.
The squeeze is on here. There's through

00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:35,600
you're selling into this. We're into a
 

1411
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,430
you're selling into this. We're into a
major higher time frame pivot here,

1412
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:37,440
major higher time frame pivot here,
 

1413
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,590
major higher time frame pivot here,
okay? Major major higher time frame

1414
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,600
okay? Major major higher time frame
 

1415
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,509
okay? Major major higher time frame
pivot here.

1416
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:41,519
pivot here.
 

1417
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,269
pivot here.
Really nice. There's your 90s. Don't be

1418
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:43,279
Really nice. There's your 90s. Don't be
 

1419
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,350
Really nice. There's your 90s. Don't be
a dick for 10 ticks. All right. Make

1420
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:45,360
a dick for 10 ticks. All right. Make
 

1421
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,990
a dick for 10 ticks. All right. Make
sure you're paying yourself. And once we

1422
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,000
sure you're paying yourself. And once we
 

1423
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,110
sure you're paying yourself. And once we
get a breakout over 510 to 520, we have

1424
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,120
get a breakout over 510 to 520, we have
 

1425
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,590
get a breakout over 510 to 520, we have
some imbalance above to fill up to uh

1426
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:55,600
some imbalance above to fill up to uh
 

1427
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,190
some imbalance above to fill up to uh
580s. So 510 to 520, that can be the

1428
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,200
580s. So 510 to 520, that can be the
 

1429
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,870
580s. So 510 to 520, that can be the
look above and fail. If we hold above

1430
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:00,880
look above and fail. If we hold above
 

1431
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,269
look above and fail. If we hold above
that, 580s is possible. I'm very jealous

1432
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:03,279
that, 580s is possible. I'm very jealous
 

1433
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:10,710
that, 580s is possible. I'm very jealous
now. God damn it.

1434
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:10,720

can slice straight through it. We lack

1462
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:42,480
can slice straight through it. We lack
 

1463
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,830
can slice straight through it. We lack
structure, but we can they can also

1464
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:43,840
structure, but we can they can also
 

1465
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,430
structure, but we can they can also
reject it fast. So just manage your

1509
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,030
make, please, you should be down to like
10 20% here. This is very squeezy. They

1510
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,040
10 20% here. This is very squeezy. They
 

1511
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,629
10 20% here. This is very squeezy. They
can drop this straight back down. Look

1512
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:36,639
can drop this straight back down. Look
 

1513
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,069
can drop this straight back down. Look
how aggressive it is up. When they're

1514
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:38,079
how aggressive it is up. When they're
 

1515
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,310
how aggressive it is up. When they're
done with it, if too many buyers come in

1516
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,320
done with it, if too many buyers come in
 

1517
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,389
done with it, if too many buyers come in
at the highs, we will collapse it. So,

1518
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:42,399
at the highs, we will collapse it. So,
 

1519
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,310

1541
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,630
now. You got a little shelf being built
out here. 50 to 55. You kind of want to

1542
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:10,640
out here. 50 to 55. You kind of want to
 

1543
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,750
out here. 50 to 55. You kind of want to
bid above that. Otherwise,

1544
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:13,760
bid above that. Otherwise,
 

1545
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,750
bid above that. Otherwise,
you might see a little 20 point wash

1546
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:15,760
you might see a little 20 point wash
 

1547
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,790
you might see a little 20 point wash
coming here. You're starting to lose

1548
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:16,800
coming here. You're starting to lose
 

1549
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,630
coming here. You're starting to lose
that little shelf at 50. I'd be very

1550
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:18,640
that little shelf at 50. I'd be very
 

1551
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:25,430
that little shelf at 50. I'd be very
careful here.

1552
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:25,440

 

1553
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,270

Here's 50. Can they reclaim 50? They

1554
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:27,280
Here's 50. Can they reclaim 50? They
 

1555
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,910
Here's 50. Can they reclaim 50? They
can. They can reclaim 50. Strong buyers

1556
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:29,920
can. They can reclaim 50. Strong buyers
 

1557
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,630
can. They can reclaim 50. Strong buyers
today on the tape. Strong buyers on the

1558
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:32,640
today on the tape. Strong buyers on the
 

1559
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,550
today on the tape. Strong buyers on the
tape. All right. ES into its 20day. So,

1560
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:34,560
tape. All right. ES into its 20day. So,
 

1561
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,150
tape. All right. ES into its 20day. So,
it's completed its mean reversion. Same

1562
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,160
it's completed its mean reversion. Same
 

1563
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,030
it's completed its mean reversion. Same
for the SPY. Just think about that. U

1564
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,040
for the SPY. Just think about that. U
 

1565
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,870
for the SPY. Just think about that. U
just be cautious about that. Where's the

1566
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:40,880
just be cautious about that. Where's the
 

1567
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,030
just be cautious about that. Where's the
cues? They've also got above the 20-day.

1568
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,040
cues? They've also got above the 20-day.
 

1569
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,710
cues? They've also got above the 20-day.
All right, so mean reversion complete

1570
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:46,720
All right, so mean reversion complete
 

1571
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,390
All right, so mean reversion complete
and those lower Ballinger bands will

1572
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:48,400
and those lower Ballinger bands will
 

1573
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,910
and those lower Ballinger bands will
start to catch up the next few days on

1574
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:49,920
start to catch up the next few days on
 

1575
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,870
start to catch up the next few days on
the daily. 80 is your only next target.

1576
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:52,880
the daily. 80 is your only next target.
 

1577
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,550
the daily. 80 is your only next target.
I'd be looking at 80s is your next

1578
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:54,560
I'd be looking at 80s is your next
 

1579
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,710
I'd be looking at 80s is your next
target.

1580
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:56,720
target.
 

1581
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,230
target.
We go to the uh

1582
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,240
We go to the uh
 

1583
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,430
We go to the uh
hourly. You'll see what I was looking

1584
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:01,440
hourly. You'll see what I was looking
 

1585
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,230
hourly. You'll see what I was looking
at. All right. So once we squeezed

1586
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:04,240
at. All right. So once we squeezed
 

1587
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,710
at. All right. So once we squeezed
through this, we held dips over previous

1588
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:06,720
through this, we held dips over previous
 

1589
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,349
through this, we held dips over previous
day value. We we squeeze through current

1590
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:09,359
day value. We we squeeze through current
 

1591
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,270
day value. We we squeeze through current
weak value. We're coming up to this

1592
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:11,280
weak value. We're coming up to this
 

1593
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,069
weak value. We're coming up to this
level up here. This is where all right

1594
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:14,079
level up here. This is where all right
 

1595
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,390
level up here. This is where all right
is supply. We do not expect price to get

1596
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:16,400
is supply. We do not expect price to get
 

1597
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,910
is supply. We do not expect price to get
above that. All right. And if we get

1598
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:17,920
above that. All right. And if we get
 

1599
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,349
above that. All right. And if we get
back under here, this would be the look

1600
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:19,359
back under here, this would be the look
 

1601
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,349
back under here, this would be the look
above and fail. So just be cautious. You

1602
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:21,359
above and fail. So just be cautious. You
 

1603
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,950
above and fail. So just be cautious. You
should have trimmed a lot of your money

1604
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:22,960
should have trimmed a lot of your money
 

1605
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,510
should have trimmed a lot of your money
if not all of it at this point.

1606
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:29,520

 

1607
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,510

Lots of sellers keep piling in here at

1608
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:31,520
Lots of sellers keep piling in here at
 

1609
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,710
Lots of sellers keep piling in here at
40s, 37s, 40s, and 30s and they are not

1610
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:34,720
40s, 37s, 40s, and 30s and they are not
 

1611
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,870
40s, 37s, 40s, and 30s and they are not
winning. They are not winning. The tape

1612
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:36,880
winning. They are not winning. The tape
 

1613
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,030
winning. They are not winning. The tape
is still aggressive. This is all Nvidia.

1614
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,040
is still aggressive. This is all Nvidia.
 

1615
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,950
is still aggressive. This is all Nvidia.
Look at look as soon as Nvidia got

1616
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:40,960
Look at look as soon as Nvidia got
 

1617
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,430
Look at look as soon as Nvidia got
through that squeeze level. Remember the

1618
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:43,440
through that squeeze level. Remember the
 

1619
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,990
through that squeeze level. Remember the
white line was at 78. We had earlier

1620
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,000
white line was at 78. We had earlier
 

1621
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,390
white line was at 78. We had earlier
7830. Soon as we got this, this is it.

1622
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:48,400
7830. Soon as we got this, this is it.
 

1623
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,069
7830. Soon as we got this, this is it.
This is the market squeezing out because

1624
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:50,079
This is the market squeezing out because
 

1625
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,510
This is the market squeezing out because
we're taking out big pivots in uh names

1626
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:53,520
we're taking out big pivots in uh names
 

1627
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,750
we're taking out big pivots in uh names
probably with massive expireies today.

1628
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:55,760
probably with massive expireies today.
 

1629
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,030
probably with massive expireies today.
You would imagine

1630
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,040
You would imagine
 

1631
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:05,109
You would imagine
massive expireies today for OPEX.

1632
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:05,119

 

1633
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,710

I'd love you guys to get 80s here. It

1634
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:06,720
I'd love you guys to get 80s here. It
 

1635
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,710
I'd love you guys to get 80s here. It
would be fantastic.

1636
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:08,720
would be fantastic.
 

1637
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,990
would be fantastic.
You're almost there. You're almost

1638
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,000
You're almost there. You're almost
 

1639
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,829
You're almost there. You're almost
there. Might as well go and do it. You

1640
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:11,839
there. Might as well go and do it. You
 

1641
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:25,750
there. Might as well go and do it. You
are almost there.

1642
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:25,760

 

1643
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,270

10 points is all you need. A little

1644
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,280
10 points is all you need. A little
 

1645
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,270
10 points is all you need. A little
squeeze up. They are offering above now

1646
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:29,280
squeeze up. They are offering above now
 

1647
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,270
squeeze up. They are offering above now
at 90. Is there anyone above that? Yes,

1648
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:31,280
at 90. Is there anyone above that? Yes,
 

1649
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,430
at 90. Is there anyone above that? Yes,
there's a big level. 600, you got 200

1650
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:33,440
there's a big level. 600, you got 200
 

1651
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,589
there's a big level. 600, you got 200
lot. But yeah, 80s is the level if you

1652
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:35,599
lot. But yeah, 80s is the level if you
 

1653
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,589
lot. But yeah, 80s is the level if you
can get up into it. And again, I'd say

1654
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:37,599
can get up into it. And again, I'd say
 

1655
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,390
can get up into it. And again, I'd say
you don't want price below 42 to 30 is

1656
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:40,400
you don't want price below 42 to 30 is
 

1657
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,670
you don't want price below 42 to 30 is
where the sellers got caught. All right,

1658
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:41,680
where the sellers got caught. All right,
 

1659
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,310
where the sellers got caught. All right,
if price comes below that, I would be uh

1660
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:44,320
if price comes below that, I would be uh
 

1661
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,150
if price comes below that, I would be uh
taking your position off. You can always

1662
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,160
taking your position off. You can always
 

1663
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,990
taking your position off. You can always
get back in. Remember folks, we can

1664
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,000
get back in. Remember folks, we can
 

1665
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,710
get back in. Remember folks, we can
always get back in.

1666
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:50,720
always get back in.
 

1667
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,109
always get back in.
This can potentially be RBS. All right,

1668
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:53,119
This can potentially be RBS. All right,
 

1669
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,790
This can potentially be RBS. All right,
it's an old pivot, so I will convert

1670
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:54,800
it's an old pivot, so I will convert
 

1671
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,390
it's an old pivot, so I will convert
that. Although, I don't really think it

1672
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:56,400
that. Although, I don't really think it
 

1673
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,829
that. Although, I don't really think it
would hold up that well if we came

1674
00:37:57,829 --> 00:37:57,839
would hold up that well if we came
 

1675
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:09,510
would hold up that well if we came
flying down into it, but we will see.

1676
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:09,520

 

1677
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,750

Yeah, quite right, Adam. All right, back

1678
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:11,760
Yeah, quite right, Adam. All right, back
 

1679
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,030
Yeah, quite right, Adam. All right, back
down to the where these sellers came

1680
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,040
down to the where these sellers came
 

1681
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,390
down to the where these sellers came
flying in. We just talked about these

1682
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:14,400
flying in. We just talked about these
 

1683
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,750
flying in. We just talked about these
sellers. This is where they keep trying

1684
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:15,760
sellers. This is where they keep trying
 

1685
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,990
sellers. This is where they keep trying
to sell aggressively down here. They

1686
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,000
to sell aggressively down here. They
 

1687
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,270
to sell aggressively down here. They
haven't been getting their way. They're

1688
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:19,280
haven't been getting their way. They're
 

1689
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,790
haven't been getting their way. They're
not getting their way again. All right,

1690
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:20,800
not getting their way again. All right,
 

1691
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,870
not getting their way again. All right,

Opening range now set as well. So, you

1772
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:18,720
Opening range now set as well. So, you
 

1773
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,109
Opening range now set as well. So, you
are dangling at that orb. Just be aware

1774
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:21,119
are dangling at that orb. Just be aware
 

1775
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,790
are dangling at that orb. Just be aware
of that. So, if you lose this, we go

1776
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:22,800
of that. So, if you lose this, we go
 

1777
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,630
of that. So, if you lose this, we go
back inside the opening range. Same kind

1778
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:24,640
back inside the opening range. Same kind
 

1779
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,190
back inside the opening range. Same kind
of level. So, your opening range high

1780
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:27,200
of level. So, your opening range high
 

1781
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,829
of level. So, your opening range high
right now is basically 50 for those of

right now is basically 50 for those of
 

1783

Well, the consumer sentiment, I mean,
I don't know if we get much of a move on

1806
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:02,079
I don't know if we get much of a move on
 

1807
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,230
I don't know if we get much of a move on
that. Home existing home sales should

1808
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:04,240
that. Home existing home sales should
 

1809
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,950
that. Home existing home sales should
should be a poor print. Home sales have

1810
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:06,960
should be a poor print. Home sales have
 

1811
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,270
should be a poor print. Home sales have
been in a decline in the last 3 months

1812
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:09,280
been in a decline in the last 3 months
 

1813
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,550
been in a decline in the last 3 months
and home sale value. But yes, we do have

1814
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:12,560
and home sale value. But yes, we do have
 

1815
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,630
and home sale value. But yes, we do have
10 minutes. I I I I'm not going to give

1816
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:14,640
10 minutes. I I I I'm not going to give
 

1817
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,790
10 minutes. I I I I'm not going to give
a prediction on on news. I think today

1818
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:16,800
a prediction on on news. I think today
 

1819
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,589
a prediction on on news. I think today
is more about the gamma levels. Do I

1820
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:19,599
is more about the gamma levels. Do I
 

1821
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,550
is more about the gamma levels. Do I
trail my stops? It depends on what uh

1822
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:22,560
trail my stops? It depends on what uh
 

1823
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,030
trail my stops? It depends on what uh
account I'm trading and whether it's a

1824
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,040
account I'm trading and whether it's a
 

1825
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,030
account I'm trading and whether it's a
trading draw down or end of day draw

1826
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,040
trading draw down or end of day draw
 

1827
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,190
trading draw down or end of day draw
down. I will always trail my stops once

1828
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:29,200
down. I will always trail my stops once
 

1829
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,109
down. I will always trail my stops once
I hit 1 R 2 R3R etc. Um, and I'll always

1830
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:33,119
I hit 1 R 2 R3R etc. Um, and I'll always

bulls have a chance. But they just came
 

2075
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,589
bulls have a chance. But they just came
flying in here. They need to hold this

2076
00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:55,599
flying in here. They need to hold this
 

2077

seeing those bears get trapped, but it's
 

2083
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,430
seeing those bears get trapped, but it's
the worst trade location of the day.

2084
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:05,440
the worst trade location of the day.
 

2085
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,750
the worst trade location of the day.

at dailies, I would advise you look at
 

2095
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,829
at dailies, I would advise you look at
the 20-day on a daily with daily

the 20-day on a daily with daily
 

2097
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,349
the 20-day on a daily with daily
Ballinger bands. That will give you your

2098
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:23,359
Ballinger bands. That will give you your
 

2099
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,430
Ballinger bands. That will give you your
expansion levels and your mean reversion

2100
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:25,440
expansion levels and your mean reversion
 

2101
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,870
expansion levels and your mean reversion
levels. We are holding this profile. We

2102
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:28,880
levels. We are holding this profile. We
 

2103

levels. We are holding this profile. We
need to get above 55. If if bulls get us

2104
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:31,040
need to get above 55. If if bulls get us
 

2105

need to get above 55. If if bulls get us
above 55s here aggressively, not just

above 55s here aggressively, not just
 

2107
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,950
above 55s here aggressively, not just
like tapping in leave 55, they have got

like tapping in leave 55, they have got
a shot at going 480 48580s

2110
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:40,640
a shot at going 480 48580s
 

2111
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,750
a shot at going 480 48580s
and 600s. They are trying over and over

Once they start leaving 55s
 

2117
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,670
Once they start leaving 55s
aggressively, they're going to squeeze,

2118
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:49,680
aggressively, they're going to squeeze,
 

2119

gray box under side, still think this is
 

2135
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,030
gray box under side, still think this is
possible down here. So we can mark this

2136
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:11,040
possible down here. So we can mark this
 

2137
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,589
possible down here. So we can mark this
out down here.

2338
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:18,640
up. Yesterday said we talked about the
 

2339
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,030
up. Yesterday said we talked about the
build of an inside day and then at some

2340
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:21,040
build of an inside day and then at some
 

2341
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,589
build of an inside day and then at some
point we will make a decision which way

2342
00:52:23,589 --> 00:52:23,599
point we will make a decision which way
 

2343
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,190
point we will make a decision which way
we are leaving that. All right, if you

2344
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:25,200
we are leaving that. All right, if you
 

2345
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,790
we are leaving that. All right, if you
going back and watch yesterday's video,

2346
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:26,800
going back and watch yesterday's video,
 

2347
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,990
going back and watch yesterday's video,
this is what we talked about. Well,

2348
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:28,000
this is what we talked about. Well,
 

2349
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,829
this is what we talked about. Well,
we're quite obviously using yesterday's

2350
00:52:29,829 --> 00:52:29,839
we're quite obviously using yesterday's
 

2351
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,990
we're quite obviously using yesterday's
inside day for expansion. We're using

2352
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:32,000
inside day for expansion. We're using
 

2353
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,230
inside day for expansion. We're using
these stops here for expansion, but we

2354
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:34,240
these stops here for expansion, but we
 

2355
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,910
these stops here for expansion, but we
understand this is fresh supply. We're

2356
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:35,920
understand this is fresh supply. We're
 

2357
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,670
understand this is fresh supply. We're
not going to get long in fresh supply.

2358
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:37,680
not going to get long in fresh supply.
 

2359
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,670
not going to get long in fresh supply.
The only way we could now get long up

2360
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:39,680
The only way we could now get long up
 

2361
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,589
The only way we could now get long up
here would need to be higher. It sounds

2362
00:52:41,589 --> 00:52:41,599
here would need to be higher. It sounds
 

2363
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,589
here would need to be higher. It sounds
weird. We would need to be above

2364
00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:43,599
weird. We would need to be above
 

2365
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,309
weird. We would need to be above
previous week value and a hold of 700.

2366
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:46,319
previous week value and a hold of 700.
 

2367
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,710
previous week value and a hold of 700.
Otherwise, I'm not interested in longs

2368
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:48,720
Otherwise, I'm not interested in longs
 

2369
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:56,069
Otherwise, I'm not interested in longs
anywhere near up here.

2370
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:56,079

 

2371
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,910

Any of you joined me yesterday should

2372
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:57,920
Any of you joined me yesterday should
 

2373
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,829
Any of you joined me yesterday should
have been sort of prepared about this.

2374
00:52:59,829 --> 00:52:59,839
have been sort of prepared about this.
 

2375
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:01,750
have been sort of prepared about this.
What's the indicator on the side of the

2376
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:01,760
What's the indicator on the side of the
 

2377
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,430
What's the indicator on the side of the
candle?

2378
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:03,440
candle?
 

2379
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,750
candle?
Uh, I assume you're talking about this.

2380
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:05,760
Uh, I assume you're talking about this.
 

2381
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,349
Uh, I assume you're talking about this.
This is a footprint chart, right? This

2382
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:07,359
This is a footprint chart, right? This
 

2383
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:11,270
This is a footprint chart, right? This
is order flow. This is footprint

2384
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:11,280
is order flow. This is footprint
 

2385
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,870
is order flow. This is footprint
showing you what's going on inside of

2386
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:12,880
showing you what's going on inside of
 

2387
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,069
showing you what's going on inside of
the candle. So, you're seeing some

2388
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:14,079
the candle. So, you're seeing some
 

2389
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:15,510
the candle. So, you're seeing some
sellers step back in. You've got this

2390
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:15,520
sellers step back in. You've got this
 

2391
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,309
sellers step back in. You've got this
volume shelf here. If you leave, all

2392
00:53:18,309 --> 00:53:18,319
volume shelf here. If you leave, all
 

2393
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,069
volume shelf here. If you leave, all
right, if sellers take control of this

2394
00:53:20,069 --> 00:53:20,079
right, if sellers take control of this
 

2395
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:22,390
right, if sellers take control of this
now, this here will happen because

2396
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:22,400
now, this here will happen because
 

2397
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,630
now, this here will happen because
you're very thin. Buyers potentially got

2398
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:24,640
you're very thin. Buyers potentially got
 

2399
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,109
you're very thin. Buyers potentially got
the move they wanted. So, the sell can

2400
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:27,119
the move they wanted. So, the sell can
 

2401
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,270
the move they wanted. So, the sell can
happen. It can still happen if they come

2402
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:29,280
happen. It can still happen if they come
 

2403
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,990
happen. It can still happen if they come
under, reject, and start washing back

2404
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:32,000
under, reject, and start washing back
 

2405
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,510
under, reject, and start washing back
down to here. That can still happen. But

2406
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:33,520
down to here. That can still happen. But
 

2407
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,829
down to here. That can still happen. But
the overall trend is up. Buyers will

2408
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:35,839
the overall trend is up. Buyers will
 

2409
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,510
the overall trend is up. Buyers will
want to defend this. All right, if they

2410
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:37,520
want to defend this. All right, if they
 

2411
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,790
want to defend this. All right, if they
fail to defend this, remember they've

2412
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:38,800
fail to defend this, remember they've
 

2413
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,549
fail to defend this, remember they've
hit a big target. Buyers will want to

2414
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:40,559
hit a big target. Buyers will want to
 

2415
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,870
hit a big target. Buyers will want to
defend this. If they fail to defend it,

2416
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:42,880
defend this. If they fail to defend it,
 

2417
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,390
defend this. If they fail to defend it,
this to the next volume level is

2418
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:46,400
this to the next volume level is
 

2419
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,150
this to the next volume level is
possible. All right, this can be a trap

2420
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:48,160
possible. All right, this can be a trap
 

2421
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,230
possible. All right, this can be a trap
level. So, I' pay attention to it. But

2422
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:50,240
level. So, I' pay attention to it. But
 

2423
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,069
level. So, I' pay attention to it. But
if you are desperate, desperate,

2424
00:53:52,069 --> 00:53:52,079
if you are desperate, desperate,
 

2425
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,990
if you are desperate, desperate,
desperate for the short, you need to be

2426
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:54,000
desperate for the short, you need to be
 

2427
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:05,750
desperate for the short, you need to be
looking for that and nothing before it.

2428
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:05,760

 

2429
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,990

Uh I will stream um Monday, Tuesday next

2430
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:10,000
Uh I will stream um Monday, Tuesday next
 

2431
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,109
Uh I will stream um Monday, Tuesday next
week. After that it will be on pause. Um

2432
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:13,119
week. After that it will be on pause. Um
 

2433
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,950
week. After that it will be on pause. Um
I will try and do like the odd session

2434
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:14,960
I will try and do like the odd session
 

2435
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,549
I will try and do like the odd session
in between. I I'll let you guys know.

2436
00:54:16,549 --> 00:54:16,559
in between. I I'll let you guys know.
 

2437
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:17,430
in between. I I'll let you guys know.
I'll have to have a look at the

2438
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:17,440
I'll have to have a look at the
 

2439
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:24,870
I'll have to have a look at the
schedule. I might go away for a bit. So

2440
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:24,880

 

2441
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,870

footprint you mean footstep footprint

2442
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:26,880
footprint you mean footstep footprint
 

2443
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,670
footprint you mean footstep footprint
versus map. Uh it each their own. I use

2444
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:29,680
versus map. Uh it each their own. I use
 

2445
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,510
versus map. Uh it each their own. I use
both. you could whatever whatever you

00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:33,520
both. you could whatever whatever you
 

2447
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,470
both. you could whatever whatever you
find easier to read I would say is the

00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:36,480
find easier to read I would say is the
 

2449
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,470
find easier to read I would say is the
best thing. The good thing about um

2450
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:38,480
best thing. The good thing about um
 

2451
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,510
best thing. The good thing about um
bookmap is you see the orders above and

2452
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:41,520
bookmap is you see the orders above and
 

2453
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,109
bookmap is you see the orders above and
below price. You won't see that on

00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,190
below price. You won't see that on
footprint.

2456
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:45,200
footprint.
 

2457
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:51,270
footprint.
Okay. So back into this gray shelf.

2458
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:51,280

 

2459
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,950

Really nice. So I can't remember who

2460
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:52,960
Really nice. So I can't remember who
 

2461
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,790
Really nice. So I can't remember who
asked me about those targets from ES but

2462
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:54,800
asked me about those targets from ES but
 

2463
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,390
asked me about those targets from ES but
you hit them as well. You hit them as

2464
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:56,400
you hit them as well. You hit them as
 

2465
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,230
you hit them as well. You hit them as
well. The only thing that you've left is

2466
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:58,240
well. The only thing that you've left is
 

2467
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,349
well. The only thing that you've left is
that 8075. But the block like we talked

2468
00:55:01,349 --> 00:55:01,359
that 8075. But the block like we talked
 

2469
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:06,150
that 8075. But the block like we talked
about was 85 to 88.

2470
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:06,160
about was 85 to 88.
 

2471
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,589
about was 85 to 88.
What do I think of the dome? I use the

2485
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,430

2486
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:27,440
Are the Trading View orderflow tools
 

2487
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,549

move here this morning. I was actually
 

2521
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:01,750
move here this morning. I was actually
long out the gate, which is very rare

2522
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:01,760
long out the gate, which is very rare
 

2523
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,230
long out the gate, which is very rare
for me, but I saw the buyer stepping in.

2524
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:04,240
for me, but I saw the buyer stepping in.
 

2525

Sold some here. Missed this reload. Had

2526
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:06,720
Sold some here. Missed this reload. Had
 

2527
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,030
Sold some here. Missed this reload. Had
to join a bit later and then missed a

2528
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:09,040
to join a bit later and then missed a
 

2529
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,630
to join a bit later and then missed a
ton of this unfortunately. But there we

2530
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:10,640
ton of this unfortunately. But there we
 

2531
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,870
ton of this unfortunately. But there we
go. Still locking in some nice profits.

2532
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:14,880
go. Still locking in some nice profits.
 

2533
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,789
go. Still locking in some nice profits.
If we leave this then uh I think we

2534
00:56:16,789 --> 00:56:16,799
If we leave this then uh I think we
 

2535
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,870
If we leave this then uh I think we
might might come down to there. I'd be

2536
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:18,880
might might come down to there. I'd be
 

2537
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,030
might might come down to there. I'd be
watching the midpoint 500 in VWAP and

2538
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,040
watching the midpoint 500 in VWAP and
 

2539
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,990
watching the midpoint 500 in VWAP and
I'd be watching this down here.

2540
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:24,000
I'd be watching this down here.
 

2541
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,349
I'd be watching this down here.
If you're wondering what that blue box

2542
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:25,359
If you're wondering what that blue box
 

2543
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:28,470
If you're wondering what that blue box
is, it is a pivot

2544
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:28,480
is, it is a pivot
 

2545
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,270
is, it is a pivot
get it accurate from Thursday. All

2546
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:31,280
get it accurate from Thursday. All
 

2547
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,990
get it accurate from Thursday. All
right, it's Thursday's this one here.

2548
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:34,000
right, it's Thursday's this one here.
 

2549
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,390
right, it's Thursday's this one here.
Oh, no it's not. It is from That is a

2550
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:36,400
Oh, no it's not. It is from That is a
 

2551
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,190
Oh, no it's not. It is from That is a
complete lie. It would be a pivot from

2552
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:39,200
complete lie. It would be a pivot from
 

2553
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,710
complete lie. It would be a pivot from
Wednesday the 17th of December

2554
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:42,720
Wednesday the 17th of December
 

2555
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,870
Wednesday the 17th of December
like so. I wouldn't pay too much

2556
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:44,880
like so. I wouldn't pay too much
 

2557
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,390
like so. I wouldn't pay too much
attention to it, but I've got it marked

2558
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:46,400
attention to it, but I've got it marked
 

2559
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,069
attention to it, but I've got it marked
out because it is high time frame.

2560
00:56:50,069 --> 00:56:50,079
out because it is high time frame.
 

2561
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,430
out because it is high time frame.
Maybe just pull this down a bit.

2562
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:51,440
Maybe just pull this down a bit.
 

2563
00:56:51,440 --> 00:57:00,230
Maybe just pull this down a bit.
Something like that.

2564
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:00,240

 

2565
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,150

Okay, starting to test the underside of

2566
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:02,160
Okay, starting to test the underside of
 

2567
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,829
Okay, starting to test the underside of
this gray box. You need to leave this

2568
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:03,839
this gray box. You need to leave this
 

2569
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:06,069
this gray box. You need to leave this
gray box, back test it to stay heavy.

2570
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:06,079
gray box, back test it to stay heavy.
 

2571
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:07,910
gray box, back test it to stay heavy.
But sellers keep coming in down here. I

2572
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:07,920
But sellers keep coming in down here. I
 

2573
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,430
But sellers keep coming in down here. I
will tell you now, from 46 to 37, they

2574
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:11,440
will tell you now, from 46 to 37, they
 

2575
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,069
will tell you now, from 46 to 37, they
keep trying to get an aggressive move

2576
00:57:14,069 --> 00:57:14,079
keep trying to get an aggressive move
 

2577
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,549
keep trying to get an aggressive move
away from here and they're not finding

2578
00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:16,559
away from here and they're not finding
 

2579
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,230
away from here and they're not finding
it. Which is why I would not take a

2580
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:18,240
it. Which is why I would not take a
 

2581
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,789
it. Which is why I would not take a
breakout short personally.

2582
00:57:20,789 --> 00:57:20,799
breakout short personally.
 

2583
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:23,750
breakout short personally.
I would need it to retest it. They're

2584
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:23,760
I would need it to retest it. They're
 

2585
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,030
I would need it to retest it. They're
trying. They're getting very aggressive

2586
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:25,040
trying. They're getting very aggressive
 

2587
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,710
trying. They're getting very aggressive
here. You need to see this stay heavy on

2588
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:26,720
here. You need to see this stay heavy on
 

2589
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,710
here. You need to see this stay heavy on
a retest. If they reclaim it, there's no

2590
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:28,720
a retest. If they reclaim it, there's no
 

2591
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,710
a retest. If they reclaim it, there's no
short to be had. If they go straight

2592
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:30,720
short to be had. If they go straight
 

2593
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,109
short to be had. If they go straight
back inside there, you just can't short

2594
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:33,119
back inside there, you just can't short
 

2595
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:34,950
back inside there, you just can't short
it. It just means they're going to get

2596
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:34,960
it. It just means they're going to get
 

2597
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:47,109
it. It just means they're going to get
trapped all over again.

2598
00:57:47,109 --> 00:57:47,119

 

2599
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,270

So, back in to test it. And it looks

2600
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:49,280
So, back in to test it. And it looks
 

2601
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,069
So, back in to test it. And it looks
like they're going to find a bid is

2602
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:52,079
like they're going to find a bid is
 

2603
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:53,270
like they're going to find a bid is
point control. If they trade through

2604
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:53,280
point control. If they trade through
 

2605
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,950
point control. If they trade through
this, it goes straight back upside. So

2606
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:54,960
this, it goes straight back upside. So
 

2607
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,030
this, it goes straight back upside. So
no rejection like we talked about. It's

2608
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:57,040
no rejection like we talked about. It's

2681
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,069
for the pro, so that they can't really
do that. Okay, in this shelf again,

we're just battling here. They're

00:59:59,750 --> 00:59:59,760
we're just battling here. They're
 

2685
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,069
we're just battling here. They're
waiting to build volume. This is a like

2686
01:00:02,069 --> 01:00:02,079
waiting to build volume. This is a like
 

2687
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:03,829
waiting to build volume. This is a like
a lower time frame example of what we

2688
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:03,839
a lower time frame example of what we
 

2689
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,309
a lower time frame example of what we
did yesterday. Once we leave volume, we

2690
01:00:06,309 --> 01:00:06,319
did yesterday. Once we leave volume, we
 

2691
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:07,829
did yesterday. Once we leave volume, we
can be aggressive with it one way or

2692
01:00:07,829 --> 01:00:07,839
can be aggressive with it one way or
 

2693
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:10,230
can be aggressive with it one way or
another.

2694
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:10,240
another.
 

2695
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:17,030
another.

such big size at 550s?
What a weird place to do that.

2738
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:24,319

 

2739
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:26,150

2745
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,789
well, it is. It's both those things.
It's a shelf. The gray box is the shelf.

2746
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:32,799
It's a shelf. The gray box is the shelf.
 

2747
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,950
It's a shelf. The gray box is the shelf.

01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:34,960
uh point of control is the red line.
 

2749
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,549
uh point of control is the red line.
We're starting to leave this shelf, but

2750
01:01:36,549 --> 01:01:36,559
We're starting to leave this shelf, but
 

2751
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,390
We're starting to leave this shelf, but
this is where sellers keep coming in and

2752
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:38,400
this is where sellers keep coming in and
 

2753
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,309
this is where sellers keep coming in and
keep getting stuck. Right. Every time

2754
01:01:40,309 --> 01:01:40,319
keep getting stuck. Right. Every time
 

2755
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:41,670
keep getting stuck. Right. Every time
we've come down here, there's been a

2756
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:41,680
we've come down here, there's been a
 

2757
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:48,390
we've come down here, there's been a
passive buyer.

2758
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:48,400

 

2759
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,990

Is he? Where's that 550 lot?

2760
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:52,000
Is he? Where's that 550 lot?
 

2761
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,670
Is he? Where's that 550 lot?
546.

2762
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:53,680
546.
 

2763
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,789
546.
So 546 to 550. Sellers need to defend

2764
01:01:56,789 --> 01:01:56,799
So 546 to 550. Sellers need to defend
 

2765
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:59,190
So 546 to 550. Sellers need to defend
that because they've just come flying in

2766
01:01:59,190 --> 01:01:59,200
that because they've just come flying in
 

2767
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,190
that because they've just come flying in
there to fill that weird buyer.

2768
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:03,200
there to fill that weird buyer.
 

2769
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,109
there to fill that weird buyer.
And you've got offside delta there. So

2770
01:02:05,109 --> 01:02:05,119
And you've got offside delta there. So
 

2771
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:07,030
And you've got offside delta there. So
well on on side at the moment. So five,

2772
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:07,040
well on on side at the moment. So five,
 

2773
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,549
well on on side at the moment. So five,
what did I just say? 546 to 550s.

2774
01:02:10,549 --> 01:02:10,559
what did I just say? 546 to 550s.
 

2775
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:11,910
what did I just say? 546 to 550s.
They're trying to sell through now

2776
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:11,920
They're trying to sell through now
 

2777
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,750
They're trying to sell through now
because they've had to just take out

2778
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:13,760
because they've had to just take out
 

2779
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,349
because they've had to just take out
that buyer. So the question is, do we

2780
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:15,359
that buyer. So the question is, do we
 

2781
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,430
that buyer. So the question is, do we
leave this shelf now? Do we come VW up?

2782
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:17,440
leave this shelf now? Do we come VW up?
 

2783
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,510
leave this shelf now? Do we come VW up?
Do we leave V up and go 460s? Or do they

2784
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:19,520
Do we leave V up and go 460s? Or do they
 

2785
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,589
Do we leave V up and go 460s? Or do they
come straight back inside that shelf?

2786
01:02:21,589 --> 01:02:21,599
come straight back inside that shelf?
 

2787
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,109
come straight back inside that shelf?
Starting to see more aggression here

2788
01:02:23,109 --> 01:02:23,119
Starting to see more aggression here
 

2789
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:24,870
Starting to see more aggression here
from sellers. But someone is still

2790
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:24,880
from sellers. But someone is still
 

2791
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,670
from sellers. But someone is still
passively bidding this down here. If he

2792
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:27,680
passively bidding this down here. If he
 

2793
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,829
passively bidding this down here. If he
moves, it snaps. But he's not moving.

2794
01:02:31,829 --> 01:02:31,839
moves, it snaps. But he's not moving.
 

2795
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:33,750
moves, it snaps. But he's not moving.
What did I say? 46. I keep forgetting

2796
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:33,760
What did I say? 46. I keep forgetting
 

2797
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,430
What did I say? 46. I keep forgetting
what what I'm saying this morning. 46.75

2798
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:37,440
what what I'm saying this morning. 46.75
 

2799
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,390
what what I'm saying this morning. 46.75
and 51. 5051. That those are the levels.

2800
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:42,400
and 51. 5051. That those are the levels.
 

2801
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:47,589
and 51. 5051. That those are the levels.
Brain's not fully in gear yet. Clearly.

2802
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:47,599

 

2803
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,270

So, this is the tap back in. Sellers

2804
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:49,280
So, this is the tap back in. Sellers
 

2805
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,190
So, this is the tap back in. Sellers
need to sell this or a move lower.

2806
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:51,200
need to sell this or a move lower.
 

2807
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,910
need to sell this or a move lower.
Otherwise, we go reclaim and we go

2808
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:53,920
Otherwise, we go reclaim and we go
 

2809
01:02:53,920 --> 01:03:08,309
Otherwise, we go reclaim and we go
higher.

2810
01:03:08,309 --> 01:03:08,319

 

2811
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:10,069

It doesn't. So the shelves don't need to

2812
01:03:10,069 --> 01:03:10,079
It doesn't. So the shelves don't need to
 

2813
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,829
It doesn't. So the shelves don't need to
be the highest range of volume. They are

2814
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:11,839
be the highest range of volume. They are
 

2815
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:13,670
be the highest range of volume. They are
literally shelves. This one happens to

2816
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:13,680
literally shelves. This one happens to
 

2817
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,829
literally shelves. This one happens to
be the highest volume node. They are

2818
01:03:15,829 --> 01:03:15,839
be the highest volume node. They are
 

2819
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:17,190
be the highest volume node. They are
high volume nodes, but they don't need

2820
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:17,200
high volume nodes, but they don't need
 

2821
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,390
high volume nodes, but they don't need
to be the highest, right? This one

2822
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:18,400
to be the highest, right? This one
 

2823
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,750
to be the highest, right? This one
happens to be the highest. That's your

2824
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:19,760
happens to be the highest. That's your
 

2825
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,510
happens to be the highest. That's your
point of control. But shelves are just

2826
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:21,520
point of control. But shelves are just
 

2827
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,710
point of control. But shelves are just
things like this where you have a clear

2828
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:22,720
things like this where you have a clear
 

2829
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,029
things like this where you have a clear
edge like here. If this was a bit more

2830
01:03:25,029 --> 01:03:25,039
edge like here. If this was a bit more
 

2831
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,470
edge like here. If this was a bit more
built out, it would be really good. like

2832
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:26,480
built out, it would be really good. like
 

2833
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,710
built out, it would be really good. like
clear edges and in here no volume.

2834
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:28,720
clear edges and in here no volume.
 

2835
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,270
clear edges and in here no volume.
Right? So in no volume they can act as

2836
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:31,280
Right? So in no volume they can act as
 

2837
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,589
Right? So in no volume they can act as
support areas where we trap like we did

2838
01:03:33,589 --> 01:03:33,599
support areas where we trap like we did
 

2839
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:35,349
support areas where we trap like we did
here. But if they can't trap then

2840
01:03:35,349 --> 01:03:35,359
here. But if they can't trap then
 

2841
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,270
here. But if they can't trap then
there's no structure here to support

2842
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:37,280
there's no structure here to support
 

2843
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,190
there's no structure here to support
then you imagine we slice down to the

2844
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:39,200
then you imagine we slice down to the
 

2845
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,029
then you imagine we slice down to the
next level. This is why sellers if they

2846
01:03:41,029 --> 01:03:41,039
next level. This is why sellers if they
 

2847
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:42,549
next level. This is why sellers if they
defend this and they get a break they're

2848
01:03:42,549 --> 01:03:42,559
defend this and they get a break they're
 

2849
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,109
defend this and they get a break they're
going to look for higher time frame RBS

2850
01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:45,119
going to look for higher time frame RBS
 

2851
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,270
going to look for higher time frame RBS
and then this. If they can't and they go

2852
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:47,280
and then this. If they can't and they go
 

2853
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,549
and then this. If they can't and they go
back inside then they're going to keep

2854
01:03:48,549 --> 01:03:48,559
back inside then they're going to keep
 

2855
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:52,470
back inside then they're going to keep
getting trapped underneath the shelf.

2856
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:52,480
getting trapped underneath the shelf.
 

2857
01:03:52,480 --> 01:04:00,150
getting trapped underneath the shelf.
Thank you sweetheart.

2858
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:00,160

 

2859
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,670

sellers a week. Yeah. I mean, they keep

2860
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:01,680
sellers a week. Yeah. I mean, they keep
 

2861
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,430
sellers a week. Yeah. I mean, they keep
trying. They're trying and trying and

2862
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:03,440
trying. They're trying and trying and
 

2863
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,109
trying. They're trying and trying and
trying and trying and trying and trying.

2864
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:05,119
trying and trying and trying and trying.
 

2865
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,950
trying and trying and trying and trying.
Can see them on the delta. They need a

2866
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:06,960
Can see them on the delta. They need a
 

2867
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,630
Can see them on the delta. They need a
break. They need it to break lower now.

2868
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:08,640
break. They need it to break lower now.
 

2869
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,270
break. They need it to break lower now.
They they are trying to reject this gray

2870
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:11,280
They they are trying to reject this gray
 

2871
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,349
They they are trying to reject this gray
box, but they need to break lower and

2872
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:13,359
box, but they need to break lower and
 

2873
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,109
box, but they need to break lower and
they are struggling to break lower right

2874
01:04:15,109 --> 01:04:15,119
they are struggling to break lower right
 

2875
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,190
they are struggling to break lower right
now. But if they break lower, it could

2876
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:17,200
now. But if they break lower, it could
 

2877
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,510
now. But if they break lower, it could
get a little bit violent.

2878
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:19,520
get a little bit violent.
 

2879
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,270
get a little bit violent.
They're just trying in this candle again

2880
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:21,280
They're just trying in this candle again
 

2881
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,910
They're just trying in this candle again
without getting any leeway.

2882
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:23,920
without getting any leeway.
 

2883
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,750
without getting any leeway.
So, I'd say it's basically all sellside

2884
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:25,760
So, I'd say it's basically all sellside
 

2885
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,349
So, I'd say it's basically all sellside
from 50 under. So, if it's all heavy

2886
01:04:29,349 --> 01:04:29,359
from 50 under. So, if it's all heavy
 

2887
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:31,190
from 50 under. So, if it's all heavy
delta from 50 under and we're not going

2888
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:31,200
delta from 50 under and we're not going
 

2889
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,870
delta from 50 under and we're not going
anywhere, what does that tell you?

2890
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:32,880
anywhere, what does that tell you?
 

2891
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,789
anywhere, what does that tell you?
Right? If it's all sellside delta from

2892
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:34,799
Right? If it's all sellside delta from
 

2893
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:36,470
Right? If it's all sellside delta from
50 and under and we're not breaking

2894
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:36,480
50 and under and we're not breaking
 

2895
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,309
50 and under and we're not breaking
away, means there's someone absorbing

2896
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:38,319
away, means there's someone absorbing
 

2897
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:40,309
away, means there's someone absorbing
the tape here. So, sellers will need

2898
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:40,319
the tape here. So, sellers will need
 

2899
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:42,069
the tape here. So, sellers will need
this breakdown.

2900
01:04:42,069 --> 01:04:42,079
this breakdown.
 

2901
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:43,750
this breakdown.
They've come flying in here. So, they're

2902
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:43,760
They've come flying in here. So, they're
 

2903
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,349
They've come flying in here. So, they're
trying now. Here we go. There's their

2904
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:45,359
trying now. Here we go. There's their
 

2905
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:48,309
trying now. Here we go. There's their
breakdown. All right. So, let's see if

2906
01:04:48,309 --> 01:04:48,319
breakdown. All right. So, let's see if
 

2907
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,029
breakdown. All right. So, let's see if
they can maintain it. Right. Can they

2908
01:04:51,029 --> 01:04:51,039
they can maintain it. Right. Can they
 

2909
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,870
they can maintain it. Right. Can they
get into this blue box and gray box or

2910
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:52,880
get into this blue box and gray box or
 

2911
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,870
get into this blue box and gray box or
are they going to get just instantly

2912
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:54,880
are they going to get just instantly
 

2913
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,910
are they going to get just instantly
absorbed? This is what happened earlier.

2914
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:57,920
absorbed? This is what happened earlier.
 

2915
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,230
absorbed? This is what happened earlier.
So from 50, let's mark it out and I'm

2916
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:00,240
So from 50, let's mark it out and I'm
 

2917
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,309
So from 50, let's mark it out and I'm
going to show you from here is all

2918
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:02,319
going to show you from here is all
 

2919
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:04,950
going to show you from here is all
aggressive selling and no real buying.

2920
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:04,960
aggressive selling and no real buying.
 

2921
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,630
aggressive selling and no real buying.
Well, there is buying but it's passive.

2922
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:08,640
Well, there is buying but it's passive.
 

2923
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,910
Well, there is buying but it's passive.
Right? You see

2924
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:11,920
Right? You see
 

2925
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,430
Right? You see
this

2926
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:13,440
this
 

2927
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,670
this
this this

2928
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:15,680
this this
 

2929
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,549
this this
what did I say from 50? This this this

2930
01:05:18,549 --> 01:05:18,559
what did I say from 50? This this this
 

2931
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:21,510
what did I say from 50? This this this
this this

2932
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:21,520
this this
 

2933
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,789
this this
is all people market ordering sells.

2934
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:24,799
is all people market ordering sells.
 

2935
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:27,589
is all people market ordering sells.
Have we moved lower? No, not yet. Right.

2936
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:27,599
Have we moved lower? No, not yet. Right.
 

2937
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,390
Have we moved lower? No, not yet. Right.
So there is a passive buyer absorbing

2938
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:30,400
So there is a passive buyer absorbing
 

2939
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,950
So there is a passive buyer absorbing
here looking for a rotation higher right

2940
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:32,960
here looking for a rotation higher right
 

2941
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,150
here looking for a rotation higher right
now. That's the battle. Passive buying,

2942
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:36,160
now. That's the battle. Passive buying,
 

2943
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:42,150
now. That's the battle. Passive buying,
aggressive selling

2944
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:42,160

 

2945
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,990

back into gray box. So sellers will have

2946
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:44,000
back into gray box. So sellers will have
 

2947
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,470
back into gray box. So sellers will have
another chance to defend this level. And

2948
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:46,480
another chance to defend this level. And
 

2949
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,470
another chance to defend this level. And
point of control now is 55. And it's

2950
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:48,480
point of control now is 55. And it's
 

2951
01:05:48,480 --> 01:06:02,150
point of control now is 55. And it's
starting to be reclaimed here.

2952
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:02,160

 

2953
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,750

If the market would clear the imbalance,

2954
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:03,760
If the market would clear the imbalance,
 

2955
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,470
If the market would clear the imbalance,
would it drop to point of control 2530?

2956
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:06,480
would it drop to point of control 2530?
 

2957
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,349
would it drop to point of control 2530?
You mean the old point of control? Um,

2958
01:06:09,349 --> 01:06:09,359
You mean the old point of control? Um,
 

2959
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:11,190
You mean the old point of control? Um,
no.

2960
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:11,200
no.
 

2961
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,710
no.
The point of control right now is at the

2962
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:12,720
The point of control right now is at the
 

2963
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,430
The point of control right now is at the
highs. This is your PC.

2964
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:15,440
highs. This is your PC.
 

2965
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,190
highs. This is your PC.
So

2966
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:17,200
So
 

2967
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,910
So
the rotations right now

2968
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:19,920
the rotations right now
 

2969
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,069
the rotations right now
could be this and I'd expect them to try

2970
01:06:22,069 --> 01:06:22,079
could be this and I'd expect them to try
 

2971
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,710
could be this and I'd expect them to try
and hold a bid there and then rotate in

2972
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:24,720
and hold a bid there and then rotate in
 

2973
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,470
and hold a bid there and then rotate in
this zone to fill this in. If they lost

2974
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:26,480
this zone to fill this in. If they lost
 

2975
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,029
this zone to fill this in. If they lost
this back down to value if they reprint

2976
01:06:29,029 --> 01:06:29,039
this back down to value if they reprint
 

2977
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:30,549
this back down to value if they reprint
over this then they're going to look for

2978
01:06:30,549 --> 01:06:30,559
over this then they're going to look for
 

2979
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:33,349
over this then they're going to look for
600 and probably weeklies up into

2980
01:06:33,349 --> 01:06:33,359
600 and probably weeklies up into
 

2981
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:35,589
600 and probably weeklies up into
sevens. Right? Those are the rotations.

2982
01:06:35,589 --> 01:06:35,599
sevens. Right? Those are the rotations.
 

2983
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:37,270
sevens. Right? Those are the rotations.
Here is is where they're building

2984
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:37,280
Here is is where they're building
 

2985
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,789
Here is is where they're building
liquidity. I don't trade in here. Okay?

2986
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:40,799
liquidity. I don't trade in here. Okay?
 

2987
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:42,630
liquidity. I don't trade in here. Okay?
As a rule. If you hear me say I don't

2988
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:42,640
As a rule. If you hear me say I don't
 

2989
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,630
As a rule. If you hear me say I don't
like trading rotations, right? that this

2990
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:44,640
like trading rotations, right? that this
 

2991
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,630
like trading rotations, right? that this
is a micro rotation in here. This is a

2992
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:46,640
is a micro rotation in here. This is a
 

2993
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,870
is a micro rotation in here. This is a
buildout of volume. What I like to trade

2994
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:48,880
buildout of volume. What I like to trade
 

2995
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,430
buildout of volume. What I like to trade
is if we leave, test, stay heavy. If we

2996
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:53,440
is if we leave, test, stay heavy. If we
 

2997
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,390
is if we leave, test, stay heavy. If we
leave, test, stay positive. I don't care

2998
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:56,400
leave, test, stay positive. I don't care
 

2999
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,150
leave, test, stay positive. I don't care
which way. This is the probably the

3000
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:58,160
which way. This is the probably the
 

3001
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,789
which way. This is the probably the
harder trade today only because we think

3002
01:07:00,789 --> 01:07:00,799
harder trade today only because we think
 

3003
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:02,470
harder trade today only because we think
about what we've done. We've already

3004
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:02,480
about what we've done. We've already
 

3005
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:03,910
about what we've done. We've already
done this. All right. So, yes,

3006
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:03,920
done this. All right. So, yes,
 

3007
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,150
done this. All right. So, yes,
momentum's up, but what are we buying

3008
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:06,160
momentum's up, but what are we buying
 

3009
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,950
momentum's up, but what are we buying
now? If this is value, right, we're

3010
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:08,960
now? If this is value, right, we're
 

3011
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,589
now? If this is value, right, we're
we're buying okay, fair value on the day

3012
01:07:11,589 --> 01:07:11,599
we're buying okay, fair value on the day
 

3013
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,029
we're buying okay, fair value on the day
is currently high, but we're buying

3014
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:13,039
is currently high, but we're buying
 

3015
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:14,870
is currently high, but we're buying
premium within current day and we're

3016
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:14,880
premium within current day and we're
 

3017
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,829
premium within current day and we're
buying premium above previous week um or

3018
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:17,839
buying premium above previous week um or
 

3019
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:20,630
buying premium above previous week um or
current week, I should say. So, we don't

3020
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:20,640
current week, I should say. So, we don't
 

3021
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,349
current week, I should say. So, we don't
want to buy this high really, but it

3022
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:23,359
want to buy this high really, but it
 

3023
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:25,589
want to buy this high really, but it
might not give us a choice. All right.

3024
01:07:25,589 --> 01:07:25,599
might not give us a choice. All right.
 

3025
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,349
might not give us a choice. All right.
Now, sellers keep rejecting up here over

3026
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:27,359
Now, sellers keep rejecting up here over
 

3027
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,589
Now, sellers keep rejecting up here over
and over again. So, buyers got caught on

3028
01:07:29,589 --> 01:07:29,599
and over again. So, buyers got caught on
 

3029
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:31,670
and over again. So, buyers got caught on
that last wick push in sellers still

3030
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:31,680
that last wick push in sellers still
 

3031
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,270
that last wick push in sellers still
have not taken control. What's the ES

3032
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:33,280
have not taken control. What's the ES
 

3033
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,109
have not taken control. What's the ES
doing? Still in no man's land, hanging

3034
01:07:35,109 --> 01:07:35,119
doing? Still in no man's land, hanging
 

3035
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:36,549
doing? Still in no man's land, hanging
around its 20 days. Okay, so if you look

3036
01:07:36,549 --> 01:07:36,559
around its 20 days. Okay, so if you look
 

3037
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,549
around its 20 days. Okay, so if you look
at the spy, it is literally just stuck

3038
01:07:38,549 --> 01:07:38,559
at the spy, it is literally just stuck
 

3039
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:40,789
at the spy, it is literally just stuck
at its 20-day. Why is that important?

3040
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:40,799
at its 20-day. Why is that important?
 

3041
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:43,190
at its 20-day. Why is that important?
Well, when we look at the dailies, this

3042
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:43,200
Well, when we look at the dailies, this
 

3043
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,510
Well, when we look at the dailies, this
is just how I trade and many of you

3044
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:45,520
is just how I trade and many of you
 

3045
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,870
is just how I trade and many of you
would never have traded this way

3046
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:46,880
would never have traded this way
 

3047
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,470
would never have traded this way
probably.

3048
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:48,480
probably.
 

3049
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,390
probably.
This is your mean on the daily. There's

3050
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:50,400
This is your mean on the daily. There's
 

3051
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,990
This is your mean on the daily. There's
your top bowl. There's your lower bowl.

3052
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:52,000
your top bowl. There's your lower bowl.
 

3053
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,870
your top bowl. There's your lower bowl.
This is your max move, max move. The

3054
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:54,880
This is your max move, max move. The
 

3055
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,710
This is your max move, max move. The
other thing we have to respect here is

3056
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:56,720
other thing we have to respect here is
 

3057
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,309
other thing we have to respect here is
what we talked about higher time frame.

3058
01:07:58,309 --> 01:07:58,319
what we talked about higher time frame.
 

3059
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:01,190
what we talked about higher time frame.
Where are we into 20-day, 50-day, edge

3060
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:01,200
Where are we into 20-day, 50-day, edge
 

3061
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,510
Where are we into 20-day, 50-day, edge
of shelf? All right, edge of shelf. So,

3062
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:03,520
of shelf? All right, edge of shelf. So,
 

3063
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,349
of shelf? All right, edge of shelf. So,
it's going to struggle to move much

3064
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:05,359
it's going to struggle to move much
 

3065
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:07,670
it's going to struggle to move much
above this. It's very unlikely that

3066
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:07,680
above this. It's very unlikely that
 

3067
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,190
above this. It's very unlikely that
we're going to get into this next block

3068
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:09,200
we're going to get into this next block
 

3069
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,710
we're going to get into this next block
here. So, they're going to keep trying

3070
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:10,720
here. So, they're going to keep trying
 

3071
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,789
here. So, they're going to keep trying
to sell this. And this is why we have to

3072
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:12,799
to sell this. And this is why we have to
 

3073
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:14,549
to sell this. And this is why we have to
think about where are we positioned? Do

3074
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:14,559
think about where are we positioned? Do
 

3075
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,470
think about where are we positioned? Do
we really want to be buying up here? Not

3076
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:16,480
we really want to be buying up here? Not
 

3077
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,110
we really want to be buying up here? Not
really. So, if you are going to buy up

3078
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:19,120
really. So, if you are going to buy up
 

3079
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,110
really. So, if you are going to buy up
here, what are you going to need to see?

3080
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:21,120
here, what are you going to need to see?
 

3081
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,149
here, what are you going to need to see?
You're going to need to see trap

3082
01:08:22,149 --> 01:08:22,159

sellers, a reclaim of a shelf, more
 

3085
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,669
sellers, a reclaim of a shelf, more
trapped sellers, and you're going to

3086
01:08:25,669 --> 01:08:25,679
trapped sellers, and you're going to
 

3087
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:27,349
trapped sellers, and you're going to
have to play momentum long. This would

3088
01:08:27,349 --> 01:08:27,359
have to play momentum long. This would
 

3089
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,430
have to play momentum long. This would
be a smaller size position because

3090
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:29,440
be a smaller size position because
 

3091
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,349
be a smaller size position because
you've lost the location, but you have

3221
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,590
actually starting to play ball properly.
All right, so probably into 05s and 500s

3222
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:21,600
All right, so probably into 05s and 500s
 

3223
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,070
All right, so probably into 05s and 500s
into this RBS level and and VWAP. And if

3224
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:24,080
into this RBS level and and VWAP. And if
 

3225
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,430
into this RBS level and and VWAP. And if
you lose VWAP, we're going to come all

3226
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:25,440
you lose VWAP, we're going to come all
 

3227
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,110
you lose VWAP, we're going to come all
the way down. This is a higher time

3228
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:27,120
the way down. This is a higher time
 

3229
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:30,149
the way down. This is a higher time
frame RBS level which dates back to

3230
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:30,159
frame RBS level which dates back to
 

3231
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:31,990
frame RBS level which dates back to
Wednesday the 17th of December. So they

3232
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:32,000
Wednesday the 17th of December. So they
 

3233
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,070
Wednesday the 17th of December. So they
are bidding off it. Interesting. Wasn't

3234
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:34,080
are bidding off it. Interesting. Wasn't
 

3235
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,510
are bidding off it. Interesting. Wasn't
sure if they'd bid off that if I'm

3236
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:35,520
sure if they'd bid off that if I'm
 

3237
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,070
sure if they'd bid off that if I'm
honest because we're very thin. So

3238
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:38,080
honest because we're very thin. So
 

3239
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,390
honest because we're very thin. So
sellers have a chance here to react

3240
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:40,400
sellers have a chance here to react
 

3241
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,910
sellers have a chance here to react
here. The rotation here is clear. Right?

3242
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:43,920
here. The rotation here is clear. Right?
 

3243
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,470
here. The rotation here is clear. Right?
They must sell up here, close under

3244
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:46,480
They must sell up here, close under
 

3245
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,630
They must sell up here, close under
here, get down into here. Buyers will

3246
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:48,640
here, get down into here. Buyers will
 

3247
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,189
here, get down into here. Buyers will
want to absorb this, use this, use all

3248
01:11:51,189 --> 01:11:51,199
want to absorb this, use this, use all
 

3249
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:53,990
want to absorb this, use this, use all
these sellers pain, and get back above.

3250
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:54,000
these sellers pain, and get back above.
 

3251
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,510
these sellers pain, and get back above.
That's the rotation. We are in a

3252
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:55,520
That's the rotation. We are in a
 

3253
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,430
That's the rotation. We are in a
rotational market. All right. I know

3254
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:57,440
rotational market. All right. I know
 

3255
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,390
rotational market. All right. I know
we've broken out of that December

3256
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:00,400
we've broken out of that December
 

3257
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,950
we've broken out of that December
17th pivot. But we are that's this right

3258
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:02,960
17th pivot. But we are that's this right
 

3259
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,990
17th pivot. But we are that's this right
here that they need to hold.

3260
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:06,000
here that they need to hold.
 

3261
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,830
here that they need to hold.
And if we don't hold it, it will be a

3262
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:07,840
And if we don't hold it, it will be a
 

3263
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,910
And if we don't hold it, it will be a
look above and fail. And if we do look

3264
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:09,920
look above and fail. And if we do look
 

3265
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,990
look above and fail. And if we do look
above and fail, we think about how

3266
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:12,000
above and fail, we think about how
 

3267
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,470
above and fail, we think about how
vertical we've been. If we leave buyers

3268
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:14,480
vertical we've been. If we leave buyers
 

3269
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,790
vertical we've been. If we leave buyers
trapped up here and we don't hold the

3270
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:16,800
trapped up here and we don't hold the
 

3271
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,709
trapped up here and we don't hold the
pivot, all right, then we can use all

3272
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:18,719
pivot, all right, then we can use all
 

3273
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:22,310
pivot, all right, then we can use all
this volume to rotate aggressively. So,

3274
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:22,320
this volume to rotate aggressively. So,
 

3275
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,149
this volume to rotate aggressively. So,
it is definitely a bit of a battle day

3276
01:12:24,149 --> 01:12:24,159
it is definitely a bit of a battle day
 

3277
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:27,110
it is definitely a bit of a battle day
today over time frames.

3278
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:27,120
today over time frames.
 

3279
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:46,870
today over time frames.
And it's OPEX just to make it extra fun.

3280
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:46,880

 

3281
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,070

Okay, so sellers took control 330 uh

3282
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:50,080
Okay, so sellers took control 330 uh
 

3283
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,550
Okay, so sellers took control 330 uh
330s, 530s,

3284
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:52,560
330s, 530s,
 

3285
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,070
330s, 530s,
that's where they really took control.

3286
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:54,080
that's where they really took control.
 

3287
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,390
that's where they really took control.
So 5 I'd say the levels right now 530s,

3288
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:56,400
So 5 I'd say the levels right now 530s,
 

3289
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,270
So 5 I'd say the levels right now 530s,
538, 547. That's where the sellers took

3290
01:12:59,270 --> 01:12:59,280
538, 547. That's where the sellers took
 

3291
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,189
538, 547. That's where the sellers took
control. They will need to defend those

3292
01:13:01,189 --> 01:13:01,199
control. They will need to defend those
 

3293
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:02,470
control. They will need to defend those
levels. If they don't defend those

3294
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:02,480
levels. If they don't defend those
 

3295
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,990
levels. If they don't defend those
levels, they will start to be squeezed

3296
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:04,000
levels, they will start to be squeezed
 

3297
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,669
levels, they will start to be squeezed
out. They will start to be squeezed out

3298
01:13:05,669 --> 01:13:05,679
out. They will start to be squeezed out
 

3299
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:07,510
out. They will start to be squeezed out
if they can't defend those levels. ES

3300
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:07,520
if they can't defend those levels. ES
 

3301
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,390
if they can't defend those levels. ES

VWAP right now. VIX is trying to catch a

VWAP right now. VIX is trying to catch a
 

3307
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:27,510
VWAP right now. VIX is trying to catch a
bit of a bid.

3308
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:27,520

 

3309
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,550

You can see 500 being bid down here. Do

3310
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:30,560
You can see 500 being bid down here. Do
 

3311
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,870
You can see 500 being bid down here. Do
they wash into him? Do they wash into

3312
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:32,880
they wash into him? Do they wash into
 

3313
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,189
they wash into him? Do they wash into
him?

3314
01:13:35,189 --> 01:13:35,199
him?
 

3315
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:36,870
him?
I would be very careful about bidding

3316
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:36,880
I would be very careful about bidding
 

3317
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,510
I would be very careful about bidding
this down here if I was you. Only

3318
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:39,520
this down here if I was you. Only
 

3319
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,310
this down here if I was you. Only
because we lack volume.

3320
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:42,320
because we lack volume.
 

3321
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,149
because we lack volume.
If we'd built out structure here this

3322
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:44,159
If we'd built out structure here this
 

3323
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:45,750
If we'd built out structure here this
morning, if we'd done something like

3324
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:45,760
morning, if we'd done something like
 

3325
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,229
morning, if we'd done something like
this, I think it would be a really good

3326
01:13:48,229 --> 01:13:48,239
this, I think it would be a really good
 

3327
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:50,470
this, I think it would be a really good
bid back up, but I think it's a little

3328
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:50,480
bid back up, but I think it's a little
 

3329
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:57,189
bid back up, but I think it's a little
risky.

3330
01:13:57,189 --> 01:13:57,199

 

3331
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,189

This is uh the New York view up. All

01:13:59,189 --> 01:13:59,199
This is uh the New York view up. All
 

3333

just do an anchored VWOP. Anchor it to

01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,590
to come all the way down into the box.
So, if any of you took the short for

3372
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:41,600
So, if any of you took the short for
 

3373
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,990
So, if any of you took the short for
these rejections, right, that's your

3374
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:44,000
these rejections, right, that's your
 

3375
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,750
these rejections, right, that's your
cover one, and this is your cover two

3376
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:45,760
cover one, and this is your cover two
 

3377
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,669
cover one, and this is your cover two
down into here. Anything beyond that is

3378
01:14:47,669 --> 01:14:47,679
down into here. Anything beyond that is
 

3379
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,750
down into here. Anything beyond that is
a bonus. Uh, I wouldn't be looking for

3380
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:49,760
a bonus. Uh, I wouldn't be looking for
 

3381
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,630
a bonus. Uh, I wouldn't be looking for
much beyond that, if I'm honest. And

3382
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:52,640
much beyond that, if I'm honest. And
 

3383
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,390
much beyond that, if I'm honest. And
then we can build out a rotation here

3384
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:54,400
then we can build out a rotation here
 

3385
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,149
then we can build out a rotation here
for a bit. If they do, if they do lose

3386
01:14:56,149 --> 01:14:56,159
for a bit. If they do, if they do lose
 

3387
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:57,590
for a bit. If they do, if they do lose
this, they might want to build it out

3388
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:57,600
this, they might want to build it out
 

3389
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:01,990
this, they might want to build it out
before we make a decision on what next.

3390
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:02,000
before we make a decision on what next.
 

3391
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:19,510
before we make a decision on what next.
Like I said, very thin here.

3392
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:19,520

 

3393
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,550

99's here.

3394
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:22,560
99's here.
 

3395
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,709
99's here.
Here

3396
01:15:24,709 --> 01:15:24,719
Here
 

3397
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:26,790
Here
we go. Starting to let it go. So, you

3398
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:26,800
we go. Starting to let it go. So, you
 

3399
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,110
we go. Starting to let it go. So, you
might come all the way down here, folks.

3400
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:29,120
might come all the way down here, folks.
 

3401
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,390
might come all the way down here, folks.
So, those of you in shorts, I don't know

3402
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:30,400
So, those of you in shorts, I don't know
 

3403
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,149
So, those of you in shorts, I don't know
if you're in this BEu, I feel like this

3404
01:15:32,149 --> 01:15:32,159
if you're in this BEu, I feel like this
 

3405
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:33,990
if you're in this BEu, I feel like this
is the type of trade you like now. Le

3406
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:34,000
is the type of trade you like now. Le
 

3407
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,070
is the type of trade you like now. Le
the leaving of shelves, but this would

3408
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:36,080
the leaving of shelves, but this would
 

3409
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,390
the leaving of shelves, but this would
be your next cover point. So, be out 50

3410
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:38,400
be your next cover point. So, be out 50
 

3411
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,390
be your next cover point. So, be out 50
plus% and see if you can get a drive

3412
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:40,400
plus% and see if you can get a drive
 

3413
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,390
plus% and see if you can get a drive
into anywhere from 60 to 55. Beyond that

3414
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:44,400
into anywhere from 60 to 55. Beyond that
 

3415
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:49,030
into anywhere from 60 to 55. Beyond that
is fantastic and an absolute godsend.

3416
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:49,040

 

3417
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,669

Shorts from 538 trim sum. Very nice.

3418
01:15:51,669 --> 01:15:51,679
Shorts from 538 trim sum. Very nice.
 

3419
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,590
Shorts from 538 trim sum. Very nice.
Yeah. So once we left really good,

3420
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:53,600
Yeah. So once we left really good,
 

3421
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,870
Yeah. So once we left really good,
right? So we talked about it for ages,

3422
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:54,880
right? So we talked about it for ages,
 

3423
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,270
right? So we talked about it for ages,
didn't we? Leaving this, trim some into

3424
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:57,280
didn't we? Leaving this, trim some into
 

3425
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,510
didn't we? Leaving this, trim some into
here, hold some into here, and I'd hold

3426
01:15:59,510 --> 01:15:59,520
here, hold some into here, and I'd hold
 

3427
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,149
here, hold some into here, and I'd hold
like 10% beyond that. So I'd be like 50%

3428
01:16:02,149 --> 01:16:02,159
like 10% beyond that. So I'd be like 50%
 

3429
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:04,709
like 10% beyond that. So I'd be like 50%
out here, maybe another 30 to 40% out

3430
01:16:04,709 --> 01:16:04,719
out here, maybe another 30 to 40% out
 

3431
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:07,590
out here, maybe another 30 to 40% out
here, and then 10% just in case they get

3432
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:07,600
here, and then 10% just in case they get
 

3433
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,910
here, and then 10% just in case they get
really nasty because if we lose this, it

3434
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:09,920
really nasty because if we lose this, it
 

3435
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,990
really nasty because if we lose this, it
is technically I just want to make sure

3436
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:12,000
is technically I just want to make sure
 

3437
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,990
is technically I just want to make sure
I'm in the right levels. This can be a

3438
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:14,000
I'm in the right levels. This can be a
 

3439
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,510
I'm in the right levels. This can be a
look above and fail. The next level will

3440
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:15,520
look above and fail. The next level will
 

3441
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,149
look above and fail. The next level will
be 400. So this is the big one. If you

3442
01:16:18,149 --> 01:16:18,159
be 400. So this is the big one. If you
 

3443
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:20,550
be 400. So this is the big one. If you
lose this, we go back into range. But

3444
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:20,560
lose this, we go back into range. But
 

3445
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,470
lose this, we go back into range. But
here you can see, so we're repricing now

3446
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:22,480
here you can see, so we're repricing now
 

3447
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,149
here you can see, so we're repricing now
like we talked about into the next

3448
01:16:24,149 --> 01:16:24,159
like we talked about into the next
 

3449
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,390
like we talked about into the next
shelf, right? So I'd be covering some

3450
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:26,400
shelf, right? So I'd be covering some
 

3451
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:31,990
shelf, right? So I'd be covering some
into here.

3452
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:32,000

 

3453
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,310

Really good.

3454
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:34,320
Really good.
 

3455
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,669
Really good.
Really, really, really good. So you can

3456
01:16:35,669 --> 01:16:35,679
Really, really, really good. So you can
 

3457
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:37,430
Really, really, really good. So you can
see thin up, thin down. This is why we

3458
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:37,440
see thin up, thin down. This is why we
 

3459
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,149
see thin up, thin down. This is why we
come and repric. Um, so if you're going

3460
01:16:40,149 --> 01:16:40,159
come and repric. Um, so if you're going
 

3461
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:41,830
come and repric. Um, so if you're going
to hold runners, what what you really

3462
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:41,840
to hold runners, what what you really
 

3463
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,990
to hold runners, what what you really
want is to get under this blue box. If

3464
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:44,000
want is to get under this blue box. If
 

3465
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,910
want is to get under this blue box. If
you get under that blue box, this whole

3466
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:45,920
you get under that blue box, this whole
 

3467
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,310
you get under that blue box, this whole
thing

3468
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:48,320
thing
 

3469
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,390
thing
will be a fail breakout. Right? If you

3470
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:50,400
will be a fail breakout. Right? If you
 

3471
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,030
will be a fail breakout. Right? If you
get under this blue box,

3472
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:53,040
get under this blue box,
 

3473
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,390
get under this blue box,
this whole thing will be a fail

3474
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:54,400
this whole thing will be a fail
 

3475
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,149
this whole thing will be a fail
breakout. If we hold this blue box, it's

3476
01:16:56,149 --> 01:16:56,159
breakout. If we hold this blue box, it's
 

3477
01:16:56,159 --> 01:17:00,390
breakout. If we hold this blue box, it's
just a breakout retest. Okay.

3478
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:00,400
just a breakout retest. Okay.
 

3479
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,870
just a breakout retest. Okay.
Going to get rid of this because like I

3480
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:02,880
Going to get rid of this because like I
 

3481
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,790
Going to get rid of this because like I
said, I'd made it darker because wasn't

3482
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:04,800
said, I'd made it darker because wasn't
 

3483
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,310
said, I'd made it darker because wasn't
convinced it would hold and it hasn't.

3484
01:17:08,310 --> 01:17:08,320
convinced it would hold and it hasn't.
 

3485
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,149
convinced it would hold and it hasn't.
Okay. Into gray box. This is your cover

3486
01:17:10,149 --> 01:17:10,159
Okay. Into gray box. This is your cover
 

3487
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,750
Okay. Into gray box. This is your cover
point for some of the shorts. You want

3488
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:11,760
point for some of the shorts. You want
 

3489
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,189
point for some of the shorts. You want
to be covering some of your short

3490
01:17:13,189 --> 01:17:13,199
to be covering some of your short
 

3491
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:19,590
to be covering some of your short
position here, please.

3492
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:19,600

 

3493
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,950

Hopefully, it makes sense.

3494
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:22,960
Hopefully, it makes sense.
 

3495
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,390
Hopefully, it makes sense.
Yeah, I'll be covering some of my short

3496
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:24,400
Yeah, I'll be covering some of my short
 

3497
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,229
Yeah, I'll be covering some of my short
now. Definitely in in and around this

3498
01:17:26,229 --> 01:17:26,239
now. Definitely in in and around this
 

3499
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:28,790
now. Definitely in in and around this
area and then hold holding if you've got

3500
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:28,800
area and then hold holding if you've got
 

3501
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,790
area and then hold holding if you've got
enough size, you can hold runners. I'd

3502
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:30,800
enough size, you can hold runners. I'd
 

3503
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,229
enough size, you can hold runners. I'd
definitely be covering some of my short

3504
01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:32,239
definitely be covering some of my short
 

3505
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:34,630
definitely be covering some of my short
here because we know this is the edge of

3506
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:34,640
here because we know this is the edge of
 

3507
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,390
here because we know this is the edge of
value down here into 50s, right? So,

3508
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:36,400
value down here into 50s, right? So,
 

3509
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,270
value down here into 50s, right? So,
it's highly likely that you see some bid

3510
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:39,280
it's highly likely that you see some bid
 

3511
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,510
it's highly likely that you see some bid
come back in here. Now, if we lose edge

3512
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:41,520
come back in here. Now, if we lose edge
 

3513
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,110
come back in here. Now, if we lose edge
of value, like I talked about, we got

3514
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:43,120
of value, like I talked about, we got
 

3515
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,030
of value, like I talked about, we got
24-hour VW up, previous day high,

3516
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:45,040
24-hour VW up, previous day high,
 

3517
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,669
24-hour VW up, previous day high,
GlobeEx, all down here. If we lose that,

3518
01:17:47,669 --> 01:17:47,679
GlobeEx, all down here. If we lose that,
 

3519
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:49,590
GlobeEx, all down here. If we lose that,
it's a whole different ball game. But,

3520
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:49,600
it's a whole different ball game. But,
 

3521
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,189
it's a whole different ball game. But,
you know, this is thin. We just came

3522
01:17:51,189 --> 01:17:51,199
you know, this is thin. We just came
 

3523
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:52,950
you know, this is thin. We just came
into like wick to wick. If you look

3524
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:52,960
into like wick to wick. If you look
 

3525
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,470
into like wick to wick. If you look
here, wick to wick. Maybe this gray box

3526
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:54,480
here, wick to wick. Maybe this gray box
 

3527
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,910
here, wick to wick. Maybe this gray box
should have been here. Wick to wick and

3528
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:55,920
should have been here. Wick to wick and
 

3529
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,350
should have been here. Wick to wick and
we're founding a bid. All right. So,

3530
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:57,360
we're founding a bid. All right. So,
 

3531
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,709
we're founding a bid. All right. So,
hopefully this is making sense to you

3532
01:17:58,709 --> 01:17:58,719
hopefully this is making sense to you
 

3533
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:01,750
hopefully this is making sense to you
why I'm like, you need to be 80% out

3534
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:01,760
why I'm like, you need to be 80% out
 

3535
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,310
why I'm like, you need to be 80% out
into this gray box,

3536
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:04,320
into this gray box,
 

3537
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,910
into this gray box,
right? We are day traders. We're not

3538
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:05,920
right? We are day traders. We're not
 

3539
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,510
right? We are day traders. We're not
swing traders. I mean I am a swing

3540
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:07,520
swing traders. I mean I am a swing
 

3541
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,830
swing traders. I mean I am a swing
trader but on this stream we are day

01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:09,840
trader but on this stream we are day
 

3543
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,669
trader but on this stream we are day
trading which means you have to respect

3544
01:18:11,669 --> 01:18:11,679
trading which means you have to respect
 

3545
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:13,669
trading which means you have to respect

reclaim this what happens giant squeeze

3548
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:15,600
reclaim this what happens giant squeeze
 

3549
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,149
reclaim this what happens giant squeeze
right so shorts need to defend this we

3550
01:18:18,149 --> 01:18:18,159
right so shorts need to defend this we
 

3551
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:21,990
right so shorts need to defend this we
reclaim this giant squeeze is on

01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,030
easily do this for a little now until
they make a decision. If they get very

01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:39,040
they make a decision. If they get very
 

3569
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,149
they make a decision. If they get very

3585
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,630
it trip witching now. But these are days
where we get big drastic moves very

3586
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:00,640
where we get big drastic moves very
 

3587
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:15,669
where we get big drastic moves very
quickly.

3588

3589
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:17,189

If you stick with me long enough here,

3590
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:17,199
If you stick with me long enough here,
 

3591
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:18,870
If you stick with me long enough here,
because lots of you will be new, you

3592
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:18,880
because lots of you will be new, you
 

3593
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,630
because lots of you will be new, you
will just start to see these setups

3594
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:20,640
will just start to see these setups
 

3595
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,030
will just start to see these setups
because they come at day after day after

3596
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:23,040
because they come at day after day after
 

3597
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,350
because they come at day after day after
day after day after day. You will see

3598
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:25,360
day after day after day. You will see
 

3599
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,350
day after day after day. You will see
them. So, they're trying to protect.

3600
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:27,360
them. So, they're trying to protect.
 

3601
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:32,630
them. So, they're trying to protect.
They just built out a little node here

3602
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:32,640

 

3603
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,870

and they reacted

3604
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:34,880
and they reacted
 

3605
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,229
and they reacted
just above it.

3606
01:19:38,229 --> 01:19:38,239
just above it.
 

3607
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,870
just above it.
So shorts are trying to take control of

3608
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:40,880
So shorts are trying to take control of
 

3609
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,310
So shorts are trying to take control of
this market at the moment. They want to

3610
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:42,320
this market at the moment. They want to
 

3611
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:45,110
this market at the moment. They want to
complete the rotation down into 450 at

3612
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:45,120
complete the rotation down into 450 at
 

3613
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:48,229
complete the rotation down into 450 at
the moment. That's what they want to do.

3614
01:19:48,229 --> 01:19:48,239
the moment. That's what they want to do.
 

3615
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:49,590
the moment. That's what they want to do.
Whether they can do it or not is a whole

3616
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:49,600
Whether they can do it or not is a whole
 

3617
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,950
Whether they can do it or not is a whole
different thing, but they would like to

3618
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:50,960
different thing, but they would like to
 

3619
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,550
different thing, but they would like to
complete the rotation down. ES is

3620
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:52,560
complete the rotation down. ES is
 

3621
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,350
complete the rotation down. ES is
finding absorption uh into its VWAP.

3622
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:55,360
finding absorption uh into its VWAP.
 

3623
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,030
finding absorption uh into its VWAP.
cannot get a close under VWAP right now

3624
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:57,040
cannot get a close under VWAP right now
 

3625
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,709
cannot get a close under VWAP right now
on the ES. So you're seeing absorption

3626
01:19:58,709 --> 01:19:58,719
on the ES. So you're seeing absorption
 

3627
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:04,149
on the ES. So you're seeing absorption
over there.

3628
01:20:04,149 --> 01:20:04,159

 

3629
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:07,030

Um what was that node there? 14s. So

3630
01:20:07,030 --> 01:20:07,040
Um what was that node there? 14s. So
 

3631
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,430
Um what was that node there? 14s. So
buyers got stuck on that last wick above

3632
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:09,440
buyers got stuck on that last wick above
 

3633
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:11,750
buyers got stuck on that last wick above
12s.

3634
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:11,760
12s.
 

3635
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,149
12s.
Can the sellers get a new lower low and

3636
01:20:14,149 --> 01:20:14,159
Can the sellers get a new lower low and
 

3637
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:16,229
Can the sellers get a new lower low and
see some follow through to uh current

3638
01:20:16,229 --> 01:20:16,239
see some follow through to uh current
 

3639
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:18,070
see some follow through to uh current
value area low or do they get caught

3640
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:18,080
value area low or do they get caught
 

3641
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:24,870
value area low or do they get caught
down here is the question.

3642
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:24,880

 

3643
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,590

They're trying.

3644
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:27,600
They're trying.
 

3645
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,270
They're trying.
Might need a little reprice first to see

3646
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:29,280
Might need a little reprice first to see
 

3647
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:32,790
Might need a little reprice first to see
if they come back in at 500.

3648
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:32,800
if they come back in at 500.
 

3649
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,790
if they come back in at 500.
And if they don't then we're going to go

3650
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:34,800
And if they don't then we're going to go
 

3651
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,990
And if they don't then we're going to go
up.

3652
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:38,000

 

3653
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,310

There you go. Up back up towards 500.

3654
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:40,320
There you go. Up back up towards 500.
 

3655
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,669
There you go. Up back up towards 500.
And they will need to sell this now

3656
01:20:41,669 --> 01:20:41,679
And they will need to sell this now
 

3657
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:44,709
And they will need to sell this now
otherwise they will get caught.

3658
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:44,719
otherwise they will get caught.
 

3659
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:49,910
otherwise they will get caught.
Yes. Absorbing VW up

3660
01:20:49,910 --> 01:20:49,920

 

3661
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:59,350

back to its 20-day.

3662
01:20:59,350 --> 01:20:59,360

 

3663
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,790

We get back above this. The next

3664
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:00,800
We get back above this. The next
 

3665
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,470
We get back above this. The next
rotation's going to take place. This is

3666
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:02,480
rotation's going to take place. This is
 

3667
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:06,550
rotation's going to take place. This is
a little bit messy here.

3668
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:06,560
a little bit messy here.
 

3669
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,070
a little bit messy here.
Just let it poke through a bit more than

3670
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:08,080
Just let it poke through a bit more than
 

3671
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,070
Just let it poke through a bit more than
they probably should have there.

3672
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:10,080
they probably should have there.
 

3673
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,750
they probably should have there.
Yes, very very strong. Back into its

3674
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:11,760
Yes, very very strong. Back into its
 

3675
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,990
Yes, very very strong. Back into its
range already. So, gaining strength

3676
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:14,000
range already. So, gaining strength
 

3677
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,870
range already. So, gaining strength
there.

3678
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:18,880

 

3679
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,470

You can see this edge above sort of

3680
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:20,480
You can see this edge above sort of
 

3681
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,070
You can see this edge above sort of
around here. 30s like we talked about

3682
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:22,080
around here. 30s like we talked about
 

3683
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,430
around here. 30s like we talked about
before. I can move this down a little

3684
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:23,440
before. I can move this down a little
 

3685
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:24,870
before. I can move this down a little
bit. Something like this. It's a little

3686
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:24,880
bit. Something like this. It's a little
 

3687
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,350
bit. Something like this. It's a little
bit messy, I'll be honest. Shorts will

3688
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:27,360
bit messy, I'll be honest. Shorts will
 

3689
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,870
bit messy, I'll be honest. Shorts will
need to defend that. We're going to get

3690
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:28,880
need to defend that. We're going to get
 

3691
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,189
need to defend that. We're going to get
rid of this now. Shorts need to defend

3692
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:31,199
rid of this now. Shorts need to defend
 

3693
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:32,870
rid of this now. Shorts need to defend
this area. These are the rotations.

3694
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:32,880
this area. These are the rotations.
 

3695
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,229
this area. These are the rotations.
Bulls want to defend this. Shorts want

3696
01:21:34,229 --> 01:21:34,239
Bulls want to defend this. Shorts want
 

3697

Bulls want to defend this. Shorts want
to defend this. These are the rotational

3698
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:35,840
to defend this. These are the rotational
 

3699
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,149
to defend this. These are the rotational
areas.

3700
01:21:38,149 --> 01:21:38,159
areas.
 

3701
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,910

Bull's trying to be very aggressive here

3702
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:39,920
Bull's trying to be very aggressive here
 

3703
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,550
Bull's trying to be very aggressive here
right now. Uh into this shelf. Let's see

3704
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:42,560
right now. Uh into this shelf. Let's see
 

3705
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,830
right now. Uh into this shelf. Let's see
if there's a passive seller. This is

3706
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:43,840
if there's a passive seller. This is
 

3707
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,070
if there's a passive seller. This is
where they started selling before. 30s

3708
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:46,080
where they started selling before. 30s
 

3709
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,669
where they started selling before. 30s
up to 50s is where sellers took control.

3710
01:21:49,669 --> 01:21:49,679
up to 50s is where sellers took control.
 

3711
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:51,590
up to 50s is where sellers took control.
So that's where they need to maintain

3712
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:51,600
So that's where they need to maintain
 

3713
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,430
So that's where they need to maintain
control. If they want the rotation back

3714
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:53,440
control. If they want the rotation back
 

3715
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,669
control. If they want the rotation back
down, if they don't maintain control,

3716
01:21:55,669 --> 01:21:55,679
down, if they don't maintain control,
 

3717
01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:06,790
down, if they don't maintain control,
they're going to get squeezed out.

3718
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:06,800

 

3719
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,629

pretty good job here. Bears probably
 

3779
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,550
pretty good job here. Bears probably

going to get a tightening of range here.
 

3841
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:32,870
going to get a tightening of range here.
Bulls will want to defend sort of 14s.

Back to 40. This guy reloading at 40.
Does he move out the way? And do we

3846
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:36,480
Does he move out the way? And do we
 

3847
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,070
Does he move out the way? And do we
squeeze through now?

3848
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:40,080

 

3849
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,390

If we repric this, I'm telling you, the

3850
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:42,400
If we repric this, I'm telling you, the

right. If we repric this, the shorts are
 

3855
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:46,950
right. If we repric this, the shorts are
going to get caught because they've had

3856
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:46,960
going to get caught because they've had
 

3857
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,430
going to get caught because they've had
numerous attempts and they didn't

complete rotation and we're back inside
 

3861
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,510
complete rotation and we're back inside
gray box. So, I'm watching this now to

3862
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:53,520
gray box. So, I'm watching this now to
 

3863
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,310
gray box. So, I'm watching this now to
see if we hold for longs. Shorts are

3864
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:56,320
see if we hold for longs. Shorts are
 

3865
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,189
see if we hold for longs. Shorts are
trying to come in here and they're

3866
01:24:57,189 --> 01:24:57,199
trying to come in here and they're
 

3867
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:58,470
trying to come in here and they're
getting squeezed. We're going point of

3868
01:24:58,470 --> 01:24:58,480
getting squeezed. We're going point of
 

3869
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,470
getting squeezed. We're going point of
control now. 55s. Buyers getting trapped

3870
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:00,480
control now. 55s. Buyers getting trapped
 

3871
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,830

right at the high of that candle.

3872
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:03,840

Watching for acceptance over 55s now.

3874
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:08,400
Watching for acceptance over 55s now.
 

3875
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,790
Watching for acceptance over 55s now.
No acceptance over volume point uh VPO

3876
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:10,800
No acceptance over volume point uh VPO
 

3877
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,629
No acceptance over volume point uh VPO
on the day. So, this is biggest

3878
01:25:12,629 --> 01:25:12,639
on the day. So, this is biggest
 

3879
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:14,629
on the day. So, this is biggest
contested area of the day. We've had

3880
01:25:14,629 --> 01:25:14,639
contested area of the day. We've had
 

3881
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:16,310
contested area of the day. We've had
market shorts and market buyers come

3882
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:16,320
market shorts and market buyers come
 

3883
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,910
market shorts and market buyers come
there at the same time. So, big big

3884
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:17,920
there at the same time. So, big big
 

3885
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,910
there at the same time. So, big big
battle. I'm going to wait to see if we

3886
01:25:19,910 --> 01:25:19,920
battle. I'm going to wait to see if we
 

3887
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,430
battle. I'm going to wait to see if we
get over 55s and hold a bid because I

3888
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:23,440
get over 55s and hold a bid because I
 

3889
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,790
get over 55s and hold a bid because I
don't want to get caught in this gray

3890
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:24,800
don't want to get caught in this gray
 

3891
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:25,990
don't want to get caught in this gray
box. I'm going to wait to see if we get

3892
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:26,000
box. I'm going to wait to see if we get
 

3893
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,550
box. I'm going to wait to see if we get
over 55s and hold a bid to join long.

3894
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:28,560
over 55s and hold a bid to join long.
 

3895
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,390
over 55s and hold a bid to join long.
Otherwise, I'm not going to join. I know

3896
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:30,400
Otherwise, I'm not going to join. I know
 

3897
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,470
Otherwise, I'm not going to join. I know
I said earlier it's probably the worst

3898
01:25:32,470 --> 01:25:32,480
I said earlier it's probably the worst
 

3899
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,830
I said earlier it's probably the worst
location of the day, but you just feel

3900
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:33,840
location of the day, but you just feel
 

3901
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:39,270
location of the day, but you just feel
like they got a few caught there.

3902

01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:25,750
right? I don't want to trade into it.
All right, we didn't get down here for

3934
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:25,760
All right, we didn't get down here for
 

3935
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,270
All right, we didn't get down here for
that rotation. So, I'm waiting to see if

that rotation. So, I'm waiting to see if
we do one of these.

3939
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,430

So, remember the red line on your screen

3940
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:35,440
So, remember the red line on your screen
 

3941
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,270
So, remember the red line on your screen
is point of control on the day. It's the

3942
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:37,280
is point of control on the day. It's the
 

3943
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,669
is point of control on the day. It's the
most it's fair value on the day, right?

3944
01:26:39,669 --> 01:26:39,679
most it's fair value on the day, right?
 

3945
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:42,390
most it's fair value on the day, right?
It's most contested area. I'd much

3946
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:42,400
It's most contested area. I'd much
 

3947
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,990
It's most contested area. I'd much
rather actually be long down here, but

3948
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:44,000
rather actually be long down here, but
 

3949
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,669
rather actually be long down here, but
we didn't. What I would have liked to

3950
01:26:45,669 --> 01:26:45,679
we didn't. What I would have liked to
 

3951
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:48,310
we didn't. What I would have liked to
have seen if I'm honest is this, right?

3952
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:48,320
have seen if I'm honest is this, right?
 

3953
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,790
have seen if I'm honest is this, right?
That would have given me a cheap long to

3954
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:50,800
That would have given me a cheap long to
 

3955
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,390
That would have given me a cheap long to
drive back up. I'm not seeing that

3956
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:52,400
drive back up. I'm not seeing that
 

3957
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,470
drive back up. I'm not seeing that
unfortunately. And I'm not going to get

3958
01:26:54,470 --> 01:26:54,480
unfortunately. And I'm not going to get
 

3959
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,390
unfortunately. And I'm not going to get
long into the shelf. I'd need to get

3960
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:56,400
long into the shelf. I'd need to get
 

3961
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,229
long into the shelf. I'd need to get
above the shelf. Remember, same way we

3962
01:26:58,229 --> 01:26:58,239
above the shelf. Remember, same way we
 

3963
01:26:58,239 --> 01:26:59,830
above the shelf. Remember, same way we
talked about leaving the shelf. This

3964
01:26:59,830 --> 01:26:59,840
talked about leaving the shelf. This
 

3965
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,830
talked about leaving the shelf. This
trade here downside, we left the shelf,

3966
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:01,840
trade here downside, we left the shelf,
 

3967
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,149
trade here downside, we left the shelf,
rejected it, got below, came into that

3968
01:27:04,149 --> 01:27:04,159
rejected it, got below, came into that
 

3969
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:05,669
rejected it, got below, came into that
level. We would need to get above the

3970
01:27:05,669 --> 01:27:05,679
level. We would need to get above the
 

3971
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,590
level. We would need to get above the
shelf, come back to it, offer the buy

3972
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:07,600
shelf, come back to it, offer the buy
 

3973
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,270
shelf, come back to it, offer the buy
up, right? I'm not going to trade into

3974
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:09,280
up, right? I'm not going to trade into
 

3975
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,709
up, right? I'm not going to trade into
the level. I don't want to trade in

3976
01:27:10,709 --> 01:27:10,719
the level. I don't want to trade in
 

3977
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:13,110
the level. I don't want to trade in
here. I want to trade an edge of it cuz

3978
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:13,120

people that trade in here will get stuck

3980
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:14,800
people that trade in here will get stuck
 

3981
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:15,990
people that trade in here will get stuck
because look, look at all the volume

3982
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:16,000
because look, look at all the volume
 

3983
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,750
because look, look at all the volume
we've created. Think about all the

3984
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:17,760
we've created. Think about all the
 

3985
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,110
we've created. Think about all the
buyers and sellers. This is the price

3986
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:19,120
buyers and sellers. This is the price
 

3987
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,470
buyers and sellers. This is the price
that they agree on. That's why we're

3988
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:20,480
that they agree on. That's why we're
 

3989
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,229
that they agree on. That's why we're
trading here so much. We need one side

3990
01:27:22,229 --> 01:27:22,239
trading here so much. We need one side
 

3991
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:24,229
trading here so much. We need one side
to be stuck. We have buyers stuck here,

3992
01:27:24,229 --> 01:27:24,239
to be stuck. We have buyers stuck here,
 

3993
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,910
to be stuck. We have buyers stuck here,
so we sold down. If we have sellers

3994
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:25,920
so we sold down. If we have sellers
 

3995
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,310
so we sold down. If we have sellers
stuck here, we will buy up. We will use

3996
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:28,320
stuck here, we will buy up. We will use
 

3997
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,830
stuck here, we will buy up. We will use
their pain. I'm not going to I'm not

3998
01:27:29,830 --> 01:27:29,840
their pain. I'm not going to I'm not
 

3999
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,910
their pain. I'm not going to I'm not
going to become the liquidity. I'm going

4000
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:31,920
going to become the liquidity. I'm going
 

4001
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,830
going to become the liquidity. I'm going
to use the liquidity. So I am either

4002
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:33,840
to use the liquidity. So I am either
 

4003
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,750
to use the liquidity. So I am either
going to think about buying here or

4004
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:35,760
going to think about buying here or
 

4005
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,270
going to think about buying here or
buying here and I will think about

4006
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:37,280
buying here and I will think about
 

4007
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:44,709
buying here and I will think about
fading once I see enough buy side stuck.

4008
01:27:44,709 --> 01:27:44,719

 

4009
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:47,030

Uh this is based on reclaiming of flow

4010
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:47,040
Uh this is based on reclaiming of flow
 

4011
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,030
Uh this is based on reclaiming of flow
zones but I mean when we go sideways

4012
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:49,040
zones but I mean when we go sideways
 

4013
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,590
zones but I mean when we go sideways
like this you ignore I would ignore a

4014
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:51,600
like this you ignore I would ignore a
 

4015
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,910
like this you ignore I would ignore a
lot of it down here is like a better buy

4016
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:53,920
lot of it down here is like a better buy
 

4017
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,149
lot of it down here is like a better buy
right once we go big expansion that

4018
01:27:56,149 --> 01:27:56,159
right once we go big expansion that
 

4019
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:59,270
right once we go big expansion that
should trend up right. So once we go

4020
01:27:59,270 --> 01:27:59,280
should trend up right. So once we go
 

4021
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,750
should trend up right. So once we go
tight like this, you got uh flow zone

4022
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:01,760
tight like this, you got uh flow zone
 

4023
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,709
tight like this, you got uh flow zone

01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,070
talked about it, right? This is the
rotation that they might build. So, I'm

4284
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:36,080
rotation that they might build. So, I'm
 

4285
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,910
rotation that they might build. So, I'm
not going to buy this unless we come

4286
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:37,920
not going to buy this unless we come
 

4287
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,229
not going to buy this unless we come
down here and I see sellers stuck or we

4288
01:33:40,229 --> 01:33:40,239
down here and I see sellers stuck or we
 

4289
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:41,990
down here and I see sellers stuck or we
come up here and hold this and I see

4290
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:42,000
come up here and hold this and I see
 

4291
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,510
come up here and hold this and I see
sellers stuck. I'm not going to buy in

4292
01:33:43,510 --> 01:33:43,520
sellers stuck. I'm not going to buy in
 

4293
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,590
sellers stuck. I'm not going to buy in
between that range.

4294
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:45,600
between that range.
 

4295
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,189
between that range.
You see flow zone starting to flatten

4296
01:33:47,189 --> 01:33:47,199
You see flow zone starting to flatten
 

4297
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:48,470
You see flow zone starting to flatten
out now. Everything's starting to

4298
01:33:48,470 --> 01:33:48,480
out now. Everything's starting to
 

4299
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:51,030
out now. Everything's starting to
flatten out which means the setup right

4300
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:51,040
flatten out which means the setup right
 

4301
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,870
flatten out which means the setup right
now

4302
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:52,880

4303
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,550
now
is worse and worse and worse is best way

4304
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:54,560
is worse and worse and worse is best way
 

4305
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,430
is worse and worse and worse is best way
of putting it.

4306
01:33:57,430 --> 01:33:57,440
of putting it.
 

4307
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,830
of putting it.
Yeah. FCT FCT is the code for all the

Yeah. FCT FCT is the code for all the

You can use code flowzone, but FCT will

4312
01:34:04,149 --> 01:34:04,159
You can use code flowzone, but FCT will
 

4313
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:06,790
You can use code flowzone, but FCT will
get you 40% off if you buy f if you're

4315
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,149
get you 40% off if you buy f if you're
new, right? If you're new,

4316
01:34:10,149 --> 01:34:10,159
new, right? If you're new,
 

4317
01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:12,310
new, right? If you're new,
it will get you if you buy five

4318
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:12,320
it will get you if you buy five
 

4319
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,790
it will get you if you buy five
accounts. Oh, no, not even if you're

4320
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:14,800
accounts. Oh, no, not even if you're
 

4321
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,310

new. Just for anyone. I didn't know

4322
01:34:16,310 --> 01:34:16,320
new. Just for anyone. I didn't know
 

4323
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,629
new. Just for anyone. I didn't know
that. My bad. So, if you buy five

4324
01:34:18,629 --> 01:34:18,639
that. My bad. So, if you buy five
 

4325
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:20,470
that. My bad. So, if you buy five
accounts, which are flex or pro, I would

4326
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:20,480
accounts, which are flex or pro, I would
 

4327
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:21,990
accounts, which are flex or pro, I would
say go with the flex right now. You will

4342
01:34:41,669 --> 01:34:41,679
that. So if you trade with Topep,
 

4343
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:43,110
that. So if you trade with Topep,
that's probably where you want to go.

that's probably where you want to go.
It's it's the closest thing to those

It's it's the closest thing to those
 

4347
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:52,149
It's it's the closest thing to those
rules, I would say.

4365
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:13,189
doing the same. There's still relative
strength over there. One thing I would

4366
01:35:13,189 --> 01:35:13,199
strength over there. One thing I would
 

4367
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:15,030
strength over there. One thing I would
say, this is getting very ugly. All

4368
01:35:15,030 --> 01:35:15,040
say, this is getting very ugly. All
 

4369
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,590
say, this is getting very ugly. All
right, this is now the level. All right,

4370
01:35:17,590 --> 01:35:17,600
right, this is now the level. All right,
 

4371
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:22,790
right, this is now the level. All right,
here's your pin high.

4372
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:22,800

 

4373
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,430

There's your pin low. This is the

4374
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:25,440
There's your pin low. This is the
 

4375
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,350
There's your pin low. This is the
rotation. This is a failure to make a

4376
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:27,360
rotation. This is a failure to make a
 

4377
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,350
rotation. This is a failure to make a
new high. If we fail to make a new low,

4378
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:29,360
new high. If we fail to make a new low,
 

4379
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,790
new high. If we fail to make a new low,
we will just keep doing this. If we make

4380
01:35:30,790 --> 01:35:30,800
we will just keep doing this. If we make
 

4381
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,709
we will just keep doing this. If we make
a new low, this is where they're going

4382
01:35:32,709 --> 01:35:32,719
a new low, this is where they're going
 

4383
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:34,870
a new low, this is where they're going
to want to come.

4384
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:34,880
to want to come.
 

4385
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,950

But it's starting to look a little bit

But it's starting to look a little bit
 

4387
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,189
But it's starting to look a little bit
ugly out here. It is just a lower time

ugly out here. It is just a lower time
 

4389
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:41,110
ugly out here. It is just a lower time
frame players battling right now with

frame players battling right now with
 

4391
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:42,550
frame players battling right now with
the higher time frame players. I'm just

4392
01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:42,560
the higher time frame players. I'm just
 

4393
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,310
the higher time frame players. I'm just
going to wait for it to make a decision.

4394
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:44,320
going to wait for it to make a decision.
 

4395
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,470
going to wait for it to make a decision.
I don't mind bidding or bidding. And I

4396
01:35:46,470 --> 01:35:46,480
I don't mind bidding or bidding. And I
 

4397
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,229
I don't mind bidding or bidding. And I
also don't mind selling if we start

4398
01:35:48,229 --> 01:35:48,239
also don't mind selling if we start
 

4399
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:51,030
also don't mind selling if we start
cracking and going back into old uh old

4400
01:35:51,030 --> 01:35:51,040
cracking and going back into old uh old
 

4401
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:54,149
cracking and going back into old uh old
value. That's also okay.

4402
01:35:54,149 --> 01:35:54,159
value. That's also okay.
 

4403
01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:56,149
value. That's also okay.
You can see that point of control was

4404
01:35:56,149 --> 01:35:56,159
You can see that point of control was
 

4405
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:58,470
You can see that point of control was
protected by the sellers very very well

4406
01:35:58,470 --> 01:35:58,480
protected by the sellers very very well
 

4407
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:02,149
protected by the sellers very very well
there.

4408
01:36:02,149 --> 01:36:02,159

 

4409
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:05,430

Your short 539, same entry as before. I

4410
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:05,440
Your short 539, same entry as before. I
 

4411
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:06,470
Your short 539, same entry as before. I
don't know if you were the same guy as

4412
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:06,480
don't know if you were the same guy as
 

4413
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,870
don't know if you were the same guy as
before. 539. It's again it's good short.

4414
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:08,880
before. 539. It's again it's good short.
 

4415
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,470
before. 539. It's again it's good short.
Like it's a good short, but I would be

4416
01:36:10,470 --> 01:36:10,480
Like it's a good short, but I would be
 

4417
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:11,750
Like it's a good short, but I would be
covering something to this, right? It's

4418
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:11,760
covering something to this, right? It's
 

4419
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,189
covering something to this, right? It's
a good short. I'd be covering something

4420
01:36:13,189 --> 01:36:13,199
a good short. I'd be covering something
 

4421
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:14,709
a good short. I'd be covering something
to this because this is where shorts

4422
01:36:14,709 --> 01:36:14,719
to this because this is where shorts
 

4423
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:18,229
to this because this is where shorts
last got stuck, right? This is where we

4424
01:36:18,229 --> 01:36:18,239
last got stuck, right? This is where we
 

4425
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:19,830
last got stuck, right? This is where we
think about this. Look where the shorts

4426
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:19,840
think about this. Look where the shorts
 

4427
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:24,149
think about this. Look where the shorts
last got stuck. It came flying in

4428
01:36:24,149 --> 01:36:24,159
last got stuck. It came flying in
 

4429
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:27,110
last got stuck. It came flying in
here, here, here, and here. And they

4430
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:27,120
here, here, here, and here. And they
 

4431
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:28,629
here, here, here, and here. And they
just tried again there. All right. So,

4432
01:36:28,629 --> 01:36:28,639
just tried again there. All right. So,
 

4433
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:30,310
just tried again there. All right. So,
I'd be covering some into here just in

4434
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:30,320
I'd be covering some into here just in
 

4435
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,390
I'd be covering some into here just in
case. And if you get a new low, then you

4436
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:32,400
case. And if you get a new low, then you
 

4437
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,550
case. And if you get a new low, then you
look good. But I would always be

4438
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:34,560
look good. But I would always be
 

4439
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,310
look good. But I would always be
protective of where they're stuck before

4440
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:36,320
protective of where they're stuck before
 

4441
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:39,110
protective of where they're stuck before
because you might find them being like,

4442
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:39,120
because you might find them being like,
 

4443
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,590
because you might find them being like,
"Oh, get me out break even." So, even if

4444
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:41,600
"Oh, get me out break even." So, even if
 

4445
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,750
"Oh, get me out break even." So, even if
you're only covering 10% or something, I

4446
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:43,760
you're only covering 10% or something, I
 

4447
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,990
you're only covering 10% or something, I
would pay myself on this into this

4448
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:46,000
would pay myself on this into this
 

4449
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,590
would pay myself on this into this
pivot. And then, if you get down into

4450
01:36:47,590 --> 01:36:47,600
pivot. And then, if you get down into
 

4451
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,510
pivot. And then, if you get down into
here, great. Remember this gray box is

4452
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:49,520
here, great. Remember this gray box is
 

4453
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,030
here, great. Remember this gray box is
where you want to be covering and then

4454
01:36:51,030 --> 01:36:51,040
where you want to be covering and then
 

4455
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,629
where you want to be covering and then
this blue box. And then if we get back

4456
01:36:52,629 --> 01:36:52,639
this blue box. And then if we get back
 

4457
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:55,510
this blue box. And then if we get back
down into previous day value, well,

4458
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:55,520
down into previous day value, well,
 

4459
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,669
down into previous day value, well,
good for you if if you get that move, I

4460
01:36:57,669 --> 01:36:57,679
good for you if if you get that move, I
 

4461
01:36:57,679 --> 01:36:59,990
good for you if if you get that move, I
would say that will make you a very

4462
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:00,000
would say that will make you a very
 

4463
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:07,669
would say that will make you a very
happy person on a Friday.

4464
01:37:07,669 --> 01:37:07,679

 

4465
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:11,109

So ES into view up, spy up. All right.

4466
01:37:11,109 --> 01:37:11,119
So ES into view up, spy up. All right.
 

4467
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:12,709
So ES into view up, spy up. All right.
Like I said, I would be covering a

4468
01:37:12,709 --> 01:37:12,719
Like I said, I would be covering a
 

4469
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:15,109
Like I said, I would be covering a
little piece into here. you you look

4470
01:37:15,109 --> 01:37:15,119
little piece into here. you you look
 

4471
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:17,910
little piece into here. you you look
good for a move down, but I would always

4472
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:17,920
good for a move down, but I would always
 

4473
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:19,830
good for a move down, but I would always
respect what has happened when I look

4474
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:19,840
respect what has happened when I look
 

4475
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:22,390
respect what has happened when I look
left. But if you get a snap here, the

4476
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:22,400
left. But if you get a snap here, the
 

4477
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,229
left. But if you get a snap here, the
gray box is the target and then the blue

4478
01:37:24,229 --> 01:37:24,239
gray box is the target and then the blue
 

4479
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:25,830
gray box is the target and then the blue
box. All right, so if you get a snap

4480
01:37:25,830 --> 01:37:25,840
box. All right, so if you get a snap
 

4481
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:29,189
box. All right, so if you get a snap
here, cover and cover

4482
01:37:29,189 --> 01:37:29,199
here, cover and cover
 

4483
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:31,350
here, cover and cover
this. There's your value on the day. All

4484
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:31,360
this. There's your value on the day. All
 

4485
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:32,870
this. There's your value on the day. All
right, so this is discount on the

4486
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:32,880
right, so this is discount on the
 

4487
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,390
right, so this is discount on the
current day. So I'd be covering and if

4488
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:34,400
current day. So I'd be covering and if
 

4489
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:42,790
current day. So I'd be covering and if
you get lucky, you get this.

4490
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:42,800

 

4491
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:43,830

All right, I'm just going to use the

4492
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:43,840
All right, I'm just going to use the
 

4493
01:37:43,840 --> 01:39:08,149
All right, I'm just going to use the
bathroom. I'll be right back, folks.

4494
01:39:08,149 --> 01:39:08,159

 

4495
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:19,590

All

4496
01:39:19,590 --> 01:39:19,600

 

4497
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,669

right, folks.

4498
01:39:21,669 --> 01:39:21,679
right, folks.
 

4499
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:23,750
right, folks.
Oh, you're almost there for your TP. So,

4500
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:23,760
Oh, you're almost there for your TP. So,
 

4501
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:26,629
Oh, you're almost there for your TP. So,
remember this is a current week current

4502
01:39:26,629 --> 01:39:26,639
remember this is a current week current
 

4503
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:29,109
remember this is a current week current
week value area high.

4504
01:39:29,109 --> 01:39:29,119
week value area high.
 

4505
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:31,430
week value area high.
So, if they're looking for expansion,

4506
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:31,440
So, if they're looking for expansion,
 

4507
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:32,870
So, if they're looking for expansion,
they will want to defend this sort of

4508
01:39:32,870 --> 01:39:32,880
they will want to defend this sort of
 

4509
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,550
they will want to defend this sort of
blue line and gray box. All right, so

4510
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:34,560
blue line and gray box. All right, so
 

4511
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:35,990
blue line and gray box. All right, so
just be aware of that. You had a big

4512
01:39:35,990 --> 01:39:36,000
just be aware of that. You had a big
 

4513
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,590
just be aware of that. You had a big
buyer just step in and he stepped in

4514
01:39:37,590 --> 01:39:37,600
buyer just step in and he stepped in
 

4515
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,830
buyer just step in and he stepped in
again. So he's trying to move up here.

4516
01:39:39,830 --> 01:39:39,840
again. So he's trying to move up here.
 

4517
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,229
again. So he's trying to move up here.
What is he doing?

4518
01:39:42,229 --> 01:39:42,239
What is he doing?
 

4519
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:43,430
What is he doing?
He could have been covering to be

4520
01:39:43,430 --> 01:39:43,440
He could have been covering to be
 

4521
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:47,030
He could have been covering to be
honest.

4522
01:39:47,030 --> 01:39:47,040

 

4523
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:55,750

Could have been covering.

4524
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:55,760

 

4525
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,430

What's your long target? What do you

4526
01:39:57,430 --> 01:39:57,440
What's your long target? What do you
 

4527
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,830
What's your long target? What do you
mean?

4528
01:39:59,830 --> 01:39:59,840
mean?
 

4529
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:03,350
mean?
We're not in long yet. So

4530
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:03,360
We're not in long yet. So
 

4531
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,430
We're not in long yet. So
we can discuss targets as and when it

4532
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:05,440
we can discuss targets as and when it
 

4533
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,750
we can discuss targets as and when it
starts shaping up uh not before because

4534
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:07,760
starts shaping up uh not before because
 

4535
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:09,270
starts shaping up uh not before because
it's going to be based on structure and

4536
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:09,280
it's going to be based on structure and
 

4537
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:11,830
it's going to be based on structure and
volume and what's available. So we just

4538
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:11,840
volume and what's available. So we just
 

4539
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,709
volume and what's available. So we just
wait. Thanks Alex for your knowledge.

4540
01:40:14,709 --> 01:40:14,719
wait. Thanks Alex for your knowledge.
 

4541
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:16,229
wait. Thanks Alex for your knowledge.
Green week for me. See you next week.

Green week for me. See you next week.
Awesome. Awesome work Mar.

4544
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:26,239

 

4545
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:29,030

Yeah. repricing that whole uh candle

4546
01:40:29,030 --> 01:40:29,040
Yeah. repricing that whole uh candle
 

4547
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:31,910
Yeah. repricing that whole uh candle
from 9:45 this morning.

4548
01:40:31,910 --> 01:40:31,920
from 9:45 this morning.
 

4549
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,590
from 9:45 this morning.
So, they're still holding this rotation.

4550
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:33,600
So, they're still holding this rotation.
 

4551
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,310
So, they're still holding this rotation.
You can see like this great box and the

4552
01:40:36,310 --> 01:40:36,320
You can see like this great box and the
 

4553
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,950
You can see like this great box and the
current week uh value area high, right?

4554
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:38,960
current week uh value area high, right?
 

4555
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,229
current week uh value area high, right?
They're just soaking and straight back

4556
01:40:40,229 --> 01:40:40,239
They're just soaking and straight back
 

4557
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:42,390
They're just soaking and straight back
to VWAP. This is like I don't like

4558
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:42,400
to VWAP. This is like I don't like
 

4559
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,310
to VWAP. This is like I don't like
trading these. This is We talked about

4560
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:44,320
trading these. This is We talked about
 

4561
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,709
trading these. This is We talked about
this, didn't we? We talked about this

4562
01:40:46,709 --> 01:40:46,719
this, didn't we? We talked about this
 

4563
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:48,390
this, didn't we? We talked about this
probably needing to be built out because

4564
01:40:48,390 --> 01:40:48,400
probably needing to be built out because
 

4565
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,709
probably needing to be built out because
this is so thin, right? This is the

4566
01:40:50,709 --> 01:40:50,719
this is so thin, right? This is the
 

4567
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:52,950
this is so thin, right? This is the
battle, right? So, shorts are defending

4568
01:40:52,950 --> 01:40:52,960
battle, right? So, shorts are defending
 

4569
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,790
battle, right? So, shorts are defending
this, bulls are defending this. This is

4570
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:54,800
this, bulls are defending this. This is
 

4571
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,669
this, bulls are defending this. This is
your whips saw. Uh let me just check

4572
01:40:57,669 --> 01:40:57,679
your whips saw. Uh let me just check
 

4573
01:40:57,679 --> 01:41:00,550
your whips saw. Uh let me just check
where are we at on the options. So

4574
01:41:00,550 --> 01:41:00,560
where are we at on the options. So
 

4575
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,030
where are we at on the options. So
probably I would say probably cool wall

4576
01:41:03,030 --> 01:41:03,040
probably I would say probably cool wall
 

4577
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:05,830
probably I would say probably cool wall
680

4578
01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:05,840
680
 

4579
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,870
680
that's holding up spiders and the

4580
01:41:08,870 --> 01:41:08,880
that's holding up spiders and the
 

4581
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,550
that's holding up spiders and the
opening of the day was probably a bit of

4582
01:41:10,550 --> 01:41:10,560
opening of the day was probably a bit of
 

4583
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:13,189
opening of the day was probably a bit of
a put ball down at 675. So that's the

4584
01:41:13,189 --> 01:41:13,199
a put ball down at 675. So that's the
 

4585
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:16,149
a put ball down at 675. So that's the
rotation over there.

4586
01:41:16,149 --> 01:41:16,159
rotation over there.
 

4587
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:19,510
rotation over there.
They want to complete this rotation.

4588
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:19,520
They want to complete this rotation.
 

4589
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:28,229
They want to complete this rotation.
We will see.

4590
01:41:28,229 --> 01:41:28,239

 

4591
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:29,830

Can I please measure the bullish move?

4592
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:29,840
Can I please measure the bullish move?
 

4593
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:33,510
Can I please measure the bullish move?
You mean from the start of the day? I

4594
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:33,520
You mean from the start of the day? I

You mean the opening range like this

You mean the opening range like this
 

4597
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:41,350
You mean the opening range like this
9:30 low?

4598
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:41,360

 

4599
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:44,470

Yeah, you're in the 50.

4600
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:44,480
Yeah, you're in the 50.
 

4601
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:47,030
Yeah, you're in the 50.
So, gray box is in the 60s. little node

4602
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:47,040
So, gray box is in the 60s. little node
 

4603
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:49,030
So, gray box is in the 60s. little node
here that you'd be losing value at that

4604
01:41:49,030 --> 01:41:49,040
here that you'd be losing value at that
 

4605
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:50,470
here that you'd be losing value at that
point. You'd be trading back inside

4606
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:50,480
point. You'd be trading back inside
 

4607
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:53,910
point. You'd be trading back inside
current week. I will remind you,

4608
01:41:53,910 --> 01:41:53,920
current week. I will remind you,
 

4609
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:58,070
current week. I will remind you,
you must be looking higher time frame.

4610
01:41:58,070 --> 01:41:58,080
you must be looking higher time frame.
 

4611
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:02,629
you must be looking higher time frame.
Current week's value,

4612
01:42:02,629 --> 01:42:02,639

 

4613
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:04,870

previous day value,

4614
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:04,880
previous day value,
 

4615
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:06,790
previous day value,
day before that's value. We've moved

4616
01:42:06,790 --> 01:42:06,800
day before that's value. We've moved
 

4617
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:10,070
day before that's value. We've moved
value up. We've moved value up. We're

4618
01:42:10,070 --> 01:42:10,080
value up. We've moved value up. We're
 

4619
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:11,750
value up. We've moved value up. We're
trying to protect this. The question,

4620
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:11,760
trying to protect this. The question,
 

4621
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:14,149
trying to protect this. The question,
it's a question right now. Are buyers

4622
01:42:14,149 --> 01:42:14,159
it's a question right now. Are buyers
 

4623
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:15,830
it's a question right now. Are buyers
willing to defend this or is this going

4624
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:15,840
willing to defend this or is this going
 

4625
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:18,709
willing to defend this or is this going
to be a look above and fail back down to

4626
01:42:18,709 --> 01:42:18,719
to be a look above and fail back down to
 

4627
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:20,950
to be a look above and fail back down to
this block? And is that going to hold or

4628
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:20,960
this block? And is that going to hold or
 

4629
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,629
this block? And is that going to hold or
is that going to be look above and fail

4630
01:42:22,629 --> 01:42:22,639
is that going to be look above and fail
 

4631
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:25,990
is that going to be look above and fail
into old value?

4632
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:26,000
into old value?
 

4633
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,990
into old value?
But if we don't hold above this level

4634
01:42:27,990 --> 01:42:28,000
But if we don't hold above this level
 

4635
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,750
But if we don't hold above this level
right here,

4636
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:29,760
right here,
 

4637
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,430
right here,
then we're going to go back into the

4638
01:42:31,430 --> 01:42:31,440
then we're going to go back into the
 

4639
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:35,590
then we're going to go back into the
current developing profile and we could

4640
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:35,600
current developing profile and we could
 

4641
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:38,550
current developing profile and we could
think about 330s then potentially

4642
01:42:38,550 --> 01:42:38,560
think about 330s then potentially
 

4643
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,310
think about 330s then potentially
potentially. It's a bit early to say,

4644
01:42:40,310 --> 01:42:40,320
potentially. It's a bit early to say,
 

4645
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:45,990
potentially. It's a bit early to say,
but potentially

4646
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:46,000

 

4647
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,629

right now they're doing a good job of

4648
01:42:48,629 --> 01:42:48,639
right now they're doing a good job of
 

4649
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:50,070
right now they're doing a good job of
trying to absorb this level. This is

4650
01:42:50,070 --> 01:42:50,080
trying to absorb this level. This is
 

4651
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,830
trying to absorb this level. This is
kind of what we did yesterday. What was

4652
01:42:51,830 --> 01:42:51,840
kind of what we did yesterday. What was
 

4653
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,750
kind of what we did yesterday. What was
the level we bought bid off yesterday?

4654
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:53,760
the level we bought bid off yesterday?
 

4655
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:54,870
the level we bought bid off yesterday?
I'm trying to remember what we kept

4656
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:54,880
I'm trying to remember what we kept
 

4657
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:57,270
I'm trying to remember what we kept
buying. All right, there. Same thing.

4658
01:42:57,270 --> 01:42:57,280
buying. All right, there. Same thing.
 

4659
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,950
buying. All right, there. Same thing.
One, two, three, four attempts they had

4660
01:42:58,950 --> 01:42:58,960
One, two, three, four attempts they had
 

4661
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:01,590
One, two, three, four attempts they had
of breaking down underneath uh the 95s.

4662
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:01,600
of breaking down underneath uh the 95s.
 

4663
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:03,270
of breaking down underneath uh the 95s.
I think it was 220s was the level for

4664
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:03,280
I think it was 220s was the level for
 

4665
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:10,550
I think it was 220s was the level for
the rip. And uh same kind of thing.

4666
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:10,560

 

4667
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,470

So lower time frame sellers I would say

4668
01:43:12,470 --> 01:43:12,480
So lower time frame sellers I would say
 

4669
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:15,350
So lower time frame sellers I would say
are in control. Lower time frame higher

4670
01:43:15,350 --> 01:43:15,360
are in control. Lower time frame higher
 

4671
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:17,430
are in control. Lower time frame higher
time frame bulls have got a chance.

4672
01:43:17,430 --> 01:43:17,440
time frame bulls have got a chance.
 

4673
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:32,790
time frame bulls have got a chance.
They've got a chance.

4674
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:32,800

 

4675
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,470

You haven't seen anyone chart the way I

4676
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:34,480
You haven't seen anyone chart the way I
 

4677
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:36,070
You haven't seen anyone chart the way I
do. I'm blowing your mind and you like

4678
01:43:36,070 --> 01:43:36,080
do. I'm blowing your mind and you like
 

4679
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:38,629
do. I'm blowing your mind and you like
it. It's probably uh not because I'm

4680
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:38,639
it. It's probably uh not because I'm
 

4681
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:39,990
it. It's probably uh not because I'm
particularly good. It's probably more

4682
01:43:39,990 --> 01:43:40,000
particularly good. It's probably more
 

4683
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,750
particularly good. It's probably more
that most people on YouTube are

4684
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:41,760
that most people on YouTube are
 

4685
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:44,229
that most people on YouTube are

pullback. We are in the pullback after

pullback? If we hold the pullback and
 

4873
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:11,189
pullback? If we hold the pullback and

01:48:11,189 --> 01:48:11,199
bid, then yes, this can still be a look
 

4875
01:48:11,199 --> 01:48:14,629

pullbacks. All right, in here we were in
liquidity build. In here, we've built

liquidity build. In here, we've built
 

4883
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:23,990
liquidity build. In here, we've built
it. Now, we've used it. Can we hold it?

4884
01:48:23,990 --> 01:48:24,000
it. Now, we've used it. Can we hold it?
 

4885
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,669
it. Now, we've used it. Can we hold it?
If we can't hold it and we come back

4886
01:48:25,669 --> 01:48:25,679
If we can't hold it and we come back
 

4887
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:28,149
If we can't hold it and we come back
down into here, this is nothing more

4888
01:48:28,149 --> 01:48:28,159
down into here, this is nothing more
 

4889
01:48:28,159 --> 01:48:34,470
down into here, this is nothing more
than a big old bull trap.

01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:01,189

They're still bidding off here, but

4906
01:49:01,189 --> 01:49:01,199
They're still bidding off here, but
 

4907
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:03,430
They're still bidding off here, but
again we're developing a little little

4908
01:49:03,430 --> 01:49:03,440
again we're developing a little little
 

4909
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:05,270
again we're developing a little little
shelf here at 88. So I'd say if they can

4910
01:49:05,270 --> 01:49:05,280
shelf here at 88. So I'd say if they can
 

4911
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:07,109
shelf here at 88. So I'd say if they can
bid and hold above 88, they got to then

4912
01:49:07,109 --> 01:49:07,119
bid and hold above 88, they got to then
 

4913
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:09,189
bid and hold above 88, they got to then
get through VWAP. ES is still holding

4914
01:49:09,189 --> 01:49:09,199
get through VWAP. ES is still holding
 

4915
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:10,629
get through VWAP. ES is still holding
its VW up and maybe they come and test

4916
01:49:10,629 --> 01:49:10,639
its VW up and maybe they come and test
 

4917
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:13,830
its VW up and maybe they come and test
up here. This is what I don't like is

4918
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:13,840
up here. This is what I don't like is
 

4919
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:15,750
up here. This is what I don't like is
this developing this way. So it's not as

4920
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:15,760
this developing this way. So it's not as
 

4921
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:18,310
this developing this way. So it's not as
sharp now. We've like extended that a

4922
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:18,320
sharp now. We've like extended that a
 

4923
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:20,870
sharp now. We've like extended that a
little bit more that slope there

4924
01:49:20,870 --> 01:49:20,880
little bit more that slope there
 

4925
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:22,070
little bit more that slope there
unfortunately. And then we've got a

4926
01:49:22,070 --> 01:49:22,080
unfortunately. And then we've got a
 

4927
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:23,350
unfortunately. And then we've got a
little bit here and then a little bit

4928
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:23,360
little bit here and then a little bit
 

4929
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:26,629
little bit here and then a little bit
here, a little bit here. It's a teeny

4930
01:49:26,629 --> 01:49:26,639
here, a little bit here. It's a teeny
 

4931
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:32,070
here, a little bit here. It's a teeny
bit messy

4932
01:49:32,070 --> 01:49:32,080

 

4933
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:33,669

at the moment. I'd say sellers are in

4934
01:49:33,669 --> 01:49:33,679
at the moment. I'd say sellers are in
 

4935
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:35,590
at the moment. I'd say sellers are in
control.

4936
01:49:35,590 --> 01:49:35,600
control.
 

4937
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:39,590
control.
Sellers are in control. Here they come.

4938
01:49:39,590 --> 01:49:39,600
Sellers are in control. Here they come.
 

4939
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:41,590
Sellers are in control. Here they come.
Let's see what they're going to do here.

4940
01:49:41,590 --> 01:49:41,600
Let's see what they're going to do here.
 

4941
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:43,350
Let's see what they're going to do here.
Are they going to be aggressive and get

4942
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:43,360
Are they going to be aggressive and get
 

4943
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:45,270
Are they going to be aggressive and get
us down into this block? And then what

4944
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:45,280
us down into this block? And then what
 

4945
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:47,109
us down into this block? And then what
are we going to do? Are bulls actually

4946
01:49:47,109 --> 01:49:47,119
are we going to do? Are bulls actually
 

4947
01:49:47,119 --> 01:49:49,030
are we going to do? Are bulls actually
going to step up in this grail blue box

4948
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:49,040
going to step up in this grail blue box
 

4949
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:52,149
going to step up in this grail blue box
today? Or is this a look above and a

4950
01:49:52,149 --> 01:49:52,159
today? Or is this a look above and a
 

4951
01:49:52,159 --> 01:50:00,790
today? Or is this a look above and a
fail?

4952
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:00,800

 

4953
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,229

Yeah, give me a second, Ericin, because

4954
01:50:02,229 --> 01:50:02,239
Yeah, give me a second, Ericin, because
 

4955
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:03,990
Yeah, give me a second, Ericin, because
I just want to like focus on this now

4956
01:50:03,990 --> 01:50:04,000
I just want to like focus on this now
 

4957
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,510
I just want to like focus on this now
just in case we get a lot of trap

4958
01:50:05,510 --> 01:50:05,520
just in case we get a lot of trap
 

4959
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:09,109
just in case we get a lot of trap
participants, in case there's a

4960
01:50:09,109 --> 01:50:09,119
participants, in case there's a
 

4961
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:11,109
participants, in case there's a
mean reversion back into range setting

4962
01:50:11,109 --> 01:50:11,119
mean reversion back into range setting
 

4963
01:50:11,119 --> 01:50:12,629
mean reversion back into range setting
up here as we come into this gray box.

4964
01:50:12,629 --> 01:50:12,639
up here as we come into this gray box.
 

4965
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:14,390
up here as we come into this gray box.
Just what let me uh just watch this for

4966
01:50:14,390 --> 01:50:14,400
Just what let me uh just watch this for
 

4967
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:16,470
Just what let me uh just watch this for
a second. So, we've had a [\h__\h] ton of

4968
01:50:16,470 --> 01:50:16,480
a second. So, we've had a [\h__\h] ton of
 

4969
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:18,229
a second. So, we've had a [\h__\h] ton of
sellers just come flying in here under

4970
01:50:18,229 --> 01:50:18,239
sellers just come flying in here under
 

4971
01:50:18,239 --> 01:50:21,189
sellers just come flying in here under
previous week close. So, 70 to 60 was

4972
01:50:21,189 --> 01:50:21,199
previous week close. So, 70 to 60 was
 

4973
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:24,070
previous week close. So, 70 to 60 was
all aggressive selling. So, just trying

4974
01:50:24,070 --> 01:50:24,080
all aggressive selling. So, just trying
 

4975
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,629
all aggressive selling. So, just trying
to see here if they get follow through

4976
01:50:26,629 --> 01:50:26,639
to see here if they get follow through
 

4977
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:29,189
to see here if they get follow through
or if a bid comes back in again. We

4978
01:50:29,189 --> 01:50:29,199
or if a bid comes back in again. We
 

4979
01:50:29,199 --> 01:50:30,550
or if a bid comes back in again. We
haven't come back down into this blue

4980
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:30,560
haven't come back down into this blue
 

4981
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:33,990
haven't come back down into this blue
box yet.

4982
01:50:33,990 --> 01:50:34,000

 

4983
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,430

Still getting absorbed here. There's

4984
01:50:35,430 --> 01:50:35,440
Still getting absorbed here. There's
 

4985
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:37,030
Still getting absorbed here. There's
definitely a passive bid here starting

4986
01:50:37,030 --> 01:50:37,040
definitely a passive bid here starting
 

4987
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:38,950
definitely a passive bid here starting
to to soak, but we're at value area low

4988
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:38,960
to to soak, but we're at value area low
 

4989
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:40,470
to to soak, but we're at value area low
on the day. If they start expanding

4990
01:50:40,470 --> 01:50:40,480
on the day. If they start expanding
 

4991
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:41,910
on the day. If they start expanding
through here, this is going to be like

4992
01:50:41,910 --> 01:50:41,920
through here, this is going to be like
 

4993
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:43,669
through here, this is going to be like
potential mean reversion trades. This

4994
01:50:43,669 --> 01:50:43,679
potential mean reversion trades. This
 

4995
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:45,270
potential mean reversion trades. This
why I just want to wait for a second

4996
01:50:45,270 --> 01:50:45,280
why I just want to wait for a second
 

4997
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:49,350
why I just want to wait for a second
before I answer you.

4998
01:50:49,350 --> 01:50:49,360

 

4999
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:52,149

Rebidding at 65.

5000
01:50:52,149 --> 01:50:52,159
Rebidding at 65.
 

5001
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:54,870
Rebidding at 65.
So I'd say 70 is is the line here.

5002
01:50:54,870 --> 01:50:54,880
So I'd say 70 is is the line here.
 

5003
01:50:54,880 --> 01:51:02,629
So I'd say 70 is is the line here.
Sellers need it back below 70 right now.

5004
01:51:02,629 --> 01:51:02,639

 

5005
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:04,149

Balls keep coming in here. I'm just

5006
01:51:04,149 --> 01:51:04,159
Balls keep coming in here. I'm just
 

5007
01:51:04,159 --> 01:51:05,750
Balls keep coming in here. I'm just
waiting to see if they get hit down one

5008
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:05,760
waiting to see if they get hit down one
 

5009
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,910
waiting to see if they get hit down one
more time and then see if this guy on

5010
01:51:07,910 --> 01:51:07,920
more time and then see if this guy on
 

5011
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:09,830
more time and then see if this guy on
tape wants to actually absorb. He keeps

5012
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:09,840
tape wants to actually absorb. He keeps
 

5013
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:12,870
tape wants to actually absorb. He keeps
moving away from 65. So, might be a bit

5014
01:51:12,870 --> 01:51:12,880
moving away from 65. So, might be a bit
 

5015
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:24,070
moving away from 65. So, might be a bit
of a spoofer down there.

5016
01:51:24,070 --> 01:51:24,080

 

5017
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:25,910

This level here. Sellers tried it again

5018
01:51:25,910 --> 01:51:25,920
This level here. Sellers tried it again
 

5019
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:29,590
This level here. Sellers tried it again
there and failed into 75.

5020
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:29,600
there and failed into 75.
 

5021
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:31,109
there and failed into 75.
Definitely seeing some absorption here

5022
01:51:31,109 --> 01:51:31,119
Definitely seeing some absorption here
 

5023
01:51:31,119 --> 01:51:33,350
Definitely seeing some absorption here
on the tape. I want to see one more

5024
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:33,360
on the tape. I want to see one more
 

5025
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:34,550
on the tape. I want to see one more
little flush down. Doesn't need to make

5026
01:51:34,550 --> 01:51:34,560
little flush down. Doesn't need to make
 

5027
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,709
little flush down. Doesn't need to make
a new low. I just want to see a little

5028
01:51:36,709 --> 01:51:36,719
a new low. I just want to see a little
 

5029
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:38,709
a new low. I just want to see a little
pull down just to know that there's a

5030
01:51:38,709 --> 01:51:38,719
pull down just to know that there's a
 

5031
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:43,430
pull down just to know that there's a
buyer willing to absorb.

5032
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:43,440

 

5033
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:45,750

Starting to see it. We need a pull. I

5034
01:51:45,750 --> 01:51:45,760
Starting to see it. We need a pull. I
 

5035
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:47,350
Starting to see it. We need a pull. I
need a pull down to see this buy. I

5036
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:47,360
need a pull down to see this buy. I
 

5037
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:48,790
need a pull down to see this buy. I
don't want to [\h__\h] get caught here.

5038
01:51:48,790 --> 01:51:48,800
don't want to [\h__\h] get caught here.
 

5039
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:49,589
don't want to [\h__\h] get caught here.
Otherwise, I'm going to have to play

5040
01:51:49,589 --> 01:51:49,599
Otherwise, I'm going to have to play
 

5041
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:52,390
Otherwise, I'm going to have to play
over it. You mother clucks.

5042
01:51:52,390 --> 01:51:52,400
over it. You mother clucks.
 

5043
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:54,390
over it. You mother clucks.
Very close to getting involved there.

5044
01:51:54,390 --> 01:51:54,400
Very close to getting involved there.
 

5045
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,149
Very close to getting involved there.
Maybe some of you took that value low

5046
01:51:56,149 --> 01:51:56,159
Maybe some of you took that value low
 

5047
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:57,990
Maybe some of you took that value low
reclaim. It was nice. Okay, here we go.

5048
01:51:57,990 --> 01:51:58,000
reclaim. It was nice. Okay, here we go.
 

5049
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,629
reclaim. It was nice. Okay, here we go.
Pull back in and show me.

Come on. I've been so patient. If you

5054
01:52:07,510 --> 01:52:07,520
Come on. I've been so patient. If you
 

5055
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:10,149
Come on. I've been so patient. If you
just go without me, I'm going to be

5056
01:52:10,149 --> 01:52:10,159
just go without me, I'm going to be
 

5057
01:52:10,159 --> 01:52:16,310
just go without me, I'm going to be
somewhat miffed.

5058
01:52:16,310 --> 01:52:16,320

 

5059
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:19,189

That line in the sand 70s

5060
01:52:19,189 --> 01:52:19,199
That line in the sand 70s
 

5061
01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:22,229
That line in the sand 70s
20 points higher now. Come on,

5062
01:52:22,229 --> 01:52:22,239
20 points higher now. Come on,
 

5063
01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:24,070
20 points higher now. Come on,
you buggers. You caught those shorts and

5064
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:24,080
you buggers. You caught those shorts and
 

5065
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:26,629
you buggers. You caught those shorts and
you went, you didn't give me a chance. I

5066
01:52:26,629 --> 01:52:26,639
you went, you didn't give me a chance. I
 

5067
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:29,910
you went, you didn't give me a chance. I
should have just slapped the market.

5068
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:29,920
should have just slapped the market.
 

5069
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:33,510
should have just slapped the market.
[\h__\h] happen sometimes. That's twice

5070
01:52:33,510 --> 01:52:33,520
[\h__\h] happen sometimes. That's twice
 

5071
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:35,430
[\h__\h] happen sometimes. That's twice
today. Twice today I've seen them

5072
01:52:35,430 --> 01:52:35,440
today. Twice today I've seen them
 

5073
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:43,350
today. Twice today I've seen them
trapped and not be able to get filled.

5074
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:43,360

 

5075
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:46,390

Oh, so annoying.

5076
01:52:46,390 --> 01:52:46,400
Oh, so annoying.
 

5077
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:48,390
Oh, so annoying.
All right, so what did I see? Same thing

5078
01:52:48,390 --> 01:52:48,400
All right, so what did I see? Same thing
 

5079
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:50,070
All right, so what did I see? Same thing
as always. All right, into the gray box

5080
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:50,080
as always. All right, into the gray box
 

5081
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:52,229
as always. All right, into the gray box
where I was thinking about bidding and

5082
01:52:52,229 --> 01:52:52,239
where I was thinking about bidding and
 

5083
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:54,790
where I was thinking about bidding and
these guys got caught, right? They got

5084
01:52:54,790 --> 01:52:54,800
these guys got caught, right? They got
 

5085
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,950
these guys got caught, right? They got
caught and then we just went and I was

5086
01:52:56,950 --> 01:52:56,960
caught and then we just went and I was
 

5087
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:58,629
caught and then we just went and I was
just looking for one little tap back in

5088
01:52:58,629 --> 01:52:58,639
just looking for one little tap back in
 

5089
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:00,470
just looking for one little tap back in
somewhere down here to leave these guys

5090
01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:00,480
somewhere down here to leave these guys
 

5091
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:02,470
somewhere down here to leave these guys
trapped that I could long out of. And

5092
01:53:02,470 --> 01:53:02,480
trapped that I could long out of. And
 

5093
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:03,750
trapped that I could long out of. And
and unfortunately we're just going

5094
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:03,760
and unfortunately we're just going
 

5095
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:05,030
and unfortunately we're just going
straight squeeze out of it cuz these

5096
01:53:05,030 --> 01:53:05,040
straight squeeze out of it cuz these
 

5097
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:10,550
straight squeeze out of it cuz these
guys are all caught at the moment

5098
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:10,560

 

5099
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:12,229

cuz I wanted that for the first move

5100
01:53:12,229 --> 01:53:12,239
cuz I wanted that for the first move
 

5101
01:53:12,239 --> 01:53:15,589
cuz I wanted that for the first move
back into VWOP. So

5102
01:53:15,589 --> 01:53:15,599
back into VWOP. So
 

5103
01:53:15,599 --> 01:53:21,030
back into VWOP. So
we'll see. We'll see.

5104
01:53:21,030 --> 01:53:21,040

 

5105
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:22,870

No, you did. You didn't distract me. You

5106
01:53:22,870 --> 01:53:22,880
No, you did. You didn't distract me. You
 

5107
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,629
No, you did. You didn't distract me. You
didn't. I I was I was zoomed in and

5108
01:53:24,629 --> 01:53:24,639
didn't. I I was I was zoomed in and
 

5109
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:26,390
didn't. I I was I was zoomed in and
ready for it. I just there was no real

5110
01:53:26,390 --> 01:53:26,400
ready for it. I just there was no real
 

5111
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,070
ready for it. I just there was no real
entry. I maybe could have marketed on

5112
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:28,080
entry. I maybe could have marketed on
 

5113
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:30,390
entry. I maybe could have marketed on
the reclaimer 75. It wasn't new,

5114
01:53:30,390 --> 01:53:30,400
the reclaimer 75. It wasn't new,
 

5115
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:32,790
the reclaimer 75. It wasn't new,
honestly. It's just I didn't see I saw

5116
01:53:32,790 --> 01:53:32,800
honestly. It's just I didn't see I saw
 

5117
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:33,910
honestly. It's just I didn't see I saw
what I wanted to see with the trap

5118
01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:33,920
what I wanted to see with the trap
 

5119
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,990
what I wanted to see with the trap
players, but I couldn't um didn't see

5120
01:53:35,990 --> 01:53:36,000
players, but I couldn't um didn't see
 

5121
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,310
players, but I couldn't um didn't see
exactly the entry I want. Maybe they

5122
01:53:38,310 --> 01:53:38,320
exactly the entry I want. Maybe they
 

5123
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:40,709
exactly the entry I want. Maybe they
come back down and hold this m like

5124
01:53:40,709 --> 01:53:40,719
come back down and hold this m like
 

5125
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:48,149
come back down and hold this m like
maybe maybe it's very risky now though.

5126
01:53:48,149 --> 01:53:48,159

 

5127
01:53:48,159 --> 01:53:51,589

You [\h__\h] Oh, thank you. You little

5128
01:53:51,589 --> 01:53:51,599
You [\h__\h] Oh, thank you. You little
 

5129
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:53,350
You [\h__\h] Oh, thank you. You little
[\h__\h]

5130
01:53:53,350 --> 01:53:53,360
[\h__\h]
 

5131
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:57,189
[\h__\h]
Little [\h__\h]

5132
01:53:57,189 --> 01:53:57,199

 

5133
01:53:57,199 --> 01:54:00,629

[\h__\h] waited like an hour for that.

5134
01:54:00,629 --> 01:54:00,639
[\h__\h] waited like an hour for that.
 

5135
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:03,750
[\h__\h] waited like an hour for that.
Oh, the fun of the fun of trading. Eh,

5136
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:03,760
Oh, the fun of the fun of trading. Eh,
 

5137
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:05,510
Oh, the fun of the fun of trading. Eh,
you draw it out, you wait for it, you

5138
01:54:05,510 --> 01:54:05,520
you draw it out, you wait for it, you
 

5139
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:31,990
you draw it out, you wait for it, you
see them trapped, and then gone.

5140
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:32,000

 

5141
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,109

Oh, that's funny.

5142
01:54:35,109 --> 01:54:35,119
Oh, that's funny.
 

5143
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:36,629
Oh, that's funny.
All right, maybe if they get through V

5144
01:54:36,629 --> 01:54:36,639
All right, maybe if they get through V
 

5145
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:37,910
All right, maybe if they get through V
up, they probably come and visit up here

5146
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:37,920
up, they probably come and visit up here
 

5147
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,990
up, they probably come and visit up here
into 26es. So, if you are long, uh,

5148
01:54:39,990 --> 01:54:40,000
into 26es. So, if you are long, uh,
 

5149
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,589
into 26es. So, if you are long, uh,
we've got a ton of imbalances to start

5150
01:54:41,589 --> 01:54:41,599
we've got a ton of imbalances to start
 

5151
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:43,669
we've got a ton of imbalances to start
taking out. So my next target here would

5152
01:54:43,669 --> 01:54:43,679
taking out. So my next target here would
 

5153
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:46,070
taking out. So my next target here would
be sort of tens and twelves and then

5154
01:54:46,070 --> 01:54:46,080
be sort of tens and twelves and then
 

5155
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:47,669
be sort of tens and twelves and then
through that 20s. These are just

5156
01:54:47,669 --> 01:54:47,679
through that 20s. These are just
 

5157
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:50,709
through that 20s. These are just
imbalances and then 24s. Um the big

5158
01:54:50,709 --> 01:54:50,719
imbalances and then 24s. Um the big
 

5159
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:53,990
imbalances and then 24s. Um the big
selling started at 24. Uh there's a

5160
01:54:53,990 --> 01:54:54,000
selling started at 24. Uh there's a
 

5161
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,790
selling started at 24. Uh there's a
there's a cluster like 24 to 30 and then

5162
01:54:56,790 --> 01:54:56,800
there's a cluster like 24 to 30 and then
 

5163
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,669
there's a cluster like 24 to 30 and then
38 and 46 is where they were earlier. So

5164
01:54:59,669 --> 01:54:59,679
38 and 46 is where they were earlier. So
 

5165
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:01,270
38 and 46 is where they were earlier. So
I'd be taking profit into these like

5166
01:55:01,270 --> 01:55:01,280
I'd be taking profit into these like
 

5167
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:02,870
I'd be taking profit into these like
drives higher. Right? We're in a

5168
01:55:02,870 --> 01:55:02,880
drives higher. Right? We're in a
 

5169
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:05,030
drives higher. Right? We're in a
rotational market.

5170
01:55:05,030 --> 01:55:05,040
rotational market.
 

5171
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:06,950
rotational market.
Surprise surprise. We're in a rotational

5172
01:55:06,950 --> 01:55:06,960
Surprise surprise. We're in a rotational
 

5173
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:09,109
Surprise surprise. We're in a rotational
market. These are the edges like we've

5174
01:55:09,109 --> 01:55:09,119
market. These are the edges like we've
 

5175
01:55:09,119 --> 01:55:10,470
market. These are the edges like we've
talked about. We are likely to do this.

5176
01:55:10,470 --> 01:55:10,480
talked about. We are likely to do this.
 

5177
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:12,470
talked about. We are likely to do this.
So, I waited for an edge, right? Because

5178
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:12,480
So, I waited for an edge, right? Because
 

5179
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:13,830
So, I waited for an edge, right? Because
if we're in a rotation, I've got to

5180
01:55:13,830 --> 01:55:13,840
if we're in a rotation, I've got to
 

5181
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,830
if we're in a rotation, I've got to
trade an edge back upside. You don't

5182
01:55:15,830 --> 01:55:15,840
trade an edge back upside. You don't
 

5183
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,350
trade an edge back upside. You don't
want to join the mid part of this range.

5184
01:55:17,350 --> 01:55:17,360
want to join the mid part of this range.
 

5185
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:19,189
want to join the mid part of this range.
It's way too risky now. All right? You

5186
01:55:19,189 --> 01:55:19,199
It's way too risky now. All right? You
 

5187
01:55:19,199 --> 01:55:21,589
It's way too risky now. All right? You
you when we're trading rotation, it goes

5188
01:55:21,589 --> 01:55:21,599
you when we're trading rotation, it goes
 

5189
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:23,669
you when we're trading rotation, it goes
against trend, right? Trend, you like

5190
01:55:23,669 --> 01:55:23,679
against trend, right? Trend, you like
 

5191
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:25,430
against trend, right? Trend, you like
this and this and this and this and you

5192
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:25,440
this and this and this and this and you
 

5193
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:26,790
this and this and this and this and you
can join later. When you're trading

5194
01:55:26,790 --> 01:55:26,800
can join later. When you're trading
 

5195
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,870
can join later. When you're trading
rotation, you need to trade someone's

5196
01:55:28,870 --> 01:55:28,880
rotation, you need to trade someone's
 

5197
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:31,750
rotation, you need to trade someone's
pain. Profit profit and then if you get

5198
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:31,760
pain. Profit profit and then if you get
 

5199
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:43,510
pain. Profit profit and then if you get
acceptance, fantastic. But

5200
01:55:43,510 --> 01:55:43,520

 

5201
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:47,189

a called it absolutely perfect, but

5202
01:55:47,189 --> 01:55:47,199
a called it absolutely perfect, but
 

5203
01:55:47,199 --> 01:55:50,470
a called it absolutely perfect, but
couldn't get it. I'm sorry, guys.

5204
01:55:50,470 --> 01:55:50,480
couldn't get it. I'm sorry, guys.
 

5205
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:55,189
couldn't get it. I'm sorry, guys.
I'm sorry.

5206
01:55:55,189 --> 01:55:55,199

 

5207
01:55:55,199 --> 01:56:05,669

Oh god.

5208
01:56:05,669 --> 01:56:05,679

 

5209
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:08,550

just shows uh like

5210
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:08,560
just shows uh like
 

5211
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:11,350
just shows uh like
markets are funny things, right? I

5212
01:56:11,350 --> 01:56:11,360
markets are funny things, right? I
 

5213
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:14,070
markets are funny things, right? I
didn't want to limit order in here,

5214
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:14,080
didn't want to limit order in here,
 

5215
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:15,270
didn't want to limit order in here,
right? Cuz I don't know if they're going

5216
01:56:15,270 --> 01:56:15,280
right? Cuz I don't know if they're going
 

5217
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,030
right? Cuz I don't know if they're going
to flush it, but I saw them get trapped

5218
01:56:17,030 --> 01:56:17,040
to flush it, but I saw them get trapped
 

5219
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:18,470
to flush it, but I saw them get trapped
and the moment I saw them get trapped,

5220
01:56:18,470 --> 01:56:18,480
and the moment I saw them get trapped,
 

5221
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:19,910
and the moment I saw them get trapped,
look at these candles. Boom, boom, boom,

5222
01:56:19,910 --> 01:56:19,920
look at these candles. Boom, boom, boom,
 

5223
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:22,550
look at these candles. Boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom. We never gave me just this.

5224
01:56:22,550 --> 01:56:22,560
boom, boom. We never gave me just this.
 

5225
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:24,709
boom, boom. We never gave me just this.
It's all I wanted. All I wanted was a

5226
01:56:24,709 --> 01:56:24,719
It's all I wanted. All I wanted was a
 

5227
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:27,430
It's all I wanted. All I wanted was a
tiny little pull back in to see these

5228
01:56:27,430 --> 01:56:27,440
tiny little pull back in to see these
 

5229
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:29,430
tiny little pull back in to see these
guys get stuck and start to cover. But

5230
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:29,440
guys get stuck and start to cover. But
 

5231
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:32,629
guys get stuck and start to cover. But
we just rushed. And this is your TP. All

5232
01:56:32,629 --> 01:56:32,639
we just rushed. And this is your TP. All
 

5233
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:34,550
we just rushed. And this is your TP. All
right. So now I'd be out a good chunk.

5234
01:56:34,550 --> 01:56:34,560
right. So now I'd be out a good chunk.
 

5235
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:35,990
right. So now I'd be out a good chunk.
All right. Most of my profit would now

5236
01:56:35,990 --> 01:56:36,000
All right. Most of my profit would now
 

5237
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,669
All right. Most of my profit would now
be out of this cuz we can rotate back

5238
01:56:37,669 --> 01:56:37,679
be out of this cuz we can rotate back
 

5239
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:39,189
be out of this cuz we can rotate back
down again. This is a straight squeeze

5240
01:56:39,189 --> 01:56:39,199
down again. This is a straight squeeze
 

5241
01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:41,430
down again. This is a straight squeeze
up. We can rotate back down again. If

5242
01:56:41,430 --> 01:56:41,440
up. We can rotate back down again. If
 

5243
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:44,390
up. We can rotate back down again. If
you find acceptance above, then well,

5244
01:56:44,390 --> 01:56:44,400
you find acceptance above, then well,
 

5245

01:56:49,270 --> 01:56:49,280
get that, if you find acceptance now, if
 

5251
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,790
get that, if you find acceptance now, if
you bought this down here on the reclaim

5252
01:56:50,790 --> 01:56:50,800
you bought this down here on the reclaim
 

5253
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:52,390
you bought this down here on the reclaim
and you find acceptance over this, you

5254
01:56:52,390 --> 01:56:52,400
and you find acceptance over this, you
 

5255
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:53,910
and you find acceptance over this, you
are going to get a monster trade. I

5256
01:56:53,910 --> 01:56:53,920
are going to get a monster trade. I
 

5257
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:55,669
are going to get a monster trade. I
promise you. But you should be paying

5258
01:56:55,669 --> 01:56:55,679
promise you. But you should be paying
 

5259
01:56:55,679 --> 01:57:03,750
promise you. But you should be paying
yourself.

5260
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:03,760

 

5261
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:05,830

How did I know they were trapped? Uh

5262
01:57:05,830 --> 01:57:05,840
How did I know they were trapped? Uh
 

5263
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:08,470
How did I know they were trapped? Uh
because they they sold the low of day

5264
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:08,480
because they they sold the low of day
 

5265
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:11,030
because they they sold the low of day
into the pivot. Remember like this is

5266
01:57:11,030 --> 01:57:11,040
into the pivot. Remember like this is
 

5267
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,109
into the pivot. Remember like this is
we're in a rotation, right? If we're in

5268
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:13,119
we're in a rotation, right? If we're in
 

5269
01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:15,990
we're in a rotation, right? If we're in
a rotation

5270
01:57:15,990 --> 01:57:16,000
a rotation
 

5271
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,070
a rotation
and we're moving value up, right?

5272
01:57:18,070 --> 01:57:18,080
and we're moving value up, right?
 

5273
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:20,950
and we're moving value up, right?
Remember previous days values here,

5274
01:57:20,950 --> 01:57:20,960
Remember previous days values here,
 

5275
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:23,270
Remember previous days values here,
right? So we're moving value higher. So

5276
01:57:23,270 --> 01:57:23,280
right? So we're moving value higher. So
 

5277
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:25,669
right? So we're moving value higher. So
that means shorts in here are stuck and

5278
01:57:25,669 --> 01:57:25,679
that means shorts in here are stuck and
 

5279
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:27,750
that means shorts in here are stuck and
the day before value is like down here

5280
01:57:27,750 --> 01:57:27,760
the day before value is like down here
 

5281
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:29,510
the day before value is like down here
somewhere. So shorts here are stuck.

5282
01:57:29,510 --> 01:57:29,520
somewhere. So shorts here are stuck.
 

5283
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:31,189
somewhere. So shorts here are stuck.
Shorts here are stuck. So where do I

5284
01:57:31,189 --> 01:57:31,199
Shorts here are stuck. So where do I
 

5285
01:57:31,199 --> 01:57:33,750
Shorts here are stuck. So where do I
want to pay buy? I want to buy at a

5286
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:33,760
want to pay buy? I want to buy at a
 

5287
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:36,950
want to pay buy? I want to buy at a
level where I think is cheap on the day

5288
01:57:36,950 --> 01:57:36,960
level where I think is cheap on the day
 

5289
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:39,030
level where I think is cheap on the day
and where they might be forced to cover

5290
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:39,040
and where they might be forced to cover
 

5291
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:41,430
and where they might be forced to cover
and I want to buy where people who don't

5292
01:57:41,430 --> 01:57:41,440
and I want to buy where people who don't
 

5293
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:43,350
and I want to buy where people who don't
understand rotations are being too

5294
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:43,360
understand rotations are being too
 

5295
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:45,990
understand rotations are being too
aggressive. So

5296
01:57:45,990 --> 01:57:46,000
aggressive. So
 

5297
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:50,709
aggressive. So
this right is discount on the day.

5298
01:57:50,709 --> 01:57:50,719
this right is discount on the day.
 

5299
01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:52,950
this right is discount on the day.
That's our discount. So, I want to buy

5300
01:57:52,950 --> 01:57:52,960
That's our discount. So, I want to buy
 

5301
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:54,550
That's our discount. So, I want to buy
in here. This is an area where I'm

5302
01:57:54,550 --> 01:57:54,560
in here. This is an area where I'm
 

5303
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,950
in here. This is an area where I'm
interested to buy. Now, my signal to buy

5304
01:57:56,950 --> 01:57:56,960
interested to buy. Now, my signal to buy
 

5305
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:59,030
interested to buy. Now, my signal to buy
that again because we're in a rotation.

5306
01:57:59,030 --> 01:57:59,040
that again because we're in a rotation.
 

5307
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:01,750
that again because we're in a rotation.
I don't I ignore flow zones basically in

5308
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:01,760
I don't I ignore flow zones basically in
 

5309
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:04,629
I don't I ignore flow zones basically in
a rotation. So, in this in this wick

5310
01:58:04,629 --> 01:58:04,639
a rotation. So, in this in this wick
 

5311
01:58:04,639 --> 01:58:12,709
a rotation. So, in this in this wick
here, I want to see trap sellers

5312
01:58:12,709 --> 01:58:12,719

 

5313
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:15,750

on this breakdown

5314
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:15,760
on this breakdown
 

5315
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:17,669
on this breakdown
under here.

5316
01:58:17,669 --> 01:58:17,679
under here.
 

5317
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:19,189
under here.
We get trap sellers. And I actually see

5318
01:58:19,189 --> 01:58:19,199
We get trap sellers. And I actually see
 

5319
01:58:19,199 --> 01:58:22,629
We get trap sellers. And I actually see
it way better on Here,

5320
01:58:22,629 --> 01:58:22,639
it way better on Here,
 

5321
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:26,470
it way better on Here,
let me show you. All right, all of this

5322
01:58:26,470 --> 01:58:26,480
let me show you. All right, all of this
 

5323
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:29,830
let me show you. All right, all of this
was sell side, right? All of this move

5324
01:58:29,830 --> 01:58:29,840
was sell side, right? All of this move
 

5325
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:32,229
was sell side, right? All of this move
under value. Look at all this delta.

5326
01:58:32,229 --> 01:58:32,239
under value. Look at all this delta.
 

5327
01:58:32,239 --> 01:58:34,470
under value. Look at all this delta.
It's all sell delta. And here, big big

5328
01:58:34,470 --> 01:58:34,480
It's all sell delta. And here, big big
 

5329
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:36,390
It's all sell delta. And here, big big
level. And here at 80s, so you would

5330
01:58:36,390 --> 01:58:36,400
level. And here at 80s, so you would
 

5331
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:38,709
level. And here at 80s, so you would
have heard me say 82s, 82s, right? So,

5332
01:58:38,709 --> 01:58:38,719
have heard me say 82s, 82s, right? So,
 

5333
01:58:38,719 --> 01:58:40,629
have heard me say 82s, 82s, right? So,
all I wanted was a little pull back in.

5334
01:58:40,629 --> 01:58:40,639
all I wanted was a little pull back in.
 

5335
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:42,310
all I wanted was a little pull back in.
I can't draw on here annoyingly. This is

5336
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:42,320
I can't draw on here annoyingly. This is
 

5337
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:44,629
I can't draw on here annoyingly. This is
why I don't use Ninja Trader to teach.

5338
01:58:44,629 --> 01:58:44,639
why I don't use Ninja Trader to teach.
 

5339
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:46,550
why I don't use Ninja Trader to teach.
But all I wanted was a move up, a

5340
01:58:46,550 --> 01:58:46,560
But all I wanted was a move up, a
 

5341
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:48,310
But all I wanted was a move up, a
pullback, leave these guys trapped, and

5342
01:58:48,310 --> 01:58:48,320
pullback, leave these guys trapped, and
 

5343
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,390
pullback, leave these guys trapped, and
then I can trade the squeeze. That's all

5344
01:58:50,390 --> 01:58:50,400
then I can trade the squeeze. That's all
 

5345
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:52,070
then I can trade the squeeze. That's all
I wanted. You could argue I should have

5346
01:58:52,070 --> 01:58:52,080
I wanted. You could argue I should have
 

5347
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:54,629
I wanted. You could argue I should have
marketed in, but uh it's a harder, you

5348
01:58:54,629 --> 01:58:54,639
marketed in, but uh it's a harder, you
 

5349
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:55,910
marketed in, but uh it's a harder, you
know, I don't know what fill I'm going

5350
01:58:55,910 --> 01:58:55,920
know, I don't know what fill I'm going
 

5351
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:57,430
know, I don't know what fill I'm going
to get. If it skips and I get an awful

5352
01:58:57,430 --> 01:58:57,440
to get. If it skips and I get an awful
 

5353
01:58:57,440 --> 01:59:07,189
to get. If it skips and I get an awful
fill, I'm going to be fuming.

5354
01:59:07,189 --> 01:59:07,199

 

5355
01:59:07,199 --> 01:59:09,189

Exactly, Scott.

5356
01:59:09,189 --> 01:59:09,199
Exactly, Scott.
 

5357
01:59:09,199 --> 01:59:13,030
Exactly, Scott.
Exactly that. Scott

5358
01:59:13,030 --> 01:59:13,040

 

5359
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:16,870

Raph got 40 points. 480 to 520s. 480s.

5360
01:59:16,870 --> 01:59:16,880
Raph got 40 points. 480 to 520s. 480s.
 

5361
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:18,950
Raph got 40 points. 480 to 520s. 480s.
Really nice. You got that? 480s to 520s.

5362
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:18,960
Really nice. You got that? 480s to 520s.
 

5363
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:21,109
Really nice. You got that? 480s to 520s.
Yeah, it's really good. And like just

5364
01:59:21,109 --> 01:59:21,119
Yeah, it's really good. And like just
 

5365
01:59:21,119 --> 01:59:23,189
Yeah, it's really good. And like just
hopefully, you know, you'll run users

5366
01:59:23,189 --> 01:59:23,199
hopefully, you know, you'll run users
 

5367

hopefully, you know, you'll run users
go. You never know. But we're going to

5368
01:59:25,030 --> 01:59:25,040
go. You never know. But we're going to
 

5369
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:26,950

get going, you might be laughing. You

5372
01:59:29,189 --> 01:59:29,199
get going, you might be laughing. You
 

5373
01:59:29,199 --> 01:59:30,470
get going, you might be laughing. You
might have the trade of the day here,

5374
01:59:30,470 --> 01:59:30,480
might have the trade of the day here,
 

5375
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:32,390

5379
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:36,950
day here. They're getting really
aggressive on the buys here. They are

5380
01:59:36,950 --> 01:59:36,960
aggressive on the buys here. They are
 

5381
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:38,470
aggressive on the buys here. They are
trying to reclaim. So, they're piling

5382
01:59:38,470 --> 01:59:38,480
trying to reclaim. So, they're piling
 

5383
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:42,229
trying to reclaim. So, they're piling
in, looking to get back above this gray

5384
01:59:42,229 --> 01:59:42,239
in, looking to get back above this gray
 

5385
01:59:42,239 --> 01:59:44,950
in, looking to get back above this gray
box now. And if we get back above that,

5386
01:59:44,950 --> 01:59:44,960
box now. And if we get back above that,
 

5387
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:47,350
box now. And if we get back above that,
I will consider buying if we get back

5388
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:47,360
I will consider buying if we get back
 

5389
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:49,830
I will consider buying if we get back
above pull back and hold it. Knowing my

5390
01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:49,840
above pull back and hold it. Knowing my
 

5391
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:51,510
above pull back and hold it. Knowing my
luck, we get back above and we squeeze

5392
01:59:51,510 --> 01:59:51,520
luck, we get back above and we squeeze
 

5393
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:55,270
luck, we get back above and we squeeze
100 points.

5394
01:59:55,270 --> 01:59:55,280

 

5395
01:59:55,280 --> 02:00:03,189

Point control is red line.

5396
02:00:03,189 --> 02:00:03,199

 

5397
02:00:03,199 --> 02:00:06,070

So this is where all the sellers were.

5398
02:00:06,070 --> 02:00:06,080
So this is where all the sellers were.
 

5399
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:08,550
So this is where all the sellers were.
All the sellers came in earlier today

5400
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:08,560
All the sellers came in earlier today
 

5401
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:13,589
All the sellers came in earlier today
from 25 to 47. we get back above that u

5402
02:00:13,589 --> 02:00:13,599
from 25 to 47. we get back above that u
 

5403
02:00:13,599 --> 02:00:15,830
from 25 to 47. we get back above that u
and definitely if we get back above 57

5404
02:00:15,830 --> 02:00:15,840
and definitely if we get back above 57
 

5405
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:18,149
and definitely if we get back above 57
it is go time right for the market but

5406
02:00:18,149 --> 02:00:18,159
it is go time right for the market but
 

5407
02:00:18,159 --> 02:00:19,750
it is go time right for the market but
as long as you've paid yourself some

5408
02:00:19,750 --> 02:00:19,760
as long as you've paid yourself some
 

5409
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:40,629
as long as you've paid yourself some
you're okay

5410
02:00:40,629 --> 02:00:40,639

 

5411
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:42,790

I'm not actually using volutric bars.

I'm not actually using volutric bars.
 

5413
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:45,350
I'm not actually using volutric bars.
I'm using a third party indicator. But

5414
02:00:45,350 --> 02:00:45,360
I'm using a third party indicator. But
 

5415
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:48,550
I'm using a third party indicator. But
you can use volumetric bars. Yes. Same

5416
02:00:48,550 --> 02:00:48,560
you can use volumetric bars. Yes. Same
 

5417
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:51,030
you can use volumetric bars. Yes. Same
thing.

5418
02:00:51,030 --> 02:00:51,040
thing.
 

5419
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:54,310
thing.
Okay. Sellside imbalance here at 47s.

5420
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:54,320
Okay. Sellside imbalance here at 47s.
 

5421
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:57,030
Okay. Sellside imbalance here at 47s.
They need to get above that.

5422
02:00:57,030 --> 02:00:57,040
They need to get above that.
 

5423
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:58,790
They need to get above that.
They need to get above 47s and they need

5424
02:00:58,790 --> 02:00:58,800
They need to get above 47s and they need
 

5425
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:00,629
They need to get above 47s and they need
to get above 53s. And if they get above

5426
02:01:00,629 --> 02:01:00,639
to get above 53s. And if they get above
 

5427
02:01:00,639 --> 02:01:03,270
to get above 53s. And if they get above
value at 65, it is absolute [\h__\h] go

02:01:03,270 --> 02:01:03,280
value at 65, it is absolute [\h__\h] go
 

5429
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:05,589
value at 65, it is absolute [\h__\h] go
time for this market.

5430
02:01:05,589 --> 02:01:05,599
time for this market.
 

5431
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:09,189
time for this market.
Here we go. You guys are

5432
02:01:09,189 --> 02:01:09,199
Here we go. You guys are
 

5433
02:01:09,199 --> 02:01:11,030
Here we go. You guys are

God damn it. How can I give you guys a
 

5435
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:12,790
God damn it. How can I give you guys a
banger like this and not be in it? Okay,

5436
02:01:12,790 --> 02:01:12,800
banger like this and not be in it? Okay,
 

5437
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:15,109
banger like this and not be in it? Okay,
give me something to get get involved

5438
02:01:15,109 --> 02:01:15,119
give me something to get get involved
 

5439
02:01:15,119 --> 02:01:20,390
give me something to get get involved
in.

5440
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:20,400

 

5441
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:22,390

I would not be short here. There's

5442
02:01:22,390 --> 02:01:22,400
I would not be short here. There's
 

5443
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:23,750
I would not be short here. There's
nothing in here to stay short. You've

5444
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:23,760
nothing in here to stay short. You've
 

5445
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:25,109
nothing in here to stay short. You've
got you've got a level, but you've

5446
02:01:25,109 --> 02:01:25,119
got you've got a level, but you've
 

5447
02:01:25,119 --> 02:01:26,310
got you've got a level, but you've
traded into this is the third time

5448
02:01:26,310 --> 02:01:26,320
traded into this is the third time
 

5449
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:27,510
traded into this is the third time
you're probably going to see a bit of a

5450
02:01:27,510 --> 02:01:27,520
you're probably going to see a bit of a
 

5451
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:29,750
you're probably going to see a bit of a
squeeze. I would not be shorting against

5452
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:29,760
squeeze. I would not be shorting against
 

5453
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:31,430
squeeze. I would not be shorting against
this strong momentum. We're in a

5454
02:01:31,430 --> 02:01:31,440
this strong momentum. We're in a
 

5455
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:34,229
this strong momentum. We're in a
rotation. Yeah, location is okay for the

5456
02:01:34,229 --> 02:01:34,239
rotation. Yeah, location is okay for the
 

5457
02:01:34,239 --> 02:01:36,149
rotation. Yeah, location is okay for the
short, but look at the momentum. Strong

5458
02:01:36,149 --> 02:01:36,159
short, but look at the momentum. Strong
 

5459
02:01:36,159 --> 02:01:38,470
short, but look at the momentum. Strong
upside then very might well squeeze

5460
02:01:38,470 --> 02:01:38,480
upside then very might well squeeze
 

5461
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:40,709
upside then very might well squeeze
everyone out. ES is looking for IB high.

5462
02:01:40,709 --> 02:01:40,719
everyone out. ES is looking for IB high.
 

5463
02:01:40,719 --> 02:01:42,629
everyone out. ES is looking for IB high.
We're going to look for the same here.

5464
02:01:42,629 --> 02:01:42,639
We're going to look for the same here.
 

5465
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:44,629
We're going to look for the same here.
Top side of this gray box. And we're

5466
02:01:44,629 --> 02:01:44,639
Top side of this gray box. And we're
 

5467
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:47,270
Top side of this gray box. And we're
probably going to squeeze it all out.

5468
02:01:47,270 --> 02:01:47,280
probably going to squeeze it all out.
 

5469
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,910
probably going to squeeze it all out.
Here we go, folks.

5470
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:49,920
Here we go, folks.
 

5471
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:52,629
Here we go, folks.
Value area high on the day 66.

5472
02:01:52,629 --> 02:01:52,639
Value area high on the day 66.
 

5473
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:54,229
Value area high on the day 66.
Initial balance right up at those highs

5474
02:01:54,229 --> 02:01:54,239
Initial balance right up at those highs
 

5475
02:01:54,239 --> 02:01:56,310
Initial balance right up at those highs
at 600. So that would be your target if

5476
02:01:56,310 --> 02:01:56,320
at 600. So that would be your target if
 

5477
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:57,750
at 600. So that would be your target if
we get through value area high. So we

5478
02:01:57,750 --> 02:01:57,760
we get through value area high. So we
 

5479
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:59,350
we get through value area high. So we
get through 66. I'd be taking some

5480
02:01:59,350 --> 02:01:59,360
get through 66. I'd be taking some
 

5481
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:00,790
get through 66. I'd be taking some
profit in and around here. And then

5482
02:02:00,790 --> 02:02:00,800
profit in and around here. And then
 

5483
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:02,790
profit in and around here. And then
you're looking for a higher day. And if

5484
02:02:02,790 --> 02:02:02,800
you're looking for a higher day. And if
 

5485
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:05,589
you're looking for a higher day. And if
you get very very very lucky, you will

5486
02:02:05,589 --> 02:02:05,599
you get very very very lucky, you will
 

5487
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:09,109
you get very very very lucky, you will
get 700 today. Very lucky. But we are

5488
02:02:09,109 --> 02:02:09,119
get 700 today. Very lucky. But we are
 

5489
02:02:09,119 --> 02:02:11,030
get 700 today. Very lucky. But we are
you're not going to uh assume that. So

5490
02:02:11,030 --> 02:02:11,040
you're not going to uh assume that. So
 

5491
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:12,950
you're not going to uh assume that. So
I'd be out a big chunk of my profit

5492
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:12,960
I'd be out a big chunk of my profit
 

5493
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:15,910
I'd be out a big chunk of my profit
here. Probably 60 70% if you took this

5494
02:02:15,910 --> 02:02:15,920
here. Probably 60 70% if you took this
 

5495
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:19,669
here. Probably 60 70% if you took this
reaction here. 60 70% 10% here and then

5496
02:02:19,669 --> 02:02:19,679
reaction here. 60 70% 10% here and then
 

5497
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:21,589
reaction here. 60 70% 10% here and then
hold 10 just in case you get up there.

5498
02:02:21,589 --> 02:02:21,599
hold 10 just in case you get up there.
 

5499
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:24,550
hold 10 just in case you get up there.
Right.

5500
02:02:24,550 --> 02:02:24,560
Right.
 

5501
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:26,629
Right.
I'd be out most of my money in this gray

5502
02:02:26,629 --> 02:02:26,639
I'd be out most of my money in this gray
 

5503
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:34,790
I'd be out most of my money in this gray
box.

5504
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:34,800

 

5505
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,709

If you see a rejection, the problem with

5506
02:02:36,709 --> 02:02:36,719
If you see a rejection, the problem with
 

5507
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:40,390
If you see a rejection, the problem with
the short now is how we've built, right?

5508
02:02:40,390 --> 02:02:40,400
the short now is how we've built, right?
 

5509
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:44,629
the short now is how we've built, right?
Because we've built these nodes here.

5510
02:02:44,629 --> 02:02:44,639
Because we've built these nodes here.
 

5511
02:02:44,639 --> 02:02:46,870
Because we've built these nodes here.
All right. So, maybe you see something

5512
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:46,880
All right. So, maybe you see something
 

5513
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:48,550
All right. So, maybe you see something
like this, but your cover points are

5514
02:02:48,550 --> 02:02:48,560
like this, but your cover points are
 

5515
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:49,750
like this, but your cover points are
going to be here and here, and we don't

it's OPEX. I I'm less inclined

trading rotations, right? You should
know that if you're joining me here. I

5596

absolutely hate it. Especially as the
 

5599
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:24,390
absolutely hate it. Especially as the
rotations start to get tighter because

5600
02:04:24,390 --> 02:04:24,400
rotations start to get tighter because
 

5601
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:28,629
rotations start to get tighter because
at least this morning. All right, we had

5602
02:04:28,629 --> 02:04:28,639
at least this morning. All right, we had
 

5603
02:04:28,639 --> 02:04:30,870
at least this morning. All right, we had
expansion from here to this red box

5604
02:04:30,870 --> 02:04:30,880
expansion from here to this red box
 

5605
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:33,189
expansion from here to this red box
which has been here before this morning.

5606
02:04:33,189 --> 02:04:33,199
which has been here before this morning.
 

5607
02:04:33,199 --> 02:04:35,830
which has been here before this morning.
Then we had move from here to here. Then

5608
02:04:35,830 --> 02:04:35,840
Then we had move from here to here. Then
 

5609
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:37,990
Then we had move from here to here. Then
it's got tighter and tighter and

5610
02:04:37,990 --> 02:04:38,000
it's got tighter and tighter and
 

5611
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,790
it's got tighter and tighter and
tighter. Right? So the range was here.

5612
02:04:40,790 --> 02:04:40,800
tighter. Right? So the range was here.
 

5613
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:43,750
tighter. Right? So the range was here.
Then it became this. Then it became this

5614
02:04:43,750 --> 02:04:43,760
Then it became this. Then it became this
 

5615
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:46,310
Then it became this. Then it became this
again. Now it might become this. Right?

5616
02:04:46,310 --> 02:04:46,320
again. Now it might become this. Right?
 

5617
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:47,669
again. Now it might become this. Right?
We are getting tighter and tighter and

5618
02:04:47,669 --> 02:04:47,679
We are getting tighter and tighter and
 

5619
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:49,350
We are getting tighter and tighter and
tighter. There's less points to aim for

5620
02:04:49,350 --> 02:04:49,360
tighter. There's less points to aim for
 

5621
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:54,470
tighter. There's less points to aim for
is I guess a better way of me saying it.

we move into positive gamma. 615 I'm

5668
02:06:48,790 --> 02:06:48,800
we move into positive gamma. 615 I'm
 

5669
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:50,550
we move into positive gamma. 615 I'm
sure I wrote this on the cues. Let me

5670
02:06:50,550 --> 02:06:50,560
sure I wrote this on the cues. Let me
 

5671
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:53,030
sure I wrote this on the cues. Let me
check. Uh, I'm sure 615 was back into

5672
02:06:53,030 --> 02:06:53,040
check. Uh, I'm sure 615 was back into
 

5673
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:57,109
check. Uh, I'm sure 615 was back into
positive gamma on the cues. D. Why can't

5674
02:06:57,109 --> 02:06:57,119
positive gamma on the cues. D. Why can't
 

5675
02:06:57,119 --> 02:07:02,550
positive gamma on the cues. D. Why can't
I remember that? Come on, Alex.

5676
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:02,560

 

5677
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:09,510

I'm sure it's 600 to 615s.

5678
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:09,520

 

5679
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:13,510

600 to 615 call. So, if we're above 615s

5680
02:07:13,510 --> 02:07:13,520
600 to 615 call. So, if we're above 615s
 

5681
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:15,030
600 to 615 call. So, if we're above 615s
on

5682
02:07:15,030 --> 02:07:15,040
on
 

5683
02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:17,030
on
Q's, which we are, technically we're in

5684
02:07:17,030 --> 02:07:17,040
Q's, which we are, technically we're in
 

5685
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:18,790
Q's, which we are, technically we're in
positive gamma, which means a squeeze.

5686
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:18,800
positive gamma, which means a squeeze.
 

5687
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:21,109
positive gamma, which means a squeeze.
There is squeeze potential. There is

5688
02:07:21,109 --> 02:07:21,119
There is squeeze potential. There is
 

5689
02:07:21,119 --> 02:07:23,030
There is squeeze potential. There is
squeeze potential above 615. We're

5690
02:07:23,030 --> 02:07:23,040
squeeze potential above 615. We're
 

5691
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:25,669
squeeze potential above 615. We're
trying currently trading 616. So, and

5692
02:07:25,669 --> 02:07:25,679
trying currently trading 616. So, and
 

5693
02:07:25,679 --> 02:07:27,270
trying currently trading 616. So, and
that last pivot that held on that

5694
02:07:27,270 --> 02:07:27,280
that last pivot that held on that
 

5695
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:29,830
that last pivot that held on that
pullback was 615. So, we have squeeze

5696
02:07:29,830 --> 02:07:29,840
pullback was 615. So, we have squeeze
 

5697
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:31,990
pullback was 615. So, we have squeeze
potential today on the queue. So, I will

5698
02:07:31,990 --> 02:07:32,000
potential today on the queue. So, I will
 

5699
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:44,950
potential today on the queue. So, I will
just say that

5700
02:07:44,950 --> 02:07:44,960

 

5701
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:46,550

what's the indicator point control on

5702
02:07:46,550 --> 02:07:46,560
what's the indicator point control on
 

5703
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:50,149
what's the indicator point control on
Ninja Trader? Um,

5704
02:07:50,149 --> 02:07:50,159
Ninja Trader? Um,
 

5705
02:07:50,159 --> 02:07:51,750
Ninja Trader? Um,
it's a third party. Let me see what it's

5706
02:07:51,750 --> 02:07:51,760
it's a third party. Let me see what it's
 

5707
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:53,510
it's a third party. Let me see what it's
called. It's not just point control.

5708
02:07:53,510 --> 02:07:53,520
called. It's not just point control.
 

5709
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:55,830
called. It's not just point control.
It's called city footprint. It's paid

It's called city footprint. It's paid
 

5711

Right? So if you can see how I trade, I

goes on. Yeah, similar to Q's basically
 

5745

goes on. Yeah, similar to Q's basically
Q's above 615 positive drift. Same

like, "Why isn't he in a trade? Why

isn't he doing anything?" Well, I missed
 

5771
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:37,830
isn't he doing anything?" Well, I missed
my entry at the lows. I'm going to be

5772
02:09:37,830 --> 02:09:37,840
my entry at the lows. I'm going to be
 

5773
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:39,350
my entry at the lows. I'm going to be
honest with you. I missed the entry at

02:09:39,350 --> 02:09:39,360
honest with you. I missed the entry at
 

5775
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:41,430
honest with you. I missed the entry at
the low. So, I have to wait now. Have to

5776
02:09:41,430 --> 02:09:41,440
the low. So, I have to wait now. Have to
 

5777
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:43,109
the low. So, I have to wait now. Have to
wait to see if we find acceptance above

5778
02:09:43,109 --> 02:09:43,119
wait to see if we find acceptance above
 

5779
02:09:43,119 --> 02:09:44,790
wait to see if we find acceptance above
this gray box. If we leave the gray box

5780
02:09:44,790 --> 02:09:44,800
this gray box. If we leave the gray box
 

5781
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:46,790
this gray box. If we leave the gray box
to the downside, I'm not convinced I'm

5782
02:09:46,790 --> 02:09:46,800
to the downside, I'm not convinced I'm
 

5783
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:49,189
to the downside, I'm not convinced I'm
going to touch it now given that we uh

5784
02:09:49,189 --> 02:09:49,199
going to touch it now given that we uh
 

5785
02:09:49,199 --> 02:09:51,109
going to touch it now given that we uh
have put in couple of lows down here.

5786
02:09:51,109 --> 02:09:51,119
have put in couple of lows down here.
 

5787
02:09:51,119 --> 02:09:53,030
have put in couple of lows down here.
And every time we've come down here,

5788
02:09:53,030 --> 02:09:53,040
And every time we've come down here,
 

5789
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:54,790
And every time we've come down here,
right, we've seen some big passive

5790
02:09:54,790 --> 02:09:54,800
right, we've seen some big passive
 

5791
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:58,629
right, we've seen some big passive
buying and this is the 615 level on QQQ.

5792
02:09:58,629 --> 02:09:58,639
buying and this is the 615 level on QQQ.
 

5793
02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:01,830

Why can't I draw that? QQQ. So, I know

5794
02:10:01,830 --> 02:10:01,840
Why can't I draw that? QQQ. So, I know
 

5795
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:03,990
Why can't I draw that? QQQ. So, I know
we're in positive gamma above that right

5796
02:10:03,990 --> 02:10:04,000
we're in positive gamma above that right
 

5797
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,950
we're in positive gamma above that right
now. I think the market is trying to

5798
02:10:06,950 --> 02:10:06,960
now. I think the market is trying to
 

5799
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:08,390
now. I think the market is trying to
drift higher.

5800
02:10:08,390 --> 02:10:08,400
drift higher.
 

5801
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:11,510
drift higher.

02:10:32,069 --> 02:10:32,079
Happens. It happens. I'm not going to
 

5821
02:10:32,079 --> 02:10:35,750
Happens. It happens. I'm not going to
get every trade, folks. But this is why

5822
02:10:35,750 --> 02:10:35,760
get every trade, folks. But this is why
 

5823
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:37,270
get every trade, folks. But this is why
those who are like, I want a signal when

5824
02:10:37,270 --> 02:10:37,280
those who are like, I want a signal when
 

5825
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:39,430
those who are like, I want a signal when
you buy and sell. The problem is I gave

5826
02:10:39,430 --> 02:10:39,440
you buy and sell. The problem is I gave
 

5827
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:40,629
you buy and sell. The problem is I gave
you the signal here when I'm talking

5828
02:10:40,629 --> 02:10:40,639
you the signal here when I'm talking
 

5829
02:10:40,639 --> 02:10:42,310
you the signal here when I'm talking
about it. I I told you I'm going to

5830
02:10:42,310 --> 02:10:42,320
about it. I I told you I'm going to
 

5831
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:43,510
about it. I I told you I'm going to
drift into here. I'm going to look for

5832
02:10:43,510 --> 02:10:43,520
drift into here. I'm going to look for
 

5833
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:45,589
drift into here. I'm going to look for
trapped sellers. And I told you they're

5834
02:10:45,589 --> 02:10:45,599
trapped sellers. And I told you they're
 

5835
02:10:45,599 --> 02:10:46,790
trapped sellers. And I told you they're
trapped. They're trapped. I'm going to

5836
02:10:46,790 --> 02:10:46,800
trapped. They're trapped. I'm going to
 

5837
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:48,470
trapped. They're trapped. I'm going to
wait for a pullback. But you guys might

5838
02:10:48,470 --> 02:10:48,480
wait for a pullback. But you guys might
 

5839
02:10:48,480 --> 02:10:50,069
wait for a pullback. But you guys might
not need to wait for a pullback. And if

5840
02:10:50,069 --> 02:10:50,079
not need to wait for a pullback. And if
 

5841
02:10:50,079 --> 02:10:51,830
not need to wait for a pullback. And if
you didn't, well, you've got a move I

5842
02:10:51,830 --> 02:10:51,840
you didn't, well, you've got a move I
 

5843
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:53,830
you didn't, well, you've got a move I
didn't get. So, this is why it's

5844
02:10:53,830 --> 02:10:53,840
didn't get. So, this is why it's
 

5845
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:55,109
didn't get. So, this is why it's
important to understand what's happening

5846
02:10:55,109 --> 02:10:55,119
important to understand what's happening
 

5847
02:10:55,119 --> 02:10:56,390
important to understand what's happening
in the chart. I'm not going to get

5848
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:56,400
in the chart. I'm not going to get
 

5849
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:58,229
in the chart. I'm not going to get
everything. Sometimes I'm going to get

5850
02:10:58,229 --> 02:10:58,239
everything. Sometimes I'm going to get
 

5851
02:10:58,239 --> 02:10:59,910
everything. Sometimes I'm going to get
it wrong.

5852
02:10:59,910 --> 02:10:59,920
it wrong.
 

5853
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:01,270
it wrong.
Sometimes I'm not going to take take

5854
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:01,280
Sometimes I'm not going to take take
 

5855
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:03,109
Sometimes I'm not going to take take
trades that you guys might take might

5856
02:11:03,109 --> 02:11:03,119
trades that you guys might take might
 

5857
02:11:03,119 --> 02:11:05,030
trades that you guys might take might
like to trade. So sellers keep coming in

5858
02:11:05,030 --> 02:11:05,040
like to trade. So sellers keep coming in
 

5859
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:07,109
like to trade. So sellers keep coming in
here getting caught.

5860
02:11:07,109 --> 02:11:07,119
here getting caught.
 

5861
02:11:07,119 --> 02:11:09,750
here getting caught.
Who's this guy coming in at 35? These

5862
02:11:09,750 --> 02:11:09,760
Who's this guy coming in at 35? These
 

5863
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:13,589
Who's this guy coming in at 35? These
idiots. 35 32. They keep getting caught

5864
02:11:13,589 --> 02:11:13,599
idiots. 35 32. They keep getting caught
 

5865
02:11:13,599 --> 02:11:15,910
idiots. 35 32. They keep getting caught
here. Sellers keep getting caught here.

5866
02:11:15,910 --> 02:11:15,920
here. Sellers keep getting caught here.
 

5867
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:25,510
here. Sellers keep getting caught here.
That is what I am seeing at the moment.

5868

5879
02:11:36,719 --> 02:11:38,550

Why can't I get long right now? Why

5880
02:11:38,550 --> 02:11:38,560
Why can't I get long right now? Why
 

5881
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:42,069
Why can't I get long right now? Why
would I? Let's frame this another way.

5882
02:11:42,069 --> 02:11:42,079
would I? Let's frame this another way.
 

5883
02:11:42,079 --> 02:11:46,870
would I? Let's frame this another way.
Why would I want to get long right now?

5884
02:11:46,870 --> 02:11:46,880
Why would I want to get long right now?
 

5885
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:48,550
Why would I want to get long right now?
Where's my edge in getting wrong long

5886
02:11:48,550 --> 02:11:48,560
Where's my edge in getting wrong long
 

5887
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:50,390
Where's my edge in getting wrong long
right now?

5888
02:11:50,390 --> 02:11:50,400
right now?

right now?
I don't want to buy fair value on the

Oh no. There we go.

Oh no. There we go.

Oh no. There we go.

No edge for me. That's where the edge

No edge for me. That's where the edge

Ray Ray, I've been trading since 1994.
You are very impressive. Keep preaching

5920
02:12:57,030 --> 02:12:57,040
You are very impressive. Keep preaching
 

5921

You are very impressive. Keep preaching

or you have no shot. Missing trades is

or you have no shot. Missing trades is
 

5925
02:13:00,639 --> 02:13:02,870
or you have no shot. Missing trades is
okay. Exactly, man.

5926
02:13:02,870 --> 02:13:02,880
okay. Exactly, man.
 

5927
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:04,629
okay. Exactly, man.
Exactly. I learned the hard way a long

5928
02:13:04,629 --> 02:13:04,639
Exactly. I learned the hard way a long
 

5929
02:13:04,639 --> 02:13:06,229
Exactly. I learned the hard way a long
time ago. Chasing trades will get you

5930
02:13:06,229 --> 02:13:06,239
time ago. Chasing trades will get you
 

5931
02:13:06,239 --> 02:13:09,430
time ago. Chasing trades will get you
wrecked. Trading in bad locations.

5932
02:13:09,430 --> 02:13:09,440
wrecked. Trading in bad locations.
 

5933
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:11,910
wrecked. Trading in bad locations.
Key to trading for me is trading in good

5934
02:13:11,910 --> 02:13:11,920
Key to trading for me is trading in good
 

5935
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:13,990
Key to trading for me is trading in good
locations and beyond that it's time.

5936
02:13:13,990 --> 02:13:14,000
locations and beyond that it's time.
 

5937
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,189
locations and beyond that it's time.
That's why I actually think swing

5938
02:13:15,189 --> 02:13:15,199
That's why I actually think swing
 

5939
02:13:15,199 --> 02:13:17,350
That's why I actually think swing
trading is way way easier. If you size

5940
02:13:17,350 --> 02:13:17,360
trading is way way easier. If you size
 

5941
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:18,870
trading is way way easier. If you size
down swing trading, if you're trading a

5942
02:13:18,870 --> 02:13:18,880
down swing trading, if you're trading a
 

5943
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:21,270
down swing trading, if you're trading a
good location, chances are you are

5944
02:13:21,270 --> 02:13:21,280
good location, chances are you are
 

5945
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:22,629
good location, chances are you are
buying yourself enough time to get a

5946
02:13:22,629 --> 02:13:22,639
buying yourself enough time to get a
 

5947
02:13:22,639 --> 02:13:23,990
buying yourself enough time to get a
good move as long as your stop is

5948
02:13:23,990 --> 02:13:24,000
good move as long as your stop is
 

5949
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,390
good move as long as your stop is
correct. Hardest thing in day trading is

5950
02:13:26,390 --> 02:13:26,400
correct. Hardest thing in day trading is
 

5951
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:27,990
correct. Hardest thing in day trading is
waiting for that location and then you

5952
02:13:27,990 --> 02:13:28,000
waiting for that location and then you
 

5953
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,510
waiting for that location and then you
don't have much time to attack it. Like

5954
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:29,520
don't have much time to attack it. Like
 

5955
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:31,830
don't have much time to attack it. Like
we just saw, didn't get the exact entry

5956
02:13:31,830 --> 02:13:31,840
we just saw, didn't get the exact entry
 

5957
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:34,470
we just saw, didn't get the exact entry
I want. Went without me. Missed the

5958
02:13:34,470 --> 02:13:34,480
I want. Went without me. Missed the
 

5959
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:46,310
I want. Went without me. Missed the
prime location. Don't chase. Let it go.

5960
02:13:46,310 --> 02:13:46,320

 

5961
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:49,109

My French felt felt fluid. It's not that

5962
02:13:49,109 --> 02:13:49,119
My French felt felt fluid. It's not that
 

5963
02:13:49,119 --> 02:13:56,229
My French felt felt fluid. It's not that
good. Really really isn't very good.

5964
02:13:56,229 --> 02:13:56,239

 

5965
02:13:56,239 --> 02:14:00,229

Thanks, Ray Ray.

5966
02:14:00,229 --> 02:14:00,239

 

5967
02:14:00,239 --> 02:14:02,069

All right, sellers are trying to get

5968
02:14:02,069 --> 02:14:02,079
All right, sellers are trying to get
 

5969
02:14:02,079 --> 02:14:03,750
All right, sellers are trying to get
this breakdown away from this range, but

5970
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:03,760
this breakdown away from this range, but
 

5971
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:05,350
this breakdown away from this range, but
every time we're coming into these 30s

5972
02:14:05,350 --> 02:14:05,360
every time we're coming into these 30s
 

5973
02:14:05,360 --> 02:14:07,510
every time we're coming into these 30s
and 20s, they are getting themselves

02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:47,750
in my head. It's nice knowing like I
know 615 600 level on QQQ. I I know 500

6132
02:18:47,750 --> 02:18:47,760
know 615 600 level on QQQ. I I know 500
 

6133
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:50,230
know 615 600 level on QQQ. I I know 500
was a level on NQ. 600 now the level

6134
02:18:50,230 --> 02:18:50,240
was a level on NQ. 600 now the level
 

6135
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:52,070
was a level on NQ. 600 now the level
today. I know above that is 700. I know

6136
02:18:52,070 --> 02:18:52,080
today. I know above that is 700. I know
 

6137
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:53,910
today. I know above that is 700. I know
they're easy levels at the moment, but

6138
02:18:53,910 --> 02:18:53,920
they're easy levels at the moment, but
 

6139
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:55,270
they're easy levels at the moment, but
that's just what they are based on the

6140
02:18:55,270 --> 02:18:55,280
that's just what they are based on the
 

6141
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:56,309
that's just what they are based on the
tape. It's not that they're whole

6142
02:18:56,309 --> 02:18:56,319
tape. It's not that they're whole
 

6143
02:18:56,319 --> 02:19:18,950
tape. It's not that they're whole
numbers. That's actually what they are.

6144
02:19:18,950 --> 02:19:18,960

 

6145
02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:21,110

correlation between ES and NQ. Do I ever

6146
02:19:21,110 --> 02:19:21,120
correlation between ES and NQ. Do I ever
 

6147
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:23,830
correlation between ES and NQ. Do I ever
consider one can already be outside the

6148
02:19:23,830 --> 02:19:23,840
consider one can already be outside the
 

6149
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:26,549
consider one can already be outside the
zone to buy like now ES and ENQ? Not

6150
02:19:26,549 --> 02:19:26,559
zone to buy like now ES and ENQ? Not
 

6151
02:19:26,559 --> 02:19:28,230
zone to buy like now ES and ENQ? Not
yet. Yeah, I mean I I'm watching them

6152
02:19:28,230 --> 02:19:28,240
yet. Yeah, I mean I I'm watching them
 

6153
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:29,910
yet. Yeah, I mean I I'm watching them
for correlation. Look, we're starting to

6154
02:19:29,910 --> 02:19:29,920
for correlation. Look, we're starting to
 

6155
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:33,910
for correlation. Look, we're starting to
break 680 here on spiders now. Um but

6156
02:19:33,910 --> 02:19:33,920
break 680 here on spiders now. Um but
 

6157
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:36,150
break 680 here on spiders now. Um but
it's also understanding why the

6158
02:19:36,150 --> 02:19:36,160
it's also understanding why the
 

6159
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:37,910
it's also understanding why the
correlation is or isn't there. Like if

6160
02:19:37,910 --> 02:19:37,920
correlation is or isn't there. Like if
 

6161
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:39,589
correlation is or isn't there. Like if
we have relative strength in one, it's

6162
02:19:39,589 --> 02:19:39,599
we have relative strength in one, it's
 

6163
02:19:39,599 --> 02:19:41,830
we have relative strength in one, it's
understanding why. Like if ES is

6164
02:19:41,830 --> 02:19:41,840
understanding why. Like if ES is
 

6165
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:43,270
understanding why. Like if ES is
stronger than ENQ, it's because

6166
02:19:43,270 --> 02:19:43,280
stronger than ENQ, it's because
 

6167
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:45,030
stronger than ENQ, it's because
healthcare or finances are running that

02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:54,230
break and look at look at spy above the

6176
02:19:54,230 --> 02:19:54,240
680. That's the key right into value
 

6177

use it as a magnet to draw up

6186
02:20:07,110 --> 02:20:07,120
use it as a magnet to draw up
 

6187
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:13,830
use it as a magnet to draw up
I'll call you later. All right, darling.

6203
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:41,750

they have a chance to squeeze here. If

02:20:54,150 --> 02:20:54,160
Still not left this volume here. But
 

6215
02:20:54,160 --> 02:20:55,670
Still not left this volume here. But
they are trying. They are desperately

Yes, took high day, traded back inside

6220
02:21:07,429 --> 02:21:07,439
Yes, took high day, traded back inside
 

6221
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:09,830
Yes, took high day, traded back inside
its range. Can it find a bid here again?

6222
02:21:09,830 --> 02:21:09,840
its range. Can it find a bid here again?
 

6223
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:13,110

Can Spy re rebid 680 or is that a failed

02:21:13,110 --> 02:21:13,120
Can Spy re rebid 680 or is that a failed

6227
02:21:20,319 --> 02:21:21,910

Back down to the 680s. It's going to

6228
02:21:21,910 --> 02:21:21,920
Back down to the 680s. It's going to
 

6229
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:25,270
Back down to the 680s. It's going to
come trading 68025s now. Does it find a

gamma or not. Is it a look above and a

02:21:31,510 --> 02:21:31,520
gamma or not. Is it a look above and a
 

6235
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:37,429
gamma or not. Is it a look above and a
fail? We are about to find out.

6236
02:21:37,429 --> 02:21:37,439

 

6237
02:21:37,439 --> 02:21:39,590

Cannot get above this gray box. Once we

6238
02:21:39,590 --> 02:21:39,600
Cannot get above this gray box. Once we
 

6239
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:40,950
Cannot get above this gray box. Once we
get above this gray box, you probably

6240
02:21:40,950 --> 02:21:40,960
get above this gray box, you probably
 

6241
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:42,389
get above this gray box, you probably
get a swipe higher. There will be a lot

6242
02:21:42,389 --> 02:21:42,399
get a swipe higher. There will be a lot
 

6243
02:21:42,399 --> 02:21:49,510
get a swipe higher. There will be a lot
of stops up here at this point.

6244
02:21:49,510 --> 02:21:49,520

 

6245
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:51,429

So, seller's trying to walk down now. He

6246
02:21:51,429 --> 02:21:51,439
So, seller's trying to walk down now. He
 

6247
02:21:51,439 --> 02:21:54,550
So, seller's trying to walk down now. He
moved from 65 to 60 to 55. Someone's

6248
02:21:54,550 --> 02:21:54,560
moved from 65 to 60 to 55. Someone's
 

6249
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:57,030
moved from 65 to 60 to 55. Someone's
desperate to get filled here at 55 60

6250
02:21:57,030 --> 02:21:57,040
desperate to get filled here at 55 60
 

6251
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:58,550
desperate to get filled here at 55 60
lot.

6252
02:21:58,550 --> 02:21:58,560
lot.
 

6253
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:02,389
lot.
He's getting impatient.

6254
02:22:02,389 --> 02:22:02,399

 

6255
02:22:02,399 --> 02:22:05,190

There's no real bid till 35 right now.

6256
02:22:05,190 --> 02:22:05,200
There's no real bid till 35 right now.
 

6257
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:06,630
There's no real bid till 35 right now.
He's getting very impatient. He's moved

6258
02:22:06,630 --> 02:22:06,640
He's getting very impatient. He's moved
 

6259
02:22:06,640 --> 02:22:09,830
He's getting very impatient. He's moved
to 50 now. He's trying to walk down now.

6260
02:22:09,830 --> 02:22:09,840
to 50 now. He's trying to walk down now.
 

6261
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:11,590
to 50 now. He's trying to walk down now.
He's getting very upset. He's not

6262
02:22:11,590 --> 02:22:11,600
He's getting very upset. He's not
 

6263
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:16,950
He's getting very upset. He's not
getting filled.

6264
02:22:16,950 --> 02:22:16,960

 

6265
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:20,710

51 is the level. That's where shorts

6266
02:22:20,710 --> 02:22:20,720
51 is the level. That's where shorts
 

6267
02:22:20,720 --> 02:22:22,230
51 is the level. That's where shorts
came flying in there. there. So if they

6268
02:22:22,230 --> 02:22:22,240
came flying in there. there. So if they
 

6269
02:22:22,240 --> 02:22:24,870
came flying in there. there. So if they
print back above 51, they can reprint

6270
02:22:24,870 --> 02:22:24,880
print back above 51, they can reprint
 

6271
02:22:24,880 --> 02:22:27,190
print back above 51, they can reprint
higher here. It's getting very tight

6272
02:22:27,190 --> 02:22:27,200
higher here. It's getting very tight
 

6273
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:29,110
higher here. It's getting very tight
though. So reprint 55s will be the next

6274
02:22:29,110 --> 02:22:29,120
though. So reprint 55s will be the next
 

6275
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:31,110
though. So reprint 55s will be the next
reprint. If they There you go. 351s. Can

6276
02:22:31,110 --> 02:22:31,120
reprint. If they There you go. 351s. Can
 

6277
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:33,349
reprint. If they There you go. 351s. Can
we go 55s? This where they're re

6278
02:22:33,349 --> 02:22:33,359
we go 55s? This where they're re
 

6279
02:22:33,359 --> 02:22:35,830
we go 55s? This where they're re
attacking this sell side.

6280
02:22:35,830 --> 02:22:35,840
attacking this sell side.
 

6281
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:37,349
attacking this sell side.
And if we can get through this, there is

6282
02:22:37,349 --> 02:22:37,359
And if we can get through this, there is
 

6283
02:22:37,359 --> 02:22:39,750
And if we can get through this, there is
a potential squeeze because they've just

6284
02:22:39,750 --> 02:22:39,760
a potential squeeze because they've just
 

6285
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:42,790
a potential squeeze because they've just
sold very hard into this now. So 60s, we

6286
02:22:42,790 --> 02:22:42,800
sold very hard into this now. So 60s, we
 

6287
02:22:42,800 --> 02:22:44,630
sold very hard into this now. So 60s, we
get through 60s, we go 70s. If we get

6288
02:22:44,630 --> 02:22:44,640
get through 60s, we go 70s. If we get
 

6289
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:47,590
get through 60s, we go 70s. If we get
through that, we go 600s probably. Yes.

6290
02:22:47,590 --> 02:22:47,600
through that, we go 600s probably. Yes.
 

6291
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:49,030
through that, we go 600s probably. Yes.
Trying to go again. So they held the

6292
02:22:49,030 --> 02:22:49,040
Trying to go again. So they held the
 

6293
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:50,870
Trying to go again. So they held the
680.

6294
02:22:50,870 --> 02:22:50,880
680.
 

6295
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:52,389
680.
So they've got a chance here to squeeze

6296
02:22:52,389 --> 02:22:52,399
So they've got a chance here to squeeze
 

6297
02:22:52,399 --> 02:22:56,630
So they've got a chance here to squeeze
out

6298
02:22:56,630 --> 02:22:56,640

 

6299
02:22:56,640 --> 02:23:00,790

560. They keep refreshing

6300
02:23:00,790 --> 02:23:00,800

 

6301
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:02,630

the lack of buying momentum up here into

6302
02:23:02,630 --> 02:23:02,640
the lack of buying momentum up here into
 

6303
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:21,670
the lack of buying momentum up here into
it.

6304
02:23:21,670 --> 02:23:21,680

 

6305
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:23,910

There's a refresh seller here at 60s.

6306
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:23,920
There's a refresh seller here at 60s.
 

6307
02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:25,429
There's a refresh seller here at 60s.
Keeps trying to come in and then walk

6308
02:23:25,429 --> 02:23:25,439
Keeps trying to come in and then walk
 

6309
02:23:25,439 --> 02:23:28,550
Keeps trying to come in and then walk
down.

6310
02:23:28,550 --> 02:23:28,560

 

6311
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:30,309

Still nothing for me yet. Not outside

6312
02:23:30,309 --> 02:23:30,319
Still nothing for me yet. Not outside
 

6313
02:23:30,319 --> 02:23:45,750
Still nothing for me yet. Not outside
this big gray box yet.

6314
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:45,760

 

6315
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:48,710

Rebidding 50s.

6316
02:23:48,710 --> 02:23:48,720
Rebidding 50s.
 

6317
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:50,870
Rebidding 50s.
That seller at 60s moved to 57. We're

6318
02:23:50,870 --> 02:23:50,880
That seller at 60s moved to 57. We're
 

6319
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:52,389
That seller at 60s moved to 57. We're
very tight seven point range here.

6320
02:23:52,389 --> 02:23:52,399
very tight seven point range here.
 

6321
02:23:52,399 --> 02:23:53,590
very tight seven point range here.
Something's going to give. They can't

6322
02:23:53,590 --> 02:23:53,600
Something's going to give. They can't
 

6323
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:55,429
Something's going to give. They can't
stay here forever. They've got too tight

6324
02:23:55,429 --> 02:23:55,439
stay here forever. They've got too tight
 

6325
02:23:55,439 --> 02:23:59,510
stay here forever. They've got too tight
here. They're juggling the tape.

6326
02:23:59,510 --> 02:23:59,520

 

6327
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:01,750

Something nasty will happen soon. They

6328
02:24:01,750 --> 02:24:01,760
Something nasty will happen soon. They
 

6329
02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:04,150
Something nasty will happen soon. They
can't stay like this forever. Someone's

6330
02:24:04,150 --> 02:24:04,160
can't stay like this forever. Someone's
 

6331
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:06,550
can't stay like this forever. Someone's
going to get swiped out or washed out.

6332
02:24:06,550 --> 02:24:06,560
going to get swiped out or washed out.
 

6333
02:24:06,560 --> 02:24:08,790
going to get swiped out or washed out.
One side of it. There's too much volume

6334
02:24:08,790 --> 02:24:08,800
One side of it. There's too much volume
 

6335
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:21,990
One side of it. There's too much volume
coming in at this level.

6336
02:24:21,990 --> 02:24:22,000

 

6337
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:27,190

Look at this battle.

6338
02:24:27,190 --> 02:24:27,200

 

6339
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:30,070

A little buy side imbalance.

6340
02:24:30,070 --> 02:24:30,080
A little buy side imbalance.
 

6341
02:24:30,080 --> 02:24:32,389
A little buy side imbalance.
Sellers need it under 30s. Honestly,

6342
02:24:32,389 --> 02:24:32,399
Sellers need it under 30s. Honestly,
 

6343
02:24:32,399 --> 02:24:39,429
Sellers need it under 30s. Honestly,
they need to exit 30s. These sellers.

6344
02:24:39,429 --> 02:24:39,439

 

6345
02:24:39,439 --> 02:24:41,110

I'm going to get some water. Oh, this

6346
02:24:41,110 --> 02:24:41,120
I'm going to get some water. Oh, this
 

6347
02:24:41,120 --> 02:25:55,990
I'm going to get some water. Oh, this
does this. Be right back.

6348
02:25:55,990 --> 02:25:56,000

 

6349
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,550

Wow. Still not moved.

6350
02:25:58,550 --> 02:25:58,560
Wow. Still not moved.
 

6351
02:25:58,560 --> 02:26:01,990
Wow. Still not moved.
Jeez.

6352
02:26:01,990 --> 02:26:02,000

 

6353
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:06,870

Can't believe that's still not moved.

6354
02:26:06,870 --> 02:26:06,880

 

6355
02:26:06,880 --> 02:26:08,389

It's like a double little node here.

6356
02:26:08,389 --> 02:26:08,399
It's like a double little node here.
 

6357
02:26:08,399 --> 02:26:10,710
It's like a double little node here.
It's gross. Gross. Gross. Gross. Gross.

6358
02:26:10,710 --> 02:26:10,720
It's gross. Gross. Gross. Gross. Gross.
 

6359
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:13,590
It's gross. Gross. Gross. Gross. Gross.
Gross. There's too many sellers here

6360
02:26:13,590 --> 02:26:13,600
Gross. There's too many sellers here
 

6361
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:18,070
Gross. There's too many sellers here
though under 51s. So they sold 51s, 47s,

6362
02:26:18,070 --> 02:26:18,080
though under 51s. So they sold 51s, 47s,
 

6363
02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:21,830
though under 51s. So they sold 51s, 47s,
38s, and 29s. And if we start breaking

6364
02:26:21,830 --> 02:26:21,840
38s, and 29s. And if we start breaking
 

6365
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:23,510
38s, and 29s. And if we start breaking
above value high, they're all going to

6366
02:26:23,510 --> 02:26:23,520
above value high, they're all going to
 

6367
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:33,110
above value high, they're all going to
force be forced to cover in my opinion.

6368
02:26:33,110 --> 02:26:33,120

 

6369
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:34,950

So here's the attempt at 60s. Once they

6370
02:26:34,950 --> 02:26:34,960
So here's the attempt at 60s. Once they
 

6371
02:26:34,960 --> 02:26:36,790
So here's the attempt at 60s. Once they
break that, they should swipe 70s and

6372
02:26:36,790 --> 02:26:36,800
break that, they should swipe 70s and
 

6373
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:39,270
break that, they should swipe 70s and
go. There you go. So now the question

6374
02:26:39,270 --> 02:26:39,280
go. There you go. So now the question
 

6375
02:26:39,280 --> 02:26:41,429
go. There you go. So now the question
is, can they hold a bid? Right? Because

6376
02:26:41,429 --> 02:26:41,439
is, can they hold a bid? Right? Because
 

6377
02:26:41,439 --> 02:26:43,590
is, can they hold a bid? Right? Because
that's the stop run. Can they hold a

6378
02:26:43,590 --> 02:26:43,600
that's the stop run. Can they hold a
 

6379
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:47,349
that's the stop run. Can they hold a
bid? Right.

6380
02:26:47,349 --> 02:26:47,359
bid? Right.
 

6381
02:26:47,359 --> 02:26:50,150
bid? Right.
So, here's 60s.

6382
02:26:50,150 --> 02:26:50,160
So, here's 60s.
 

6383
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:51,990
So, here's 60s.
Are they going to go 70s? Can they hold

6384
02:26:51,990 --> 02:26:52,000
Are they going to go 70s? Can they hold
 

6385
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,550
Are they going to go 70s? Can they hold
a bid now?

6386
02:26:54,550 --> 02:26:54,560
a bid now?
 

6387
02:26:54,560 --> 02:26:56,230
a bid now?
Because sellers can use aggressive

6388
02:26:56,230 --> 02:26:56,240
Because sellers can use aggressive
 

6389
02:26:56,240 --> 02:26:58,150
Because sellers can use aggressive
buyers to passively just smack back

6390
02:26:58,150 --> 02:26:58,160
buyers to passively just smack back
 

6391
02:26:58,160 --> 02:26:59,910
buyers to passively just smack back
down. So, want to see if they hold a bid

6392
02:26:59,910 --> 02:26:59,920
down. So, want to see if they hold a bid
 

6393
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:02,469
down. So, want to see if they hold a bid
or not.

6394
02:27:02,469 --> 02:27:02,479
or not.
 

6395
02:27:02,479 --> 02:27:04,550
or not.
At the moment, you had stops getting

6396
02:27:04,550 --> 02:27:04,560
At the moment, you had stops getting
 

6397
02:27:04,560 --> 02:27:07,750
At the moment, you had stops getting
popped there. Not actually that many,

6398
02:27:07,750 --> 02:27:07,760
popped there. Not actually that many,
 

6399
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:14,630
popped there. Not actually that many,
but there were stops being popped.

6400
02:27:14,630 --> 02:27:14,640

 

6401
02:27:14,640 --> 02:27:16,389

back down into range. Aggressive seller

6402
02:27:16,389 --> 02:27:16,399
back down into range. Aggressive seller
 

6403
02:27:16,399 --> 02:27:18,230
back down into range. Aggressive seller
coming in here at 55s again. It's just

6404
02:27:18,230 --> 02:27:18,240
coming in here at 55s again. It's just
 

6405
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:19,750
coming in here at 55s again. It's just
still

6406
02:27:19,750 --> 02:27:19,760
still
 

6407
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:21,349
still
not not enough. Not attractive enough

6408
02:27:21,349 --> 02:27:21,359
not not enough. Not attractive enough
 

6409
02:27:21,359 --> 02:27:25,750
not not enough. Not attractive enough
for me to do anything.

6410
02:27:25,750 --> 02:27:25,760

 

6411
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:33,030

You seeing both sides.

6412
02:27:33,030 --> 02:27:33,040

 

6413
02:27:33,040 --> 02:27:34,870

Someone's going to get hurt soon. Like

6414
02:27:34,870 --> 02:27:34,880
Someone's going to get hurt soon. Like
 

6415
02:27:34,880 --> 02:27:36,309
Someone's going to get hurt soon. Like
they could just drop this back down to

6416
02:27:36,309 --> 02:27:36,319
they could just drop this back down to
 

6417
02:27:36,319 --> 02:27:38,630
they could just drop this back down to
30 really quickly. And if they snap

6418
02:27:38,630 --> 02:27:38,640
30 really quickly. And if they snap
 

6419
02:27:38,640 --> 02:27:41,270
30 really quickly. And if they snap
that, they get a big wash. Or if they

6420
02:27:41,270 --> 02:27:41,280
that, they get a big wash. Or if they
 

6421
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:43,030
that, they get a big wash. Or if they
keep absorbing this little pocket in

6422
02:27:43,030 --> 02:27:43,040
keep absorbing this little pocket in
 

6423
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:46,070
keep absorbing this little pocket in
front of 30 and 40 and get a breakout,

6424
02:27:46,070 --> 02:27:46,080
front of 30 and 40 and get a breakout,
 

6425
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:49,349
front of 30 and 40 and get a breakout,
they can go the other way. Um it is like

6426
02:27:49,349 --> 02:27:49,359
they can go the other way. Um it is like
 

6427
02:27:49,359 --> 02:27:51,830
they can go the other way. Um it is like
a I don't know what like we're at the

6428
02:27:51,830 --> 02:27:51,840
a I don't know what like we're at the
 

6429
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:55,590
a I don't know what like we're at the
edge of value on the day, but uh

6430
02:27:55,590 --> 02:27:55,600
edge of value on the day, but uh
 

6431
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:57,750
edge of value on the day, but uh
all all I would say is in this pocket

6432
02:27:57,750 --> 02:27:57,760
all all I would say is in this pocket
 

6433
02:27:57,760 --> 02:28:01,030
all all I would say is in this pocket
here

6434
02:28:01,030 --> 02:28:01,040

 

6435
02:28:01,040 --> 02:28:04,230

is all sellers

6436
02:28:04,230 --> 02:28:04,240
is all sellers
 

6437
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:06,389
is all sellers
and if they stay stuck, this is

6438
02:28:06,389 --> 02:28:06,399
and if they stay stuck, this is
 

6439
02:28:06,399 --> 02:28:08,230
and if they stay stuck, this is
possible. Now, if they take control,

6440
02:28:08,230 --> 02:28:08,240
possible. Now, if they take control,
 

6441
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:11,030
possible. Now, if they take control,
that collapse can happen again for sure

6442
02:28:11,030 --> 02:28:11,040
that collapse can happen again for sure
 

6443
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:12,550
that collapse can happen again for sure
because this is the edge of value. This

6444
02:28:12,550 --> 02:28:12,560
because this is the edge of value. This
 

6445
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:13,910
because this is the edge of value. This
is the edge of the shelf. You can see

6446
02:28:13,910 --> 02:28:13,920
is the edge of the shelf. You can see
 

6447
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:16,070
is the edge of the shelf. You can see
why I don't trade in these gray boxes.

6448
02:28:16,070 --> 02:28:16,080
why I don't trade in these gray boxes.
 

6449
02:28:16,080 --> 02:28:17,750
why I don't trade in these gray boxes.
Someone asked me earlier, why why no

6450
02:28:17,750 --> 02:28:17,760
Someone asked me earlier, why why no
 

6451
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:19,270
Someone asked me earlier, why why no
long? Well, I just don't want to trade

6452
02:28:19,270 --> 02:28:19,280
long? Well, I just don't want to trade
 

6453
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:21,270
long? Well, I just don't want to trade
in this. You'd have to sit in this for

6454
02:28:21,270 --> 02:28:21,280
in this. You'd have to sit in this for
 

6455
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:26,950
in this. You'd have to sit in this for
so long.

6456
02:28:26,950 --> 02:28:26,960

 

6457
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:28,950

Yeah, totally divergence. Yeah, ES took

6458
02:28:28,950 --> 02:28:28,960
Yeah, totally divergence. Yeah, ES took
 

6459
02:28:28,960 --> 02:28:30,710
Yeah, totally divergence. Yeah, ES took
made a new high day, but it actually

6460
02:28:30,710 --> 02:28:30,720
made a new high day, but it actually
 

6461
02:28:30,720 --> 02:28:33,670
made a new high day, but it actually
missed its key level.

6462
02:28:33,670 --> 02:28:33,680
missed its key level.
 

6463
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:37,030
missed its key level.
It missed its key level as did spy.

6464
02:28:37,030 --> 02:28:37,040
It missed its key level as did spy.
 

6465
02:28:37,040 --> 02:29:02,469
It missed its key level as did spy.
Missed its key level.

6466
02:29:02,469 --> 02:29:02,479

 

6467
02:29:02,479 --> 02:29:04,710

Yes. Ray, Ray, that's a really good way

6468
02:29:04,710 --> 02:29:04,720
Yes. Ray, Ray, that's a really good way
 

6469
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:07,349
Yes. Ray, Ray, that's a really good way
of putting it. Tug of war. Definitely.

6470
02:29:07,349 --> 02:29:07,359
of putting it. Tug of war. Definitely.
 

6471
02:29:07,359 --> 02:29:09,030
of putting it. Tug of war. Definitely.
Definitely. So, if you think about point

6472
02:29:09,030 --> 02:29:09,040
Definitely. So, if you think about point
 

6473
02:29:09,040 --> 02:29:11,030
Definitely. So, if you think about point
of control,

6474
02:29:11,030 --> 02:29:11,040
of control,
 

6475
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:13,429
of control,
right? Point of control. This is the

6476
02:29:13,429 --> 02:29:13,439
right? Point of control. This is the
 

6477
02:29:13,439 --> 02:29:15,990
right? Point of control. This is the
price at which buyers

6478
02:29:15,990 --> 02:29:16,000
price at which buyers
 

6479
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,950
price at which buyers
and sellers agree on because it's where

6480
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:18,960
and sellers agree on because it's where
 

6481
02:29:18,960 --> 02:29:21,270
and sellers agree on because it's where
most volume has been traded and you need

6482
02:29:21,270 --> 02:29:21,280
most volume has been traded and you need
 

6483
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:23,670
most volume has been traded and you need
both sides to trade volume, right? So,

6484
02:29:23,670 --> 02:29:23,680
both sides to trade volume, right? So,
 

6485
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:25,349
both sides to trade volume, right? So,
that's where they agree is fair value.

6486
02:29:25,349 --> 02:29:25,359
that's where they agree is fair value.
 

6487
02:29:25,359 --> 02:29:28,389
that's where they agree is fair value.
And if we look at price around that,

6488
02:29:28,389 --> 02:29:28,399
And if we look at price around that,
 

6489
02:29:28,399 --> 02:29:31,030
And if we look at price around that,
right,

6490
02:29:31,030 --> 02:29:31,040
right,
 

6491
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:33,270
right,
sellers keep trying to sell under here,

6492
02:29:33,270 --> 02:29:33,280
sellers keep trying to sell under here,
 

6493
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:35,030
sellers keep trying to sell under here,
buyers keep trying to buy above here,

6494
02:29:35,030 --> 02:29:35,040
buyers keep trying to buy above here,
 

6495
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:37,349
buyers keep trying to buy above here,
and we keep getting stuck. And that's so

6496
02:29:37,349 --> 02:29:37,359
and we keep getting stuck. And that's so
 

6497
02:29:37,359 --> 02:29:39,190
and we keep getting stuck. And that's so
that's a really good way of putting it.

6498
02:29:39,190 --> 02:29:39,200
that's a really good way of putting it.
 

6499
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:41,830
that's a really good way of putting it.
It's a tug of war. What we're doing

6500
02:29:41,830 --> 02:29:41,840
It's a tug of war. What we're doing
 

6501
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:44,150
It's a tug of war. What we're doing
right now is we have acceptance in this

6502
02:29:44,150 --> 02:29:44,160
right now is we have acceptance in this
 

6503
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:47,750
right now is we have acceptance in this
range. This is fair value. All right? If

6504
02:29:47,750 --> 02:29:47,760
range. This is fair value. All right? If
 

6505
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:49,830
range. This is fair value. All right? If
buyers deem this is too cheap, we will

6506
02:29:49,830 --> 02:29:49,840
buyers deem this is too cheap, we will
 

6507
02:29:49,840 --> 02:29:51,990
buyers deem this is too cheap, we will
leave this range. If sellers deem this

6508
02:29:51,990 --> 02:29:52,000
leave this range. If sellers deem this
 

6509
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,429
leave this range. If sellers deem this
is too expensive and buyers get

6510
02:29:53,429 --> 02:29:53,439
is too expensive and buyers get
 

6511
02:29:53,439 --> 02:29:55,590
is too expensive and buyers get
exhausted, we will leave this range. If

6512
02:29:55,590 --> 02:29:55,600
exhausted, we will leave this range. If
 

6513
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:57,670
exhausted, we will leave this range. If
they just keep agreeing on price, we

6514
02:29:57,670 --> 02:29:57,680
they just keep agreeing on price, we
 

6515
02:29:57,680 --> 02:29:59,990
they just keep agreeing on price, we
will just keep doing this over and over,

6516
02:29:59,990 --> 02:30:00,000
will just keep doing this over and over,
 

6517
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:16,550
will just keep doing this over and over,
right?

6518
02:30:16,550 --> 02:30:16,560

 

6519
02:30:16,560 --> 02:30:19,030

Joe bouncing around the level we were at

6520
02:30:19,030 --> 02:30:19,040
Joe bouncing around the level we were at
 

6521
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:21,429
Joe bouncing around the level we were at
at 10 a.m. but lower volume bearish tilt

6522
02:30:21,429 --> 02:30:21,439
at 10 a.m. but lower volume bearish tilt
 

6523
02:30:21,439 --> 02:30:23,990
at 10 a.m. but lower volume bearish tilt
for me. It being Friday heading into

6524
02:30:23,990 --> 02:30:24,000
for me. It being Friday heading into
 

6525
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,710
for me. It being Friday heading into
quad witching. Yeah, I mean totally is

6526
02:30:26,710 --> 02:30:26,720
quad witching. Yeah, I mean totally is
 

6527
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:33,910
quad witching. Yeah, I mean totally is
quad witching. Um

6528
02:30:33,910 --> 02:30:33,920

 

6529
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:36,950

I wouldn't be too bearish on it.

6530
02:30:36,950 --> 02:30:36,960
I wouldn't be too bearish on it.
 

6531
02:30:36,960 --> 02:30:39,030
I wouldn't be too bearish on it.
I honestly I wouldn't. The only thing

6532
02:30:39,030 --> 02:30:39,040
I honestly I wouldn't. The only thing
 

6533
02:30:39,040 --> 02:30:42,070
I honestly I wouldn't. The only thing
that you've got going for you right is

6534
02:30:42,070 --> 02:30:42,080
that you've got going for you right is
 

6535
02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:43,830
that you've got going for you right is
that this has been an edge and that you

6536
02:30:43,830 --> 02:30:43,840
that this has been an edge and that you
 

6537
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:44,950
that this has been an edge and that you
probably have some buyers trapped up

6538
02:30:44,950 --> 02:30:44,960
probably have some buyers trapped up
 

6539
02:30:44,960 --> 02:30:47,750
probably have some buyers trapped up
here. But if you think about this, that

6540
02:30:47,750 --> 02:30:47,760
here. But if you think about this, that
 

6541
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:49,750
here. But if you think about this, that
is not bearish. This is a potential

6542
02:30:49,750 --> 02:30:49,760
is not bearish. This is a potential
 

6543
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:52,150
is not bearish. This is a potential
squeeze up right into this. And if we

6544
02:30:52,150 --> 02:30:52,160
squeeze up right into this. And if we
 

6545
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:53,349
squeeze up right into this. And if we
like we talked about, where was

6546
02:30:53,349 --> 02:30:53,359
like we talked about, where was
 

6547
02:30:53,359 --> 02:30:55,510
like we talked about, where was
yesterday's value? Where's today's

6548
02:30:55,510 --> 02:30:55,520
yesterday's value? Where's today's
 

6549
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:57,990
yesterday's value? Where's today's
value? Where's the days before's value?

6550
02:30:57,990 --> 02:30:58,000
value? Where's the days before's value?
 

6551
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,070
value? Where's the days before's value?
Where's the current week's value? Where

6552
02:31:00,070 --> 02:31:00,080
Where's the current week's value? Where
 

6553
02:31:00,080 --> 02:31:01,830
Where's the current week's value? Where
are we above it? So, we're auctioning

6554
02:31:01,830 --> 02:31:01,840
are we above it? So, we're auctioning
 

6555
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:03,990
are we above it? So, we're auctioning
higher. I wouldn't be bearish on this.

6556
02:31:03,990 --> 02:31:04,000
higher. I wouldn't be bearish on this.
 

6557
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:05,429
higher. I wouldn't be bearish on this.
There you go. Starting to break now.

6558
02:31:05,429 --> 02:31:05,439
There you go. Starting to break now.
 

6559
02:31:05,439 --> 02:31:08,389
There you go. Starting to break now.
Finally, they're trying to do it.

6560
02:31:08,389 --> 02:31:08,399
Finally, they're trying to do it.
 

6561
02:31:08,399 --> 02:31:11,270
Finally, they're trying to do it.
Try and try and create um

6562
02:31:11,270 --> 02:31:11,280
Try and try and create um
 

6563
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:18,710
Try and try and create um
neutrality in your head where you can.

6564
02:31:18,710 --> 02:31:18,720

 

6565
02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:21,030

So they can they find acceptance above

6566
02:31:21,030 --> 02:31:21,040
So they can they find acceptance above
 

6567
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:23,349
So they can they find acceptance above
where we go blue to gray, right? And we

6568
02:31:23,349 --> 02:31:23,359
where we go blue to gray, right? And we
 

6569
02:31:23,359 --> 02:31:25,190
where we go blue to gray, right? And we
get a new value area high. Can we let

6570
02:31:25,190 --> 02:31:25,200
get a new value area high. Can we let
 

6571
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:27,270
get a new value area high. Can we let
out those buyers from earlier? How many

6572
02:31:27,270 --> 02:31:27,280
out those buyers from earlier? How many
 

6573
02:31:27,280 --> 02:31:28,790
out those buyers from earlier? How many
buyers were caught there earlier? Let's

6574
02:31:28,790 --> 02:31:28,800
buyers were caught there earlier? Let's
 

6575
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:33,030
buyers were caught there earlier? Let's
have a little look

6576
02:31:33,030 --> 02:31:33,040

 

6577
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:34,870

where we have. So we have a sellside

6578
02:31:34,870 --> 02:31:34,880
where we have. So we have a sellside
 

6579
02:31:34,880 --> 02:31:39,510
where we have. So we have a sellside
imbalance here to 67s.

6580
02:31:39,510 --> 02:31:39,520

 

6581
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:42,150

We have another one up here

6582
02:31:42,150 --> 02:31:42,160
We have another one up here
 

6583
02:31:42,160 --> 02:31:45,030
We have another one up here
into 80s and most of the buying volume

6584
02:31:45,030 --> 02:31:45,040
into 80s and most of the buying volume
 

6585
02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:47,349
into 80s and most of the buying volume
look was right at that high. Some idiot

6586
02:31:47,349 --> 02:31:47,359
look was right at that high. Some idiot
 

6587
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:49,349
look was right at that high. Some idiot
right at that high. All right. So, we'd

6588
02:31:49,349 --> 02:31:49,359
right at that high. All right. So, we'd
 

6589
02:31:49,359 --> 02:31:52,230
right at that high. All right. So, we'd
be watching

6590
02:31:52,230 --> 02:31:52,240
be watching
 

6591
02:31:52,240 --> 02:31:54,710
be watching
these guys here, these guys here. So,

6592
02:31:54,710 --> 02:31:54,720
these guys here, these guys here. So,
 

6593
02:31:54,720 --> 02:31:58,309
these guys here, these guys here. So,
I'd be taking some profit into this

6594
02:31:58,309 --> 02:31:58,319
I'd be taking some profit into this
 

6595
02:31:58,319 --> 02:32:01,270
I'd be taking some profit into this
70s. If we get 80s, great. And then

6596
02:32:01,270 --> 02:32:01,280
70s. If we get 80s, great. And then
 

6597
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:03,110
70s. If we get 80s, great. And then
higher day. And then above that, we

6598
02:32:03,110 --> 02:32:03,120
higher day. And then above that, we
 

6599
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:05,110
higher day. And then above that, we
might have some room. But you just want

6600
02:32:05,110 --> 02:32:05,120
might have some room. But you just want
 

6601
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:07,830
might have some room. But you just want
to lock in into that push, which you

6602
02:32:07,830 --> 02:32:07,840
to lock in into that push, which you
 

6603
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:09,110
to lock in into that push, which you
might have already done while I'm

6604
02:32:09,110 --> 02:32:09,120
might have already done while I'm
 

6605
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:11,590
might have already done while I'm
talking about it.

6606
02:32:11,590 --> 02:32:11,600
talking about it.
 

6607
02:32:11,600 --> 02:32:13,750
talking about it.
Yes, we just just just did just came

6608
02:32:13,750 --> 02:32:13,760
Yes, we just just just did just came
 

6609
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:20,790
Yes, we just just just did just came
right into it.

6610
02:32:20,790 --> 02:32:20,800

 

6611
02:32:20,800 --> 02:32:22,309

What's my streaming schedule for the

6612
02:32:22,309 --> 02:32:22,319
What's my streaming schedule for the
 

6613
02:32:22,319 --> 02:32:24,230
What's my streaming schedule for the
holidays? Let me have a look. I haven't

6614
02:32:24,230 --> 02:32:24,240
holidays? Let me have a look. I haven't
 

6615
02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:25,750
holidays? Let me have a look. I haven't
really thought about it, but let let me

6616
02:32:25,750 --> 02:32:25,760
really thought about it, but let let me
 

6617
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:32,150
really thought about it, but let let me
have a look now.

6618
02:32:32,150 --> 02:32:32,160

 

6619
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:34,150

We can make some agreement together as a

6620
02:32:34,150 --> 02:32:34,160
We can make some agreement together as a
 

6621
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:40,070
We can make some agreement together as a
team of what works for everyone. Um,

6622
02:32:40,070 --> 02:32:40,080

 

6623
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:41,990

how can I make this? No, I want the

6624
02:32:41,990 --> 02:32:42,000
how can I make this? No, I want the
 

6625
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,150
how can I make this? No, I want the
other way. So, I'm assuming we're

6626
02:32:44,150 --> 02:32:44,160
other way. So, I'm assuming we're
 

6627
02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:48,630
other way. So, I'm assuming we're
opening 22nd, 23rd. I will take 24, 25,

6628
02:32:48,630 --> 02:32:48,640
opening 22nd, 23rd. I will take 24, 25,
 

6629
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:51,990
opening 22nd, 23rd. I will take 24, 25,
26th off for sure.

6630
02:32:51,990 --> 02:32:52,000
26th off for sure.
 

6631
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,950
26th off for sure.
So I will probably trade Monday, Tuesday

6632
02:32:54,950 --> 02:32:54,960
So I will probably trade Monday, Tuesday
 

6633
02:32:54,960 --> 02:32:56,790
So I will probably trade Monday, Tuesday
next week

6634
02:32:56,790 --> 02:32:56,800
next week
 

6635
02:32:56,800 --> 02:33:00,710
next week
and maybe Monday, Tuesday the following

6636
02:33:00,710 --> 02:33:00,720
and maybe Monday, Tuesday the following
 

6637
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:03,270
and maybe Monday, Tuesday the following
week and maybe the Friday, but probably

6638
02:33:03,270 --> 02:33:03,280
week and maybe the Friday, but probably
 

6639
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:05,349
week and maybe the Friday, but probably
not. So let's do 20. Let's guarantee

6640
02:33:05,349 --> 02:33:05,359
not. So let's do 20. Let's guarantee
 

6641
02:33:05,359 --> 02:33:08,950
not. So let's do 20. Let's guarantee
22nd, 23rd, 29th, 30th, back to usual on

6642
02:33:08,950 --> 02:33:08,960
22nd, 23rd, 29th, 30th, back to usual on
 

6643
02:33:08,960 --> 02:33:10,710
22nd, 23rd, 29th, 30th, back to usual on
the 5th, I think, unless I go away on

6644
02:33:10,710 --> 02:33:10,720
the 5th, I think, unless I go away on
 

6645
02:33:10,720 --> 02:33:17,750
the 5th, I think, unless I go away on
vacation.

6646
02:33:17,750 --> 02:33:17,760

 

6647
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:19,349

Only thing that would worry me here is

6648
02:33:19,349 --> 02:33:19,359
Only thing that would worry me here is
 

6649
02:33:19,359 --> 02:33:21,270
Only thing that would worry me here is
if bulls don't get the break. We've

6650
02:33:21,270 --> 02:33:21,280
if bulls don't get the break. We've
 

6651
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:23,349
if bulls don't get the break. We've
built a [\h__\h] ton of liquidity in here

6652
02:33:23,349 --> 02:33:23,359
built a [\h__\h] ton of liquidity in here
 

6653
02:33:23,359 --> 02:33:26,870
built a [\h__\h] ton of liquidity in here
now. If bulls don't get this, that can

6654
02:33:26,870 --> 02:33:26,880
now. If bulls don't get this, that can
 

6655
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:31,190
now. If bulls don't get this, that can
happen real quick.

6656
02:33:31,190 --> 02:33:31,200

 

6657
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:32,710

We're coming in for lunch. Honestly, you

6658
02:33:32,710 --> 02:33:32,720
We're coming in for lunch. Honestly, you
 

6659
02:33:32,720 --> 02:33:36,950
We're coming in for lunch. Honestly, you
got 15 minutes left. Like,

6660
02:33:36,950 --> 02:33:36,960

 

6661
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:39,429

here comes the bears. The Bulls are not

6662
02:33:39,429 --> 02:33:39,439
here comes the bears. The Bulls are not
 

6663
02:33:39,439 --> 02:33:42,230
here comes the bears. The Bulls are not
getting that breakout. I would just I

6664
02:33:42,230 --> 02:33:42,240
getting that breakout. I would just I
 

6665
02:33:42,240 --> 02:33:43,910
getting that breakout. I would just I
would personally

6666
02:33:43,910 --> 02:33:43,920
would personally
 

6667
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:45,349
would personally
you guys do what you want. Personally, I

6668
02:33:45,349 --> 02:33:45,359
you guys do what you want. Personally, I
 

6669
02:33:45,359 --> 02:33:47,110
you guys do what you want. Personally, I
would leave this box alone until you

6670
02:33:47,110 --> 02:33:47,120
would leave this box alone until you
 

6671
02:33:47,120 --> 02:33:49,830
would leave this box alone until you
exit this box one way or another. Leave

6672
02:33:49,830 --> 02:33:49,840
exit this box one way or another. Leave
 

6673
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:51,670
exit this box one way or another. Leave
the box alone until you exit it one way

6674
02:33:51,670 --> 02:33:51,680
the box alone until you exit it one way
 

6675
02:33:51,680 --> 02:33:54,389
the box alone until you exit it one way
or another.

6676
02:33:54,389 --> 02:33:54,399
or another.
 

6677
02:33:54,399 --> 02:33:56,230
or another.
Bears are doing their best here to step

6678
02:33:56,230 --> 02:33:56,240
Bears are doing their best here to step
 

6679
02:33:56,240 --> 02:34:01,990
Bears are doing their best here to step
in aggressively.

6680
02:34:01,990 --> 02:34:02,000

 

6681
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,150

Heading out. Great week. Love you, Alex.

6682
02:34:04,150 --> 02:34:04,160
Heading out. Great week. Love you, Alex.
 

6683
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:06,070
Heading out. Great week. Love you, Alex.
Appreciate your ongoing contribution. No

6684
02:34:06,070 --> 02:34:06,080
Appreciate your ongoing contribution. No
 

6685
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:08,150
Appreciate your ongoing contribution. No
worries, mate. Take care. Take care. All

6686
02:34:08,150 --> 02:34:08,160
worries, mate. Take care. Take care. All
 

6687
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:11,270
worries, mate. Take care. Take care. All
right. Starting to exit now. Starting to

6688
02:34:11,270 --> 02:34:11,280
right. Starting to exit now. Starting to
 

6689
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:13,830
right. Starting to exit now. Starting to
see some bearish exits. They're going to

6690
02:34:13,830 --> 02:34:13,840
see some bearish exits. They're going to
 

6691
02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:16,469
see some bearish exits. They're going to
come sweep these guys out. Just going to

6692
02:34:16,469 --> 02:34:16,479
come sweep these guys out. Just going to
 

6693
02:34:16,479 --> 02:34:17,910
come sweep these guys out. Just going to
have a look at liquidity on the foot.

6694
02:34:17,910 --> 02:34:17,920
have a look at liquidity on the foot.
 

6695
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:19,349
have a look at liquidity on the foot.
Where are they stacking in? There's not

6696
02:34:19,349 --> 02:34:19,359
Where are they stacking in? There's not
 

6697
02:34:19,359 --> 02:34:21,110
Where are they stacking in? There's not
that much actually. Doesn't look very

6698
02:34:21,110 --> 02:34:21,120
that much actually. Doesn't look very
 

6699
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:24,150
that much actually. Doesn't look very
good.

6700
02:34:24,150 --> 02:34:24,160

 

6701
02:34:24,160 --> 02:34:31,349

I'm still neutral bias right now.

6702
02:34:31,349 --> 02:34:31,359

 

6703
02:34:31,359 --> 02:34:39,830

I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, I'm in LA.

6704
02:34:39,830 --> 02:34:39,840

 

6705
02:34:39,840 --> 02:34:45,349

Right, let's do a giveaway.

6706
02:34:45,349 --> 02:34:45,359

 

6707
02:34:45,359 --> 02:34:49,830

Bears have got a shot here.

6708
02:34:49,830 --> 02:34:49,840

 

6709
02:34:49,840 --> 02:34:51,110

I'm not going to play it. Bears have got

6710
02:34:51,110 --> 02:34:51,120
I'm not going to play it. Bears have got
 

6711
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:52,870
I'm not going to play it. Bears have got
a shot here though. The S is breaking

6712
02:34:52,870 --> 02:34:52,880
a shot here though. The S is breaking
 

6713
02:34:52,880 --> 02:34:54,950
a shot here though. The S is breaking
down. Bears have got a shot here. They

6714
02:34:54,950 --> 02:34:54,960
down. Bears have got a shot here. They
 

6715
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:56,870
down. Bears have got a shot here. They
might get this wash now. They're coming

6716
02:34:56,870 --> 02:34:56,880
might get this wash now. They're coming
 

6717
02:34:56,880 --> 02:35:00,790
might get this wash now. They're coming
for it.

6718
02:35:00,790 --> 02:35:00,800

 

6719
02:35:00,800 --> 02:35:03,190

What I'd say is they entered again at th

6720
02:35:03,190 --> 02:35:03,200
What I'd say is they entered again at th
 

6721
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:06,630
What I'd say is they entered again at th
30 to 50 is where they've just come

6722
02:35:06,630 --> 02:35:06,640
30 to 50 is where they've just come
 

6723
02:35:06,640 --> 02:35:09,429
30 to 50 is where they've just come
flying in. They must keep price below

6724
02:35:09,429 --> 02:35:09,439
flying in. They must keep price below
 

6725
02:35:09,439 --> 02:35:11,990
flying in. They must keep price below
those levels. You have a little shelf

6726
02:35:11,990 --> 02:35:12,000
those levels. You have a little shelf
 

6727
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:15,349
those levels. You have a little shelf
here. 35 to 40. That's basically where

6728
02:35:15,349 --> 02:35:15,359
here. 35 to 40. That's basically where
 

6729
02:35:15,359 --> 02:35:17,750
here. 35 to 40. That's basically where
they must reject. If they fail to reject

6730
02:35:17,750 --> 02:35:17,760
they must reject. If they fail to reject
 

6731
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:19,429
they must reject. If they fail to reject
that again, then you are not going to

6732
02:35:19,429 --> 02:35:19,439
that again, then you are not going to
 

6733
02:35:19,439 --> 02:35:20,870
that again, then you are not going to
see any further rotation. If you're

6734
02:35:20,870 --> 02:35:20,880
see any further rotation. If you're
 

6735
02:35:20,880 --> 02:35:22,389
see any further rotation. If you're
going to see further rotation, you can

6736
02:35:22,389 --> 02:35:22,399
going to see further rotation, you can
 

6737
02:35:22,399 --> 02:35:25,030
going to see further rotation, you can
attack potentially for VWOP and

6738
02:35:25,030 --> 02:35:25,040
attack potentially for VWOP and
 

6739
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:27,190
attack potentially for VWOP and
underneath VWAP, the gray box below. If

6740
02:35:27,190 --> 02:35:27,200
underneath VWAP, the gray box below. If
 

6741
02:35:27,200 --> 02:35:29,510
underneath VWAP, the gray box below. If
they reclaim the stuff above, I'd say

6742
02:35:29,510 --> 02:35:29,520
they reclaim the stuff above, I'd say
 

6743
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:31,670
they reclaim the stuff above, I'd say
you're in big trouble.

6744
02:35:31,670 --> 02:35:31,680
you're in big trouble.
 

6745
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:33,510
you're in big trouble.
Like again, I'm not going to touch this.

6746
02:35:33,510 --> 02:35:33,520
Like again, I'm not going to touch this.
 

6747
02:35:33,520 --> 02:35:36,389
Like again, I'm not going to touch this.
I'm neutral bias. I don't really want to

6748
02:35:36,389 --> 02:35:36,399
I'm neutral bias. I don't really want to
 

6749
02:35:36,399 --> 02:35:37,990
I'm neutral bias. I don't really want to
do anything else. We've had a couple all

6750
02:35:37,990 --> 02:35:38,000
do anything else. We've had a couple all
 

6751

is where they've been attacking this all

6802
02:36:45,990 --> 02:36:46,000
is where they've been attacking this all
 

6803
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,070
is where they've been attacking this all
day. They will need to see a breakdown

6804
02:36:48,070 --> 02:36:48,080
day. They will need to see a breakdown
 

6805
02:36:48,080 --> 02:36:56,630

They need to exit this gray box. So, if
 

6809
02:36:58,399 --> 02:36:59,750
They need to exit this gray box. So, if
you're short, you're looking for this to

02:36:59,750 --> 02:36:59,760
you're short, you're looking for this to
 

6811
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:03,270
you're short, you're looking for this to
wash down. There you go.

6812
02:37:03,270 --> 02:37:03,280
wash down. There you go.
 

6813
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:04,710

There you go. Right. So, you'd be
looking for VW up here or at least this

6816
02:37:06,150 --> 02:37:06,160
looking for VW up here or at least this
 

6817
02:37:06,160 --> 02:37:08,389
looking for VW up here or at least this
wick here ideally and then VWAP and then

6818
02:37:08,389 --> 02:37:08,399
wick here ideally and then VWAP and then
 

6819
02:37:08,399 --> 02:37:10,550
wick here ideally and then VWAP and then
all the way back down.

6820
02:37:10,550 --> 02:37:10,560
all the way back down.
 

6821
02:37:10,560 --> 02:37:12,710

Look at that tape shift. Okay. Let's

6824
02:37:14,389 --> 02:37:14,399
Look at that tape shift. Okay. Let's
 

6825
02:37:14,399 --> 02:37:19,830
Look at that tape shift. Okay. Let's
see.

6826

6827
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:23,510

VWAP coming up. So, I'd cover some here

6828
02:37:23,510 --> 02:37:23,520
VWAP coming up. So, I'd cover some here
 

6829
02:37:23,520 --> 02:37:25,190
VWAP coming up. So, I'd cover some here
and see if you get a wash down to gray

6830
02:37:25,190 --> 02:37:25,200
and see if you get a wash down to gray
 

6831
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:27,190
and see if you get a wash down to gray
box, but you should be out a good chunk

6832
02:37:27,190 --> 02:37:27,200
box, but you should be out a good chunk
 

6833
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:29,510
box, but you should be out a good chunk
of it here, folks. All right, if you

6834
02:37:29,510 --> 02:37:29,520
of it here, folks. All right, if you
 

6835
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:35,510
of it here, folks. All right, if you
did, take that.

6836
02:37:35,510 --> 02:37:35,520

If you get a continuation, you want to

6838
02:37:37,429 --> 02:37:37,439
If you get a continuation, you want to
 

6839
02:37:37,439 --> 02:37:40,790
If you get a continuation, you want to
get back down

6840
02:37:40,790 --> 02:37:40,800

 

6841
02:37:40,800 --> 02:37:43,830

here,

6842
02:37:43,830 --> 02:37:43,840

 

6843
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:45,270

Shorts are in control from here. If you
 

6859
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:00,150
Shorts are in control from here. If you
let go of this, you're going to get

6860
02:38:00,150 --> 02:38:00,160
let go of this, you're going to get
 

6861
02:38:00,160 --> 02:38:02,710
let go of this, you're going to get
this. You must respect some of this

6862
02:38:02,710 --> 02:38:02,720
this. You must respect some of this
 

6863
02:38:02,720 --> 02:38:04,950
this. You must respect some of this
volume. Cover some to there. And then

6864
02:38:04,950 --> 02:38:04,960
volume. Cover some to there. And then
 

6865
02:38:04,960 --> 02:38:06,550
volume. Cover some to there. And then
here and here. If you get very, very

6866
02:38:06,550 --> 02:38:06,560
here and here. If you get very, very
 

6867
02:38:06,560 --> 02:38:11,990
here and here. If you get very, very
lucky. That shifted so quick. Then

6868
02:38:11,990 --> 02:38:12,000
lucky. That shifted so quick. Then
 

6869
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:15,110
lucky. That shifted so quick. Then
once they uh let go of that gray box.

6870
02:38:15,110 --> 02:38:15,120
once they uh let go of that gray box.
 

6871
02:38:15,120 --> 02:38:18,630
once they uh let go of that gray box.
Look at this shift here.

6872
02:38:18,630 --> 02:38:18,640
Look at this shift here.
 

6873
02:38:18,640 --> 02:38:20,790
Look at this shift here.
So quick and now this and now this is

6874
02:38:20,790 --> 02:38:20,800
So quick and now this and now this is
 

6875
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:28,469
So quick and now this and now this is
possible.

6876
02:38:28,469 --> 02:38:28,479

 

6877
02:38:28,479 --> 02:38:30,230

Midday price action. I just think I just

6878
02:38:30,230 --> 02:38:30,240
Midday price action. I just think I just
 

6879
02:38:30,240 --> 02:38:31,910
Midday price action. I just think I just
think it's cuz it's it's OPEX. We're

6880
02:38:31,910 --> 02:38:31,920
think it's cuz it's it's OPEX. We're
 

6881
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:33,910
think it's cuz it's it's OPEX. We're
just pinning. Like I think the big thing

6882
02:38:33,910 --> 02:38:33,920
just pinning. Like I think the big thing
 

6883
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:39,990
just pinning. Like I think the big thing
for me is this.

6884
02:38:39,990 --> 02:38:40,000

 

6885
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:47,510

All right. We know 680 is their level.

6886
02:38:47,510 --> 02:38:47,520

 

6887
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:49,750

And we got a new high and then a

6888
02:38:49,750 --> 02:38:49,760
And we got a new high and then a
 

6889
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:51,510
And we got a new high and then a
rotation and then they can absorb here

6890
02:38:51,510 --> 02:38:51,520
rotation and then they can absorb here
 

6891
02:38:51,520 --> 02:38:54,230
rotation and then they can absorb here
again. Right? We're just pinning until

6892
02:38:54,230 --> 02:38:54,240
again. Right? We're just pinning until
 

6893
02:38:54,240 --> 02:38:57,590
again. Right? We're just pinning until
we see like the bigger level snap. 75

6894
02:38:57,590 --> 02:38:57,600
we see like the bigger level snap. 75
 

6895
02:38:57,600 --> 02:39:00,070
we see like the bigger level snap. 75
would be the next one right the way down

6896
02:39:00,070 --> 02:39:00,080
would be the next one right the way down
 

6897
02:39:00,080 --> 02:39:02,150
would be the next one right the way down
here. Right where we bid off the start

6898
02:39:02,150 --> 02:39:02,160
here. Right where we bid off the start
 

6899
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:05,510
here. Right where we bid off the start
of the day. So we bid off put wall sorry

6900
02:39:05,510 --> 02:39:05,520
of the day. So we bid off put wall sorry
 

6901
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:08,230
of the day. So we bid off put wall sorry
bid off cool wall into sorry bid off put

6902
02:39:08,230 --> 02:39:08,240
bid off cool wall into sorry bid off put
 

6903
02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:11,030
bid off cool wall into sorry bid off put
wall into cool wall pulling back. That's

6904
02:39:11,030 --> 02:39:11,040
wall into cool wall pulling back. That's
 

6905
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:13,110
wall into cool wall pulling back. That's
that's all it is. It's quad witching.

6906
02:39:13,110 --> 02:39:13,120
that's all it is. It's quad witching.
 

6907
02:39:13,120 --> 02:39:15,429
that's all it is. It's quad witching.
Right. It's not a day to be like, I'm

6908
02:39:15,429 --> 02:39:15,439
Right. It's not a day to be like, I'm
 

6909
02:39:15,439 --> 02:39:17,750
Right. It's not a day to be like, I'm
going to risk all my accounts and go

6910
02:39:17,750 --> 02:39:17,760
going to risk all my accounts and go
 

6911
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:23,429
going to risk all my accounts and go
crazy.

6912
02:39:23,429 --> 02:39:23,439

 

6913
02:39:23,439 --> 02:39:28,469

Swing traded this week. Uh

6914
02:39:28,469 --> 02:39:28,479

 

6915
02:39:28,479 --> 02:39:35,429

yeah,

6916
02:39:35,429 --> 02:39:35,439

 

6917
02:39:35,439 --> 02:39:38,230

the best entry for me if you were

6918
02:39:38,230 --> 02:39:38,240
the best entry for me if you were
 

6919
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:41,270
the best entry for me if you were
bullish was here. This move here was

6920
02:39:41,270 --> 02:39:41,280
bullish was here. This move here was
 

6921
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:44,630
bullish was here. This move here was
highly probable back upside.

6922
02:39:44,630 --> 02:39:44,640
highly probable back upside.
 

6923
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:46,790
highly probable back upside.
And the best bearish move would have

6924
02:39:46,790 --> 02:39:46,800
And the best bearish move would have
 

6925
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:49,429
And the best bearish move would have
been this from Monday,

6926
02:39:49,429 --> 02:39:49,439
been this from Monday,
 

6927
02:39:49,439 --> 02:39:53,830
been this from Monday,
right? Because we left old value

6928
02:39:53,830 --> 02:39:53,840

 

6929
02:39:53,840 --> 02:39:56,630

and that was you could have taken puts

6930
02:39:56,630 --> 02:39:56,640
and that was you could have taken puts
 

6931
02:39:56,640 --> 02:39:59,190
and that was you could have taken puts
down. Um what was our level? It was the

6932
02:39:59,190 --> 02:39:59,200
down. Um what was our level? It was the
 

6933
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:01,270
down. Um what was our level? It was the
old contract was 930. So I'm trying to

6934
02:40:01,270 --> 02:40:01,280
old contract was 930. So I'm trying to
 

6935
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:02,550
old contract was 930. So I'm trying to
remember what that new contract level

6936
02:40:02,550 --> 02:40:02,560
remember what that new contract level
 

6937
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:05,830
remember what that new contract level
was. I think it was this 25,000 was 930

6938
02:40:05,830 --> 02:40:05,840
was. I think it was this 25,000 was 930
 

6939
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:07,429
was. I think it was this 25,000 was 930
on the old contract. That was the exit.

6940
02:40:07,429 --> 02:40:07,439
on the old contract. That was the exit.
 

6941
02:40:07,439 --> 02:40:09,270
on the old contract. That was the exit.
So, you could have got you could have

6942
02:40:09,270 --> 02:40:09,280
So, you could have got you could have
 

6943
02:40:09,280 --> 02:40:11,590
So, you could have got you could have
got basically 700 point uh short this

6944
02:40:11,590 --> 02:40:11,600
got basically 700 point uh short this
 

6945
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:13,670
got basically 700 point uh short this
week or you could have taken calls from

6946
02:40:13,670 --> 02:40:13,680
week or you could have taken calls from
 

6947
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:16,070
week or you could have taken calls from
here. Um

6948
02:40:16,070 --> 02:40:16,080
here. Um
 

6949
02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:17,830
here. Um
and I probably would have exited some on

6950
02:40:17,830 --> 02:40:17,840
and I probably would have exited some on
 

6951
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:19,110
and I probably would have exited some on
that first push up because you don't

6952
02:40:19,110 --> 02:40:19,120
that first push up because you don't
 

6953
02:40:19,120 --> 02:40:21,590
that first push up because you don't
know if it's going to fail. So, in all

6954
02:40:21,590 --> 02:40:21,600
know if it's going to fail. So, in all
 

6955
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:24,230
know if it's going to fail. So, in all
fairness, 400 point upside, 700 point

6956
02:40:24,230 --> 02:40:24,240
fairness, 400 point upside, 700 point
 

6957
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:26,710
fairness, 400 point upside, 700 point
downside, both available this week if

6958
02:40:26,710 --> 02:40:26,720
downside, both available this week if
 

6959
02:40:26,720 --> 02:40:29,670
downside, both available this week if

this why I saying this is where the

7014
02:41:55,429 --> 02:41:55,439
this why I saying this is where the
 

7015
02:41:55,439 --> 02:41:56,710
this why I saying this is where the
shorts got trapped. This is what

7016
02:41:56,710 --> 02:41:56,720
shorts got trapped. This is what
 

7017
02:41:56,720 --> 02:41:58,070
shorts got trapped. This is what
remember earlier we were talking about

7018
02:41:58,070 --> 02:41:58,080
remember earlier we were talking about
 

7019
02:41:58,080 --> 02:41:59,670
remember earlier we were talking about
the range was bigger here and then it

7020
02:41:59,670 --> 02:41:59,680
the range was bigger here and then it
 

7021
02:41:59,680 --> 02:42:02,230
the range was bigger here and then it
gets smaller and smaller and now it

7022
02:42:02,230 --> 02:42:02,240
gets smaller and smaller and now it
 

7023
02:42:02,240 --> 02:42:04,230
gets smaller and smaller and now it
might just be here to here right because

7024
02:42:04,230 --> 02:42:04,240
might just be here to here right because
 

7025
02:42:04,240 --> 02:42:06,870
might just be here to here right because
this is where shorts got caught and this

7026
02:42:06,870 --> 02:42:06,880
this is where shorts got caught and this
 

7027
02:42:06,880 --> 02:42:08,550
this is where shorts got caught and this
is where buyers are now caught and this

7028
02:42:08,550 --> 02:42:08,560
is where buyers are now caught and this
 

7029
02:42:08,560 --> 02:42:09,990
is where buyers are now caught and this
is now the rotation. So it's going to

7030
02:42:09,990 --> 02:42:10,000
is now the rotation. So it's going to
 

7031
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:11,670
is now the rotation. So it's going to
get smaller and smaller as the day goes

7032
02:42:11,670 --> 02:42:11,680
get smaller and smaller as the day goes
 

7033
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:13,910
get smaller and smaller as the day goes
on unless we get a breakout either side.

7034
02:42:13,910 --> 02:42:13,920
on unless we get a breakout either side.
 

7035
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:20,630
on unless we get a breakout either side.
Breakout would be here or here right

7036
02:42:20,630 --> 02:42:20,640

 

7037
02:42:20,640 --> 02:42:24,309

Again, you only need to type it once. If
you type it more than once, Nightbot

02:47:41,349 --> 02:47:41,359
you type it more than once, Nightbot
 

7215
02:47:41,359 --> 02:47:44,469
you type it more than once, Nightbot
will pull you out. So just type it once.

7216
02:47:44,469 --> 02:47:44,479
will pull you out. So just type it once.
 

7217
02:47:44,479 --> 02:47:56,950

We'll pull a winner.

7218
02:47:56,950 --> 02:47:56,960

 

7219
02:47:56,960 --> 02:47:58,870

Yeah, no free funding tick account. I've

7224
02:48:39,910 --> 02:48:39,920
Yeah, no free funding tick account. I've
 

7225
02:48:39,920 --> 02:48:42,950
Yeah, no free funding tick account. I've
stopped working with them

7226
02:48:42,950 --> 02:48:42,960
stopped working with them
 

7227
02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:45,429
stopped working with them

7229
02:48:45,439 --> 02:48:48,070

7263
02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:41,349

What would I be looking for? All right,

7264
02:49:41,349 --> 02:49:41,359
What would I be looking for? All right,
 

7265
02:49:41,359 --> 02:49:43,349
What would I be looking for? All right,
you can see your range here. All right,

7266
02:49:43,349 --> 02:49:43,359
you can see your range here. All right,
 

7267
02:49:43,359 --> 02:49:45,030
you can see your range here. All right,
you can see there's your value area.

7268
02:49:45,030 --> 02:49:45,040
you can see there's your value area.
 

7269
02:49:45,040 --> 02:49:48,070
you can see there's your value area.
There's the high. This is a Pshape,

7270
02:49:48,070 --> 02:49:48,080
There's the high. This is a Pshape,
 

7271
02:49:48,080 --> 02:49:51,110
There's the high. This is a Pshape,
right? With Pshape, this is a strong

7272
02:49:51,110 --> 02:49:51,120
right? With Pshape, this is a strong
 

7273
02:49:51,120 --> 02:49:53,750
right? With Pshape, this is a strong
move. All right, because we've left

7274
02:49:53,750 --> 02:49:53,760
move. All right, because we've left
 

7275
02:49:53,760 --> 02:49:56,150
move. All right, because we've left
previous days value and we've left

7276
02:49:56,150 --> 02:49:56,160
previous days value and we've left
 

7277
02:49:56,160 --> 02:49:57,670
previous days value and we've left
current week's value and we are

7278
02:49:57,670 --> 02:49:57,680
current week's value and we are
 

7279
02:49:57,680 --> 02:50:00,630
current week's value and we are
aggressively moving higher right now. In

7280
02:50:00,630 --> 02:50:00,640
aggressively moving higher right now. In
 

7281
02:50:00,640 --> 02:50:02,870
aggressively moving higher right now. In
fact, has current week's value moved up?

7282
02:50:02,870 --> 02:50:02,880
fact, has current week's value moved up?
 

7283
02:50:02,880 --> 02:50:04,710
fact, has current week's value moved up?
Yes. All right. So, current week's value

7284
02:50:04,710 --> 02:50:04,720
Yes. All right. So, current week's value
 

7285
02:50:04,720 --> 02:50:08,710
Yes. All right. So, current week's value
area high is now this blue line in line

7286
02:50:08,710 --> 02:50:08,720
area high is now this blue line in line
 

7287
02:50:08,720 --> 02:50:11,190
area high is now this blue line in line
this here in line with this. This is

7288
02:50:11,190 --> 02:50:11,200
this here in line with this. This is
 

7289
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:14,070
this here in line with this. This is
your bid support. All right. You want to

7290
02:50:14,070 --> 02:50:14,080
your bid support. All right. You want to
 

7291
02:50:14,080 --> 02:50:17,190
your bid support. All right. You want to
stay thinking about a rotation between

7292
02:50:17,190 --> 02:50:17,200
stay thinking about a rotation between
 

7293
02:50:17,200 --> 02:50:19,269
stay thinking about a rotation between
here and here. All right. If you're a

7294
02:50:19,269 --> 02:50:19,279
here and here. All right. If you're a
 

7295
02:50:19,279 --> 02:50:21,190
here and here. All right. If you're a
rotational player, these are your

7296
02:50:21,190 --> 02:50:21,200
rotational player, these are your
 

7297
02:50:21,200 --> 02:50:22,870
rotational player, these are your
rotations

7298
02:50:22,870 --> 02:50:22,880
rotations
 

7299
02:50:22,880 --> 02:50:24,710
rotations
all the time. We're inside that. This

7300
02:50:24,710 --> 02:50:24,720
all the time. We're inside that. This
 

7301
02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:26,790
all the time. We're inside that. This
will get tighter as we develop more

7302
02:50:26,790 --> 02:50:26,800
will get tighter as we develop more
 

7303
02:50:26,800 --> 02:50:30,150
will get tighter as we develop more
volume. Like you're seeing here,

7304
02:50:30,150 --> 02:50:30,160
volume. Like you're seeing here,
 

7305
02:50:30,160 --> 02:50:32,230
volume. Like you're seeing here,
right? This is where shorts are stuck.

7306
02:50:32,230 --> 02:50:32,240
right? This is where shorts are stuck.
 

7307
02:50:32,240 --> 02:50:34,309
right? This is where shorts are stuck.
This is where buyers are stuck. They can

7308
02:50:34,309 --> 02:50:34,319
This is where buyers are stuck. They can
 

7309
02:50:34,319 --> 02:50:35,990
This is where buyers are stuck. They can
rotate this. If they find acceptance

7310
02:50:35,990 --> 02:50:36,000
rotate this. If they find acceptance
 

7311
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:37,590
rotate this. If they find acceptance
above, they can go for this move. If

7312
02:50:37,590 --> 02:50:37,600
above, they can go for this move. If
 

7313
02:50:37,600 --> 02:50:39,590
above, they can go for this move. If
they find acceptance below, you're

7314
02:50:39,590 --> 02:50:39,600
they find acceptance below, you're
 

7315
02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:41,190
they find acceptance below, you're
watching gray box and blue box for

7316
02:50:41,190 --> 02:50:41,200
watching gray box and blue box for
 

7317
02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:43,429
watching gray box and blue box for
downside pressure. Um, I doubt we come

7318
02:50:43,429 --> 02:50:43,439
downside pressure. Um, I doubt we come
 

7319
02:50:43,439 --> 02:50:46,230
downside pressure. Um, I doubt we come
into yesterday's value, honestly.

7320
02:50:46,230 --> 02:50:46,240
into yesterday's value, honestly.
 

7321
02:50:46,240 --> 02:50:48,710
into yesterday's value, honestly.
I would say this is a bullish rotational

7322
02:50:48,710 --> 02:50:48,720
I would say this is a bullish rotational
 

7323
02:50:48,720 --> 02:50:50,630
I would say this is a bullish rotational
day right now. Right, we are in a

7324
02:50:50,630 --> 02:50:50,640
day right now. Right, we are in a
 

7325
02:50:50,640 --> 02:50:53,990
day right now. Right, we are in a
rotation but we are bullish in a Pshape

7326
02:50:53,990 --> 02:50:54,000
rotation but we are bullish in a Pshape
 

7327
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:57,269
rotation but we are bullish in a Pshape
above current week in current value

7328
02:50:57,269 --> 02:50:57,279
above current week in current value
 

7329
02:50:57,279 --> 02:50:59,750
above current week in current value
above old value. Right? So my edge

7330
02:50:59,750 --> 02:50:59,760
above old value. Right? So my edge
 

7331
02:50:59,760 --> 02:51:02,469
above old value. Right? So my edge
technically is bullish but for sure

7332
02:51:02,469 --> 02:51:02,479
technically is bullish but for sure
 

7333
02:51:02,479 --> 02:51:04,309
technically is bullish but for sure
they're struggling to get much more of a

7334
02:51:04,309 --> 02:51:04,319
they're struggling to get much more of a
 

7335
02:51:04,319 --> 02:51:06,150
they're struggling to get much more of a
breakout to the upside. But that's what

7336
02:51:06,150 --> 02:51:06,160
breakout to the upside. But that's what
 

7337
02:51:06,160 --> 02:51:08,630
breakout to the upside. But that's what
I'd say. I wouldn't be bullish on the

7338
02:51:08,630 --> 02:51:08,640
I'd say. I wouldn't be bullish on the
 

7339
02:51:08,640 --> 02:51:10,550
I'd say. I wouldn't be bullish on the
breakouts. I'd be more bullish on dips

7340
02:51:10,550 --> 02:51:10,560
breakouts. I'd be more bullish on dips
 

7341
02:51:10,560 --> 02:51:12,309
breakouts. I'd be more bullish on dips
when available when it's clear and when

7342
02:51:12,309 --> 02:51:12,319
when available when it's clear and when
 

7343
02:51:12,319 --> 02:51:14,150
when available when it's clear and when
you see short stuck. All right? just

7344
02:51:14,150 --> 02:51:14,160
you see short stuck. All right? just
 

7345
02:51:14,160 --> 02:51:15,590
you see short stuck. All right? just
like we had here. I know I missed that

7346
02:51:15,590 --> 02:51:15,600
like we had here. I know I missed that
 

7347
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:17,990
like we had here. I know I missed that
one. We called it, but that was the one

7348
02:51:17,990 --> 02:51:18,000
one. We called it, but that was the one
 

7349
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:19,750
one. We called it, but that was the one
that frustrated me today. I waited all

7350
02:51:19,750 --> 02:51:19,760
that frustrated me today. I waited all
 

7351
02:51:19,760 --> 02:51:22,230
that frustrated me today. I waited all
this time for that move. Um, so that's

7352
02:51:22,230 --> 02:51:22,240
this time for that move. Um, so that's
 

7353
02:51:22,240 --> 02:51:24,469
this time for that move. Um, so that's
what I'll be looking at. Those

7354
02:51:24,469 --> 02:51:24,479
what I'll be looking at. Those
 

7355
02:51:24,479 --> 02:51:27,429
what I'll be looking at. Those
