Brain's not working. Another semi. I
 

93
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,550
Brain's not working. Another semi. I
can't think who it was. Oracle. There we

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
can't think who it was. Oracle. There we
 

95
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,430
can't think who it was. Oracle. There we
go. Well, wake up brain. All right. This

96
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
go. Well, wake up brain. All right. This
 

97

go. Well, wake up brain. All right. This
move was caused by Oracle. And then this

So, we're just stuck. It's as it's as

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:41,600
So, we're just stuck. It's as it's as
 

103
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,950
So, we're just stuck. It's as it's as
simple as that. All right. There has

00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
simple as that. All right. There has
 

105
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,710
simple as that. All right. There has
been no change. If we want to think

106
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
been no change. If we want to think
 

107
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,390
been no change. If we want to think

109
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,230
about this, all right, this low volume
node here is resistance currently. This

And in between this, we have a range

118
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
And in between this, we have a range
 

119
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,670
And in between this, we have a range
rotation in here. All right. So, this is

120
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
rotation in here. All right. So, this is
 

121
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,550
rotation in here. All right. So, this is
no man's land.

122
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
no man's land.
 

123
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,550
no man's land.
Until something here gives, we're going

124
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
Until something here gives, we're going
 

125
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,070
Until something here gives, we're going
to continue to get what we've got. All

126
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
to continue to get what we've got. All
 

127
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,950
to continue to get what we've got. All
right. So, we have to assume these edges

128
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
right. So, we have to assume these edges
 

129
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,870
right. So, we have to assume these edges
hold until proves otherwise. We get

130
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:10,880
hold until proves otherwise. We get
 

131
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,430
hold until proves otherwise. We get
this. Great. We get this. Great. In

132
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
this. Great. We get this. Great. In
 

133
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,110
this. Great. We get this. Great. In
here, you're going to get rotation. And

134
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
here, you're going to get rotation. And
 

135
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,510
here, you're going to get rotation. And
we all know Alex doesn't really play

136
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
we all know Alex doesn't really play
 

137
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,909
we all know Alex doesn't really play
rotation. He tries to avoid rotation.

138
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
rotation. He tries to avoid rotation.
 

139
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,110
rotation. He tries to avoid rotation.
Right? So, that's where we're at and

140
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
Right? So, that's where we're at and
 

141
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,189
Right? So, that's where we're at and
that's what we have got currently. Uh

142
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
that's what we have got currently. Uh
 

143
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,909
that's what we have got currently. Uh
let's move into the hourlies and see

144
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
let's move into the hourlies and see
 

145
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,110
let's move into the hourlies and see
what's been going on

146
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
what's been going on
 

147
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,790
what's been going on
developing profile for the week. I've

148
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
developing profile for the week. I've
 

149
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,550
developing profile for the week. I've
had it on this week because we've been

150
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
had it on this week because we've been
 

151
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,230
had it on this week because we've been
in a range just to see how we act.

152
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
in a range just to see how we act.
 

153
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,230
in a range just to see how we act.
Normally I don't bother with a weekly

154
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
Normally I don't bother with a weekly
 

155
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,550
Normally I don't bother with a weekly
development. But as you can see yet

156
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
development. But as you can see yet
 

157
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,270
development. But as you can see yet
again, all right, yesterday

158
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
again, all right, yesterday
 

159
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,070
again, all right, yesterday
in the after hours finally broke out.

160
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
in the after hours finally broke out.
 

161
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,310
in the after hours finally broke out.
Did we take the highs? No. We failed up

162
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
Did we take the highs? No. We failed up
 

163
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,189
Did we take the highs? No. We failed up
there. Failed up here. Came back down

164
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
there. Failed up here. Came back down
 

165
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,270
there. Failed up here. Came back down
inside current week range. inside

166
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,280
inside current week range. inside
 

167
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,189
inside current week range. inside
previous week range. Came back into the

168
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
previous week range. Came back into the
 

169
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,670
previous week range. Came back into the
balance side. Failed to reclaim it. Came

170
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
balance side. Failed to reclaim it. Came
 

171
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,350
balance side. Failed to reclaim it. Came
back to point of control. Came back down

172
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360
back to point of control. Came back down
 

173
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,670
back to point of control. Came back down
to the bottom side. Came back to point

174
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
to the bottom side. Came back to point
 

175
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,950
to the bottom side. Came back to point
of control. And now we're doing the

176
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
of control. And now we're doing the
 

177
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,550
of control. And now we're doing the
dance. It's the same dance we've done

178
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
dance. It's the same dance we've done
 

179
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,309
dance. It's the same dance we've done
all week, folks. If you're joining me

180
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
all week, folks. If you're joining me
 

181
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,390
all week, folks. If you're joining me
today and you've joined me all week, you

182
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
today and you've joined me all week, you
 

183
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,309
today and you've joined me all week, you
nothing has changed. You can literally

184
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
nothing has changed. You can literally
 

185
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,230
nothing has changed. You can literally
split this range into sort of two parts.

186
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
split this range into sort of two parts.
 

187
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,309
split this range into sort of two parts.
There's your point of control. And

188
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:12,319
There's your point of control. And
 

189
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,870
There's your point of control. And
here's the sort of lower side of it. And

190
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
here's the sort of lower side of it. And
 

191
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,390
here's the sort of lower side of it. And
here's the upper side of it. And you can

192
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400
here's the upper side of it. And you can
 

193
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,710
here's the upper side of it. And you can
see above no acceptance, below no

194
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
see above no acceptance, below no
 

195
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,790
see above no acceptance, below no
acceptance. So we are doing rotations

196
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
acceptance. So we are doing rotations
 

197
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,189
acceptance. So we are doing rotations
really from sort of 725

198
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
really from sort of 725
 

199
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,749
really from sort of 725
to 640 down to 525. Right? Those are

200
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
to 640 down to 525. Right? Those are
 

201
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,430
to 640 down to 525. Right? Those are
kind of the moves. So we fail one side,

202
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
kind of the moves. So we fail one side,
 

203
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,670
kind of the moves. So we fail one side,
back test, back test, back test, flush,

204
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
back test, back test, back test, flush,
 

205
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,510
back test, back test, back test, flush,
back test, back test, fail the other

206
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
back test, back test, fail the other
 

207
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,390
back test, back test, fail the other

208
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400

00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319

213
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,909
test, fail the other side, back test,
back test, back test, back test. You get

214
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
back test, back test, back test. You get
 

215
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,550
back test, back test, back test. You get
the point. In here is that gray box that

216
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
the point. In here is that gray box that
 

217
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,029
the point. In here is that gray box that
we had on the daily. All right? Very,

218
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
we had on the daily. All right? Very,
 

219
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,430
we had on the daily. All right? Very,
very simple. So, just be careful. It's

220
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
very simple. So, just be careful. It's
 

221
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,790
very simple. So, just be careful. It's
Friday. I don't know what they're going

222
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
Friday. I don't know what they're going
 

223
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,230
Friday. I don't know what they're going
to do. I have no idea what their

224
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
to do. I have no idea what their
 

225
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,230
to do. I have no idea what their
intentions are. Do they have some puts

226
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
intentions are. Do they have some puts
 

227
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,670
intentions are. Do they have some puts
that they need to close that cause a

228
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
that they need to close that cause a
 

229
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,670
that they need to close that cause a
squeeze? Do they have do they want to go

230
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
squeeze? Do they have do they want to go
 

231
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,790
squeeze? Do they have do they want to go
risk off because they're worried about

232
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
risk off because they're worried about
 

233
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,870
risk off because they're worried about
what's coming next week? I don't know.

234
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880
what's coming next week? I don't know.
 

235
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,870
what's coming next week? I don't know.
Uh and I don't think many people do. I

236
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
Uh and I don't think many people do. I
 

237
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,070
Uh and I don't think many people do. I
think you'll find anyone who's

238
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
think you'll find anyone who's
 

239
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,189
think you'll find anyone who's
predicting the market, I don't think

240
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
predicting the market, I don't think
 

241
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,029
predicting the market, I don't think
many people knows what's happening.

242
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
many people knows what's happening.
 

243
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,350
many people knows what's happening.
Otherwise, we wouldn't be in this. All

244
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
Otherwise, we wouldn't be in this. All
 

245
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,430
Otherwise, we wouldn't be in this. All
right. If we had good confluence of one

246
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
right. If we had good confluence of one
 

247
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,589
right. If we had good confluence of one
way, we'd be moving that way finally.

248
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
way, we'd be moving that way finally.
 

249
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,390
way, we'd be moving that way finally.
And we don't have that overnight. Let's

250
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
And we don't have that overnight. Let's
 

251
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,670
And we don't have that overnight. Let's
just have a little dial and see what

252
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680
just have a little dial and see what
 

253
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,909
just have a little dial and see what
we've seen overnight. Right, the big

254
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
we've seen overnight. Right, the big
 

255
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,670
we've seen overnight. Right, the big
thing was the gap down. All right,

256
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
thing was the gap down. All right,
 

257
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,830
thing was the gap down. All right,
again, this market had we closed up

258
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
again, this market had we closed up
 

259
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,029
again, this market had we closed up
here. All it had to do is hold a

260
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
here. All it had to do is hold a
 

261
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,469
here. All it had to do is hold a
pullback and we could go. But we gap

262
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:26,479
pullback and we could go. But we gap
 

263
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,749
pullback and we could go. But we gap
down AGO call and Asia goes kind of

264
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
down AGO call and Asia goes kind of
 

265
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,629
down AGO call and Asia goes kind of
sideways and then London says [\h__\h] that.

266
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
sideways and then London says [\h__\h] that.
 

267
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,790
sideways and then London says [\h__\h] that.
We're not holding this and down we go.

268
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
We're not holding this and down we go.
 

269
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,390
We're not holding this and down we go.
The question now is, are we going to

270
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
The question now is, are we going to
 

271
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,909
The question now is, are we going to
take out GlobeEx at 700 and find a bid

272
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
take out GlobeEx at 700 and find a bid
 

273
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,230
take out GlobeEx at 700 and find a bid
or are we just simply going to reject

274
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
or are we just simply going to reject
 

275
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,909
or are we just simply going to reject
point of control like we keep doing and

276
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:43,919
point of control like we keep doing and
 

277
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,230
point of control like we keep doing and
come back down to the current value area

278
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,240
come back down to the current value area
 

279
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,350
come back down to the current value area
low? I don't know. Again, I don't know.

280
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
low? I don't know. Again, I don't know.
 

281
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,029
low? I don't know. Again, I don't know.
We're stuck right in the middle, folks.

282
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
We're stuck right in the middle, folks.
 

283
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,950
We're stuck right in the middle, folks.
Right in the middle. Let's have a look

284
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
Right in the middle. Let's have a look
 

285
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,909
Right in the middle. Let's have a look
at what's going on elsewhere.

286
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
at what's going on elsewhere.
 

287
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,629
at what's going on elsewhere.
Move up here. Go to a five minute. Let's

288
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
Move up here. Go to a five minute. Let's
 

289
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,550
Move up here. Go to a five minute. Let's
get rid of that ugly drawing.

290
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
get rid of that ugly drawing.
 

291
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,350
get rid of that ugly drawing.
And let's just check out the ES.

292
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
And let's just check out the ES.
 

293
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,950
And let's just check out the ES.
Probably a bit of relative strength over

294
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
Probably a bit of relative strength over
 

295
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,869
Probably a bit of relative strength over
there, I would imagine. Less affected by

296
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
there, I would imagine. Less affected by
 

297
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,869
there, I would imagine. Less affected by
some of these semis.

298
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
some of these semis.
 

299
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,350
some of these semis.
Yeah. So, opening up pretty much flat.

300
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
Yeah. So, opening up pretty much flat.
 

301
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,830
Yeah. So, opening up pretty much flat.
We compare that to the Q's

302
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840
We compare that to the Q's
 

303
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,430
We compare that to the Q's
which are opening up on a gap down. So,

304
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
which are opening up on a gap down. So,
 

305
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,070
which are opening up on a gap down. So,
ES already relative strength. Remember,

306
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
ES already relative strength. Remember,
 

307
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,430
ES already relative strength. Remember,
less affected by tech. Um, what are the

308
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
less affected by tech. Um, what are the
 

309
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,469
less affected by tech. Um, what are the
opportunities here? Well, it really

310
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
opportunities here? Well, it really
 

311
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,309
opportunities here? Well, it really
needs to hold that gap. It really needs

312
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
needs to hold that gap. It really needs
 

313
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,909
needs to hold that gap. It really needs
to hold 890s. All right. A hold of 890s

314
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
to hold 890s. All right. A hold of 890s
 

315
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,670
to hold 890s. All right. A hold of 890s
gives it potential for strength because

316
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:33,680
gives it potential for strength because
 

317
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,630
gives it potential for strength because
we've seen fail breakdown higher low. If

318
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
we've seen fail breakdown higher low. If
 

319
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,750
we've seen fail breakdown higher low. If
it can hold this, maybe we can start or

320
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
it can hold this, maybe we can start or
 

321
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,350
it can hold this, maybe we can start or
at least creating liquidity for next

322
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
at least creating liquidity for next
 

323
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,029
at least creating liquidity for next
week for that move. All right, it's

324
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,039
week for that move. All right, it's
 

325
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,070
week for that move. All right, it's
possible. It is possible. So, we have

326
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
possible. It is possible. So, we have
 

327
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,910
possible. It is possible. So, we have
strength over there by comparison to the

328
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
strength over there by comparison to the
 

329
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,630
strength over there by comparison to the
cues. We just have to see how we open.

330
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
cues. We just have to see how we open.
 

331
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,670
cues. We just have to see how we open.
Dixie started to fail the last few

332
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:53,680
Dixie started to fail the last few
 

333
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,910
Dixie started to fail the last few
sessions,

334
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
sessions,
 

335
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,350
sessions,
right? Rolling over that sort of head

336
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
right? Rolling over that sort of head
 

337
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,870
right? Rolling over that sort of head
and shoulders. Where have we gone?

338
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
and shoulders. Where have we gone?
 

339
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,710
and shoulders. Where have we gone?
There we go. Right, starting to roll

340
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
There we go. Right, starting to roll
 

341
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,509
There we go. Right, starting to roll
over or a quasi. Right, starting to see

342
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
over or a quasi. Right, starting to see
 

343
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,590
over or a quasi. Right, starting to see
that breakdown. So, I expect Dixie to do

344
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600
that breakdown. So, I expect Dixie to do
 

345
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,750
that breakdown. So, I expect Dixie to do
a bit of a back test here and then maybe

346
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
a bit of a back test here and then maybe
 

347
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,310
a bit of a back test here and then maybe
let go. Uh, gold and silver have been

348
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
let go. Uh, gold and silver have been
 

349
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,990
let go. Uh, gold and silver have been
continuing to break out. Gold almost

350
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
continuing to break out. Gold almost
 

351
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,710
continuing to break out. Gold almost
there. Um, remember silver's on just a

352
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
there. Um, remember silver's on just a
 

353
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,389
there. Um, remember silver's on just a
ridiculous pump at the moment. People

354
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399
ridiculous pump at the moment. People
 

355
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,470
ridiculous pump at the moment. People
overexposed short side on it. BIX

356
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:20,480
overexposed short side on it. BIX
 

357
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,829
overexposed short side on it. BIX
continues to drift down, right? We're

358
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
continues to drift down, right? We're
 

359
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,910
continues to drift down, right? We're
now sub 15. That is usually very bullish

360
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
now sub 15. That is usually very bullish
 

361
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,350
now sub 15. That is usually very bullish
for the market. The only thing I would

362
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
for the market. The only thing I would
 

363
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,670
for the market. The only thing I would
say is every time we come into here,

364
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
say is every time we come into here,
 

365
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,230
say is every time we come into here,
right, this is where the danger starts,

366
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
right, this is where the danger starts,
 

367
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,750
right, this is where the danger starts,
right? So, we can come into here for a

368
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:31,760
right? So, we can come into here for a
 

369
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,670
right? So, we can come into here for a
long time, but this is where if we get

370
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
long time, but this is where if we get
 

371
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,910
long time, but this is where if we get
overexposed, over greedy. Think about

372
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:35,920
overexposed, over greedy. Think about
 

373
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,389
overexposed, over greedy. Think about
this. If this is fear and index, this is

374
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
this. If this is fear and index, this is
 

375
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,910
this. If this is fear and index, this is
starting to get overly greedy. It will

376
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
starting to get overly greedy. It will
 

377
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,190
starting to get overly greedy. It will
start to flip and we'll see some of

378
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
start to flip and we'll see some of
 

379
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,430
start to flip and we'll see some of
these when we're least expecting it, I

380
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
these when we're least expecting it, I
 

381
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,190
these when we're least expecting it, I
would imagine. Uh, Bitcoin,

382
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
would imagine. Uh, Bitcoin,
 

383
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,110
would imagine. Uh, Bitcoin,
well, it's into a key level. All right.

384
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
well, it's into a key level. All right.
 

385
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,829
well, it's into a key level. All right.
I would say if Bitcoin fails this uh

386
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
I would say if Bitcoin fails this uh
 

387
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,350
I would say if Bitcoin fails this uh
it's in problems because it will come

388
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
it's in problems because it will come
 

389
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,710
it's in problems because it will come
back down and liquidate. It needs to

390
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
back down and liquidate. It needs to
 

391
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,110
back down and liquidate. It needs to
reclaim this to have any shot. Uh not

392
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
reclaim this to have any shot. Uh not
 

393
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,110
reclaim this to have any shot. Uh not
trading it, not interested. But just for

394
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
trading it, not interested. But just for
 

395
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,590
trading it, not interested. But just for
those of you who are Apple slight gap

396
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
those of you who are Apple slight gap
 

397
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,590
those of you who are Apple slight gap
down here, remains in range. All right.

398
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
down here, remains in range. All right.
 

399
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,790
down here, remains in range. All right.
Yesterday it washed on uh that Tim Cook

400
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
Yesterday it washed on uh that Tim Cook
 

401
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,829
Yesterday it washed on uh that Tim Cook
uh announcement challenging uh I think

402
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
uh announcement challenging uh I think
 

403
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,470
uh announcement challenging uh I think
it was the European Courts over the App

404
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
it was the European Courts over the App
 

405
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,470
it was the European Courts over the App
Store and all it did all day was grind

406
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,480
Store and all it did all day was grind
 

407
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,990
Store and all it did all day was grind
back. So it's a look below and fail.

408
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
back. So it's a look below and fail.
 

409
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,470
back. So it's a look below and fail.
Back into range we go. You're going to

410
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
Back into range we go. You're going to
 

411
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,310
Back into range we go. You're going to
get the point here. It's everything's

412
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320
get the point here. It's everything's
 

413
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,949
get the point here. It's everything's
looking kind of the same. Amazon. Well,

414
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:22,959
looking kind of the same. Amazon. Well,
 

415
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,870
looking kind of the same. Amazon. Well,
that looks messy, doesn't it? There's

416
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:24,880
that looks messy, doesn't it? There's
 

417
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,790
that looks messy, doesn't it? There's
your range. All right. Look below and

418
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
your range. All right. Look below and
 

419
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,870
your range. All right. Look below and
fail earlier this week. Look above and

420
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
fail earlier this week. Look above and
 

421
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,190
fail earlier this week. Look above and
fail yesterday and the day before. We

422
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200
fail yesterday and the day before. We
 

423
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,870
fail yesterday and the day before. We
just have to see what happens. Again, no

424
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
just have to see what happens. Again, no
 

425
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,750
just have to see what happens. Again, no
edge there really. Goo.

426
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
edge there really. Goo.
 

427
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,470
edge there really. Goo.
Zoom out of this a little bit.

428
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
Zoom out of this a little bit.
 

429
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,670
Zoom out of this a little bit.
Still has potential for this to be a

430
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
Still has potential for this to be a
 

431
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,630
Still has potential for this to be a
continuation pattern versus this. It's

432
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
continuation pattern versus this. It's
 

433
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,470
continuation pattern versus this. It's
actually doesn't look too bad. If it can

434
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
actually doesn't look too bad. If it can
 

435
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,470
actually doesn't look too bad. If it can
find a bid, potentially it can get

436
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
find a bid, potentially it can get
 

437
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,110
find a bid, potentially it can get
going. Meta

438
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120

 

439
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,750

starting to look a bit rough. There's

440
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
starting to look a bit rough. There's
 

441
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,710
starting to look a bit rough. There's
your box that they must hold. There's

442
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
your box that they must hold. There's
 

443
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,870
your box that they must hold. There's
the failed breakout. Failed to make a

444
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
the failed breakout. Failed to make a
 

445
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,790
the failed breakout. Failed to make a
new high. There's the short. There's the

446
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
new high. There's the short. There's the
 

447
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,110
new high. There's the short. There's the
turn back inside. There's the retest.

448
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
turn back inside. There's the retest.
 

449
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,870
turn back inside. There's the retest.
So, I'd be out my short now. Waiting to

450
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
So, I'd be out my short now. Waiting to
 

451
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,350
So, I'd be out my short now. Waiting to
see do we develop one of these or do we

452
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
see do we develop one of these or do we
 

453
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,190
see do we develop one of these or do we
develop this and find acceptance down.

454
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
develop this and find acceptance down.
 

455
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,870
develop this and find acceptance down.
So, again, I'm small position in Meta

456
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
So, again, I'm small position in Meta
 

457
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,509
So, again, I'm small position in Meta
from just 580s. Just trying to remember.

00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
from just 580s. Just trying to remember.
 

459
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,590
from just 580s. Just trying to remember.
Yeah, 580 is down here. I'm small long

460
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,600
Yeah, 580 is down here. I'm small long
 

461
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,829
Yeah, 580 is down here. I'm small long
from here. I'm not looking to sell it.

462
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839

wouldn't be short on this until you

494
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
wouldn't be short on this until you
 

495
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,949
wouldn't be short on this until you
start to break down and then you can

496
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
start to break down and then you can
 

497
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,110
start to break down and then you can
think about it. Uh let's have a look at

498
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
think about it. Uh let's have a look at
 

499
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,190
think about it. Uh let's have a look at
what Oracle's doing. Right, there's the

500
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
what Oracle's doing. Right, there's the
 

501
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,870
what Oracle's doing. Right, there's the
big earnings news. We're flat here.

502
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:10,880
big earnings news. We're flat here.
 

503
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,870
big earnings news. We're flat here.
Uh wouldn't be long here yet. All right,

504
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
Uh wouldn't be long here yet. All right,
 

505
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,389
Uh wouldn't be long here yet. All right,
I am watching it for a long. I know

506
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
I am watching it for a long. I know
 

507
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,310
I am watching it for a long. I know
we've got a gap filled down to I think

508
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
we've got a gap filled down to I think
 

509
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,310
we've got a gap filled down to I think
it was 78 or something. Why can I never

510
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
it was 78 or something. Why can I never
 

511
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,629
it was 78 or something. Why can I never
remember that? Yes, 78. So, watching

512
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
remember that? Yes, 78. So, watching
 

513
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,710
remember that? Yes, 78. So, watching
that see if we do want to do a gap fill.

514
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,720
that see if we do want to do a gap fill.
 

515
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,069
that see if we do want to do a gap fill.
I'm not touching it until then.

516
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:26,079
I'm not touching it until then.
 

517
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,910
I'm not touching it until then.
Um, let's have a look at those names

518
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
Um, let's have a look at those names
 

519
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,230
Um, let's have a look at those names
which caused the move. Broadcom, AVGO.

520
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
which caused the move. Broadcom, AVGO.
 

521
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,590
which caused the move. Broadcom, AVGO.
Right. So, you can see earnings were

522
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
Right. So, you can see earnings were
 

523
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,069
Right. So, you can see earnings were
really good. What was the problem was

524
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
really good. What was the problem was
 

525
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,150
really good. What was the problem was
that was the call. All right. blowout

526
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
that was the call. All right. blowout
 

527
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,590
that was the call. All right. blowout
earnings absolutely ripped it up to 422s

528
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600
earnings absolutely ripped it up to 422s
 

529
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,550
earnings absolutely ripped it up to 422s
and we've just given back over 10% here.

530
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:44,560
and we've just given back over 10% here.
 

531
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,110
and we've just given back over 10% here.
So have to see how we now this is a key

532
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
So have to see how we now this is a key
 

533
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,069
So have to see how we now this is a key
level for AVGO. If it starts losing that

534
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,079
level for AVGO. If it starts losing that
 

535
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,069
level for AVGO. If it starts losing that
then you're going to have you know uh

536
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
then you're going to have you know uh
 

537
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,670
then you're going to have you know uh
over a month's worth of trap buyers

538
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:53,680
over a month's worth of trap buyers
 

539
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,750
over a month's worth of trap buyers
above.

540
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:55,760
above.
 

541
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,750
above.
So we just see uh what did break out.

542
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:57,760
So we just see uh what did break out.
 

543
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,150
So we just see uh what did break out.
Well RTY I think it was RTY broke out

544
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
Well RTY I think it was RTY broke out
 

545
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,629
Well RTY I think it was RTY broke out
alltime highs right watching that. So

546
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
alltime highs right watching that. So
 

547
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,949
alltime highs right watching that. So
that is signaling

548
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:04,959
that is signaling
 

549
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,150
that is signaling
right a rotation out of tech

550
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
right a rotation out of tech
 

551
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,790
right a rotation out of tech
into small cap land. Right? So just keep

552
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:14,800
into small cap land. Right? So just keep
 

553
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,949
into small cap land. Right? So just keep
your eyes on that

554
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:16,959
your eyes on that
 

555
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,150
your eyes on that
daily huge breakout. There you go. All

556
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
daily huge breakout. There you go. All
 

557
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,870
daily huge breakout. There you go. All
right. So really nice recovery. If you

558
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
right. So really nice recovery. If you
 

559
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,310
right. So really nice recovery. If you
think, oh well the rest of the market's

560
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
think, oh well the rest of the market's
 

561
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,990
think, oh well the rest of the market's
lagging behind, go and look at some of

562
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
lagging behind, go and look at some of
 

563
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,829
lagging behind, go and look at some of
the times we've had uh major major

564
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
the times we've had uh major major
 

565
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,150
the times we've had uh major major
problems in the market quite frequently.

566
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,160
problems in the market quite frequently.
 

567
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,030
problems in the market quite frequently.
you will see RTY do this Q's not do it

568
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
you will see RTY do this Q's not do it
 

569
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,790
you will see RTY do this Q's not do it
and then all a roll. So, it's the only

570
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
and then all a roll. So, it's the only
 

571
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,230
and then all a roll. So, it's the only
thing I'm concerned about. I don't want

572
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,240
thing I'm concerned about. I don't want
 

573
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,030
thing I'm concerned about. I don't want
to be overly biased anyway right now. I

574
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,040
to be overly biased anyway right now. I
 

575
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,430
to be overly biased anyway right now. I
do want to be um somewhat aware of

576
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440
do want to be um somewhat aware of
 

577
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,310
do want to be um somewhat aware of
what's going on. Um let me just check

578
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
what's going on. Um let me just check
 

579
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:54,629
what's going on. Um let me just check
move quickly before I forget.

580
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:54,639

 

581
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,949

Okay. the 10 year

582
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
Okay. the 10 year
 

583
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,750
Okay. the 10 year
five. It was the 10 that pullback held.

584
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:01,760
five. It was the 10 that pullback held.
 

585
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,670
five. It was the 10 that pullback held.
I think this is going to be a problem.

586
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
I think this is going to be a problem.
 

587
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,509
I think this is going to be a problem.
I've maintained this for a long, long

588
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
I've maintained this for a long, long
 

589
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,949
I've maintained this for a long, long
time. I think this is where the

590
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:06,959
time. I think this is where the
 

591
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,710
time. I think this is where the
problem's going to come.

592
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,720

 

593
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,110

A break over 42.

594
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,120
A break over 42.
 

595
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,550
A break over 42.
This is going to be a problem for the

596
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,560
This is going to be a problem for the
 

597
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,550
This is going to be a problem for the
market.

598
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
market.
 

599
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,350
market.
Just absolutely is. and uh US has got a

600
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
Just absolutely is. and uh US has got a
 

601
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,710
Just absolutely is. and uh US has got a
lot of um debt it's exposed to that it's

602
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:22,720
lot of um debt it's exposed to that it's
 

603
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,670
lot of um debt it's exposed to that it's
going to have to move come early 2026.

604
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
going to have to move come early 2026.
 

605
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,910
going to have to move come early 2026.
So maybe we don't see this play out till

606
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:27,920
So maybe we don't see this play out till
 

607
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,710
So maybe we don't see this play out till
next year. But uh

608
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:30,720
next year. But uh
 

609
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,629
next year. But uh
it's certainly not looking good if that

610
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
it's certainly not looking good if that
 

611
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,590
it's certainly not looking good if that
starts breaking out, folks.

612
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,600
starts breaking out, folks.
 

613
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,829
starts breaking out, folks.
I don't want to have a bias. Not right

614
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
I don't want to have a bias. Not right
 

615
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,990
I don't want to have a bias. Not right
now. Right. That's that's what I'm

616
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000
now. Right. That's that's what I'm
 

617

906
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:27,440
and slam this now. would probably come
 

907
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,510
and slam this now. would probably come
and test the 550s and see if they can

908
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:29,520
and test the 550s and see if they can

and test the 550s and see if they can
hold a bid there, which they just did.

So if you look at if you zoom out and

920
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:48,960
So if you look at if you zoom out and
 

921
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,870
So if you look at if you zoom out and
look at the current weekly profile, we

922
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
look at the current weekly profile, we
 

923
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,510
look at the current weekly profile, we
are literally trading right at the uh

924
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:53,520
are literally trading right at the uh
 

925
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,909
are literally trading right at the uh
value area low. Previous week point of

926
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:55,919
value area low. Previous week point of
 

927
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,990
value area low. Previous week point of
control is just above us as you can see.

928
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,000
control is just above us as you can see.
 

929
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,710
control is just above us as you can see.
So this is current value area low of the

930
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:00,720
So this is current value area low of the
 

931
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,470
So this is current value area low of the
week. This blue line previous week point

932
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:02,480
week. This blue line previous week point
 

933
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,230
week. This blue line previous week point
of control here. So we're just battling

934
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:04,240
of control here. So we're just battling
 

935
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,830
of control here. So we're just battling
between all these levels at the moment.

936
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:09,840

 

937
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,909

I would love to be long and strong but

938
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:11,919
I would love to be long and strong but
 

939
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,390
I would love to be long and strong but
uh you know how many attempts can this

940
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,400
uh you know how many attempts can this
 

941
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,149
uh you know how many attempts can this
market have at 900 and keep failing? You

942
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:16,159
market have at 900 and keep failing? You
 

943
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,750
market have at 900 and keep failing? You
got to imagine the next attempt we just

944
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:17,760
got to imagine the next attempt we just
 

945
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,270
got to imagine the next attempt we just
run through it. It's been there so many

946
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,280
run through it. It's been there so many
 

947
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,909
run through it. It's been there so many
times. But at the moment we are nowhere

948
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:21,919
times. But at the moment we are nowhere
 

949
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,070
times. But at the moment we are nowhere
near that. We're over 300 points away

950
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,080
near that. We're over 300 points away
 

951
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,430
near that. We're over 300 points away
from it.

952
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:29,440

 

953
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,149

Tes are really motoring here.

955
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,070

Really motoring here. I think it had uh

956
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080
Really motoring here. I think it had uh
 

957
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,909
Really motoring here. I think it had uh
over 50s. It looks good. And it's

958
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:37,919
over 50s. It looks good. And it's
 

959
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,470
over 50s. It looks good. And it's
currently trading at 55. So, it's really

960
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:40,480
currently trading at 55. So, it's really
 

961
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,669
currently trading at 55. So, it's really
dragging this market up. It's

962
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:41,679
dragging this market up. It's
 

963
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,710
dragging this market up. It's
impressive.

964
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720

 

965
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,870

absolutely ripping. The next level on

968
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:48,640

969
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,789

Tesla would be 56.90. Might as well call
 

971
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,350

it 57. And that would be a big breakout

972
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,360
it 57. And that would be a big breakout
 

973
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,470
it 57. And that would be a big breakout
if we get through that. Then you're

974
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:54,480
if we get through that. Then you're
 

975
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,549
if we get through that. Then you're

Waiting to see if it offers a join long
here.

1092
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,600

 

1093
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,430

Some sellers got caught on that last

1094
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:43,440
Some sellers got caught on that last
 

1095
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,190
Some sellers got caught on that last
candle. This is M just going to go

1096
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,200
candle. This is M just going to go
 

1097
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,230
candle. This is M just going to go
without me now.

1098
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:48,240
without me now.
 

1099
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,070
without me now.
Dang it.

1100
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,080
Dang it.
 

1101
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,830
Dang it.
Wait and see for that retest of 80. He's

1102
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:51,840
Wait and see for that retest of 80. He's
 

1103
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,870
Wait and see for that retest of 80. He's
never came. Dang it. Dang it. All right.

1104
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:54,880
never came. Dang it. Dang it. All right.
 

1105
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,470
never came. Dang it. Dang it. All right.
So, if you're longing this, you'd be

1106
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:56,480
So, if you're longing this, you'd be
 

1107
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,230
So, if you're longing this, you'd be
looking for this squeeze up to this blue

1108
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,240
looking for this squeeze up to this blue
 

1109
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,470
looking for this squeeze up to this blue
line above you now. Previous day value

1110
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:00,480
line above you now. Previous day value
 

1111
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,909
line above you now. Previous day value
high. I was just waiting. Just wanted a

1112
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:01,919
high. I was just waiting. Just wanted a
 

1113
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,430
high. I was just waiting. Just wanted a
bit more of a retest down here. Maybe I

1114
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:03,440
bit more of a retest down here. Maybe I
 

1115
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,669
bit more of a retest down here. Maybe I
was too greedy. Was waiting to see this

1116
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:05,679
was too greedy. Was waiting to see this
 

1117
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,830
was too greedy. Was waiting to see this
build down into here and then scoop that

1118
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:07,840
build down into here and then scoop that
 

1119
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,830
build down into here and then scoop that
up.

1120
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:09,840
up.
 

1121
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,269
up.
The last lot of sellers got trapped into

1122
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:13,279
The last lot of sellers got trapped into
 

1123
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,149
The last lot of sellers got trapped into
around 96 in here. So they held previous

1124
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:16,159
around 96 in here. So they held previous
 

1125
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,750
around 96 in here. So they held previous
week. They're not getting through

1126
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:17,760
week. They're not getting through
 

1127
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,750
week. They're not getting through
previous day though for that move there.

1128
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:19,760
previous day though for that move there.
 

1129
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,149
previous day though for that move there.
So maybe I'll get another shot at this.

1130
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:22,159
So maybe I'll get another shot at this.
 

1131
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,669
So maybe I'll get another shot at this.
I want to be careful now because it's

1132
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:23,679
I want to be careful now because it's
 

1133
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:31,029
I want to be careful now because it's
just squeezed out.

1134
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:31,039

 

1135
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,430

Lots of buyers getting aggressive here

1136
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:33,440
Lots of buyers getting aggressive here
 

1137
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,750
Lots of buyers getting aggressive here
and not getting the move.

1138
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:37,760

 

1139
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,830

Yeah, absolutely correct. Whoever said

1140
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:39,840
Yeah, absolutely correct. Whoever said
 

1141
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,750
Yeah, absolutely correct. Whoever said
that same trap zone as yesterday, it is.

1142
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:41,760
that same trap zone as yesterday, it is.
 

1143
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,990
that same trap zone as yesterday, it is.
It is. We're still in yesterday's range,

1144
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,000
It is. We're still in yesterday's range,
 

1145
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,390
It is. We're still in yesterday's range,
right? There's the top of the range.

1146
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:46,400
right? There's the top of the range.
 

1147
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,950
right? There's the top of the range.
There's bottom of the range.

1148
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:48,960
There's bottom of the range.
 

1149
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,950
There's bottom of the range.
Oh, move that. And we're going to need

1150
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:50,960
Oh, move that. And we're going to need
 

1151
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,389
Oh, move that. And we're going to need
that.

1152
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:54,399

 

1153
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,110

Can we develop some sort of higher pivot

1154
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,120
Can we develop some sort of higher pivot
 

1155
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,029
Can we develop some sort of higher pivot
here is the question. Can we develop the

1156
00:27:59,029 --> 00:27:59,039
here is the question. Can we develop the
 

1157
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,510
here is the question. Can we develop the
higher pivot over this and use this then

1158
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:01,520
higher pivot over this and use this then
 

1159
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,190
higher pivot over this and use this then
to come and attack this? And if we get

1160
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,200
to come and attack this? And if we get
 

1161
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,909
to come and attack this? And if we get
lucky, we close this gap. If we fail

1162
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:05,919
lucky, we close this gap. If we fail
 

1163
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:26,870
lucky, we close this gap. If we fail
this, then everything's off the table.

1164
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:26,880

 

1165
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,430

We're a little bit thin under 96 down to

1166
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,440
We're a little bit thin under 96 down to
 

1167
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,830
We're a little bit thin under 96 down to
78. Just aware of that. There you go.

1168
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:31,840
78. Just aware of that. There you go.
 

1169
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,990
78. Just aware of that. There you go.
So, that happened literally as I said

1170
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,000
So, that happened literally as I said
 

1171
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,750
So, that happened literally as I said
it.

1172
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:39,760

 

1173
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,230

We're a little bit thin. Gone. Oh, we'll

1174
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:42,240
We're a little bit thin. Gone. Oh, we'll
 

1175
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,230
We're a little bit thin. Gone. Oh, we'll
have your thinness. Thanks very much.

1176
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,240
have your thinness. Thanks very much.
 

1177
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,149
have your thinness. Thanks very much.
Okay, so I'm just going to wait this out

1178
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:46,159
Okay, so I'm just going to wait this out
 

1179
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,870
Okay, so I'm just going to wait this out
a second.

1180
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:48,880
a second.
 

1181
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,230
a second.
Came straight through that point of

1182
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:50,240
Came straight through that point of
 

1183
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:59,029
Came straight through that point of
control on the session. Back to be what?

1184
00:28:59,029 --> 00:28:59,039

 

1185
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:09,269

Oh my days.

1186
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:09,279

 

1187
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,190

This little low volume node now here

1188
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,200
This little low volume node now here
 

1189
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:43,830
This little low volume node now here
becomes important as you're over under

1190
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:43,840

 

1191
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,029

Just checking the news today.

1192
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:47,039
Just checking the news today.
 

1193
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,669
Just checking the news today.

Wholesale is worth being aware of. Okay.

1198
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:55,919
Wholesale is worth being aware of. Okay.
 

1199
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,870
Wholesale is worth being aware of. Okay.
Heaviness coming into this market.

1200
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:58,880
Heaviness coming into this market.
 

1201
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,470
Heaviness coming into this market.
So they failed to get back through those

1202
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:00,480
So they failed to get back through those
 

1203
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,710
So they failed to get back through those
point of controls. They had the ability

1204
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:02,720
point of controls. They had the ability
 

1205
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,149
point of controls. They had the ability
to put in a higher low. They haven't

1206
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:04,159
to put in a higher low. They haven't
 

1207
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,669
to put in a higher low. They haven't
been able to put in that higher low. So,

1208
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:05,679
been able to put in that higher low. So,
 

1209
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,470
been able to put in that higher low. So,
no dips available yet. Starting to wash

1210
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:08,480
no dips available yet. Starting to wash
 

1211
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,310
no dips available yet. Starting to wash
down. I'm still flat on the day, folks.

1212
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:10,320
down. I'm still flat on the day, folks.
 

1213
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,990
down. I'm still flat on the day, folks.
Like, no trades here. There's nothing

1214
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,000
Like, no trades here. There's nothing
 

1215
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,269
Like, no trades here. There's nothing
going on. Just waiting till I see

1216
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:15,279
going on. Just waiting till I see
 

1217
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,430
going on. Just waiting till I see
something I like.

1218
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:17,440
something I like.
 

1219
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,950
something I like.
Let's wait and see if we'd come into

1220
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:18,960
Let's wait and see if we'd come into
 

1221
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,549
Let's wait and see if we'd come into
here and put in a high low. We haven't

1222
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:20,559
here and put in a high low. We haven't
 

1223
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,630
here and put in a high low. We haven't
done that. All we've done now is had a

1224
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:22,640
done that. All we've done now is had a
 

1225
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,430
done that. All we've done now is had a
failed breakout up here,

1226
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:27,440

 

1227
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,070

failing to regain point control. And if

1228
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,080
failing to regain point control. And if
 

1229
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,830
failing to regain point control. And if
they lose this, then we're going to come

1230
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:31,840
they lose this, then we're going to come
 

1231
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,029
they lose this, then we're going to come
and revisit value area low.

1232
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:35,039
and revisit value area low.
 

1233
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:47,190
and revisit value area low.
So the rotations are continuing.

1234
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,200

 

1235
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,149

I don't use range charts. No, I don't

1236
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:50,159
I don't use range charts. No, I don't
 

1237
00:30:50,159 --> 00:31:01,029
I don't use range charts. No, I don't
use range charts or tick charts.

1238
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:01,039

 

1239
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,029

Do I know if you can copy trade across

1240
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:03,039
Do I know if you can copy trade across
 

1241
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,950
Do I know if you can copy trade across
firms like Apex TPT at the same time?

1242
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:04,960
firms like Apex TPT at the same time?
 

1243
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,909
firms like Apex TPT at the same time?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can.

1244
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:07,919
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can.
 

1245
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,310
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can.
This is very rare that firms don't allow

1246
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,320
This is very rare that firms don't allow
 

1247
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,710
This is very rare that firms don't allow
it. I think trade day was one that

1248
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:12,720
it. I think trade day was one that
 

1249
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,310
it. I think trade day was one that
didn't, but like everyone else allows it

1250
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:14,320
didn't, but like everyone else allows it
 

1251
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,909
didn't, but like everyone else allows it
pretty much.

1252
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:19,919

 

1253
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,750

Manipulation. I mean, I just think we're

1254
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:21,760
Manipulation. I mean, I just think we're
 

1255
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,430
Manipulation. I mean, I just think we're
in a a rotation. I don't think it's

1256
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:23,440
in a a rotation. I don't think it's
 

1257
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,029
in a a rotation. I don't think it's
necessarily manipulation. and we haven't

1258
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:25,039
necessarily manipulation. and we haven't
 

1259
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,669
necessarily manipulation. and we haven't
moved a bubble below a swing point.

1260
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:27,679
moved a bubble below a swing point.
 

1261
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,909
moved a bubble below a swing point.
Personally, that's how I would read it.

1262
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:29,919
Personally, that's how I would read it.
 

1263
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,909
Personally, that's how I would read it.
All right, just remember with if we zoom

1264
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:31,919
All right, just remember with if we zoom
 

1265
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,110
All right, just remember with if we zoom
out and think about where we are,

1266
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,120
out and think about where we are,
 

1267
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,549
out and think about where we are,
right? This is the previous week range.

1268
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:38,559
right? This is the previous week range.
 

1269
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,110
right? This is the previous week range.
This is the current week range.

1270
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,120
This is the current week range.
 

1271
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,630
This is the current week range.
We can't get back above the current

1272
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:42,640
We can't get back above the current
 

1273
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,389
We can't get back above the current
week's point of control or the previous

1274
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:44,399
week's point of control or the previous
 

1275
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,830
week's point of control or the previous
week point of control. We're coming down

1276
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:45,840
week point of control. We're coming down
 

1277
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,909
week point of control. We're coming down
to the current week value area low. If

1278
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:47,919
to the current week value area low. If
 

1279
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:48,950
to the current week value area low. If
we lose that, we come down to

1280
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
we lose that, we come down to
 

1281
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,710
we lose that, we come down to
yesterday's value low. If we hold that,

1282
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:50,720
yesterday's value low. If we hold that,
 

1283
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,230
yesterday's value low. If we hold that,
we come back. If we lose that, we come

1284
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:52,240
we come back. If we lose that, we come
 

1285
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,830
we come back. If we lose that, we come
down. We're just going like remember at

1286
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:53,840
down. We're just going like remember at
 

1287
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,430
down. We're just going like remember at
the beginning before in the pre-market

1288
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:55,440
the beginning before in the pre-market
 

1289
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,630
the beginning before in the pre-market
if you were here I talked about going

1290
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:56,640
if you were here I talked about going
 

1291
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,710
if you were here I talked about going
from level to level to level to level.

1292
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
from level to level to level to level.
 

1293
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,470
from level to level to level to level.
That's what we do in range rotations. We

1294
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:00,480
That's what we do in range rotations. We
 

1295
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,789
That's what we do in range rotations. We
just test one side, test the other. Test

1296
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:02,799
just test one side, test the other. Test
 

1297
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,909
just test one side, test the other. Test
one side, test the other. That's why

1298
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:03,919
one side, test the other. That's why
 

1299
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,430
one side, test the other. That's why
it's very hard for me to want to get

1300
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,440
it's very hard for me to want to get
 

1301
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,110
it's very hard for me to want to get
involved. Like I said, like if we come

1302
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,120
involved. Like I said, like if we come
 

1303
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,590
involved. Like I said, like if we come
down and we base out and we hold a dip,

1304
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:11,600
down and we base out and we hold a dip,
 

1305
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,590
down and we base out and we hold a dip,
I'll and I see something interesting, I

1306
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:13,600
I'll and I see something interesting, I
 

1307
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,190
I'll and I see something interesting, I
will absolutely play it. But it's not

1308
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,200
will absolutely play it. But it's not
 

1309
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,549
will absolutely play it. But it's not
what I'm seeing right now.

1310
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:18,559
what I'm seeing right now.
 

1311
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,669
what I'm seeing right now.
The blue is what and the gray is what?

1312
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:21,679
The blue is what and the gray is what?
 

1313
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,830
The blue is what and the gray is what?
Uh, blue is value. That's your current

1314
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:23,840
Uh, blue is value. That's your current
 

1315
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,990
Uh, blue is value. That's your current
value area, high, value area low. This

1316
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,000
value area, high, value area low. This
 

1317
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,909
value area, high, value area low. This
is outside of value. This is developing

1318
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:27,919
is outside of value. This is developing
 

1319
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,750
is outside of value. This is developing
though. So, this will build as we go on

1320
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:29,760
though. So, this will build as we go on
 

1321
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,430
though. So, this will build as we go on
through the day because we're only what,

1322
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:31,440
through the day because we're only what,
 

1323
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,430
through the day because we're only what,
15 minutes into the day. This is your

1324
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:33,440
15 minutes into the day. This is your
 

1325
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:41,669
15 minutes into the day. This is your
opening range low coming up here, folks.

1326
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:41,679

 

1327
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,190

The buy and sell indicators, they're the

1328
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:43,200
The buy and sell indicators, they're the
 

1329
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,269
The buy and sell indicators, they're the
flow zone pros. You can get those on my

1330
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:45,279
flow zone pros. You can get those on my
 

1331
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,830
flow zone pros. You can get those on my
website if you're interested.

1332
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:47,840
website if you're interested.
 

1333
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,149
website if you're interested.
I would be somewhat careful trading. uh

1334
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:50,159
I would be somewhat careful trading. uh
 

1335
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,830
I would be somewhat careful trading. uh
they are momentum players and trend

1336
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:51,840
they are momentum players and trend
 

1337
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,830
they are momentum players and trend
players. So be careful trading those

1338
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:53,840
players. So be careful trading those
 

1339
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,630
players. So be careful trading those
when we're inside a range though, right?

1340
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:56,640
when we're inside a range though, right?
 

1341
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,070
when we're inside a range though, right?
When you see them going up and down, up

1342
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,080
When you see them going up and down, up
 

1343
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,389
When you see them going up and down, up
and down, up and down, I kind of tend to

1344
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:00,399
and down, up and down, I kind of tend to
 

1345
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,149
and down, up and down, I kind of tend to
ignore these. Once we get into a trend

1346
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:02,159
ignore these. Once we get into a trend
 

1347
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,230
ignore these. Once we get into a trend
though, they're fantastic.

1348
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,240
though, they're fantastic.
 

1349
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,590
though, they're fantastic.
Like yesterday, they were really

1350
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:05,600
Like yesterday, they were really
 

1351
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,430
Like yesterday, they were really
powerful once we started breaking out

1352
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:09,440
powerful once we started breaking out
 

1353
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,310
powerful once we started breaking out
or even the breakdown last night.

1354
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:12,320
or even the breakdown last night.
 

1355
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,029
or even the breakdown last night.
This breakout yesterday once we got long

1356
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:15,039
This breakout yesterday once we got long
 

1357
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,509
This breakout yesterday once we got long
really nice even this long end of day,

1358
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:17,519
really nice even this long end of day,
 

1359
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,190
really nice even this long end of day,
right? So really good once we're in

1360
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,200
right? So really good once we're in
 

1361
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,110
right? So really good once we're in
breakout territory.

1362
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,120

 

1363
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:30,310

Okay, testing this low again.

1364
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:30,320

 

1365
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,789

Feels like we're going to sweep, but uh

1366
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:32,799
Feels like we're going to sweep, but uh
 

1367
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,310
Feels like we're going to sweep, but uh
feels like and does has not been

1368
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:34,320
feels like and does has not been
 

1369
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,310
feels like and does has not been
matching recently.

1370
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:38,320

 

1371
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,630

Where's spy trading into 88's on spy?

1372
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:40,640
Where's spy trading into 88's on spy?
 

1373
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,350
Where's spy trading into 88's on spy?
Remember key level 88's on spy. We lose

1374
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:43,360
Remember key level 88's on spy. We lose
 

1375
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,710
Remember key level 88's on spy. We lose
that. Um yesterday 87s was important but

1376
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:46,720
that. Um yesterday 87s was important but
 

1377
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,630
that. Um yesterday 87s was important but
I'd say 85s unless they uh move the gaps

1378
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:50,640
I'd say 85s unless they uh move the gaps
 

1379
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,029
I'd say 85s unless they uh move the gaps
levels 85 82s 88 9700.

1380
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:55,039
levels 85 82s 88 9700.
 

1381
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,470
levels 85 82s 88 9700.
Okay so holding bottom side of this

1382
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:56,480
Okay so holding bottom side of this
 

1383
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,590
Okay so holding bottom side of this
range we're probably going to go out and

1384
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:57,600
range we're probably going to go out and
 

1385
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,590
range we're probably going to go out and
test towards 70 now failing that New

1386
00:33:59,590 --> 00:33:59,600
test towards 70 now failing that New
 

1387
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,509
test towards 70 now failing that New
York open that blue line on the chart so

1388
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:01,519
York open that blue line on the chart so
 

1389
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,669
York open that blue line on the chart so
far. This will become key as you're over

1390
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:03,679
far. This will become key as you're over
 

1391
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,190
far. This will become key as you're over
under. You can see how ugly this is

1392
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:05,200
under. You can see how ugly this is
 

1393
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,269
under. You can see how ugly this is
getting. If we develop liquidity here

1394
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:07,279
getting. If we develop liquidity here
 

1395
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,030
getting. If we develop liquidity here
it's possible right if we develop

1396
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,040
it's possible right if we develop
 

1397
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,470
it's possible right if we develop
liquidity here and hold here it's

1398
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:10,480
liquidity here and hold here it's
 

1399
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,629
liquidity here and hold here it's
possible that they rotate this. Can't

1400
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:12,639
possible that they rotate this. Can't
 

1401
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,190
possible that they rotate this. Can't
rule that out

1402
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,200
rule that out
 

1403
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,470
rule that out
again. Still flat for me. Just waiting.

1404
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:18,480
again. Still flat for me. Just waiting.
 

1405
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,069
again. Still flat for me. Just waiting.
We're still inside that opening five

1406
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:20,079
We're still inside that opening five
 

1407
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,230
We're still inside that opening five
minute candle.

1408
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,240

 

1409
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,430

Tesla is trying to build out here.

1410
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:29,440

 

1411
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,270

Starting to break down here now. Some

1412
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,280
Starting to break down here now. Some
 

1413
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,190
Starting to break down here now. Some
big sellers coming in at those 35s

1414
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,200
big sellers coming in at those 35s
 

1415
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:43,030
big sellers coming in at those 35s
though being absorbed.

1416
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,040

 

1417
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,629

trying to break down. It's a big delta

1418
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:44,639
trying to break down. It's a big delta
 

1419
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,470
trying to break down. It's a big delta
level here at sort of 34 standing out.

1420
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:46,480
level here at sort of 34 standing out.
 

1421
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,909
level here at sort of 34 standing out.
They get under that, there's a potential

1422
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:47,919
They get under that, there's a potential
 

1423
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,349
They get under that, there's a potential
flush, but at the moment they keep

1424
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:49,359
flush, but at the moment they keep
 

1425
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,589
flush, but at the moment they keep
getting absorbed down here.

1426
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:53,599

 

1427
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,950

Tesla is trying to go the other way.

1428
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:54,960
Tesla is trying to go the other way.
 

1429
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,550
Tesla is trying to go the other way.
It's trying to build a 5minute flag for

1430
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:56,560
It's trying to build a 5minute flag for
 

1431
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,430
It's trying to build a 5minute flag for
a breakout on Tesla.

1432
00:34:59,430 --> 00:34:59,440
a breakout on Tesla.
 

1433
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,190
a breakout on Tesla.
And if it does that, it might drag the

1434
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,200
And if it does that, it might drag the
 

1435
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,550
And if it does that, it might drag the
market up with it. We will see.

1436
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:06,560

 

1437
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,310

Lots of selling at these lows, folks.

1438
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:08,320
Lots of selling at these lows, folks.
 

1439
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,829
Lots of selling at these lows, folks.
They keep reloading the selling at the

1440
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:09,839
They keep reloading the selling at the
 

1441
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,430
They keep reloading the selling at the
lows and they're not able to move lower

1442
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:11,440
lows and they're not able to move lower
 

1443
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,069
lows and they're not able to move lower
yet. They are trying. They are

1444
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:14,079
yet. They are trying. They are
 

1445
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:20,550
yet. They are trying. They are
desperately trying to move lower here.

1446
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:20,560

 

1447
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,310

There's the attempt again. Lots of

1448
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:22,320
There's the attempt again. Lots of
 

1449
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,310
There's the attempt again. Lots of
selling down here. Market orders flying

1450
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:24,320
selling down here. Market orders flying
 

1451
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,829
selling down here. Market orders flying
in. There we go. They finally getting

1452
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:25,839
in. There we go. They finally getting
 

1453
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,230
in. There we go. They finally getting
their break. Here's the move outside of

1454
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,240
their break. Here's the move outside of
 

1455
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,510
their break. Here's the move outside of
your opening range. Now, the question

1456
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:29,520
your opening range. Now, the question
 

1457
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,109
your opening range. Now, the question
is, can they get continuation? They

1458
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:31,119
is, can they get continuation? They
 

1459
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,910
is, can they get continuation? They
won't want to lose 40s. All right. If we

1460
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:33,920
won't want to lose 40s. All right. If we
 

1461
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,670
won't want to lose 40s. All right. If we
reclaim 40s, all the shorts down here

1462
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:35,680
reclaim 40s, all the shorts down here
 

1463
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,910
reclaim 40s, all the shorts down here
will get stuck. The rotation can happen

1464
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:37,920
will get stuck. The rotation can happen
 

1465
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,069
will get stuck. The rotation can happen
down to here if they really want. So,

1466
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:40,079
down to here if they really want. So,
 

1467
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,470
down to here if they really want. So,
they're looking to sell versus 40s for a

1468
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:42,480
they're looking to sell versus 40s for a
 

1469
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,470
they're looking to sell versus 40s for a
rotation lower. If they lose 40s, they

1470
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:44,480
rotation lower. If they lose 40s, they
 

1471
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,270
rotation lower. If they lose 40s, they
will be in problems.

1472
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:49,280

 

1473
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,310

Can they snap down to that value? That's

1474
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:52,320
Can they snap down to that value? That's
 

1475
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,750
Can they snap down to that value? That's
not breaking out yet, so it might give

1476
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:53,760
not breaking out yet, so it might give
 

1477
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,470
not breaking out yet, so it might give
them a chance. So many shorts piling in

1478
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:56,480
them a chance. So many shorts piling in
 

1479
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,310
them a chance. So many shorts piling in
here. Can they get a continuation? Here

1480
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:58,320
here. Can they get a continuation? Here
 

1481
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,310
here. Can they get a continuation? Here
we go.

1482
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:00,320
we go.
 

1483
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,550
we go.
So, first little scout. Big delta there

1484
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:02,560
So, first little scout. Big delta there
 

1485
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,190
So, first little scout. Big delta there
at at 300 at 500s. Be very very careful.

1486
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,200
at at 300 at 500s. Be very very careful.
 

1487
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,349
at at 300 at 500s. Be very very careful.
That's massive seller down there. He's

1488
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:07,359
That's massive seller down there. He's
 

1489
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,270
That's massive seller down there. He's
twice now he's got trapped. There's

1490
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:09,280
twice now he's got trapped. There's
 

1491
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,310
twice now he's got trapped. There's
someone on the tape down there

1492
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:10,320
someone on the tape down there
 

1493
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,430
someone on the tape down there
absorbing.

1494
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:13,440

 

1495
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,069

So I wouldn't want this to revisit uh I

1496
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:16,079
So I wouldn't want this to revisit uh I
 

1497
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,950
So I wouldn't want this to revisit uh I
wouldn't want this to reclaim sorry 40s

1498
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:18,960
wouldn't want this to reclaim sorry 40s
 

1499
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,310
wouldn't want this to reclaim sorry 40s
all the time. We're under that possible

1500
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:20,320
all the time. We're under that possible
 

1501
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,150
all the time. We're under that possible
continuation but it's all sellside delta

1502
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,160
continuation but it's all sellside delta
 

1503
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,510
continuation but it's all sellside delta
here. There's definitely absorption

1504
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:23,520
here. There's definitely absorption
 

1505
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,150
here. There's definitely absorption
happening versus 500. So watching this

1506
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,160
happening versus 500. So watching this
 

1507
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,470
happening versus 500. So watching this
now as we come back into the 40s. Do

1508
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:28,480
now as we come back into the 40s. Do
 

1509
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,390
now as we come back into the 40s. Do
they sell this in front of 40s? If they

1510
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:30,400
they sell this in front of 40s? If they
 

1511
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,670
they sell this in front of 40s? If they
don't, we're going straight back into

1512
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:31,680
don't, we're going straight back into
 

1513
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,150
don't, we're going straight back into
range.

1514
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,160
range.
 

1515
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,990
range.
And the selling really started at 47.

1516
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:38,000
And the selling really started at 47.
 

1517
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,589
And the selling really started at 47.
So buyers tried there and failed to

1518
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:39,599
So buyers tried there and failed to
 

1519
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,829
So buyers tried there and failed to
reclaim 30s and 40s. Now you're going to

1520
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:41,839
reclaim 30s and 40s. Now you're going to
 

1521
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,270
reclaim 30s and 40s. Now you're going to
get a lower time frame battle. There's

1522
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:43,280
get a lower time frame battle. There's
 

1523
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,470
get a lower time frame battle. There's
absorption at 500, but 40s becomes the

1524
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:46,480
absorption at 500, but 40s becomes the
 

1525
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,150
absorption at 500, but 40s becomes the
key level for me. I'm watching. Tesla

1526
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,160
key level for me. I'm watching. Tesla
 

1527
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,589
key level for me. I'm watching. Tesla
trying to break out as well at the same

1528
00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:49,599
trying to break out as well at the same
 

1529
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,950
trying to break out as well at the same
time. Just be aware of that. Tesla

1530
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:50,960
time. Just be aware of that. Tesla
 

1531
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,230
time. Just be aware of that. Tesla
trying to do a fivem minute flag

1532
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:52,240
trying to do a fivem minute flag
 

1533
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,750
trying to do a fivem minute flag
breakout. It does that might drag the

1534
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:53,760
breakout. It does that might drag the
 

1535
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,670
breakout. It does that might drag the
cues up. Rest of the market's gone red

1536
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:55,680
cues up. Rest of the market's gone red
 

1537
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,109
cues up. Rest of the market's gone red
other than Tesla. Rest of the market's

1538
00:36:57,109 --> 00:36:57,119
other than Tesla. Rest of the market's
 

1539
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,550
other than Tesla. Rest of the market's
gone heavy. Tesla's the only one. 250 or

1540
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:00,560
gone heavy. Tesla's the only one. 250 or
 

1541
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,550
gone heavy. Tesla's the only one. 250 or
58% up. Rest of the market is all red on

1542
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:02,560
58% up. Rest of the market is all red on
 

1543
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,270
58% up. Rest of the market is all red on
the day

1544
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:07,280

 

1545
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,109

and test the I really want this to come

1546
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:09,119
and test the I really want this to come
 

1547
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,870
and test the I really want this to come
up to 40s and show me

1548
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:14,880

 

1549
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,190

back to these 500s again. He's just

1550
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,200
back to these 500s again. He's just
 

1551
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,670
back to these 500s again. He's just
sitting at 500s trying to absorb Delta

1552
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:19,680
sitting at 500s trying to absorb Delta
 

1553
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,030
sitting at 500s trying to absorb Delta
offside down here. If we break that,

1554
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,040
offside down here. If we break that,
 

1555
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,910
offside down here. If we break that,
we're probably going to go down to 470s.

1556
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,920
we're probably going to go down to 470s.
 

1557
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,670
we're probably going to go down to 470s.
They're trying to sell this again to

1558
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:25,680
They're trying to sell this again to
 

1559
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,990
They're trying to sell this again to
Delta C again here. Can they snap is the

1560
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,000
Delta C again here. Can they snap is the
 

1561
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,430
Delta C again here. Can they snap is the
question. Otherwise, we're going right

1562
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:29,440
question. Otherwise, we're going right
 

1563
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,750
question. Otherwise, we're going right
back up to 40s. So, failed to break down

1564
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:31,760
back up to 40s. So, failed to break down
 

1565
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,790
back up to 40s. So, failed to break down
there so far.

1566
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:34,800
there so far.
 

1567
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,550
there so far.
If they snap, we go previous day value

1568
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:36,560
If they snap, we go previous day value
 

1569
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,910
If they snap, we go previous day value
low. If they hold, we go back to the

1570
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:37,920
low. If they hold, we go back to the
 

1571
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,630
low. If they hold, we go back to the
40s. Back to the 40s we go at the

1572
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:40,640
40s. Back to the 40s we go at the
 

1573
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,270
40s. Back to the 40s we go at the
moment. Or at least back to 20s.

1574
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,280
moment. Or at least back to 20s.
 

1575
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,790
moment. Or at least back to 20s.
That bid just pulled. So, he's moved

Tesla looks like it's going to break

1580
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:51,359
Tesla looks like it's going to break
 

1581
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,670
Tesla looks like it's going to break
out. honestly be very concerned about

1582
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:53,680
out. honestly be very concerned about
 

1583
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,430
out. honestly be very concerned about
this that they can do a reversal here if

1584
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:55,440
this that they can do a reversal here if
 

1585
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:03,109
this that they can do a reversal here if
they want to be really nasty.

1586
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:03,119

 

1587
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,550

They're pushing for those 40s like we

1588
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:04,560
They're pushing for those 40s like we
 

1589
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,550
They're pushing for those 40s like we
just talked about. If they reclaim that

1590
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:06,560
just talked about. If they reclaim that
 

1591
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,030
just talked about. If they reclaim that
potential squeezes on 40s to 50s

1592
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,040
potential squeezes on 40s to 50s
 

1593
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,790
potential squeezes on 40s to 50s
that be a failed look below not even

1594
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:12,800
that be a failed look below not even
 

1595
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,069
that be a failed look below not even
getting to value.

1596
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:16,079
getting to value.
 

1597
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,750
getting to value.
That's currently value 65s.

1598
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:21,760

 

1599
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:33,109

Interesting levels here.

1600
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:33,119

 

1601
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,589

No snap. No push. Tesla's about to break

1602
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:35,599
No snap. No push. Tesla's about to break
 

1603
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,310
No snap. No push. Tesla's about to break
out here, folks. Be very, very careful.

1604
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:38,320
out here, folks. Be very, very careful.
 

1605
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,990
out here, folks. Be very, very careful.
And that will drag the market up if it

1606
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,000
And that will drag the market up if it
 

1607
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:49,430
And that will drag the market up if it
does.

1608
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:49,440

 

1609
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,190

They are bidding lower. It's like they

1610
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:51,200
They are bidding lower. It's like they
 

1611
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,390
They are bidding lower. It's like they
want to move lower, but they've got a

1612
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:52,400
want to move lower, but they've got a
 

1613
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,069
want to move lower, but they've got a
one-stop market right now trying to drag

1614
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:54,079
one-stop market right now trying to drag
 

1615
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,630
one-stop market right now trying to drag
this market up. We snap 500s. They've

1616
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:56,640
this market up. We snap 500s. They've
 

1617
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,670
this market up. We snap 500s. They've
got to play, but uh

1618
00:38:59,670 --> 00:38:59,680
got to play, but uh
 

1619
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,109
got to play, but uh
yeah, they're coming to revisit it.

1620
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:01,119
yeah, they're coming to revisit it.
 

1621
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,310
yeah, they're coming to revisit it.
They're trying. There's just so much

1622
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,320
They're trying. There's just so much
 

1623
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,109
They're trying. There's just so much
delta caught offside down here. So many

1624
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:05,119
delta caught offside down here. So many
 

1625
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,069
delta caught offside down here. So many
sellers caught offside at 500 right now.

1626
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:08,079
sellers caught offside at 500 right now.
 

1627
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,470
sellers caught offside at 500 right now.
So many

1628
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:12,480

 

1629
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,030

So there's 20s,

1630
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,040
So there's 20s,
 

1631
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,829
So there's 20s,
here's the 30s, and here's the test of

1632
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:17,839
here's the 30s, and here's the test of
 

1633
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,190
here's the 30s, and here's the test of
the 40s I just talked about. And there's

1634
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,200
the 40s I just talked about. And there's
 

1635
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,190
the 40s I just talked about. And there's
Tesla breaking out. So that's why, like

1636
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:21,200
Tesla breaking out. So that's why, like
 

1637
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,510
Tesla breaking out. So that's why, like
I said, one stock market. It's it's just

1638
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:23,520
I said, one stock market. It's it's just
 

1639
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,790
I said, one stock market. It's it's just
how the cues have been for a little

1640
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:24,800
how the cues have been for a little
 

1641
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,589
how the cues have been for a little
while.

1642
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:27,599
while.
 

1643
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,670
while.
We test 40s now. And maybe if we get

1644
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:29,680
We test 40s now. And maybe if we get
 

1645
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,270
We test 40s now. And maybe if we get
through this, we're going to test 60s,

1646
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:31,280
through this, we're going to test 60s,
 

1647
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,470
through this, we're going to test 60s,
which is New York Open. Is it New York

1648
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:34,480
which is New York Open. Is it New York
 

1649
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,310
which is New York Open. Is it New York
Open? I don't think it is New York Open.

1650
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:38,320
Open? I don't think it is New York Open.
 

1651
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,190
Open? I don't think it is New York Open.
Let me check.

1652
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:41,200
Let me check.
 

1653
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,069
Let me check.
It is New York open. All right. And B up

1654
00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:44,079
It is New York open. All right. And B up
 

1655
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,310
It is New York open. All right. And B up
60s. Okay. So, squeezes on here with

1656
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:46,320
60s. Okay. So, squeezes on here with
 

1657
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,910
60s. Okay. So, squeezes on here with
Tesla like I just talked about. So, all

1658
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:47,920
Tesla like I just talked about. So, all
 

1659
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,990
Tesla like I just talked about. So, all
that delta offside at the lows

1660
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,000
that delta offside at the lows
 

1661
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,550
that delta offside at the lows
and up we go. And the rotation

1662
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:54,560
and up we go. And the rotation
 

1663
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,870
and up we go. And the rotation
continues. No continuation trades. We

1664
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:56,880
continues. No continuation trades. We
 

1665
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,710
continues. No continuation trades. We
had We don't even complete rotations at

1666
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:58,720
had We don't even complete rotations at
 

1667
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,390
had We don't even complete rotations at
this point. We're not even getting down

1668
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:00,400
this point. We're not even getting down
 

1669
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,470
this point. We're not even getting down
to complete one side or the other.

1670
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:02,480
to complete one side or the other.
 

1671
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,829
to complete one side or the other.
That's how bad this market's got.

1672
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:05,839
That's how bad this market's got.
 

1673
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:18,710
That's how bad this market's got.
And there's the New York Open.

1674
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:18,720

 

1675
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,630

Tesla's still going. This is a one-stop

1676
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:20,640
Tesla's still going. This is a one-stop
 

1677
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,829
Tesla's still going. This is a one-stop
market. It's going to drag everything

1678
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:21,839
market. It's going to drag everything
 

1679
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,109
market. It's going to drag everything
else up with it. So Tesla's risk on

1680
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:25,119
else up with it. So Tesla's risk on
 

1681
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,190
else up with it. So Tesla's risk on
absolutely flying right now. Up 15

1682
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:27,200
absolutely flying right now. Up 15
 

1683
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,270
absolutely flying right now. Up 15
points on the day. [\h__\h] I don't know

1684
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:29,280
points on the day. [\h__\h] I don't know
 

1685
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,589
points on the day. [\h__\h] I don't know
how people trade that with zero DTE.

1686
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:31,599
how people trade that with zero DTE.
 

1687
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,030
how people trade that with zero DTE.
Absolute psychopaths.

1688
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,040

 

1689
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,270

Apple now gone red to green. Nvidia gone

1690
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:37,280
Apple now gone red to green. Nvidia gone
 

1691
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,950
Apple now gone red to green. Nvidia gone
red to green and this is all from Tessa

trying to reclaim back towards 88. It's

1696
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:44,640
trying to reclaim back towards 88. It's
 

1697
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,109
trying to reclaim back towards 88. It's
not there yet though.

1698
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:47,119
not there yet though.
 

1699
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,870
not there yet though.
Not there yet though. And to New York

1700
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:48,880
Not there yet though. And to New York
 

1701

00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:56,240

 

1703
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,030

And back inside the opening range.

1704
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,040

 

1705
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,710

What a [\h__\h] show this week's been.

1706
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:02,720
What a [\h__\h] show this week's been.
 

1707
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,630
What a [\h__\h] show this week's been.
Honestly, or the last two weeks

1708
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:04,640
Honestly, or the last two weeks
 

1709
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:17,109
Honestly, or the last two weeks
actually. Complete [\h__\h] show.

1710
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:17,119

 

1711
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,790

Is there anyone higher now? Yeah.

1712
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:22,800

 

1713
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,550

So, I'd watch Spy and uh

1714
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:26,560
So, I'd watch Spy and uh
 

1715
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,069
So, I'd watch Spy and uh
Why is Tesla ripping? Because he's in a

1716
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:28,079
Why is Tesla ripping? Because he's in a
 

1717
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:42,309
Why is Tesla ripping? Because he's in a
technical breakout.

1718
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:42,319

 

1719
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:43,750

So through point of control on the

1720
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:43,760
So through point of control on the
 

1721
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,829
So through point of control on the
session, we probably come and test uh

1722
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:45,839
session, we probably come and test uh
 

1723
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,790
session, we probably come and test uh
90s to 600s now, which is your value

1724
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:48,800
90s to 600s now, which is your value
 

1725
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,790
90s to 600s now, which is your value
area high and your 24-hour VWAP and the

1726
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:50,800
area high and your 24-hour VWAP and the
 

1727
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,550
area high and your 24-hour VWAP and the
lower time frame algo and the previous

1728
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:52,560
lower time frame algo and the previous
 

1729
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,550
lower time frame algo and the previous
week point of control.

1730
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:54,560
week point of control.
 

1731
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,150
week point of control.
So probably up to that other side of

1732
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:56,160
So probably up to that other side of
 

1733
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,910
So probably up to that other side of
this

1734
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:57,920
this
 

1735
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,430
this
and I don't know if they fail that or

1736
00:41:59,430 --> 00:41:59,440
and I don't know if they fail that or
 

1737
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,030
and I don't know if they fail that or
not. All right, sweet. Didn't complete

1738
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,040
not. All right, sweet. Didn't complete
 

1739
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,950
not. All right, sweet. Didn't complete
rotation here. Didn't complete rotation

1740
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:02,960
rotation here. Didn't complete rotation
 

1741
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,510
rotation here. Didn't complete rotation
here. Stuck in between. They had the

1742
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:05,520
here. Stuck in between. They had the
 

1743
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,950
here. Stuck in between. They had the
chance to do this breakdown. They

1744
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:06,960
chance to do this breakdown. They
 

1745
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,309
chance to do this breakdown. They
failed. They had the chance to do this

1746
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:08,319
failed. They had the chance to do this
 

1747
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,910
failed. They had the chance to do this
breakout, they failed. That's the story

1748
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:09,920
breakout, they failed. That's the story
 

1749
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,910
breakout, they failed. That's the story
of this market.

1750
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:11,920
of this market.
 

1751
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,270
of this market.
But at some point, I tell you what's

1752
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:13,280
But at some point, I tell you what's
 

1753
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,710
But at some point, I tell you what's
going to happen. Everyone's going to bet

1754
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:14,720
going to happen. Everyone's going to bet
 

1755
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,030
going to happen. Everyone's going to bet
long here or bet short here, or maybe

1756
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,040
long here or bet short here, or maybe
 

1757
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,390
long here or bet short here, or maybe
not there, but at the extremes, and

1758
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:18,400
not there, but at the extremes, and
 

1759
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,069
not there, but at the extremes, and
they're going to get crushed because

1760
00:42:20,069 --> 00:42:20,079
they're going to get crushed because
 

1761
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,510
they're going to get crushed because
they've got so used to trading the

1762
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:21,520
they've got so used to trading the
 

1763
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,589
they've got so used to trading the
edges. At sometimes those at some point

1764
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:23,599
edges. At sometimes those at some point
 

1765
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:24,950
edges. At sometimes those at some point
those edges will fail because we've been

1766
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:24,960
those edges will fail because we've been
 

1767
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:37,349
those edges will fail because we've been
there so many times now.

1768
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:37,359

 

1769
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,829

Big outlier here at 73 delta wise. Get

1770
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:39,839
Big outlier here at 73 delta wise. Get
 

1771
00:42:39,839 --> 00:43:02,790
Big outlier here at 73 delta wise. Get
above that and it's a potential squeeze.

1772
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:02,800

 

1773
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,190

Looks so messy. Essa still looks like it

1774
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:05,200
Looks so messy. Essa still looks like it
 

1775
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:17,030
Looks so messy. Essa still looks like it
wants more to me.

1776
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:17,040

 

1777
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,950

Market's trying to rotate red to green

1778
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:18,960
Market's trying to rotate red to green
 

1779
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,430
Market's trying to rotate red to green
across the board now. It's trying. It's

1780
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:21,440
across the board now. It's trying. It's
 

1781
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,510
across the board now. It's trying. It's
not there yet. Nvidia is about to go

1782
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:23,520
not there yet. Nvidia is about to go
 

1783
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,670
not there yet. Nvidia is about to go
green to red though

1784
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:29,680

 

1785
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:35,270

point control.

1786
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:35,280

 

1787
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,150

Uh I guess question I guess technically

1788
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:38,160
Uh I guess question I guess technically
 

1789
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,589
Uh I guess question I guess technically
speaking they could try and put higher

1790
00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:39,599
speaking they could try and put higher
 

1791
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,470
speaking they could try and put higher
low in at the edge of this shelf. Uh I'm

1792
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:42,480
low in at the edge of this shelf. Uh I'm
 

1793
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,910
low in at the edge of this shelf. Uh I'm
I'm just avoiding this now at this

1794
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:43,920
I'm just avoiding this now at this
 

1795
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,510
I'm just avoiding this now at this
point. I was interested in playing the

1796
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:45,520
point. I was interested in playing the
 

1797
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,030
point. I was interested in playing the
shorts. Uh, but I'm going to avoid this,

1798
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:49,040
shorts. Uh, but I'm going to avoid this,
 

1799
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,950
shorts. Uh, but I'm going to avoid this,
right? Because we know in here they will

1800
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:50,960
right? Because we know in here they will
 

1801
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,710
right? Because we know in here they will
build out liquidity. If we leave this,

1802
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:52,720
build out liquidity. If we leave this,
 

1803
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,109
build out liquidity. If we leave this,
maybe if we leave this, maybe I'll be

1804
00:43:55,109 --> 00:43:55,119
maybe if we leave this, maybe I'll be
 

1805
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,470
maybe if we leave this, maybe I'll be
more interested. I'm going to try and

1806
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:56,480
more interested. I'm going to try and
 

1807
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,230
more interested. I'm going to try and
avoid this rotation in here for a

1808
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:58,240
avoid this rotation in here for a
 

1809
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,390
avoid this rotation in here for a
minute. We've still got lots of day

1810
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:00,400
minute. We've still got lots of day
 

1811
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,390
minute. We've still got lots of day
left. We've got news coming top of the

1812
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:02,400
left. We've got news coming top of the
 

1813
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,910
left. We've got news coming top of the
hour. We've got three and a half minutes

1814
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:03,920
hour. We've got three and a half minutes
 

1815
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,030
hour. We've got three and a half minutes
to get into that.

1816
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:07,040
to get into that.
 

1817
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,990
to get into that.
But what I would say is without a doubt,

1818
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:10,000
But what I would say is without a doubt,
 

1819
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,790
But what I would say is without a doubt,
Big Delta got caught at 30 and under.

1820
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:12,800
Big Delta got caught at 30 and under.
 

1821
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,390
Big Delta got caught at 30 and under.
And it really got caught at the low of

1822
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:14,400
And it really got caught at the low of
 

1823
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,030
And it really got caught at the low of
day. If I

1824
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:17,040
day. If I
 

1825
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,430
day. If I
should really just add a chart here,

1826
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:19,440
should really just add a chart here,
 

1827
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,589
should really just add a chart here,
shouldn't I? Let me just do this because

1828
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:21,599
shouldn't I? Let me just do this because
 

1829
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,030
shouldn't I? Let me just do this because
it's going to make me easier to teach

1830
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:23,040
it's going to make me easier to teach
 

1831
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,030
it's going to make me easier to teach
you. Where's my delta chart? Print.

1832
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:27,040
you. Where's my delta chart? Print.
 

1833
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:34,150
you. Where's my delta chart? Print.
Give me a second.

1834
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:34,160

 

1835
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,910

All right. Here's your offside players

1836
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:37,920
All right. Here's your offside players
 

1837
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,670
All right. Here's your offside players
down here.

1838
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:41,680

 

1839
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,470

All right. here. They got caught and

1840
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:44,480
All right. here. They got caught and
 

1841
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,710
All right. here. They got caught and
this guy and once we reprinted that, you

1842
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:46,720
this guy and once we reprinted that, you
 

1843
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,950
this guy and once we reprinted that, you
see this whole candle now stuck. All

1844
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:48,960
see this whole candle now stuck. All
 

1845
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,109
see this whole candle now stuck. All
right, so these guys are strong sellers.

1846
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:51,119
right, so these guys are strong sellers.
 

1847
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,550
right, so these guys are strong sellers.
They're now stuck. And we're playing the

1848
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:52,560
They're now stuck. And we're playing the
 

1849
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,550
They're now stuck. And we're playing the
other way

1850
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:54,560
other way
 

1851
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,390
other way
again. Same in this candle. They sold

1852
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:56,400
again. Same in this candle. They sold
 

1853
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:11,910
again. Same in this candle. They sold
the lows and they might get stuck here.

1854
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:11,920

 

1855
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,589

What bet did you lose with me last week,

1856
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:13,599
What bet did you lose with me last week,
 

1857
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:30,150
What bet did you lose with me last week,
buddy? I don't know what bet you lost.

1858
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:30,160

 

1859
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,589

Back down to these lows where those

1860
00:45:31,589 --> 00:45:31,599
Back down to these lows where those
 

1861
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,550
Back down to these lows where those
bears just got trapped. Still in range,

1862
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:34,560
bears just got trapped. Still in range,
 

1863
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,550
bears just got trapped. Still in range,
folks. Still in range. So, if you enjoy

1864
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:36,560
folks. Still in range. So, if you enjoy
 

1865
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,910
folks. Still in range. So, if you enjoy
playing edgeto edge, this is your

1866
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:37,920
playing edgeto edge, this is your
 

1867
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,990
playing edgeto edge, this is your
market.

1868
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,000
market.
 

1869
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,230
market.
We've talked about this.

1870
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:42,240
We've talked about this.
 

1871
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,630
We've talked about this.
My uh profit factor goes up by avoiding

1872
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:44,640
My uh profit factor goes up by avoiding
 

1873
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,550
My uh profit factor goes up by avoiding
stuff that I'm

1874
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:46,560
stuff that I'm
 

1875
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,950
stuff that I'm
not as confident in doing.

1876
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:50,960

 

1877
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,270

Uh it's a footprint chart, but this just

1878
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:53,280
Uh it's a footprint chart, but this just
 

1879
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,670
Uh it's a footprint chart, but this just
a footprint chart.

1880
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:55,680
a footprint chart.
 

1881
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,510
a footprint chart.
That's what I see on my Ninja, but you

1882
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:57,520
That's what I see on my Ninja, but you
 

1883
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,430
That's what I see on my Ninja, but you
can have it on here. So, if you come up

1884
00:45:59,430 --> 00:45:59,440
can have it on here. So, if you come up
 

1885
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,990
can have it on here. So, if you come up
to here where you have your bars, you

1886
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:02,000
to here where you have your bars, you
 

1887
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,670
to here where you have your bars, you
come down to volume footprint, you can

1888
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:03,680
come down to volume footprint, you can
 

1889
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,750
come down to volume footprint, you can
put it on.

1890
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:07,760

 

1891
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,270

Uh, it won't look like that. You'll have

1892
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:09,280
Uh, it won't look like that. You'll have
 

1893
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,870
Uh, it won't look like that. You'll have
to change a few things. I'll do a video

1894
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:10,880
to change a few things. I'll do a video
 

1895
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,030
to change a few things. I'll do a video
in the next in the next few weeks for

1896
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:13,040
in the next in the next few weeks for
 

1897
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,750
in the next in the next few weeks for
it.

1898
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:17,760

 

1899
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:39,990

Update my indicator. What do you mean?

1900
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:40,000

 

1901
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,750

market's gone still waiting for this

1902
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:41,760
market's gone still waiting for this
 

1903
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,190
market's gone still waiting for this
10:00 print probably which is coming

1904
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:47,200

 

1905
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,309

was it 10 wholesale wasn't it

1906
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:50,319
was it 10 wholesale wasn't it
 

1907
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:54,390
was it 10 wholesale wasn't it
wholesale yeah we'll see normally I'd

1908
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:54,400
wholesale yeah we'll see normally I'd
 

1909
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,910
wholesale yeah we'll see normally I'd
say unlikely to move the market but I'd

1910
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:55,920
say unlikely to move the market but I'd
 

1911
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,510
say unlikely to move the market but I'd
say recently the market just feels very

1912
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:57,520
say recently the market just feels very
 

1913
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,670
say recently the market just feels very
sensitive

1914
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:01,680

 

1915
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,109

okay es spy can't reclaim 88

1916
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:05,119
okay es spy can't reclaim 88
 

1917
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:09,910
okay es spy can't reclaim 88
keeps failing at 88 the spy. So 87 maybe

1918
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:09,920
keeps failing at 88 the spy. So 87 maybe
 

1919
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,589
keeps failing at 88 the spy. So 87 maybe
was a key level yesterday. What's the

1920
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:11,599
was a key level yesterday. What's the
 

1921
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,309
was a key level yesterday. What's the
five day at? Yeah, 85 is still the

1922
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:14,319
five day at? Yeah, 85 is still the
 

1923
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,670
five day at? Yeah, 85 is still the
level. we lose 88 is potent potential

1924
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:17,680
level. we lose 88 is potent potential
 

1925
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,750
level. we lose 88 is potent potential
for rotation to 85 especially if we

1926
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:19,760
for rotation to 85 especially if we
 

1927
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,910
for rotation to 85 especially if we
start breaking these 87s that pre-market

1928
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:21,920
start breaking these 87s that pre-market
 

1929
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:39,270
start breaking these 87s that pre-market
lows by 8650s

1930
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:39,280

 

1931
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,790

new course hopefully will be out next

1932
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:40,800
new course hopefully will be out next
 

1933
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:47,910
new course hopefully will be out next
week bud um and uh bookmaps in

1934
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:47,920

 

1935
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,670

Okay, starting to see some weakness back

1936
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:49,680
Okay, starting to see some weakness back
 

1937
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,870
Okay, starting to see some weakness back
down into these levels. This is where

1938
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:50,880
down into these levels. This is where
 

1939
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,630
down into these levels. This is where
shorts keep getting stuck. It's current

1940
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:52,640
shorts keep getting stuck. It's current
 

1941
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,430
shorts keep getting stuck. It's current
value area low on the day right right

1942
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:55,440
value area low on the day right right
 

1943
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,950
value area low on the day right right
here. They keep getting stuck into this

1944
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:56,960
here. They keep getting stuck into this
 

1945
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,750
here. They keep getting stuck into this
candle.

1946
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:01,760

 

1947
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,990

I just feel like we want to break down.

1948
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,000
I just feel like we want to break down.
 

1949
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,750
I just feel like we want to break down.
Oh, every time I say it, we do this

1950
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:05,760
Oh, every time I say it, we do this
 

1951
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,190
Oh, every time I say it, we do this
whip. But is there going to be

1952
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:07,200
whip. But is there going to be
 

1953
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,190
whip. But is there going to be
continuation though? We know bears got

1954
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:09,200
continuation though? We know bears got
 

1955
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,630
continuation though? We know bears got
stuck down here at the beginning of the

1956
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:10,640
stuck down here at the beginning of the
 

1957
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,790
stuck down here at the beginning of the
day.

1958
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:14,800

 

1959
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,470

500s is what they're protecting right

1960
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:16,480
500s is what they're protecting right
 

1961
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,870
500s is what they're protecting right
now.

1962
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:18,880
now.
 

1963
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,030
now.
So, new low of day on ES, new low of day

1964
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:21,040
So, new low of day on ES, new low of day
 

1965
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,470
So, new low of day on ES, new low of day
on SPY. Q's holding up. Uh Tesla are

1966
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:24,480
on SPY. Q's holding up. Uh Tesla are
 

1967
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,710
on SPY. Q's holding up. Uh Tesla are
about to come back to VWAP.

1968
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:26,720
about to come back to VWAP.
 

1969
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,910
about to come back to VWAP.
Massive weakness in the spiders here.

1970
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:29,920
Massive weakness in the spiders here.
 

1971
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,270
Massive weakness in the spiders here.
Back down to their higher time frame

1972
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:31,280
Back down to their higher time frame
 

1973
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,430
Back down to their higher time frame
algo. Huge weakness in the spiders. No

1974
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:33,440
algo. Huge weakness in the spiders. No
 

1975
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,270
algo. Huge weakness in the spiders. No
continuation through the lows yet. And

1976
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:35,280
continuation through the lows yet. And
 

1977
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,790
continuation through the lows yet. And
there you go. It's where the bears got

1978
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:36,800
there you go. It's where the bears got
 

1979
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,230
there you go. It's where the bears got
trapped earlier on ENQ. It's gross out

1980
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:40,240
trapped earlier on ENQ. It's gross out
 

1981
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,470
trapped earlier on ENQ. It's gross out
here, folks. So these guys on bit mapap

1982
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:42,480
here, folks. So these guys on bit mapap
 

1983
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,150
here, folks. So these guys on bit mapap
here at 500 is trying to pin this market

1984
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:44,160
here at 500 is trying to pin this market
 

1985
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,309
here at 500 is trying to pin this market
up. Do they get washed in? Buyers just

1986
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:46,319
up. Do they get washed in? Buyers just
 

1987
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:54,950
up. Do they get washed in? Buyers just
stepped in here and failed.

1988
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:54,960

 

1989
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,589

So divergence versus ES. So ES now

1990
00:48:57,589 --> 00:48:57,599
So divergence versus ES. So ES now
 

1991
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,270
So divergence versus ES. So ES now
weaker.

1992
00:48:59,270 --> 00:48:59,280
weaker.
 

1993
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,510
weaker.
Someone explained that to me when you've

1994
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:01,520
Someone explained that to me when you've
 

1995
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,069
Someone explained that to me when you've
got uh chips being weak. But uh

1996
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:04,079
got uh chips being weak. But uh
 

1997
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,150
got uh chips being weak. But uh
apparently Tesla matters this much that

1998
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:06,160
apparently Tesla matters this much that
 

1999
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,349
apparently Tesla matters this much that
we just uh don't respect levels the

2000
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:09,359
we just uh don't respect levels the
 

2001
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,990
we just uh don't respect levels the
right way now on ENQ because one one

2002
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,000
right way now on ENQ because one one
 

2003
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,349
right way now on ENQ because one one
stock wants to go one way and that that

2004
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:15,359
stock wants to go one way and that that
 

2005
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,950
stock wants to go one way and that that
just does all the damage, does it? Come

2006
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:16,960
just does all the damage, does it? Come
 

2007
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,430
just does all the damage, does it? Come
on, man. We can't live in a world where

2008
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:19,440
on, man. We can't live in a world where
 

2009
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,430
on, man. We can't live in a world where
that's the case surely.

2010
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:23,440

 

2011
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,950

So, do they reject here or we just going

2012
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:24,960
So, do they reject here or we just going
 

2013
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,470
So, do they reject here or we just going
to go full reclaim and squeeze these 87s

2014
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:28,480
to go full reclaim and squeeze these 87s
 

2015
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,910
to go full reclaim and squeeze these 87s
now on the spiders like I talked about?

2016
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:29,920
now on the spiders like I talked about?
 

2017
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,750
now on the spiders like I talked about?
They're going to become key. Is there

2018
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:31,760
They're going to become key. Is there
 

2019
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,510
They're going to become key. Is there
any continuation back down to lower day

2020
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:33,520
any continuation back down to lower day
 

2021
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,150
any continuation back down to lower day
currently? No on the ENQ. Shorts cannot

2022
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:36,160

continuation now. They've got the chance
 

2037
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,470
continuation now. They've got the chance
to do it now, but they're going to have

2038
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:50,480
to do it now, but they're going to have
 

2039
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,030
to do it now, but they're going to have
to break these 20s. They break 20s,

2040
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:53,040
to break these 20s. They break 20s,
 

2041
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,630
to break these 20s. They break 20s,
they've got a shot at it. Definitely

they've got a shot at it. Definitely

Okay, you're going to get that move

2118
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:31,680
Okay, you're going to get that move
 

2119
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,990
Okay, you're going to get that move
finally. Just be careful. Don't add late

2120
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:34,000
finally. Just be careful. Don't add late
 

2121
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,630
finally. Just be careful. Don't add late
here. Um, this is where they keep

2122
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:36,640
here. Um, this is where they keep
 

2123
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,150
here. Um, this is where they keep
getting stuck. But I think you're going

2124
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:38,160
getting stuck. But I think you're going
 

2125
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,589
getting stuck. But I think you're going
to get that move to previous day value

2126
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:39,599
to get that move to previous day value
 

2127
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,910
to get that move to previous day value
area low.

2128

00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:51,430
Lots of bears just came flying in here
at low of day again.

2132

2133
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,309

Shelf now developed at 18s. Uh if you're

2134
00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:54,319
Shelf now developed at 18s. Uh if you're
 

2135
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,750
Shelf now developed at 18s. Uh if you're
short in this, you've got to be covering

2136
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:55,760
short in this, you've got to be covering
 

2137
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,349
short in this, you've got to be covering
some as you move into this previous day

2138
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:57,359
some as you move into this previous day
 

2139
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,670
some as you move into this previous day
value. If you get outside of that, you

2140
00:51:59,670 --> 00:51:59,680
value. If you get outside of that, you
 

2141
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,430
value. If you get outside of that, you
can hold a runner, but right now it's uh

2142
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:01,440
can hold a runner, but right now it's uh
 

2143
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,190
can hold a runner, but right now it's uh
hasn't even got to value. So, just be

2144
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:03,200
hasn't even got to value. So, just be
 

2145
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,870
hasn't even got to value. So, just be
smart.

2146
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:04,880

yourself there. Be very careful. Do not
 

2177
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:43,349
yourself there. Be very careful. Do not
get caught offside here.

2178
00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:43,359

 

2179
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:44,710

I'll come back to your questions once

2180
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:44,720
I'll come back to your questions once
 

2181
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,549
I'll come back to your questions once
this is finished, guys. Let me watch the

2182
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:46,559
this is finished, guys. Let me watch the
 

2183
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,510
this is finished, guys. Let me watch the
tape and I see how we act into these key

2184
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:49,520
tape and I see how we act into these key
 

2185
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,870
tape and I see how we act into these key
levels. This is the edge where they've

2186
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:50,880
levels. This is the edge where they've
 

2187
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,549
levels. This is the edge where they've
been bidding off all week and the

2188
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:52,559
been bidding off all week and the
 

2189
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,190
been bidding off all week and the
previous week. But momentum is very

2190
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:55,200
previous week. But momentum is very
 

2191
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,990
previous week. But momentum is very
heavy here right now.

2192
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:00,000

 

2193
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,750

So for me, I wouldn't really want to be

2194
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:01,760
So for me, I wouldn't really want to be
 

2195
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,670
So for me, I wouldn't really want to be
long until unless we start reclaiming

2196
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:03,680
long until unless we start reclaiming
 

2197
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,190
long until unless we start reclaiming
levels. I always talk about that. That's

2198
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:05,200
levels. I always talk about that. That's
 

2199
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,190
levels. I always talk about that. That's
why I don't like trading ranges, right?

2200
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:07,200
why I don't like trading ranges, right?
 

2201
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,470
why I don't like trading ranges, right?
Because I wouldn't want to be long until

2202
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:08,480
Because I wouldn't want to be long until
 

2203
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,150
Because I wouldn't want to be long until
I see reclaim of this and then my risk

2204
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:10,160
I see reclaim of this and then my risk
 

2205
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,309
I see reclaim of this and then my risk
has to be down here. I would stay short

2206
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:12,319
has to be down here. I would stay short
 

2207
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,990
has to be down here. I would stay short
bias until there's a reason for a pivot

2208
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:16,000
bias until there's a reason for a pivot
 

2209
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,990
bias until there's a reason for a pivot
because structurally we're short bias.

2210
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:18,000
because structurally we're short bias.
 

2211
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,069
because structurally we're short bias.
Momentum is downside. We've lost point

2212

Momentum is downside. We've lost point
 

2213
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:21,589
Momentum is downside. We've lost point
of control. We've coming into a key

00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:21,599
of control. We've coming into a key
 

2215
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:22,870
of control. We've coming into a key
levels, no doubt about it. But what

2216
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:22,880
levels, no doubt about it. But what
 

2217
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,309
levels, no doubt about it. But what
happens if we lose this and do this? How

2218
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:24,319
happens if we lose this and do this? How
 

2219
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:25,750
happens if we lose this and do this? How
are you going to risk off it? If you

2220
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:25,760
are you going to risk off it? If you
 

2221
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,230
are you going to risk off it? If you
like trading rotation and you want to

2222
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:28,240
like trading rotation and you want to
 

2223
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,870
like trading rotation and you want to
front run this long,

2224
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:30,880
front run this long,
 

2225
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:38,470
front run this long,
do your thing. It's just not how I play.

2226
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:38,480

 

2227
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,549

I think Spy wants 85s. Like I said, once

2228
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:40,559
I think Spy wants 85s. Like I said, once
 

2229
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,190
I think Spy wants 85s. Like I said, once
we lost 88,

2230
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:43,200
we lost 88,

00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,630
we lost 88,

2239
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,270

It should drop now. Is there any news

2240
00:53:59,270 --> 00:53:59,280
It should drop now. Is there any news
 

2241
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,190
It should drop now. Is there any news
regarding gold? Uh I haven't seen

00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:01,200
regarding gold? Uh I haven't seen
 

2243
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,790
regarding gold? Uh I haven't seen
anything regarding gold. It would just

2244
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:02,800
anything regarding gold. It would just
 

2245
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,470
anything regarding gold. It would just
be following silver. Silver's at all

2246
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:04,480
be following silver. Silver's at all
 

2247
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,190
be following silver. Silver's at all
time highs. Uh we'll be gold. Remember,

2248
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:07,200
time highs. Uh we'll be gold. Remember,
 

2249
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,030
time highs. Uh we'll be gold. Remember,
gold is the hedge to what's going on in

2250

gold is the hedge to what's going on in
 

2251
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,829
gold is the hedge to what's going on in
the economy. All right. So, we've got to

2252
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:11,839
the economy. All right. So, we've got to
 

2253
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:14,069
the economy. All right. So, we've got to
watch that JPY carry trade that they

2254
00:54:14,069 --> 00:54:14,079
watch that JPY carry trade that they
 

2255
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,589
watch that JPY carry trade that they
will be positioning themselves in gold

2256
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:15,599
will be positioning themselves in gold
 

2257
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,990
will be positioning themselves in gold
early in case that goes disastrously

2258
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:18,000
early in case that goes disastrously
 

2259
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,910
early in case that goes disastrously
wrong.

2260
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:19,920
wrong.
 

2261
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,270
wrong.
Still think you've got more downside

2262
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:21,280
Still think you've got more downside
 

2263
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,950
Still think you've got more downside
here at the moment. Retesting that low.

2264
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:22,960
here at the moment. Retesting that low.
 

2265
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,950
here at the moment. Retesting that low.
No breakdown yet, but it feels like we

2266
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:24,960
No breakdown yet, but it feels like we
 

2267
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,190
No breakdown yet, but it feels like we
want more downside.

2268
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:27,200
want more downside.
 

2269
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,790
want more downside.
It feels very, very heavy at this point.

2270
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:30,800
It feels very, very heavy at this point.
 

2271
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,549
It feels very, very heavy at this point.
Very, very, very heavy. I think you're

2272
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:32,559
Very, very, very heavy. I think you're
 

2273
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,230
Very, very, very heavy. I think you're
going to get a flush here. There's that

2274
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:34,240
going to get a flush here. There's that
 

2275
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,910
going to get a flush here. There's that
little flush. They're trying. Shorts are

2276
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:35,920
little flush. They're trying. Shorts are
 

2277
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,430
little flush. They're trying. Shorts are
getting starting to compiling in here.

2278
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:37,440
getting starting to compiling in here.
 

2279
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,630
getting starting to compiling in here.
If they don't get their way soon, they

2280
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:38,640
If they don't get their way soon, they
 

2281
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:45,589
If they don't get their way soon, they
will get caught here.

2282
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:45,599

 

2283
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,150

So there's both areas of value taken and

2284
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:48,160
So there's both areas of value taken and
 

2285
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,589
So there's both areas of value taken and
the next level would be previous day

2286
00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:49,599
the next level would be previous day
 

2287
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,150
the next level would be previous day
low. So runners now would be here. We

2288
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:52,160
low. So runners now would be here. We
 

2289
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,309
low. So runners now would be here. We
can add back on, right? We can add back

2290
00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:54,319
can add back on, right? We can add back
 

2291
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:56,150
can add back on, right? We can add back
on if we do something like this and stay

2292
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:56,160
on if we do something like this and stay
 

2293
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,069
on if we do something like this and stay
heavy. We can play this move otherwise

2294
00:54:58,069 --> 00:54:58,079
heavy. We can play this move otherwise
 

2295
00:54:58,079 --> 00:54:59,430
heavy. We can play this move otherwise
your runners. Here comes the flush that

2296
00:54:59,430 --> 00:54:59,440
your runners. Here comes the flush that
 

2297
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,190
your runners. Here comes the flush that
I just talked about finally. So I say it

2298
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:01,200
I just talked about finally. So I say it
 

2299
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,430
I just talked about finally. So I say it
wouldn't be long based momentum is very

2300
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:03,440
wouldn't be long based momentum is very
 

2301
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,549
wouldn't be long based momentum is very
uh heavy right now. If we reclaim and

2302
00:55:06,549 --> 00:55:06,559
uh heavy right now. If we reclaim and
 

2303
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:07,750
uh heavy right now. If we reclaim and
trap shorts, you can think about the

2304
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:07,760
trap shorts, you can think about the
 

2305
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,430
trap shorts, you can think about the
long or that's how I would play it. If

2306
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:09,440
long or that's how I would play it. If
 

2307
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,030
long or that's how I would play it. If
we trap shorts and reclaim, you could

2308
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:11,040
we trap shorts and reclaim, you could
 

2309
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,030
we trap shorts and reclaim, you could
think about the long, but structurally,

2310
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:13,040
think about the long, but structurally,
 

2311
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,630
think about the long, but structurally,
momentum wise, we're trading downside.

2312
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:16,640
momentum wise, we're trading downside.
 

2313
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:22,549
momentum wise, we're trading downside.
Tesla's now lost VW up, folks.

2314
00:55:22,549 --> 00:55:22,559

 

2315
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,470

Still downside. Still coming downside

2316
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:24,480
Still downside. Still coming downside
 

2317
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,630
Still downside. Still coming downside
right now. So, if you retest value and

2318
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:26,640
right now. So, if you retest value and
 

2319
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,549
right now. So, if you retest value and
and stay heavy here, there's maybe an

2320
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:28,559
and stay heavy here, there's maybe an
 

2321
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,870
and stay heavy here, there's maybe an
add-on opportunity. Didn't even get up

2322
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:30,880
add-on opportunity. Didn't even get up
 

2323
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,670
add-on opportunity. Didn't even get up
to value there. Or did it tapped it

2324
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:33,680
to value there. Or did it tapped it
 

2325
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,190
to value there. Or did it tapped it
actually. That's a lie, Alex. It

2326
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:35,200
actually. That's a lie, Alex. It
 

2327
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,430
actually. That's a lie, Alex. It
actually tapped value, right? So, there

2328
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:37,440
actually tapped value, right? So, there
 

2329
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,030
actually tapped value, right? So, there
might be an add-on opportunity here. You

2330
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:39,040
might be an add-on opportunity here. You
 

2331
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,549
might be an add-on opportunity here. You
do not want to see a reclaim of these

2332

do not want to see a reclaim of these
 

2333
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,710
do not want to see a reclaim of these
levels. If it reclaim these levels, you

00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:42,720
levels. If it reclaim these levels, you
 

2335

00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:04,640
we're going to start wicking out
 

2351
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,710
we're going to start wicking out
a lot of liquidity.

And if we lose 300s, we're looking for a
move, doesn't have to be today, into two

2358
00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:12,559
move, doesn't have to be today, into two

Maybe easier to join after 9:45 10:00
 

2421
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,430
Maybe easier to join after 9:45 10:00
just like yesterday. All right. Let them

Where was 9:45 10:00? There was 9:45.
That was the first opportunity. Didn't

2432
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:46,559
That was the first opportunity. Didn't
 

2433
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,030
That was the first opportunity. Didn't
work. There was 10:00. Did work. All

00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:52,960
wait. If they reject this, maybe they
 

2439
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,470
wait. If they reject this, maybe they
come for this. If they reject this,

2440
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:54,480
come for this. If they reject this,
 

2441
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,309
come for this. If they reject this,
right, this is an area I really want to

00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:56,319
right, this is an area I really want to
 

2443
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:58,470

God, I can't draw point of control on a

00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:04,160
God, I can't draw point of control on a
 

2449
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,349
God, I can't draw point of control on a
weekly. All right. I really want to see

weekly. All right. I really want to see
 

2451
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,190
weekly. All right. I really want to see
that traded into, but doesn't have to be

00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:07,200
that traded into, but doesn't have to be
 

2453
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,750
that traded into, but doesn't have to be
today. Look below and fail will be this.

2454
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:09,760
today. Look below and fail will be this.
 

2455
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,510
today. Look below and fail will be this.
Okay, look below and fail be this. I

2456
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:11,520
Okay, look below and fail be this. I
 

2457
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,270
Okay, look below and fail be this. I
wouldn't really want to long. We're

2458
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:13,280
wouldn't really want to long. We're
 

2459
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,190
wouldn't really want to long. We're
going to do a look below and fail. I

2460
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:15,200
going to do a look below and fail. I
 

2461
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,470
going to do a look below and fail. I
want to see this. And I really want to

2462
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:16,480
want to see this. And I really want to
 

2463
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,069
want to see this. And I really want to
see us claim value on the day. And then

2464
00:58:18,069 --> 00:58:18,079
see us claim value on the day. And then
 

2465
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:21,349
see us claim value on the day. And then
there's a trade up to here.

2466
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:21,359
there's a trade up to here.
 

2467
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:22,950
there's a trade up to here.
All the time we're outside of this range

2468
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:22,960
All the time we're outside of this range
 

2469
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,109
All the time we're outside of this range
though, there is a possible trend. Okay,

2470
00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:25,119
though, there is a possible trend. Okay,
 

2471
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,589

there's a possible trend.
 

2473
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:29,109
there's a possible trend.
Let's do this. Make this simple. There's

2474
00:58:29,109 --> 00:58:29,119
Let's do this. Make this simple. There's
 

2475
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,270
Let's do this. Make this simple. There's
a possible trend if we stay heavy versus

2476
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:31,280
a possible trend if we stay heavy versus
 

2477
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,270
a possible trend if we stay heavy versus
this. If we reclaim it, it is a look

2478
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:33,280
this. If we reclaim it, it is a look
 

2479
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:40,390
this. If we reclaim it, it is a look
below and fail.

2480
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:40,400

 

2481
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,390

Big W. Yeah, W's in chat if you got that

2482
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:42,400
Big W. Yeah, W's in chat if you got that
 

2483
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,910
Big W. Yeah, W's in chat if you got that
with me. I'm trying to be a bit calmer

2484
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:43,920
with me. I'm trying to be a bit calmer
 

2485
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,630
with me. I'm trying to be a bit calmer
recently. Some of you know I've got some

2486
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:46,640
recently. Some of you know I've got some
 

2487
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,390
recently. Some of you know I've got some
really nasty stuff going on off the

2488
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:48,400
really nasty stuff going on off the
 

2489
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,910
really nasty stuff going on off the
street, off the uh screens at the

2490
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:49,920
street, off the uh screens at the
 

2491
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,349
street, off the uh screens at the
moment. So, it's definitely affected my

2492
00:58:51,349 --> 00:58:51,359
moment. So, it's definitely affected my
 

2493
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,109
moment. So, it's definitely affected my
attitudes recently. Like I said, I

2494
00:58:53,109 --> 00:58:53,119
attitudes recently. Like I said, I
 

2495
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,950
attitudes recently. Like I said, I
apologize. I'm only human. I can only

2496
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:54,960
apologize. I'm only human. I can only
 

2497
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,190
apologize. I'm only human. I can only
deal with so much. When family matters

2498
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:57,200
deal with so much. When family matters
 

2499
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,190
deal with so much. When family matters
get bad, it's very hard to stay calm

2500
00:58:59,190 --> 00:58:59,200
get bad, it's very hard to stay calm
 

2501
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,750
get bad, it's very hard to stay calm
here. If you got that with me, really

2502
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:01,760
here. If you got that with me, really
 

2503
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:07,030
here. If you got that with me, really
nice. It's laid out nice and early.

2504
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:07,040

 

2505
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,549

Starting to see a rejection of this red

2506
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:08,559
Starting to see a rejection of this red
 

2507
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,950
Starting to see a rejection of this red
box

2508
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:10,960
box
 

2509
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,549
box
and bulls did come in there and didn't

2510
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:12,559
and bulls did come in there and didn't
 

2511
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,470
and bulls did come in there and didn't
get that way. So, we have a passive

2512
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:14,480
get that way. So, we have a passive
 

2513
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,910
get that way. So, we have a passive
seller up here, which is what we want to

2514
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:15,920
seller up here, which is what we want to
 

2515
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,670
seller up here, which is what we want to
see. So your target if you're going to

2516
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:17,680
see. So your target if you're going to
 

2517
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,109
see. So your target if you're going to
rehit this or if you're holding your

2518
00:59:19,109 --> 00:59:19,119
rehit this or if you're holding your
 

2519
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:23,349
rehit this or if you're holding your
runners, your target now is to here.

2520
00:59:23,349 --> 00:59:23,359
runners, your target now is to here.
 

2521
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,230
runners, your target now is to here.
Okay, that's your target.

2522
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:26,240
Okay, that's your target.
 

2523
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,150
Okay, that's your target.
If they reclaim this, I would be risk

2524
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:28,160
If they reclaim this, I would be risk
 

2525
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,150
If they reclaim this, I would be risk
off shortwise. Okay, if they reclaim

2526
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:30,160
off shortwise. Okay, if they reclaim
 

2527
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,069
off shortwise. Okay, if they reclaim
this,

2528
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:32,079
this,
 

2529
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:35,190
this,
that is the potential long. But uh I

2530
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:35,200
that is the potential long. But uh I
 

2531
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,670
that is the potential long. But uh I
would rather stay heavy and short on

2532
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:37,680
would rather stay heavy and short on
 

2533
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,109
would rather stay heavy and short on
this today. All the time it's going to

2534
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:39,119
this today. All the time it's going to
 

2535
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,349
this today. All the time it's going to
stay heavy.

2536
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:41,359
stay heavy.
 

2537
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,430
stay heavy.
Have we traded 85 yet? We're not at 85

2538
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:43,440
Have we traded 85 yet? We're not at 85
 

2539
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,109
Have we traded 85 yet? We're not at 85
yet. low of the day on SPY's 8550.

2540
00:59:47,109 --> 00:59:47,119
yet. low of the day on SPY's 8550.
 

2541
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:48,710
yet. low of the day on SPY's 8550.
Like we said, once we lost 88, it's

2542
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:48,720
Like we said, once we lost 88, it's
 

2543
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,710
Like we said, once we lost 88, it's
probably going to go 85. Only reason I

2544
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:50,720
probably going to go 85. Only reason I
 

2545
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,230
probably going to go 85. Only reason I
said that is just because those are the

2546
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:52,240
said that is just because those are the
 

2547
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,549
said that is just because those are the
gamma levels. I normally don't look at

2548
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:54,559
gamma levels. I normally don't look at
 

2549
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:57,829
gamma levels. I normally don't look at
those, but this market the last definite

2550
00:59:57,829 --> 00:59:57,839
those, but this market the last definite
 

2551
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:00,549
those, but this market the last definite
few weeks has just been all about those

2552
01:00:00,549 --> 01:00:00,559
few weeks has just been all about those
 

2553
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:03,030
few weeks has just been all about those
gamma levels on SPY. I don't know why.

2554
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:03,040
gamma levels on SPY. I don't know why.
 

2555
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,470
gamma levels on SPY. I don't know why.
Well, I do know why. It's because it's

2556
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:04,480
Well, I do know why. It's because it's
 

2557
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,670
Well, I do know why. It's because it's
all about the hedge. They are very

2558
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:05,680
all about the hedge. They are very
 

2559
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,030
all about the hedge. They are very
concerned about what's going on in the

2560
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:07,040
concerned about what's going on in the
 

2561
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,109
concerned about what's going on in the
economy, as am I. So, they're hedging

2562
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:09,119
economy, as am I. So, they're hedging
 

2563
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:16,069
economy, as am I. So, they're hedging
against it using options.

2564
01:00:16,069 --> 01:00:16,079

 

2565
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,750

you want to catch a Vshape. The only

2566
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:17,760
you want to catch a Vshape. The only
 

2567
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,190
you want to catch a Vshape. The only
thing I'd say, Peter,

2568
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:21,200
thing I'd say, Peter,
 

2569
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,710
thing I'd say, Peter,
um, traders are getting very, how can I

2570
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:24,720
um, traders are getting very, how can I
 

2571
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,750
um, traders are getting very, how can I
put this? Trying to think of a way to

2572
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:25,760
put this? Trying to think of a way to
 

2573
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,190
put this? Trying to think of a way to
teach this. When traders get very used

2574
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:27,200
teach this. When traders get very used
 

2575
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,789
teach this. When traders get very used
to one environment, the market will

2576
01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:28,799
to one environment, the market will
 

2577
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,710
to one environment, the market will
often go the other way, right? So, do

2578
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:30,720
often go the other way, right? So, do
 

2579
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,829
often go the other way, right? So, do
you remember earlier I said traders are

2580
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:31,839
you remember earlier I said traders are
 

2581
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:33,670
you remember earlier I said traders are
getting so used to trading edge to edge,

2582
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:33,680
getting so used to trading edge to edge,
 

2583
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,430
getting so used to trading edge to edge,
edge to edge, edge to edge. Think about

2584
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:35,440
edge to edge, edge to edge. Think about
 

2585
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,870
edge to edge, edge to edge. Think about
how many traders are buying this right

2586
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:36,880
how many traders are buying this right
 

2587
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,150
how many traders are buying this right
now being like, "Well, we're going to go

2588
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:38,160
now being like, "Well, we're going to go
 

2589
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,829
now being like, "Well, we're going to go
oh well, we're going to go in recovery

2590
01:00:39,829 --> 01:00:39,839
oh well, we're going to go in recovery
 

2591
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:41,589
oh well, we're going to go in recovery
because yesterday we did a Vshape for

2592
01:00:41,589 --> 01:00:41,599
because yesterday we did a Vshape for
 

2593
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,910
because yesterday we did a Vshape for
example, right? Or yes, yesterday we did

2594
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:43,920
example, right? Or yes, yesterday we did
 

2595
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,870
example, right? Or yes, yesterday we did
a a Vshape off here or whatever, right?

2596
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:46,880
a a Vshape off here or whatever, right?
 

2597
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,390
a a Vshape off here or whatever, right?
Everyone's going to try and look for the

2598
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:48,400
Everyone's going to try and look for the
 

2599
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,069
Everyone's going to try and look for the
same thing. It's habit. Look for that

2600
01:00:50,069 --> 01:00:50,079
same thing. It's habit. Look for that
 

2601
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,950
same thing. It's habit. Look for that
fade. What happens when we try it for

2602
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:52,960
fade. What happens when we try it for
 

2603
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,630
fade. What happens when we try it for
two weeks in a row and then it goes [\h__\h]

2604
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:54,640
two weeks in a row and then it goes [\h__\h]
 

2605
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,190
two weeks in a row and then it goes [\h__\h]
you, right? That's my concern right now.

2606
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:57,200
you, right? That's my concern right now.
 

2607
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,789
you, right? That's my concern right now.
These are not fresh levels. Same as

2608
01:00:58,789 --> 01:00:58,799
These are not fresh levels. Same as
 

2609
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,670
These are not fresh levels. Same as
this. That's not fresh. Think about

2610
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:01,680
this. That's not fresh. Think about
 

2611
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,030
this. That's not fresh. Think about
we're just going to go to an hourly to

2612
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:03,040
we're just going to go to an hourly to
 

2613
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,710
we're just going to go to an hourly to
make try and teach this so it makes

2614
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:04,720
make try and teach this so it makes
 

2615
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,309
make try and teach this so it makes
sense.

2616
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:06,319
sense.
 

2617
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:10,150
sense.
All right, this is

2618
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:10,160
All right, this is
 

2619
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,030
All right, this is
one, two, three times down here. Maybe

2620
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:13,040
one, two, three times down here. Maybe
 

2621
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,630
one, two, three times down here. Maybe
it came earlier. We can include that

2622
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:14,640
it came earlier. We can include that
 

2623
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,470
it came earlier. We can include that
four times. We think about the high one,

2624
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:16,480
four times. We think about the high one,
 

2625
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,549
four times. We think about the high one,
two, three, four times. Right? These are

2626
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:18,559
two, three, four times. Right? These are
 

2627
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:20,630
two, three, four times. Right? These are
not fresh. So if that's supply, well,

2628
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:20,640
not fresh. So if that's supply, well,
 

2629
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,069
not fresh. So if that's supply, well,
we've chewed through it. And if this is

2630
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:22,079
we've chewed through it. And if this is
 

2631
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,430
we've chewed through it. And if this is
demand, well, we've probably chewed

2632
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:23,440
demand, well, we've probably chewed
 

2633
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,109
demand, well, we've probably chewed
through it. There won't be that many

2634
01:01:25,109 --> 01:01:25,119
through it. There won't be that many
 

2635
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,789
through it. There won't be that many
bids left there. There won't be that

2636
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:26,799
bids left there. There won't be that
 

2637
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:29,270
bids left there. There won't be that
many sales left there at some point. All

2638
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:29,280
many sales left there at some point. All
 

2639
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,349
many sales left there at some point. All
right. Once the market's ready, that

2640
01:01:31,349 --> 01:01:31,359
right. Once the market's ready, that
 

2641
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:33,109
right. Once the market's ready, that
will happen. Once the market's ready,

2642
01:01:33,109 --> 01:01:33,119
will happen. Once the market's ready,
 

2643
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:34,789
will happen. Once the market's ready,
that will happen. That's all I'm saying.

2644
01:01:34,789 --> 01:01:34,799
that will happen. That's all I'm saying.
 

2645
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:36,309
that will happen. That's all I'm saying.
I don't I'm not trying to say it has to

2646
01:01:36,309 --> 01:01:36,319
I don't I'm not trying to say it has to
 

2647
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:38,789
I don't I'm not trying to say it has to
be today. But the market has a nasty

2648
01:01:38,789 --> 01:01:38,799
be today. But the market has a nasty
 

2649
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:42,309
be today. But the market has a nasty
habit of luring you in to a pattern

2650
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:42,319
habit of luring you in to a pattern
 

2651
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,470
habit of luring you in to a pattern
which like I've seen this I've seen this

2652
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:44,480
which like I've seen this I've seen this
 

2653
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,549
which like I've seen this I've seen this
four times this week. I've seen it four

2654
01:01:46,549 --> 01:01:46,559
four times this week. I've seen it four
 

2655
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,549
four times this week. I've seen it four
times this week and on the fifth time it

2656
01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:48,559
times this week and on the fifth time it
 

2657
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:51,270
times this week and on the fifth time it
goes no. Right? So just be aware of

2658
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:51,280
goes no. Right? So just be aware of
 

2659
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,430
goes no. Right? So just be aware of
that. At the moment momentum is he all

2660
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:53,440
that. At the moment momentum is he all
 

2661
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,270
that. At the moment momentum is he all
I'm going to say is what's happening.

2662
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:55,280
I'm going to say is what's happening.
 

2663
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,589
I'm going to say is what's happening.
Momentum is heavy. We're outside value

2664
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:57,599
Momentum is heavy. We're outside value
 

2665
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,430
Momentum is heavy. We're outside value
on the day. We're outside value on the

2666
01:01:59,430 --> 01:01:59,440
on the day. We're outside value on the
 

2667
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,270
on the day. We're outside value on the
week. We're outside value on the

2668
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:01,280
week. We're outside value on the
 

2669
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,870
week. We're outside value on the
previous day. We're outside value on the

2670
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:02,880
previous day. We're outside value on the
 

2671
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,710
previous day. We're outside value on the
previous week. This is a potential

2672
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:04,720
previous week. This is a potential
 

2673
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,270
previous week. This is a potential
momentum play lower all the time this is

2674
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:07,280
momentum play lower all the time this is
 

2675
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,510
momentum play lower all the time this is
being protected. That's all I know.

2676
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:09,520
being protected. That's all I know.
 

2677
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,670
being protected. That's all I know.
That's what I know. That's what it's

2678
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:11,680
That's what I know. That's what it's
 

2679
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,670
That's what I know. That's what it's
telling me. This is momentum lower all

2680
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:13,680
telling me. This is momentum lower all
 

2681
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,510
telling me. This is momentum lower all
the time it's being protected. This is

2682
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:15,520
the time it's being protected. This is
 

2683
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,829
the time it's being protected. This is
not a long not a long. That's all I know

2684
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:19,839
not a long not a long. That's all I know
 

2685
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:21,430
not a long not a long. That's all I know
right now. I can only tell you what I

2686
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:21,440
right now. I can only tell you what I
 

2687
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,030
right now. I can only tell you what I
can see right in front of me right now.

2688
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:23,040
can see right in front of me right now.
 

2689
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:32,549
can see right in front of me right now.
Hopefully that makes sense.

2690
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:32,559

 

2691
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:37,510

Where did I enter? Uh I came in

2692
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:37,520
Where did I enter? Uh I came in
 

2693
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,030
Where did I enter? Uh I came in
up on Ninja.

2694
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:41,040

 

2695
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,829

Uh we had one trade I took one trade

2696
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:43,839
Uh we had one trade I took one trade
 

2697
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:48,470
Uh we had one trade I took one trade
earlier into sort of 40s 540s downside.

2698
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:48,480
earlier into sort of 40s 540s downside.
 

2699
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,270
earlier into sort of 40s 540s downside.
Then I had that first attempt

2700
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:51,280
Then I had that first attempt
 

2701
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,750
Then I had that first attempt
uh for the breakdown

2702
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:53,760
uh for the breakdown
 

2703
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,390
uh for the breakdown
and that failed. So I was short around

2704
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:56,400
and that failed. So I was short around
 

2705
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,630
and that failed. So I was short around
sort of the

2706
01:02:58,630 --> 01:02:58,640
sort of the
 

2707
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,630
sort of the
20s and stuff and knocked out break

2708
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:00,640
20s and stuff and knocked out break
 

2709
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,190
20s and stuff and knocked out break
even. And then the next time I saw the

2710
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:03,200
even. And then the next time I saw the
 

2711
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,190
even. And then the next time I saw the
momentum start to come in, I started to

2712
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:05,200
momentum start to come in, I started to
 

2713
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,069
momentum start to come in, I started to
hit it at around 88

2714
01:03:08,069 --> 01:03:08,079
hit it at around 88
 

2715
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:10,950
hit it at around 88
93 and then I added heavy on the break

2716
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:10,960
93 and then I added heavy on the break
 

2717
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,789
93 and then I added heavy on the break
of 67.

2718
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:12,799
of 67.
 

2719
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:14,789
of 67.
And then my cover point, my lowest cover

2720
01:03:14,789 --> 01:03:14,799
And then my cover point, my lowest cover
 

2721
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:17,510
And then my cover point, my lowest cover
point there was 17s. Lowest cover point

2722
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:17,520
point there was 17s. Lowest cover point
 

2723
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:23,190
point there was 17s. Lowest cover point
was 17s.

2724
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:23,200

 

2725
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,109

Can you explain the chart without the

2726
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:25,119
Can you explain the chart without the
 

2727
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,630
Can you explain the chart without the
indicators? I don't see nothing.

2728
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:28,640
indicators? I don't see nothing.
 

2729
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,510
indicators? I don't see nothing.
What do you mean? What? Without this? Is

2730
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:31,520
What do you mean? What? Without this? Is
 

2731
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,150
What do you mean? What? Without this? Is
this what you mean? Which indicators? I

2732
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:34,160
this what you mean? Which indicators? I
 

2733
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,710
this what you mean? Which indicators? I
mean, this is just showing you momentum,

2734
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:36,720
mean, this is just showing you momentum,
 

2735
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,510
mean, this is just showing you momentum,
right? So, this this is the flow zones

2736
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:39,520
right? So, this this is the flow zones
 

2737
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,109
right? So, this this is the flow zones
are just telling you momentum. Right

2738
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:41,119
are just telling you momentum. Right
 

2739
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:43,029
are just telling you momentum. Right
now, we're in a cell. Lower highs, lower

2740
01:03:43,029 --> 01:03:43,039
now, we're in a cell. Lower highs, lower
 

2741
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:44,710
now, we're in a cell. Lower highs, lower
lows, lower highs, lower lows. We are

2742
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:44,720
lows, lower highs, lower lows. We are
 

2743
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,430
lows, lower highs, lower lows. We are
protecting the flow zones. All right.

2744
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:47,440
protecting the flow zones. All right.
 

2745
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,029
protecting the flow zones. All right.
So, this should be telling you, I don't

2746
01:03:49,029 --> 01:03:49,039
So, this should be telling you, I don't
 

2747
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:50,549
So, this should be telling you, I don't
This is why I built this. I don't want a

2748
01:03:50,549 --> 01:03:50,559
This is why I built this. I don't want a
 

2749
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:52,069
This is why I built this. I don't want a
long. I'm not going to battle against

2750
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:52,079
long. I'm not going to battle against
 

2751
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,150
long. I'm not going to battle against
this. It's another reason why I don't

2752
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:54,160
this. It's another reason why I don't
 

2753
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,069
this. It's another reason why I don't
like trading trading range rotations

2754
01:03:56,069 --> 01:03:56,079
like trading trading range rotations
 

2755
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:57,829
like trading trading range rotations
because if we reclaim this, all right

2756
01:03:57,829 --> 01:03:57,839
because if we reclaim this, all right
 

2757
01:03:57,839 --> 01:03:59,670
because if we reclaim this, all right
then and it does do a Vshape. Let's say

2758
01:03:59,670 --> 01:03:59,680
then and it does do a Vshape. Let's say
 

2759
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,510
then and it does do a Vshape. Let's say
it does do a Vshape, these will take

2760
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:01,520
it does do a Vshape, these will take
 

2761
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,029
it does do a Vshape, these will take
time to catch up and I'll be looking for

2762
01:04:03,029 --> 01:04:03,039
time to catch up and I'll be looking for
 

2763
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,549
time to catch up and I'll be looking for
a lower high that might not come in and

2764
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:04,559
a lower high that might not come in and
 

2765
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:12,390
a lower high that might not come in and
might just go flying. But

2766
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:12,400

 

2767
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,950

I I've made money. Don't worry. Don't

2768
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:14,960
I I've made money. Don't worry. Don't
 

2769
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,430
I I've made money. Don't worry. Don't
worry. I've uh I've pounded into this.

2770
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:17,440
worry. I've uh I've pounded into this.
 

2771
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,750
worry. I've uh I've pounded into this.
Don't worry. I'm I'm good for a Friday.

2772
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:19,760
Don't worry. I'm I'm good for a Friday.
 

2773
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,710
Don't worry. I'm I'm good for a Friday.
I size down on Fridays anyway. I'm good.

2774
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:22,720
I size down on Fridays anyway. I'm good.
 

2775
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,470
I size down on Fridays anyway. I'm good.
And if it gives me another setup, I'll

2776
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:24,480
And if it gives me another setup, I'll
 

2777
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,710
And if it gives me another setup, I'll
take another setup. Don't you worry.

2778
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:28,720
take another setup. Don't you worry.
 

2779
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,990
take another setup. Don't you worry.
All right. Previous day lows your

2780
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:30,000
All right. Previous day lows your
 

2781
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,349
All right. Previous day lows your
target.

2782
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:33,359

 

2783
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,510

That that red box holding up really

2784
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:35,520
That that red box holding up really
 

2785
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,990
That that red box holding up really
nice. I'm currently out of this. I

2786
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:38,000
nice. I'm currently out of this. I
 

2787
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,430
nice. I'm currently out of this. I
didn't add in while I was teaching. So

2788
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:39,440
didn't add in while I was teaching. So
 

2789
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,270
didn't add in while I was teaching. So
maybe that's what you mean.

2790
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:43,280

 

2791
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,510

Watch spying to 85s. Okay. Watch spying

2792
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:45,520
Watch spying to 85s. Okay. Watch spying
 

2793
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,150
Watch spying to 85s. Okay. Watch spying
to 85s. you if you 85 will be an under

2794
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:48,160
to 85s. you if you 85 will be an under
 

2795
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,549
to 85s. you if you 85 will be an under
over you lose 85 on spy 82 is the next

2796
01:04:50,549 --> 01:04:50,559
over you lose 85 on spy 82 is the next
 

2797
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:52,390
over you lose 85 on spy 82 is the next
stop you lose that 80 is the next stop

2798
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:52,400
stop you lose that 80 is the next stop
 

2799
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,710
stop you lose that 80 is the next stop
there wasn't much gamma to the downside

2800
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:54,720
there wasn't much gamma to the downside
 

2801
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,349
there wasn't much gamma to the downside
I can't imagine spy going underneath 82s

2802
01:04:57,349 --> 01:04:57,359
I can't imagine spy going underneath 82s
 

2803
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,029
I can't imagine spy going underneath 82s
because the whole market will lose a bid

2804
01:04:59,029 --> 01:04:59,039
because the whole market will lose a bid
 

2805
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:01,750
because the whole market will lose a bid
if it does that so

2806
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:01,760
if it does that so
 

2807
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,910
if it does that so

down. That would be SSR. Went over 10%

2848
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:53,680
down. That would be SSR. Went over 10%
 

2849
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:57,589
down. That would be SSR. Went over 10%
down. Oh, Oracle is also SSR today. That

2850
01:05:57,589 --> 01:05:57,599
down. Oh, Oracle is also SSR today. That
 

2851
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:59,349
down. Oh, Oracle is also SSR today. That
was well over 10% down in yesterday.

2852
01:05:59,349 --> 01:05:59,359
was well over 10% down in yesterday.
 

2853
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:04,150
was well over 10% down in yesterday.
Right. All right. Found uh no, Oracle

2854
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:04,160
Right. All right. Found uh no, Oracle
 

2855
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,150
Right. All right. Found uh no, Oracle
was SSR yesterday. Found a bid. Um so

2856
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:08,160
was SSR yesterday. Found a bid. Um so
 

2857
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,230
was SSR yesterday. Found a bid. Um so
yeah, some weakness across the board in

2858
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:10,240
yeah, some weakness across the board in
 

2859
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,870
yeah, some weakness across the board in
tech. Um, the reason we took a bit

2860
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:12,880
tech. Um, the reason we took a bit
 

2861
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,069
tech. Um, the reason we took a bit
longer to flush than the rest of the

2862
01:06:14,069 --> 01:06:14,079
longer to flush than the rest of the
 

2863
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:17,510
longer to flush than the rest of the
market was literally Tesla holding it up

2864
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:17,520
market was literally Tesla holding it up
 

2865
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,510
market was literally Tesla holding it up
because we got to remember the mag are

2866
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:19,520
because we got to remember the mag are
 

2867
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,349
because we got to remember the mag are
60% of the cues, right? Or even more

2868
01:06:21,349 --> 01:06:21,359
60% of the cues, right? Or even more
 

2869
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:22,470
60% of the cues, right? Or even more
than that now. So, when you have

2870
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:22,480
than that now. So, when you have
 

2871
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,750
than that now. So, when you have
something with relative strength, it

2872
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:23,760
something with relative strength, it
 

2873
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,589
something with relative strength, it
just holds it up. So, we've talked about

2874
01:06:25,589 --> 01:06:25,599
just holds it up. So, we've talked about
 

2875
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:28,069
just holds it up. So, we've talked about
this the last few days on stream. It

2876
01:06:28,069 --> 01:06:28,079
this the last few days on stream. It
 

2877
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,950
this the last few days on stream. It
gets really easy with the cues when the

2878
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:30,960
gets really easy with the cues when the
 

2879
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,950
gets really easy with the cues when the
whole of the M go red. Like, if Tesla if

2880
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:32,960
whole of the M go red. Like, if Tesla if
 

2881
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,950
whole of the M go red. Like, if Tesla if
Tesla was in a red day today, guys, we'd

2882
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:34,960
Tesla was in a red day today, guys, we'd
 

2883
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,349
Tesla was in a red day today, guys, we'd
be [\h__\h] puking. We'd be absolutely

2884
01:06:37,349 --> 01:06:37,359
be [\h__\h] puking. We'd be absolutely
 

2885
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:44,789
be [\h__\h] puking. We'd be absolutely
tanking.

2886
01:06:44,789 --> 01:06:44,799

 

2887
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:46,309

Okay. So, you can see they're trying to

2888
01:06:46,309 --> 01:06:46,319
Okay. So, you can see they're trying to
 

2889
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:49,190
Okay. So, you can see they're trying to
walk this down. There's a seller at 500.

2890
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:49,200
walk this down. There's a seller at 500.
 

2891
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,589
walk this down. There's a seller at 500.
He's stayed up there at 500. He's moved

2892
01:06:51,589 --> 01:06:51,599
He's stayed up there at 500. He's moved
 

2893
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:53,589
He's stayed up there at 500. He's moved
some size to 480. Didn't get filled.

2894
01:06:53,589 --> 01:06:53,599
some size to 480. Didn't get filled.
 

2895
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,270
some size to 480. Didn't get filled.
Tried to move down to 460. He's now

2896
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:55,280
Tried to move down to 460. He's now
 

2897
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,029
Tried to move down to 460. He's now
trying to chase it a little bit into

2898
01:06:57,029 --> 01:06:57,039
trying to chase it a little bit into
 

2899
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:03,190
trying to chase it a little bit into
440s, 455. Juggling around.

2900
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:03,200

 

2901
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,510

The last two candles before this one

2902
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:05,520
The last two candles before this one
 

2903
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,589
The last two candles before this one
were positive delta. If we cannot break

2904
01:07:07,589 --> 01:07:07,599
were positive delta. If we cannot break
 

2905
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,589
were positive delta. If we cannot break
above the high of that, those buyers

2906
01:07:09,589 --> 01:07:09,599
above the high of that, those buyers
 

2907
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:12,710
above the high of that, those buyers
will get stuck. There is a big outlier

2908
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:12,720
will get stuck. There is a big outlier
 

2909
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:17,670
will get stuck. There is a big outlier
delta right here at 44s

2910
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:17,680
delta right here at 44s
 

2911
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:18,950
delta right here at 44s
and we should be able to see him. Here

2912
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:18,960
and we should be able to see him. Here
 

2913
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,069
and we should be able to see him. Here
he is 43 115 lot buy side all the time

2914
01:07:22,069 --> 01:07:22,079
he is 43 115 lot buy side all the time
 

2915
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,670
he is 43 115 lot buy side all the time
we're below him but 443.5

2916
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:25,680
we're below him but 443.5
 

2917
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,990
we're below him but 443.5
then a buyer there's a big buyer stuck.

2918
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:28,000
then a buyer there's a big buyer stuck.
 

2919
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,990
then a buyer there's a big buyer stuck.
All right. So they need to get it above

2920
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:30,000
All right. So they need to get it above
 

2921
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,230
All right. So they need to get it above
that player and they're not able to do

2922
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:32,240
that player and they're not able to do
 

2923
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,630
that player and they're not able to do
that right now. So, if you look at my

2924
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:34,640
that right now. So, if you look at my
 

2925
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:43,270
that right now. So, if you look at my
VPD on my uh tape, we can go to here.

2926
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:43,280

 

2927
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,589

You can see this player is stuck. All

These are buyers stuck in the market. So

2960
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:27,040
These are buyers stuck in the market. So
 

2961
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,950
These are buyers stuck in the market. So
I don't know if Miguel's on here with me

2962
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:28,960
I don't know if Miguel's on here with me
 

2963
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,070
I don't know if Miguel's on here with me
yesterday, but we talked about this

2964
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:30,080
yesterday, but we talked about this
 

2965
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,470
yesterday, but we talked about this
together, buddy. We see this guy here as

2966
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:32,480
together, buddy. We see this guy here as
 

2967
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,789
together, buddy. We see this guy here as
well. This is the big player right here,

2968
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:34,799
well. This is the big player right here,
 

2969
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,950
well. This is the big player right here,
right? See this big bubble here, 427

2970
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:36,960
right? See this big bubble here, 427
 

2971
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,630
right? See this big bubble here, 427
lot. So all the time we're under this,

2972
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:38,640
lot. So all the time we're under this,
 

2973
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,070
lot. So all the time we're under this,
these buyers are stuck. They become

2974
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:40,080
these buyers are stuck. They become
 

2975
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,709
these buyers are stuck. They become
supply. We break down lower. We reclaim

2976
01:08:42,709 --> 01:08:42,719
supply. We break down lower. We reclaim
 

2977
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,309
supply. We break down lower. We reclaim
that. We go the other way. So I don't

2978
01:08:44,309 --> 01:08:44,319
that. We go the other way. So I don't
 

2979
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:45,829
that. We go the other way. So I don't
know if Miguel's here. This is the

2980
01:08:45,829 --> 01:08:45,839
know if Miguel's here. This is the
 

2981
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:47,749
know if Miguel's here. This is the
lesson we went over together last night.

2982
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:47,759
lesson we went over together last night.
 

2983
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:49,430
lesson we went over together last night.
That voice note. There you go. There's

2984
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:49,440
That voice note. There you go. There's
 

2985
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,510
That voice note. There you go. There's
the breakdown. So just playing the

2986
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:51,520
the breakdown. So just playing the
 

2987
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,950
the breakdown. So just playing the
continuation in front of you. Don't

2988
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:52,960
continuation in front of you. Don't
 

2989
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,870
continuation in front of you. Don't
guess what's happening. Learn to

2990
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:54,880
guess what's happening. Learn to
 

2991
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,030
guess what's happening. Learn to
actually read the tape in front of you

2992
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:57,040
actually read the tape in front of you
 

2993
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,430
actually read the tape in front of you
of what's really happening. Makes a big

2994
01:08:59,430 --> 01:08:59,440
of what's really happening. Makes a big
 

2995
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,950
of what's really happening. Makes a big
difference. There you go. Big breakdown.

2996
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:02,960
difference. There you go. Big breakdown.
 

2997
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,789
difference. There you go. Big breakdown.
So, did that make sense, Miguel? Based

2998
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:04,799
So, did that make sense, Miguel? Based
 

2999
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,390
So, did that make sense, Miguel? Based
on our conversation yesterday. Sorry,

3000
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:06,400
on our conversation yesterday. Sorry,
 

3001
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,749
on our conversation yesterday. Sorry,
I'm giving priority to one of my

3002
01:09:07,749 --> 01:09:07,759
I'm giving priority to one of my
 

3003
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:09,590
I'm giving priority to one of my
students here, but it's important. Does

3004
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:09,600
students here, but it's important. Does
 

3005
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,749
students here, but it's important. Does
this make sense? Right. Exactly what we

3006
01:09:11,749 --> 01:09:11,759
this make sense? Right. Exactly what we
 

3007
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:13,349
this make sense? Right. Exactly what we
talked about like the higher time frame.

3008
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:13,359
talked about like the higher time frame.
 

3009
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:15,110
talked about like the higher time frame.
And remember the voice not said on the

3010
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:15,120
And remember the voice not said on the
 

3011
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,789
And remember the voice not said on the
lower time frame. Think about all of

3012
01:09:16,789 --> 01:09:16,799
lower time frame. Think about all of
 

3013
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:18,390
lower time frame. Think about all of
this. How many green bubbles do you see?

3014
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:18,400
this. How many green bubbles do you see?
 

3015
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,149
this. How many green bubbles do you see?
All these green bubbles. Do we get a

3016
01:09:20,149 --> 01:09:20,159
All these green bubbles. Do we get a
 

3017
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:22,470
All these green bubbles. Do we get a
back above them? No. And now we sell

3018
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:22,480
back above them? No. And now we sell
 

3019
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,749
back above them? No. And now we sell
them. We use their stops. They just

3020
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:23,759
them. We use their stops. They just
 

3021
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,990
them. We use their stops. They just
stopped out here. All right. So, all of

3022
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:26,000
stopped out here. All right. So, all of
 

3023
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,229
stopped out here. All right. So, all of
these guys used the low as the stop. So

3024
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:28,239
these guys used the low as the stop. So
 

3025
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:29,910
these guys used the low as the stop. So
this is why we got a big sell here

3026
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:29,920
this is why we got a big sell here
 

3027
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,070
this is why we got a big sell here
because these guys become a seller down

3028
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:32,080
because these guys become a seller down
 

3029
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,550
because these guys become a seller down
here and this becomes your over under.

3030
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:34,560
here and this becomes your over under.
 

3031
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,430
here and this becomes your over under.
Now 440 to 470 is your overunder on the

3032
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:37,440
Now 440 to 470 is your overunder on the
 

3033
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:42,950
Now 440 to 470 is your overunder on the
lower time frame range, right?

3034
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:42,960

 

3035
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,470

Oh, he doesn't know what he's talking

3036

Oh, he doesn't know what he's talking
 

3037
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,229

these [\h__\h] comments to come in from

3040
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:48,159
these [\h__\h] comments to come in from
 

3041
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,870
these [\h__\h] comments to come in from
ICT traders.

3042
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:50,880
ICT traders.
 

3043
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,350
ICT traders.
He's a scam.

3044
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:55,360

You're natural Libra now. Okay, now I

01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,430

Maybe I'll change mine to King King King

3054
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:19,440
Maybe I'll change mine to King King King

Maybe I'll change mine to King King King
Scan.

3056
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:22,880

 

3057
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,470

All right. So, we're going to come and

3058
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:24,480
All right. So, we're going to come and
 

3059
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,550
All right. So, we're going to come and
test this area where the buyers were

3060
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:26,560
test this area where the buyers were
 

3061
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,709
test this area where the buyers were
stuck. All right. So, the big delta

3062
01:10:28,709 --> 01:10:28,719
stuck. All right. So, the big delta
 

3063
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:31,350
stuck. All right. So, the big delta
level is 444.25.

3064
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:31,360
level is 444.25.
 

3065
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,910
level is 444.25.
So, 25,444.25.

3066
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:33,920
So, 25,444.25.
 

3067
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,750
So, 25,444.25.
All the time we're under that, sellers

3068
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:35,760
All the time we're under that, sellers
 

3069

All the time we're under that, sellers
are in absolute control of this market.

So, we can put a line on here if it

3072
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:40,000
So, we can put a line on here if it
 

3073

we're under this, what should we do it
 

3079
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:50,390
we're under this, what should we do it
as? Like this little pink line. All the

3080
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:50,400
as? Like this little pink line. All the
 

3081
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,669
as? Like this little pink line. All the
time we're under this, sellers are in

3082
01:10:51,669 --> 01:10:51,679
time we're under this, sellers are in
 

3083
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:53,110
time we're under this, sellers are in
control. But we get above that, we're

3084
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:53,120
control. But we get above that, we're
 

3085
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:57,750
control. But we get above that, we're
going to let buyers out.

3086
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:57,760

 

3087
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:11,430

Mr. Smart Bollocks.

3088
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:11,440

 

3089
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,870

All right. So, that's your level to risk

3090
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:12,880
All right. So, that's your level to risk
 

3091
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,990
All right. So, that's your level to risk
off. Uh I wouldn't be long. Uh by the

3092
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:16,000
off. Uh I wouldn't be long. Uh by the
 

3093
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,590
off. Uh I wouldn't be long. Uh by the
way, if we just reclaim that, I'd wait

3094
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:17,600
way, if we just reclaim that, I'd wait
 

3095
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,189
way, if we just reclaim that, I'd wait
to reclaim value. All of you guys who

3096
01:11:19,189 --> 01:11:19,199
to reclaim value. All of you guys who
 

3097
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:21,270
to reclaim value. All of you guys who
are desperate to get long, I don't think

3098
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:21,280
are desperate to get long, I don't think
 

3099
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,709
are desperate to get long, I don't think
today's your day. But if you're

3100
01:11:22,709 --> 01:11:22,719
today's your day. But if you're
 

3101
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:24,950
today's your day. But if you're
desperate to get long, ideally what

3102
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:24,960
desperate to get long, ideally what
 

3103
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,470
desperate to get long, ideally what
you'd like to see is previous day low,

3104
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:26,480
you'd like to see is previous day low,
 

3105
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,990
you'd like to see is previous day low,
this green. If you are desperate to get

3106
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:28,000
this green. If you are desperate to get
 

3107
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,189
this green. If you are desperate to get
long, this is what I think you want to

3108
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:29,199
long, this is what I think you want to
 

3109
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:30,630
long, this is what I think you want to
see. You want to see this, this, this,

3110
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:30,640
see. You want to see this, this, this,
 

3111
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,790
see. You want to see this, this, this,
this, this, this, this, this, this,

3112
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:32,800
this, this, this, this, this, this,
 

3113
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,390
this, this, this, this, this, this,
this. All right. And that is your long

3114
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:34,400
this. All right. And that is your long
 

3115
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,550
this. All right. And that is your long
trigger up here once you take this out.

3116
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:36,560
trigger up here once you take this out.
 

3117
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,709
trigger up here once you take this out.
But I would be very skeptical about

3118
01:11:38,709 --> 01:11:38,719
But I would be very skeptical about
 

3119
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:41,030
But I would be very skeptical about
looking for longs. If we're on a Friday,

3120
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:41,040
looking for longs. If we're on a Friday,
 

3121
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,709
looking for longs. If we're on a Friday,
this is what I now know. This is where

3122
01:11:42,709 --> 01:11:42,719
this is what I now know. This is where
 

3123
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,430
this is what I now know. This is where
my brain is. It's a Friday. We failed to

3124
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:45,440
my brain is. It's a Friday. We failed to
 

3125
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,189
my brain is. It's a Friday. We failed to
break out of the highs three times this

3126
01:11:47,189 --> 01:11:47,199
break out of the highs three times this
 

3127
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,870
break out of the highs three times this
week.

3128
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:48,880
week.
 

3129
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,030
week.
Uh earnings report have been good but

3130
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:51,040
Uh earnings report have been good but
 

3131
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,229
Uh earnings report have been good but
we've sold. Guidance has been bad.

3132
01:11:54,229 --> 01:11:54,239
we've sold. Guidance has been bad.
 

3133
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:56,870
we've sold. Guidance has been bad.
Everyone's worried about tech.

3134
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:56,880
Everyone's worried about tech.
 

3135
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,709
Everyone's worried about tech.
We're in a sell. No reason to buy it,

3136
01:11:58,709 --> 01:11:58,719
We're in a sell. No reason to buy it,
 

3137
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,310
We're in a sell. No reason to buy it,
right? You don't need to buy weakness.

3138
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:00,320
right? You don't need to buy weakness.
 

3139
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,229
right? You don't need to buy weakness.
You want to buy strength. So, previous

3146
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:07,120
right. So, make sure you're covering
 

3147
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,270
right. So, make sure you're covering
some here.

3148
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:09,280
some here.
 

3149
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,350
some here.
And uh well, now we really need to think

3150
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:11,360
And uh well, now we really need to think
 

3151
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,030
And uh well, now we really need to think
about next levels down. And to do that,

3152
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:13,040
about next levels down. And to do that,
 

3153
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,709
about next levels down. And to do that,
I want to take you back to the daily

3154
01:12:14,709 --> 01:12:14,719
I want to take you back to the daily
 

3155
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,270
I want to take you back to the daily
chart. All right.

3156
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:17,280
chart. All right.
 

3157
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,630
chart. All right.
This is where we're trading into this

3158
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:18,640
This is where we're trading into this
 

3159
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,229
This is where we're trading into this
low volume node. We talked about it this

3160
01:12:20,229 --> 01:12:20,239
low volume node. We talked about it this
 

3161
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:21,990
low volume node. We talked about it this
morning. If we lose this low volume

3162
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:22,000
morning. If we lose this low volume
 

3163
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,669
morning. If we lose this low volume
node, the high volume node starts at

3164
01:12:23,669 --> 01:12:23,679
node, the high volume node starts at
 

3165
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:28,149
node, the high volume node starts at
340. 50-day is at 324. 20-day is at 241.

3166
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:28,159
340. 50-day is at 324. 20-day is at 241.
 

3167
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,189
340. 50-day is at 324. 20-day is at 241.
And the big level for me to trade back

3168
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:31,199
And the big level for me to trade back
 

3169
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:34,310
And the big level for me to trade back
into is uh what did I call it? The 900.

3170
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:34,320
into is uh what did I call it? The 900.
 

3171
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,070
into is uh what did I call it? The 900.
Yes, it's down here. All right. This

3172
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:36,080
Yes, it's down here. All right. This
 

3173
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,709
Yes, it's down here. All right. This
naked PC, if we lose this blue box, I

3174
01:12:38,709 --> 01:12:38,719
naked PC, if we lose this blue box, I
 

3175
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:40,149
naked PC, if we lose this blue box, I
don't think it happens today. But just

3176
01:12:40,149 --> 01:12:40,159
don't think it happens today. But just
 

3177
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:43,350
don't think it happens today. But just
in case, this is the trade that I want

3178
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:43,360
in case, this is the trade that I want
 

3179
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,709
in case, this is the trade that I want
to see happen. I don't know if it

3180
01:12:44,709 --> 01:12:44,719
to see happen. I don't know if it
 

3181
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:46,310
to see happen. I don't know if it
happens today or if it happens next

3182
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:46,320
happens today or if it happens next
 

3183
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,030
happens today or if it happens next
week, but we lose this. This is one of

3184
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:49,040
week, but we lose this. This is one of
 

3185
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,709
week, but we lose this. This is one of
the biggest magnets you will ever get in

3186
01:12:50,709 --> 01:12:50,719
the biggest magnets you will ever get in
 

3187
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:51,990
the biggest magnets you will ever get in
a stock market. All right, it's an

3188
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:52,000
a stock market. All right, it's an
 

3189
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,470
a stock market. All right, it's an
untested weekly PC. So, if we don't do

3190
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:54,480
untested weekly PC. So, if we don't do
 

3191
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:55,910
untested weekly PC. So, if we don't do
it today, we're going to do it on week

3192
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:55,920
it today, we're going to do it on week
 

3193
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,350
it today, we're going to do it on week
three, which means what? Think about

3194
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:57,360
three, which means what? Think about
 

3195
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,669
three, which means what? Think about
what we're starting to see. All these

3196
01:12:59,669 --> 01:12:59,679
what we're starting to see. All these
 

3197
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:01,350
what we're starting to see. All these
participants, if we start breaking down

3198
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:01,360
participants, if we start breaking down
 

3199
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,750
participants, if we start breaking down
and holding these, these guys will

3200
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:03,760
and holding these, these guys will
 

3201
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:06,229
and holding these, these guys will
become trap volume. We will use them and

3202
01:13:06,229 --> 01:13:06,239
become trap volume. We will use them and
 

3203
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:08,630
become trap volume. We will use them and
we will sell their pain down to this

3204
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:08,640
we will sell their pain down to this
 

3205
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,070
we will sell their pain down to this
point. All right, so this has not

3206
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:10,080
point. All right, so this has not
 

3207
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,709
point. All right, so this has not
changed. I've maintained this stance all

3208
01:13:12,709 --> 01:13:12,719
changed. I've maintained this stance all
 

3209
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,229
changed. I've maintained this stance all
week. It's why I got very pissed off

3210
01:13:14,229 --> 01:13:14,239
week. It's why I got very pissed off
 

3211
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,430
week. It's why I got very pissed off
earlier in the week when everyone was

3212
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:15,440
earlier in the week when everyone was
 

3213
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,590
earlier in the week when everyone was
saying, "Oh, it's very obvious bull

3214
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:17,600
saying, "Oh, it's very obvious bull
 

3215
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,750
saying, "Oh, it's very obvious bull
trend and I was like, it's [\h__\h] not."

3216
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:19,760
trend and I was like, it's [\h__\h] not."
 

3217
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,870
trend and I was like, it's [\h__\h] not."
And saying that is dangerous. So, but

3218
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:22,880
And saying that is dangerous. So, but
 

3219
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,430
And saying that is dangerous. So, but
we're into a potential

3220
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:25,440
we're into a potential
 

3221
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,830
we're into a potential
cover point here and you just should

3222
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:27,840
cover point here and you just should
 

3223
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,990
cover point here and you just should
just be runners only now unless we start

3224
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:30,000
just be runners only now unless we start
 

3225
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,229
just be runners only now unless we start
to really flip these zones. So, unless

3226
01:13:32,229 --> 01:13:32,239
to really flip these zones. So, unless
 

3227
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:35,510
to really flip these zones. So, unless
we get under the if we get underneath

3228
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:35,520
we get under the if we get underneath
 

3229
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,070
we get under the if we get underneath
blue and we reject blue, then we're

3230
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:38,080
blue and we reject blue, then we're
 

3231
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,350
blue and we reject blue, then we're
coming to here. All right. So your only

3232
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:41,360
coming to here. All right. So your only
 

3233
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:46,870
coming to here. All right. So your only
trades left now for shorts are

3234
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:46,880

 

3235
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,510

if we get underneath this and we reject

3236
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:49,520
if we get underneath this and we reject
 

3237
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,149
if we get underneath this and we reject
this ideally with a two-leg then you can

3238
01:13:52,149 --> 01:13:52,159
this ideally with a two-leg then you can
 

3239
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:53,669
this ideally with a two-leg then you can
think about this. Ideally they save it

3240
01:13:53,669 --> 01:13:53,679
think about this. Ideally they save it
 

3241
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,350
think about this. Ideally they save it
for next week. I'll be honest. It' be

3242
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:55,360
for next week. I'll be honest. It' be
 

3243
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,709
for next week. I'll be honest. It' be
really nice if they just save that for

3244
01:13:56,709 --> 01:13:56,719
really nice if they just save that for
 

3245
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,189
really nice if they just save that for
next week.

3246
01:13:59,189 --> 01:13:59,199
next week.
 

3247
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:00,390
next week.
All right. So all of you should

3248
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:00,400
All right. So all of you should
 

3249
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,310
All right. So all of you should
understand what's going on. I've done my

3250
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:02,320
understand what's going on. I've done my
 

3251
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:05,990
understand what's going on. I've done my
best to teach it in a u

3252
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:06,000
best to teach it in a u
 

3253
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,910
best to teach it in a u
easier way to understand. Let's say hope

3254
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:07,920
easier way to understand. Let's say hope
 

3255
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,709
easier way to understand. Let's say hope
hopefully it's helping.

3256
01:14:10,709 --> 01:14:10,719
hopefully it's helping.
 

3257
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:22,870
hopefully it's helping.
Hopefully it's helping.

3258
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:22,880

 

3259
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:34,630

Still don't feel 100% you know postco.

3260
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:34,640

 

3261

Really nice.
Really nice. All right. So, I'd say a

3278
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:55,440
Really nice. All right. So, I'd say a
 

3279
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,590
Really nice. All right. So, I'd say a
few trap sellers coming in down here at

3280
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:57,600
few trap sellers coming in down here at
 

3281
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,990
few trap sellers coming in down here at
65s, but uh you know, momentum is

3282
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:00,000
65s, but uh you know, momentum is
 

3283
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,790
65s, but uh you know, momentum is
downside. It remains downside and you

3284
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:02,800
downside. It remains downside and you
 

3285
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,470
downside. It remains downside and you
haven't reclaimed previous day low yet.

3286
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:04,480
haven't reclaimed previous day low yet.
 

3287
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,070
haven't reclaimed previous day low yet.
We you haven't reclaimed value or

3288
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:06,080
We you haven't reclaimed value or
 

3289
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,590
We you haven't reclaimed value or
anything like that. Momentum's heavy.

3290
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:07,600
anything like that. Momentum's heavy.
 

3291
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,590
anything like that. Momentum's heavy.
You have taken the lowhanging fruit. We

3292
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:09,600
You have taken the lowhanging fruit. We
 

3293
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,510
You have taken the lowhanging fruit. We
are into this. Remember this right here

3294
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:11,520
are into this. Remember this right here
 

3295
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,750
are into this. Remember this right here
is that potential daily low volume node.

3296
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:13,760
is that potential daily low volume node.
 

3297
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,310
is that potential daily low volume node.
It's a high volume node outside of

3298
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:16,320
It's a high volume node outside of
 

3299
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,990
It's a high volume node outside of
value. It's basically in the gap for

3300
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:18,000
value. It's basically in the gap for
 

3301
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,310
value. It's basically in the gap for
those that care. It's in the gap between

3302
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:20,320
those that care. It's in the gap between
 

3303
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,110
those that care. It's in the gap between
Monday the 24th and Monday the 1st. If

3304
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:23,120
Monday the 24th and Monday the 1st. If
 

3305
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,270
Monday the 24th and Monday the 1st. If
you look at the gap between um value

3306
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:25,280
you look at the gap between um value
 

3307
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,870
you look at the gap between um value
area low and value area high there,

3308
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:26,880
area low and value area high there,
 

3309
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,950
area low and value area high there,
that's what we've traded into. But it it

3310
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:28,960
that's what we've traded into. But it it
 

3311
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,270
that's what we've traded into. But it it
is absolutely a low volume node on the

3312
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:31,280
is absolutely a low volume node on the
 

3313
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:34,310
is absolutely a low volume node on the
daily we just went over. We start losing

3314
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:34,320
daily we just went over. We start losing
 

3315
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,709
daily we just went over. We start losing
93s. We've got liquidity at 200s and

3316
01:15:36,709 --> 01:15:36,719
93s. We've got liquidity at 200s and
 

3317
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:38,709
93s. We've got liquidity at 200s and
then we're going 900s. And it can happen

3318
01:15:38,709 --> 01:15:38,719
then we're going 900s. And it can happen
 

3319
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:40,550
then we're going 900s. And it can happen
quick. I'm not joking. It can happen

3320
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:40,560
quick. I'm not joking. It can happen
 

3321
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,550
quick. I'm not joking. It can happen
quick. I really would like them to save

3322
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:42,560
quick. I really would like them to save
 

3323
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,030
quick. I really would like them to save
this for next week. Really? Ideally,

3324
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:45,040
this for next week. Really? Ideally,
 

3325
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:52,709
this for next week. Really? Ideally,
they save it next week.

3326
01:15:52,709 --> 01:15:52,719

 

3327
01:15:52,719 --> 01:16:00,790

Are you I'm not even ask like

3328
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:00,800

 

3329
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,070

what are you talking about then?

3330
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:04,080
what are you talking about then?
 

3331
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,910
what are you talking about then?
I'm not I'm not giving anyone like that

3332
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:05,920
I'm not I'm not giving anyone like that
 

3333
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,709
I'm not I'm not giving anyone like that
valid validity.

3334
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:08,719
valid validity.
 

3335
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:15,590
valid validity.
I've made it super clear.

3336
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:15,600

 

3337
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,030

All right. So, watching into the low of

3338
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:17,040
All right. So, watching into the low of
 

3339
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,110
All right. So, watching into the low of
this box. You got to be covering some of

3340
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:19,120
this box. You got to be covering some of
 

3341
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,149
this box. You got to be covering some of
the low of this box. And if we lose this

3342
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:22,159
the low of this box. And if we lose this
 

3343
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:24,950
the low of this box. And if we lose this
previous week low is at 193s. You can

3344
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:24,960
previous week low is at 193s. You can
 

3345
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,669
previous week low is at 193s. You can
think about that. But I'd really think

3346
01:16:27,669 --> 01:16:27,679
think about that. But I'd really think
 

3347
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:29,990
think about that. But I'd really think
that we can maybe go down to the 900s if

3348
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:30,000
that we can maybe go down to the 900s if
 

3349
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,669
that we can maybe go down to the 900s if
we start getting really heavy today. It

3350
01:16:31,669 --> 01:16:31,679
we start getting really heavy today. It
 

3351
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,270
we start getting really heavy today. It
will be a complete meltdown if they do

3352
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:33,280
will be a complete meltdown if they do
 

3353
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,470
will be a complete meltdown if they do
that. So, look at Spy now underneath

3354
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:36,480
that. So, look at Spy now underneath
 

3355
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,229
that. So, look at Spy now underneath
85s. It's lost 85s. We're going to go to

3356
01:16:38,229 --> 01:16:38,239
85s. It's lost 85s. We're going to go to
 

3357
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:40,310
85s. It's lost 85s. We're going to go to
the 82s. If they lose 82s, it's good

3358
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:40,320
the 82s. If they lose 82s, it's good
 

3359
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:47,430
the 82s. If they lose 82s, it's good
night, sweetheart.

3360
01:16:47,430 --> 01:16:47,440

 

3361
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,709

It would be nice, Peter. Um,

3362
01:16:50,709 --> 01:16:50,719
It would be nice, Peter. Um,
 

3363
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:53,910
It would be nice, Peter. Um,
the 900s is uh what I think this market

3364
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:53,920
the 900s is uh what I think this market
 

3365
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,510
the 900s is uh what I think this market
really wants to get to. All right, we're

3366
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:55,520
really wants to get to. All right, we're
 

3367
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,990
really wants to get to. All right, we're
into the low of this box, right? So

3368
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:58,000
into the low of this box, right? So
 

3369
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,950
into the low of this box, right? So
there's a value area high from the week

3370
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:00,960
there's a value area high from the week
 

3371
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,910
there's a value area high from the week
of the 24th of November. All right. So

3372
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:03,920
of the 24th of November. All right. So
 

3373
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,350
of the 24th of November. All right. So
we're trading into that value area high.

3374
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:05,360
we're trading into that value area high.
 

3375
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,790
we're trading into that value area high.
If we lose this, we're going to go

3376
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:06,800
If we lose this, we're going to go
 

3377
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,870
If we lose this, we're going to go
search for value inside, which means

3378
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:08,880
search for value inside, which means
 

3379
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:09,990
search for value inside, which means
we're probably going to come for the

3380
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:10,000
we're probably going to come for the
 

3381
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,910
we're probably going to come for the

All right, I tell you where you had huge
 

3401
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,669
All right, I tell you where you had huge
sellers come in was 59

3402
01:18:07,669 --> 01:18:07,679

 

3403
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,070

59 360 you can call it. All right, huge

3404
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:10,080
59 360 you can call it. All right, huge
 

3405
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,229
59 360 you can call it. All right, huge
sellers came in

3406
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:12,239
sellers came in
 

3407
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:14,630
sellers came in
360 top of this box. All right, so they

3408
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:14,640
360 top of this box. All right, so they
 

3409
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:15,990
360 top of this box. All right, so they
tried to defend the top of this box

3410
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:16,000
tried to defend the top of this box
 

3411
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,390
tried to defend the top of this box
which shows how important these levels

3412
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:18,400
which shows how important these levels
 

3413
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,189
which shows how important these levels
are because this is where sellers came

3414
01:18:21,189 --> 01:18:21,199
are because this is where sellers came
 

3415
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:22,550
are because this is where sellers came
in. They tried to defend it. became

3419
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,590
sellers and we're trying to hold the
bottom of this box. All right? So, this

3420
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:25,600
bottom of this box. All right? So, this
 

3421
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,709
bottom of this box. All right? So, this
rotation here is going to become

3422
01:18:26,709 --> 01:18:26,719
rotation here is going to become
 

3423
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:28,149
rotation here is going to become
important. If we reject this, reject

3424
01:18:28,149 --> 01:18:28,159
important. If we reject this, reject
 

3425
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:32,149
important. If we reject this, reject
this, reject this, we're going lower.

3426
01:18:32,149 --> 01:18:32,159
this, reject this, we're going lower.
 

3427
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:33,910

Taylor, what's the meaning of the blue

3450
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:00,080
Taylor, what's the meaning of the blue
 

3451
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,390
Taylor, what's the meaning of the blue
box? If if you see a blue box, it's a

3452
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:02,400
box? If if you see a blue box, it's a
 

3453
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,709
box? If if you see a blue box, it's a
possible area of demand. It's like if

3454
01:19:04,709 --> 01:19:04,719
possible area of demand. It's like if
 

3455
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:06,229
possible area of demand. It's like if
you're in a short, it's an area you

3456
01:19:06,229 --> 01:19:06,239
you're in a short, it's an area you
 

3457
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,590
you're in a short, it's an area you
should be starting to cover some of your

3458
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:07,600
should be starting to cover some of your
 

3459
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,430
should be starting to cover some of your
positions. If you see a red box, it's a

3460
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:09,440
positions. If you see a red box, it's a
 

3461
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,590
positions. If you see a red box, it's a
possible area of supply, right? Those

3462
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:11,600
possible area of supply, right? Those
 

3463
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,790
possible area of supply, right? Those
boxes can flip. Okay? So, a zone will

3464
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:14,800
boxes can flip. Okay? So, a zone will
 

3465
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,510
boxes can flip. Okay? So, a zone will
flip. So, if we drop below this, right,

3466
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:17,520
flip. So, if we drop below this, right,
 

3467
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,189
flip. So, if we drop below this, right,
I would expect this to become red and we

3468
01:19:19,189 --> 01:19:19,199
I would expect this to become red and we
 

3469
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:20,630
I would expect this to become red and we
stay heavy. Right now, we're trading

said that, spot on. That's where they're
looking to defend the 360, the top side

3534
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:46,000
looking to defend the 360, the top side
 

3535
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,990
looking to defend the 360, the top side
of the box. If they don't defend this, a

3536
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:48,000
of the box. If they don't defend this, a
 

3537
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,470
of the box. If they don't defend this, a
squeeze back upside is on. Come and test

3538
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:50,480
squeeze back upside is on. Come and test
 

3539
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,550
squeeze back upside is on. Come and test
probably this area here. All right, this

3540
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:52,560
probably this area here. All right, this
 

3541
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,390
probably this area here. All right, this
guy

3542
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:54,400
guy
 

3543
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,110
guy
right here, right, is a level of

3544
01:20:57,110 --> 01:20:57,120
right here, right, is a level of
 

3545
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,669
right here, right, is a level of
interest for a back test if they reclaim

3546
01:20:59,669 --> 01:20:59,679
interest for a back test if they reclaim
 

3547
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:03,030
interest for a back test if they reclaim
360s. But in these 360s, we had uh look,

3548
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:03,040
360s. But in these 360s, we had uh look,
 

3549
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,790
360s. But in these 360s, we had uh look,
if you look at the tape, look at this

3550
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:04,800
if you look at the tape, look at this
 

3551
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,750
if you look at the tape, look at this
guy here, 626 lot sellside. All right,

3552
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:07,760
guy here, 626 lot sellside. All right,
 

3553
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,070
guy here, 626 lot sellside. All right,
so sellside delta

3554
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:10,080
so sellside delta
 

3555
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,709
so sellside delta
626 lot. We're now above them, right?

3556
01:21:12,709 --> 01:21:12,719
626 lot. We're now above them, right?
 

3557
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:14,390
626 lot. We're now above them, right?
Which means everyone below is now stuck

3558
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:14,400
Which means everyone below is now stuck
 

3559
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,630
Which means everyone below is now stuck
as a seller. This is why I give it to

3560
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:16,640
as a seller. This is why I give it to
 

3561
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,590
as a seller. This is why I give it to
you. So, reclaim blue blue box. Watch

3562
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:19,600
you. So, reclaim blue blue box. Watch
 

3563
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,110
you. So, reclaim blue blue box. Watch
previous day low. If we squeeze through

3564
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:21,120
previous day low. If we squeeze through
 

3565
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,550
previous day low. If we squeeze through
previous day low, they're going to get

3566
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:22,560
previous day low, they're going to get
 

3567
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,510
previous day low, they're going to get
some relief to 433s. This is still not a

3568
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:25,520
some relief to 433s. This is still not a
 

3569
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,189
some relief to 433s. This is still not a
long for me. There's nothing in here as

3570
01:21:27,189 --> 01:21:27,199
long for me. There's nothing in here as
 

3571
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:30,070
long for me. There's nothing in here as
a long for me personally. All right. You

3572
01:21:30,070 --> 01:21:30,080
a long for me personally. All right. You
 

3573
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,590
a long for me personally. All right. You
for me personally, like I talked about,

3574
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:31,600
for me personally, like I talked about,
 

3575
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,430
for me personally, like I talked about,
you would need to take this liquidity

3576
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:33,440
you would need to take this liquidity
 

3577
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,910
you would need to take this liquidity
and come back inside this and defend

3578
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:35,920
and come back inside this and defend
 

3579
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,750
and come back inside this and defend
this. And then really, you want to

3580
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:37,760
this. And then really, you want to
 

3581
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,750
this. And then really, you want to
trigger would be that to there. I mean,

3582
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:39,760
trigger would be that to there. I mean,
 

3583
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,990
trigger would be that to there. I mean,
you are in a strong sell day. So, I

3584
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,000
you are in a strong sell day. So, I
 

3585
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,350
you are in a strong sell day. So, I
don't think there's a reason to be long

3586
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:43,360
don't think there's a reason to be long
 

3587
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:46,790
don't think there's a reason to be long
today. Personally, that's how I would

3588
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:46,800
today. Personally, that's how I would
 

3589
01:21:46,800 --> 01:22:02,550
today. Personally, that's how I would
treat it.

3590
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:02,560

 

3591
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,629

If we get a nice deep ret retest, I'll

3602
01:22:18,149 --> 01:22:18,159
If we get a nice deep ret retest, I'll
 

3603
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:19,669
If we get a nice deep ret retest, I'll
I'll think about adding back in. But

3604
01:22:19,669 --> 01:22:19,679
I'll think about adding back in. But
 

3605
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:21,750
I'll think about adding back in. But
it's a Friday for me. I'm just nice and

Alex, that concept that you showed on

3610
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:35,040
Alex, that concept that you showed on
 

3611
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,430
Alex, that concept that you showed on
bookmat or stuck buyers, that was epic.

3612
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:37,440
bookmat or stuck buyers, that was epic.
 

3613
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,070
bookmat or stuck buyers, that was epic.

3621
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:48,550
course. It's all like, guys, that's
it's just different ways of looking at

3622
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:48,560
it's just different ways of looking at
 

3623
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,070
it's just different ways of looking at
it. That's all I'm ever looking at.

3624
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:50,080
it. That's all I'm ever looking at.
 

3625
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,830
it. That's all I'm ever looking at.

principle of how a market moves is based
 

3633
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:01,189
principle of how a market moves is based
on who's stuck. That's literally

3634
01:23:01,189 --> 01:23:01,199
on who's stuck. That's literally
 

3635
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:09,510
on who's stuck. That's literally
how the market moves.

3636
01:23:09,510 --> 01:23:09,520

 

3637
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,750

Okay, sell is still in control. So, no

3638
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:11,760
Okay, sell is still in control. So, no
 

3639
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,030
Okay, sell is still in control. So, no
reclaim above that 360 peaked above it.

reclaim above that 360 peaked above it.
 

3641
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,110
reclaim above that 360 peaked above it.
No reclaim of it. No close above, no

3642
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:17,120
No reclaim of it. No close above, no
 

3643
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,750
No reclaim of it. No close above, no
hold above blue box. Right? Notice you

3644
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:19,760
hold above blue box. Right? Notice you
 

3645
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,470
hold above blue box. Right? Notice you
are not seeing this. All right? You're

3646
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:22,480
are not seeing this. All right? You're
 

3647
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:25,750
are not seeing this. All right? You're
seeing a poke and a fail.

3648
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:25,760
seeing a poke and a fail.
 

3649
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,750
seeing a poke and a fail.
Right? If bulls are going to do this,

3650
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:27,760
Right? If bulls are going to do this,
 

3651
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,030
Right? If bulls are going to do this,
they've got to do this. And your long

3652
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:29,040
they've got to do this. And your long
 

3653
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,310
they've got to do this. And your long
would be on a reclaim. You don't want to

3654
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:30,320
would be on a reclaim. You don't want to
 

3655
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,669
would be on a reclaim. You don't want to
be long down here because you will get

3656
01:23:31,669 --> 01:23:31,679
be long down here because you will get
 

3657
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:34,310
be long down here because you will get
flushed out on.

3658
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:34,320
flushed out on.
 

3659
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:35,830
flushed out on.
Right? If you're desperate to be long,

3660
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:35,840
Right? If you're desperate to be long,
 

3661
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,669
Right? If you're desperate to be long,
it's got to go and rebuild. And I'd be

3662
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:37,679
it's got to go and rebuild. And I'd be
 

3663
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,550
it's got to go and rebuild. And I'd be
very careful because for me any long

3664
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:40,560
very careful because for me any long
 

3665
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,310
very careful because for me any long
today will be counter trend. Why?

3666
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:42,320
today will be counter trend. Why?
 

3667
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,229
today will be counter trend. Why?
Because we're outside of value for the

3668
01:23:44,229 --> 01:23:44,239
Because we're outside of value for the
 

3669
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:45,830
Because we're outside of value for the
first time this week. We're rejecting

3670
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:45,840
first time this week. We're rejecting
 

3671
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,350
first time this week. We're rejecting
value. Yeah, we've taken previous day

3672
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:47,360
value. Yeah, we've taken previous day
 

3673
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,629
value. Yeah, we've taken previous day
low. Whippy-doo. I know what you're

3674
01:23:48,629 --> 01:23:48,639
low. Whippy-doo. I know what you're
 

3675
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,709
low. Whippy-doo. I know what you're
going to say. Low hanging fruit's gone.

3676
01:23:50,709 --> 01:23:50,719
going to say. Low hanging fruit's gone.
 

3677
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:52,790
going to say. Low hanging fruit's gone.
But the draw can easily be down here. So

3678
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:52,800
But the draw can easily be down here. So
 

3679
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,189
But the draw can easily be down here. So
any long today, you know, unless you

3680
01:23:55,189 --> 01:23:55,199
any long today, you know, unless you
 

3681
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:57,510
any long today, you know, unless you
reclaim this, right? Then this is

3682
01:23:57,510 --> 01:23:57,520
reclaim this, right? Then this is
 

3683
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,189
reclaim this, right? Then this is
probably a counter trend which gets sold

3684
01:23:59,189 --> 01:23:59,199
probably a counter trend which gets sold
 

3685
01:23:59,199 --> 01:24:01,830
probably a counter trend which gets sold
into until they prove otherwise. That's

3686
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:01,840
into until they prove otherwise. That's
 

3687
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,590
into until they prove otherwise. That's
how I would think about the market. So

3688
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:03,600
how I would think about the market. So
 

3689
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,629
how I would think about the market. So
if you're long today, you counter trend.

3690
01:24:06,629 --> 01:24:06,639
if you're long today, you counter trend.
 

3691
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:08,229
if you're long today, you counter trend.
I don't like counter trends. I try and

3692
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:08,239
I don't like counter trends. I try and
 

3693
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:09,990
I don't like counter trends. I try and
play protrends. I'd rather let this

3694
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:10,000
play protrends. I'd rather let this
 

3695
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,870
play protrends. I'd rather let this
squeeze out, right? Imagine we get loads

3696
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:12,880
squeeze out, right? Imagine we get loads
 

3697
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,870
squeeze out, right? Imagine we get loads
of bulls, chase, chase, chase, chase,

3698
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:14,880
of bulls, chase, chase, chase, chase,
 

3699
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,910
of bulls, chase, chase, chase, chase,
chase, two leg, fail, slam back down,

3700
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:17,920
chase, two leg, fail, slam back down,
 

3701
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,070
chase, two leg, fail, slam back down,
cover some, run us for down here just in

3702
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:20,080
cover some, run us for down here just in
 

3703
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,430
cover some, run us for down here just in
case it wants to do it. That's the kind

3704
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:21,440
case it wants to do it. That's the kind
 

3705
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:27,669
case it wants to do it. That's the kind
of thing I would prefer to look for.

3706
01:24:27,669 --> 01:24:27,679

 

3707
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:29,510

Holding for naked PC. I mean, if they

3708
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:29,520
Holding for naked PC. I mean, if they
 

3709
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,390
Holding for naked PC. I mean, if they
get it today, what will that move be?

3710
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:32,400
get it today, what will that move be?
 

3711
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,390
get it today, what will that move be?
Let's see if it's actually realistic to

3712
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:34,400
Let's see if it's actually realistic to
 

3713
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,830
Let's see if it's actually realistic to
do in one day. Where did our closing

3714
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:37,840
do in one day. Where did our closing
 

3715
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:43,030
do in one day. Where did our closing
price from yesterday to?

3716
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:43,040

 

3717
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:46,390

Possible. It's a 3% move. Seen weirder

3718
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:46,400
Possible. It's a 3% move. Seen weirder
 

3719
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,189
Possible. It's a 3% move. Seen weirder
things. Where's the New York open?

3720
01:24:49,189 --> 01:24:49,199
things. Where's the New York open?
 

3721
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:51,270
things. Where's the New York open?
Somewhere around here. Where's my blue

3722
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:51,280
Somewhere around here. Where's my blue
 

3723
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:56,629
Somewhere around here. Where's my blue
line? Yeah,

3724
01:24:56,629 --> 01:24:56,639

 

3725
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:59,590

2.41% down day. It's possible. It's not

3726
01:24:59,590 --> 01:24:59,600
2.41% down day. It's possible. It's not
 

3727
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,669
2.41% down day. It's possible. It's not
actually that much, is it?

3728
01:25:01,669 --> 01:25:01,679
actually that much, is it?
 

3729
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,510
actually that much, is it?
It's a lot, don't get me wrong. 2 to 3%

3730
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:03,520
It's a lot, don't get me wrong. 2 to 3%
 

3731
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,390
It's a lot, don't get me wrong. 2 to 3%
is a lot, but it's not like it's a 10%

3732
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:06,400
is a lot, but it's not like it's a 10%
 

3733
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,830
is a lot, but it's not like it's a 10%
drop in a day is what I'm trying to say.

3734
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:07,840
drop in a day is what I'm trying to say.
 

3735
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,709
drop in a day is what I'm trying to say.
It's possible. There's validity to it.

3736
01:25:10,709 --> 01:25:10,719
It's possible. There's validity to it.
 

3737
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:14,070
It's possible. There's validity to it.
It could happen. It could happen. Okay.

3738
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:14,080
It could happen. It could happen. Okay.
 

3739
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,390
It could happen. It could happen. Okay.
SPY retesting 85 here. This is a big

3740
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:16,400
SPY retesting 85 here. This is a big
 

3741
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,149
SPY retesting 85 here. This is a big
overunder for SPY. Remember, if it

3742
01:25:18,149 --> 01:25:18,159
overunder for SPY. Remember, if it
 

3743
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:19,750
overunder for SPY. Remember, if it
retests it, we can go on a reclaim

3744
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:19,760
retests it, we can go on a reclaim
 

3745
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,149
retests it, we can go on a reclaim
squeeze. If they resell into this, then

3746
01:25:22,149 --> 01:25:22,159
squeeze. If they resell into this, then
 

3747
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:24,229
squeeze. If they resell into this, then
I think 82s are very, very much possible

3748
01:25:24,229 --> 01:25:24,239
I think 82s are very, very much possible
 

3749
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:27,110
I think 82s are very, very much possible
on SPY. So, these are the levels you

3750
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:27,120
on SPY. So, these are the levels you
 

3751
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,350
on SPY. So, these are the levels you
just had. Buyers just came flying in

3752
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:29,360
just had. Buyers just came flying in
 

3753
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,510
just had. Buyers just came flying in
here trying to support this bid for an

3754
01:25:31,510 --> 01:25:31,520
here trying to support this bid for an
 

3755
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:35,270
here trying to support this bid for an
upside move now.

3756
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:35,280

 

3757
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,750

And where did we say these guys were

3758
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:37,760
And where did we say these guys were
 

3759
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,030
And where did we say these guys were
stuck? Where was the

3760
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:41,040
stuck? Where was the
 

3761
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,550
stuck? Where was the
I thought I put pink line on the chart

3762
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:42,560
I thought I put pink line on the chart
 

3763
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,270
I thought I put pink line on the chart
if I deleted it.

3764
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:45,280
if I deleted it.
 

3765
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:48,070
if I deleted it.
Have to find him now again. That's

3766
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:48,080
Have to find him now again. That's
 

3767
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:53,270
Have to find him now again. That's
annoying.

3768
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:53,280

 

3769
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,590

Zoom out this. Oh, he's way up there.

3770
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:55,600
Zoom out this. Oh, he's way up there.
 

3771
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,030
Zoom out this. Oh, he's way up there.
Okay. So, I'd be watching it into sort

3772
01:25:57,030 --> 01:25:57,040
Okay. So, I'd be watching it into sort
 

3773
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:59,270
Okay. So, I'd be watching it into sort
of 425s,

3774
01:25:59,270 --> 01:25:59,280
of 425s,
 

3775
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,990
of 425s,
425s to 460s, 470s. And you'd want

3776
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:02,000
425s to 460s, 470s. And you'd want
 

3777
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,910
425s to 460s, 470s. And you'd want
sellers to defend that max. Okay. Here's

3778
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:03,920
sellers to defend that max. Okay. Here's
 

3779
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,590
sellers to defend that max. Okay. Here's
the retest of previous day low staying

3780
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:05,600
the retest of previous day low staying
 

3781
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,750
the retest of previous day low staying
heavy. This volume node now staying

3782
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:07,760
heavy. This volume node now staying
 

3783
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,470
heavy. This volume node now staying
heavy.

3784
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:10,480
heavy.
 

3785
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:13,990
heavy.
Sellers came flying in here. 450 lot now

3786
01:26:13,990 --> 01:26:14,000
Sellers came flying in here. 450 lot now
 

3787
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,229
Sellers came flying in here. 450 lot now
caught at 50. So, just I would just

3788
01:26:16,229 --> 01:26:16,239
caught at 50. So, just I would just
 

3789
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:17,750
caught at 50. So, just I would just
personally I'd just let this shake out

3790
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:17,760
personally I'd just let this shake out
 

3791
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,990
personally I'd just let this shake out
for a minute. Let it shake out for a

3792
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:20,000
for a minute. Let it shake out for a
 

3793
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,350
for a minute. Let it shake out for a
minute. If you're looking for the follow

3794
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:21,360
minute. If you're looking for the follow
 

3795
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,709
minute. If you're looking for the follow
on short, I would just let this shake

3796
01:26:22,709 --> 01:26:22,719
on short, I would just let this shake
 

3797
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,229
on short, I would just let this shake
out for a minute. You got a bit of a

3798
01:26:24,229 --> 01:26:24,239
out for a minute. You got a bit of a
 

3799
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,070
out for a minute. You got a bit of a
battle developing here. Previous day

3800
01:26:26,070 --> 01:26:26,080
battle developing here. Previous day
 

3801
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,830
battle developing here. Previous day
low. A big seller just came flying in

3802
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:27,840
low. A big seller just came flying in
 

3803
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,149
low. A big seller just came flying in
here and got stuck. Okay, this is your

3804
01:26:30,149 --> 01:26:30,159
here and got stuck. Okay, this is your
 

3805
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:32,629
here and got stuck. Okay, this is your
volume node. If they reclaim this node,

3806
01:26:32,629 --> 01:26:32,639
volume node. If they reclaim this node,
 

3807
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:34,229
volume node. If they reclaim this node,
this is potential resistance to here,

3808
01:26:34,229 --> 01:26:34,239
this is potential resistance to here,
 

3809
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:35,750
this is potential resistance to here,
but it's very thin, so they might just

3810
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:35,760
but it's very thin, so they might just
 

3811
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,830
but it's very thin, so they might just
skip straight up to here. These are the

3812
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:37,840
skip straight up to here. These are the
 

3813
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,669
skip straight up to here. These are the
levels that I'm interested in shorting

3814
01:26:39,669 --> 01:26:39,679
levels that I'm interested in shorting
 

3815
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:42,470
levels that I'm interested in shorting
versus. If we reclaim those shorts go

3816
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:42,480
versus. If we reclaim those shorts go
 

3817
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,550
versus. If we reclaim those shorts go
out the off the table, and we'll

3818
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:44,560
out the off the table, and we'll
 

3819
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:47,030
out the off the table, and we'll
probably go back into rotation. So, I'm

3820
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:47,040
probably go back into rotation. So, I'm
 

3821
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,750
probably go back into rotation. So, I'm
going to wait. Can we squeeze through

3822
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:49,760
going to wait. Can we squeeze through
 

3823
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,430
going to wait. Can we squeeze through
this little area here? Can we do like a

3824
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:51,440
this little area here? Can we do like a
 

3825
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,510
this little area here? Can we do like a
two-leg

3826
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:53,520
two-leg
 

3827
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,189
two-leg
through the low volume node. Right?

3828
01:26:55,189 --> 01:26:55,199
through the low volume node. Right?
 

3829
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:57,110
through the low volume node. Right?
Either sellers defend this or we're

3830
01:26:57,110 --> 01:26:57,120
Either sellers defend this or we're
 

3831
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,470
Either sellers defend this or we're
going to go straight squeeze to here.

3832
01:26:58,470 --> 01:26:58,480
going to go straight squeeze to here.
 

3833
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,709
going to go straight squeeze to here.
And this area here I'm interested in

3834
01:27:00,709 --> 01:27:00,719
And this area here I'm interested in

3903
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,270

What we doing, folks? Just building out

3904
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:41,280
What we doing, folks? Just building out
 

3905
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,790
What we doing, folks? Just building out
liquidity now. All right. The market's

3906
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:42,800
liquidity now. All right. The market's
 

3907
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:46,950
liquidity now. All right. The market's
taking a breather now.

3908
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:46,960

 

3909
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,310

Market's taking a breather. It's still

3910
01:29:48,310 --> 01:29:48,320
Market's taking a breather. It's still
 

3911
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:49,910
Market's taking a breather. It's still
bearish. All right. Look, if we just

3912
01:29:49,910 --> 01:29:49,920
bearish. All right. Look, if we just
 

3913
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,149
bearish. All right. Look, if we just
think about this, very, very simple. Can

3914
01:29:52,149 --> 01:29:52,159
think about this, very, very simple. Can
 

3915
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:54,390
think about this, very, very simple. Can
we reclaim previous day low? No. Have we

3916
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:54,400
we reclaim previous day low? No. Have we
 

3917
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,229
we reclaim previous day low? No. Have we
reclaimed momentum clouds, flow zone

3918
01:29:56,229 --> 01:29:56,239
reclaimed momentum clouds, flow zone
 

3919
01:29:56,239 --> 01:29:57,910
reclaimed momentum clouds, flow zone
clouds? No. Have we got back above this

3920
01:29:57,910 --> 01:29:57,920
clouds? No. Have we got back above this
 

3921
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:00,470
clouds? No. Have we got back above this
shelf? Have we reclaimed this low

3922
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:00,480
shelf? Have we reclaimed this low
 

3923
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,350
shelf? Have we reclaimed this low
volume? No. No. So for me, any build out

3924
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:03,360
volume? No. No. So for me, any build out
 

3925
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,350
volume? No. No. So for me, any build out
here is bearish. All right. Any build

3926
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:05,360
here is bearish. All right. Any build
 

3927
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,910
here is bearish. All right. Any build
out here is bearish. But you can just

3928
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:07,920
out here is bearish. But you can just
 

3929
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:09,750
out here is bearish. But you can just
really build a bare flag and and let it

3930
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:09,760
really build a bare flag and and let it
 

3931
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,629
really build a bare flag and and let it
do whatever it needs to do. Ideally,

3932
01:30:12,629 --> 01:30:12,639
do whatever it needs to do. Ideally,
 

3933
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:14,470
do whatever it needs to do. Ideally,
you know, two plus leg pullback. Where

3934
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:14,480
you know, two plus leg pullback. Where
 

3935
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,709
you know, two plus leg pullback. Where
is my channel? Do I have one? Let me get

3936
01:30:16,709 --> 01:30:16,719
is my channel? Do I have one? Let me get
 

3937
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:18,790
is my channel? Do I have one? Let me get
rid of it.

3938
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:18,800
rid of it.
 

3939
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,910
rid of it.
I'll just draw it like this. All right.

3940
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:21,920
I'll just draw it like this. All right.
 

3941
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:23,990
I'll just draw it like this. All right.
No, it's not what we want. Sorry, folks.

3942
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:24,000
No, it's not what we want. Sorry, folks.
 

3943
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:31,590
No, it's not what we want. Sorry, folks.
Let me try and help here. Right.

3944
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:31,600

 

3945
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,149

I don't really want to be a new money

3946
01:30:34,149 --> 01:30:34,159
I don't really want to be a new money
 

3947
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:36,470
I don't really want to be a new money
short in here. Do I remember this is a

3948
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:36,480
short in here. Do I remember this is a
 

3949
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,629
short in here. Do I remember this is a
high time frame level. It's been on here

3950
01:30:38,629 --> 01:30:38,639
high time frame level. It's been on here
 

3951
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,390
high time frame level. It's been on here
for two weeks now. This level. I don't

3952
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:40,400
for two weeks now. This level. I don't
 

3953
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,550
for two weeks now. This level. I don't
want to be a short in this box. All

3954
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:42,560
want to be a short in this box. All
 

3955
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,510
want to be a short in this box. All
right. I would much rather see this

3956
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:45,520
right. I would much rather see this
 

3957
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:49,510
right. I would much rather see this
market move out of this.

3958
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:49,520
market move out of this.
 

3959
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:52,070
market move out of this.
All right. Maybe into here. Maybe into

3960
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:52,080
All right. Maybe into here. Maybe into
 

3961
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,910
All right. Maybe into here. Maybe into
here.

3962
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:53,920
here.
 

3963
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:57,270
here.
and then offer a short here. Or if it

3964
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:57,280
and then offer a short here. Or if it
 

3965
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:58,950
and then offer a short here. Or if it
won't do that, if it's a nasty market

3966
01:30:58,950 --> 01:30:58,960
won't do that, if it's a nasty market
 

3967
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,110
won't do that, if it's a nasty market
and it just does this and fail, then we

3968
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:01,120
and it just does this and fail, then we
 

3969
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,510
and it just does this and fail, then we
need to wait for a return in for a

3970
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:03,520
need to wait for a return in for a
 

3971
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:06,790
need to wait for a return in for a
continuation. All right? So,

3972
01:31:06,790 --> 01:31:06,800
continuation. All right? So,
 

3973
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,229
continuation. All right? So,
if you're learning anything from here,

3974
01:31:08,229 --> 01:31:08,239
if you're learning anything from here,
 

3975
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:09,750
if you're learning anything from here,
it's the important of the higher time

3976
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:09,760
it's the important of the higher time
 

3977
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,189
it's the important of the higher time
frames, right? It's important of

3978
01:31:11,189 --> 01:31:11,199
frames, right? It's important of
 

3979
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:14,070
frames, right? It's important of
understanding when we're leaving value,

3980
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:14,080
understanding when we're leaving value,
 

3981
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,990
understanding when we're leaving value,
when we're searching for new value.

3982
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:16,000
when we're searching for new value.
 

3983
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,270
when we're searching for new value.
Remember, this market has been in value

3984
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:19,280
Remember, this market has been in value
 

3985
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,350
Remember, this market has been in value
in here for two weeks, right? Rotation,

3986
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:21,360
in here for two weeks, right? Rotation,
 

3987
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,870
in here for two weeks, right? Rotation,
rotation, rotation, rotation.

3988

Eventually, it went [\h__\h] no. We don't

3990
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:25,600
Eventually, it went [\h__\h] no. We don't
 

3991
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,350
Eventually, it went [\h__\h] no. We don't
like the price up here. We need to

3992
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:27,360
like the price up here. We need to
 

3993
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,510
like the price up here. We need to
search for new value. That's what a

3994
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:29,520
search for new value. That's what a
 

3995
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,990
search for new value. That's what a
trend is. It's search for new value. The

3996
01:31:31,990 --> 01:31:32,000
trend is. It's search for new value. The
 

3997
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,390
trend is. It's search for new value. The
moment it's found some validity here

3998
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:34,400
moment it's found some validity here
 

3999
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,709
moment it's found some validity here
because it's building out volume. I know

4000
01:31:36,709 --> 01:31:36,719
because it's building out volume. I know
 

4001
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:39,350
because it's building out volume. I know
the most valued area is down here. I

4002
01:31:39,350 --> 01:31:39,360
the most valued area is down here. I
 

4003
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,790
the most valued area is down here. I
don't know. It comes today. It might

4004
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:40,800
don't know. It comes today. It might
 

4005
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,629
don't know. It comes today. It might
come next week. It might never come. I

4006
01:31:42,629 --> 01:31:42,639
come next week. It might never come. I
 

4007
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:44,070
come next week. It might never come. I
think it will come, but it might never

4008
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:44,080
think it will come, but it might never
 

4009
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:45,350
think it will come, but it might never
come. And we need to be prepared for

4010
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:45,360
come. And we need to be prepared for
 

4011
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,709
come. And we need to be prepared for
that. But that's the move that I would

4012
01:31:46,709 --> 01:31:46,719
that. But that's the move that I would
 

4013
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:48,790
that. But that's the move that I would
love to see. That is also previous week

4014
01:31:48,790 --> 01:31:48,800
love to see. That is also previous week
 

4015
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,390
love to see. That is also previous week
low right here. So, we're going to also

4016
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:50,400
low right here. So, we're going to also
 

4017
01:31:50,400 --> 01:32:01,189
low right here. So, we're going to also
respect that.

4018
01:32:01,189 --> 01:32:01,199

 

4019
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:04,470

So, the indicators mention in private

4020
01:32:04,470 --> 01:32:04,480
So, the indicators mention in private
 

4021
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,830
So, the indicators mention in private
created ones. Yeah, they're they're

4022
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:05,840
created ones. Yeah, they're they're
 

4023
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,950
created ones. Yeah, they're they're
private. So, you can get it on uh the

4024
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:08,960
private. So, you can get it on uh the
 

4025
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,790
private. So, you can get it on uh the
website if you're interested. If you do

4026
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:10,800
website if you're interested. If you do
 

4027
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,270
website if you're interested. If you do
the course, uh you get a version of it.

4028
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:13,280
the course, uh you get a version of it.
 

4029
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,870
the course, uh you get a version of it.
Uh they're cheaper if you do the

4030
01:32:14,870 --> 01:32:14,880
Uh they're cheaper if you do the
 

4031
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:16,470
Uh they're cheaper if you do the
beginner to advanced course because it's

4032
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:16,480
beginner to advanced course because it's
 

4033
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,390
beginner to advanced course because it's
a big part of how I trade. I don't try

4034
01:32:18,390 --> 01:32:18,400
a big part of how I trade. I don't try
 

4035
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:24,550
a big part of how I trade. I don't try
not to trade against them.

4036
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:24,560

 

4037
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:25,990

Uh what are the other ones that you want

4038
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:26,000
Uh what are the other ones that you want
 

4039
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,510
Uh what are the other ones that you want
to know, bud? Uh this is this is just

4040
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:29,520
to know, bud? Uh this is this is just
 

4041
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,830
to know, bud? Uh this is this is just
anchored uh volume profile, right?

4042
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:31,840
anchored uh volume profile, right?
 

4043
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,149
anchored uh volume profile, right?
Anchored off the 930. That's all that

4044
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:34,159
Anchored off the 930. That's all that
 

4045
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:35,750
Anchored off the 930. That's all that
is. And everything else that you've seen

4046
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:35,760
is. And everything else that you've seen
 

4047
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:40,070
is. And everything else that you've seen
on the chart are just uh weekly um fixed

4048
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:40,080
on the chart are just uh weekly um fixed
 

4049
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,910
on the chart are just uh weekly um fixed
fixed range volume profiles, right? You

4050
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:41,920
fixed range volume profiles, right? You
 

4051
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,350
fixed range volume profiles, right? You
can draw those on. They're for free,

4052
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:43,360
can draw those on. They're for free,
 

4053
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,430
can draw those on. They're for free,
right? They're not uh they're just here.

4054
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:45,440
right? They're not uh they're just here.
 

4055
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,070
right? They're not uh they're just here.
Is it here? Is it this one? They're

4056
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:48,080
Is it here? Is it this one? They're
 

4057
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,990
Is it here? Is it this one? They're
here. Volume based, right? anchored

4058
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:50,000
here. Volume based, right? anchored
 

4059
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,510
here. Volume based, right? anchored
volume profile, fixed range volume

4060
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:51,520
volume profile, fixed range volume
 

4061
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:53,030
volume profile, fixed range volume
profile. So that's all these are.

4062
01:32:53,030 --> 01:32:53,040
profile. So that's all these are.
 

4063
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,629
profile. So that's all these are.
They're just they're not indicators.

4064
01:32:54,629 --> 01:32:54,639
They're just they're not indicators.
 

4065
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:56,070
They're just they're not indicators.
They're tools, I guess, is a better way

4066
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:56,080
They're tools, I guess, is a better way
 

4067
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,990
They're tools, I guess, is a better way
of putting it. If that's what you were

4068
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:58,000
of putting it. If that's what you were
 

4069
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,669
of putting it. If that's what you were
wondering. If I've misunderstood that, I

4070
01:32:59,669 --> 01:32:59,679
wondering. If I've misunderstood that, I
 

4071
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:03,910
wondering. If I've misunderstood that, I
am sorry.

4072
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:03,920

 

4073
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,590

So, let's see if this can lift up a bit

4074
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:05,600
So, let's see if this can lift up a bit
 

4075
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,830
So, let's see if this can lift up a bit
here. Spy reclaiming those 85s. Didn't

4076
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:07,840
here. Spy reclaiming those 85s. Didn't
 

4077
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,910
here. Spy reclaiming those 85s. Didn't
quite get to 82s. I saw one of you

4078
01:33:09,910 --> 01:33:09,920
quite get to 82s. I saw one of you
 

4079
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,310
quite get to 82s. I saw one of you
saying S&P got to strike price or

4080
01:33:12,310 --> 01:33:12,320
saying S&P got to strike price or
 

4081
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,070
saying S&P got to strike price or
something. I missed that. So, I don't

4082
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:14,080
something. I missed that. So, I don't
 

4083
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,790
something. I missed that. So, I don't
know what price that was. Apologies.

4084
01:33:16,790 --> 01:33:16,800
know what price that was. Apologies.
 

4085
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,189
know what price that was. Apologies.
VIX did peak out at 16, has failed to

4086
01:33:19,189 --> 01:33:19,199
VIX did peak out at 16, has failed to
 

4087
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:21,110
VIX did peak out at 16, has failed to
close above 16, coming right down to the

4088
01:33:21,110 --> 01:33:21,120
close above 16, coming right down to the
 

4089
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,430
close above 16, coming right down to the
1550s now. And we are into this low

4090
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:23,440
1550s now. And we are into this low
 

4091
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,910
1550s now. And we are into this low
volume node. So sometimes you will see

4092
01:33:25,910 --> 01:33:25,920
volume node. So sometimes you will see
 

4093
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:29,270
volume node. So sometimes you will see
sellers try and defend this. All right,

4094
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:29,280
sellers try and defend this. All right,
 

4095
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:32,149
sellers try and defend this. All right,
but at the moment we might see a retest

4096
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:32,159
but at the moment we might see a retest
 

4097
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:33,510
but at the moment we might see a retest
of this. If they get through this,

4098
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:33,520
of this. If they get through this,
 

4099
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,350
of this. If they get through this,
retest this. If we get through this, I'm

4100
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:35,360
retest this. If we get through this, I'm
 

4101
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,590
retest this. If we get through this, I'm
not interested in shorts anymore. And

4102
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:37,600
not interested in shorts anymore. And
 

4103
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,390
not interested in shorts anymore. And
I'm not going to short. What I do not do

4104
01:33:40,390 --> 01:33:40,400
I'm not going to short. What I do not do
 

4105
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:41,910
I'm not going to short. What I do not do
is try and guess where the top is,

4106
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:41,920
is try and guess where the top is,
 

4107
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,229
is try and guess where the top is,
right? I let it I don't go short short

4108
01:33:44,229 --> 01:33:44,239
right? I let it I don't go short short
 

4109
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:47,830
right? I let it I don't go short short
short blow up. All right, we let it peak

4110
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:47,840
short blow up. All right, we let it peak
 

4111
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:50,310
short blow up. All right, we let it peak
out, right? Ideally, this move happens

4112
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:50,320
out, right? Ideally, this move happens
 

4113
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,910
out, right? Ideally, this move happens
aggressively. The slower it is actually,

4114
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:51,920
aggressively. The slower it is actually,
 

4115
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,910
aggressively. The slower it is actually,
the worse it is. What you want is

4116
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:53,920
the worse it is. What you want is
 

4117
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,270
the worse it is. What you want is
something like this and then that,

4118
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:55,280
something like this and then that,
 

4119
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,830
something like this and then that,
right? And you want buyers all buying

4120
01:33:57,830 --> 01:33:57,840
right? And you want buyers all buying
 

4121
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,870
right? And you want buyers all buying
here, right? Delta to go high, right?

4122
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:00,880
here, right? Delta to go high, right?
 

4123
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,629
here, right? Delta to go high, right?
This delta you want to go high and then

4124
01:34:02,629 --> 01:34:02,639
This delta you want to go high and then
 

4125
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:04,709
This delta you want to go high and then
to get stuck and then we use their pain.

4126
01:34:04,709 --> 01:34:04,719
to get stuck and then we use their pain.
 

4127
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:07,030
to get stuck and then we use their pain.
At least that's how I trade it. So, this

4128
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:07,040
At least that's how I trade it. So, this
 

4129
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,390
At least that's how I trade it. So, this
is what actually just happened now.

4130
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:08,400
is what actually just happened now.
 

4131
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:11,270
is what actually just happened now.
Buyers just came flying in here at 94,

4132
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:11,280
Buyers just came flying in here at 94,
 

4133
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,110
Buyers just came flying in here at 94,
right? They literally just claim flying

4134
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:13,120
right? They literally just claim flying
 

4135
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,030
right? They literally just claim flying
in at 94.

4136
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:15,040
in at 94.
 

4137
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,189
in at 94.
So let's see if they get stuck. And they

4138
01:34:17,189 --> 01:34:17,199
So let's see if they get stuck. And they
 

4139
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:19,350
So let's see if they get stuck. And they
do have bid support at 76 is here. But

4140
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:19,360
do have bid support at 76 is here. But
 

4141
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,950
do have bid support at 76 is here. But
they just got stuck there at 94. They

4142
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:20,960
they just got stuck there at 94. They
 

4143
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:24,070
they just got stuck there at 94. They
just came. So there you go. Why I'm

4144
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:24,080
just came. So there you go. Why I'm
 

4145
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:25,990
just came. So there you go. Why I'm
teaching it? It's starting. All right.

4146
01:34:25,990 --> 01:34:26,000
teaching it? It's starting. All right.
 

4147
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,350
teaching it? It's starting. All right.
So let's just see. I'd say big buy side

4148
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:29,360
So let's just see. I'd say big buy side
 

4149
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,750
So let's just see. I'd say big buy side
delta is 94. And if they get above that,

4150
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:31,760
delta is 94. And if they get above that,
 

4151
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,830
delta is 94. And if they get above that,
it's 9008ish.

4152
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:33,840
it's 9008ish.
 

4153
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,189
it's 9008ish.
And they are now starting to find

4154
01:34:35,189 --> 01:34:35,199
And they are now starting to find
 

4155
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:36,950
And they are now starting to find
themselves a little bit caught up here.

4156
01:34:36,950 --> 01:34:36,960
themselves a little bit caught up here.
 

4157
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,110
themselves a little bit caught up here.
The problem now is is how we've built

4158
01:34:39,110 --> 01:34:39,120
The problem now is is how we've built
 

4159
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:40,870
The problem now is is how we've built
out this volume. All right. Do they

4160
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:40,880
out this volume. All right. Do they
 

4161
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:43,270
out this volume. All right. Do they
respect this? It's why it's why you want

4162
01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:43,280
respect this? It's why it's why you want
 

4163
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:46,070
respect this? It's why it's why you want
like a blowoff top and then that because

4164
01:34:46,070 --> 01:34:46,080
like a blowoff top and then that because
 

4165
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:52,550
like a blowoff top and then that because
you use their pain to come lower.

4166
01:34:52,550 --> 01:34:52,560

 

4167
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:55,110

Can I show that on bookm? Uh yeah, right

4168
01:34:55,110 --> 01:34:55,120
Can I show that on bookm? Uh yeah, right
 

4169
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:57,030
Can I show that on bookm? Uh yeah, right
here.

4170
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:57,040
here.
 

4171
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:02,470
here.
Uh maybe to put that

4172
01:35:02,470 --> 01:35:02,480

 

4173
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,790

these guys right here. All right. See

4174
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:04,800
these guys right here. All right. See
 

4175
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:09,350
these guys right here. All right. See
these guys? 57 lot, 5 lot, 142 lot, 107

4176
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:09,360
these guys? 57 lot, 5 lot, 142 lot, 107
 

4177
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,189
these guys? 57 lot, 5 lot, 142 lot, 107
lot. And the moment, if you just think

4178
01:35:11,189 --> 01:35:11,199
lot. And the moment, if you just think
 

4179
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:13,590
lot. And the moment, if you just think
about this as like a little shelf, the

4180
01:35:13,590 --> 01:35:13,600
about this as like a little shelf, the
 

4181
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,669
about this as like a little shelf, the
moment they got stuck, boom, they become

4182
01:35:15,669 --> 01:35:15,679
moment they got stuck, boom, they become
 

4183
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:16,709
moment they got stuck, boom, they become
sellers. So, we're going to come back

4184
01:35:16,709 --> 01:35:16,719
sellers. So, we're going to come back
 

4185
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:20,470
sellers. So, we're going to come back
and test them. If they stay heavy again,

4186
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:20,480
and test them. If they stay heavy again,
 

4187
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,550
and test them. If they stay heavy again,
if they stay heavy versus here, right,

4188
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:22,560
if they stay heavy versus here, right,
 

4189
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:23,990
if they stay heavy versus here, right,
they've just bought heavy into it again.

4190
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:24,000
they've just bought heavy into it again.
 

4191
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,590
they've just bought heavy into it again.
If they can't reclaim this range, we

4192
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:25,600
If they can't reclaim this range, we
 

4193
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:26,950
If they can't reclaim this range, we
move lower. So if they reclaim this

4194
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:26,960
move lower. So if they reclaim this
 

4195
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,629
move lower. So if they reclaim this
range, then we're going to try and move

4196
01:35:28,629 --> 01:35:28,639
range, then we're going to try and move
 

4197
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:30,629
range, then we're going to try and move
higher and we can think about where

4198
01:35:30,629 --> 01:35:30,639
higher and we can think about where
 

4199
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:33,350
higher and we can think about where
delta is stuck above. So 406s is a big

4200
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:33,360
delta is stuck above. So 406s is a big
 

4201
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:37,189
delta is stuck above. So 406s is a big
level. 408 is a big level.

4202
01:35:37,189 --> 01:35:37,199
level. 408 is a big level.
 

4203
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:42,229
level. 408 is a big level.
416s is a big level.

4204
01:35:42,229 --> 01:35:42,239

 

4205
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:44,790

They're trying to bid up now. And I

4206
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:44,800
They're trying to bid up now. And I
 

4207
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:49,030
They're trying to bid up now. And I
would say we go back to

4208
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:49,040

 

4209
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,550

this

4210
01:35:50,550 --> 01:35:50,560
this
 

4211
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:53,430
this
and we're watching 410s and then 430s.

4212
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:53,440
and we're watching 410s and then 430s.
 

4213
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:54,629
and we're watching 410s and then 430s.
Those are really the levels I'd be

4214
01:35:54,629 --> 01:35:54,639
Those are really the levels I'd be
 

4215
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:57,830
Those are really the levels I'd be
watching. 410s, 430s.

4216
01:35:57,830 --> 01:35:57,840
watching. 410s, 430s.
 

4217
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,110
watching. 410s, 430s.
But we are starting to build out

4218
01:35:59,110 --> 01:35:59,120
But we are starting to build out
 

4219
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:03,350
But we are starting to build out
liquidity. Now,

4220
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:03,360

 

4221
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,110

what you don't want to do is be short

4222
01:36:05,110 --> 01:36:05,120
what you don't want to do is be short
 

4223
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:09,750
what you don't want to do is be short
above 460s, 470s today, because that

4224
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:09,760
above 460s, 470s today, because that
 

4225
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:11,270
above 460s, 470s today, because that
would be a look below and fail, right?

4226
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:11,280
would be a look below and fail, right?
 

4227
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:12,790
would be a look below and fail, right?
Be a look below and fail, which is what

4228
01:36:12,790 --> 01:36:12,800
Be a look below and fail, which is what
 

4229
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,510
Be a look below and fail, which is what
we've had the last few days.

4230
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:15,520
we've had the last few days.
 

4231
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:21,189
we've had the last few days.
Okay, so Delta 409's, 416s, 420s.

4232
01:36:21,189 --> 01:36:21,199
Okay, so Delta 409's, 416s, 420s.
 

4233
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:22,790
Okay, so Delta 409's, 416s, 420s.
Who's this guy? [\h__\h] hell, that's

4234
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:22,800
Who's this guy? [\h__\h] hell, that's
 

4235
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,070
Who's this guy? [\h__\h] hell, that's
huge.

4236
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:24,080
huge.
 

4237
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:28,470
huge.
544s is massive. 544s.

4238
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:28,480
544s is massive. 544s.
 

4239
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,070
544s is massive. 544s.
That makes sense in here. I'm going to

4240
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:30,080
That makes sense in here. I'm going to
 

4241
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,830
That makes sense in here. I'm going to
extend this out a little bit. I know

4242
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:31,840
extend this out a little bit. I know
 

4243
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:37,830
extend this out a little bit. I know
he's at 44 just so I can remind myself.

4244
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:37,840

 

4245
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:48,070

And the way I'm seeing that is

4246
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:48,080

 

4247
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,910

this guy here. Think about how much

4248
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:49,920
this guy here. Think about how much
 

4249
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,189
this guy here. Think about how much
buying took place here.

4250
01:36:53,189 --> 01:36:53,199
buying took place here.
 

4251
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:55,109
buying took place here.
Right. It's this guy we need trapped.

4252
01:36:55,109 --> 01:36:55,119
Right. It's this guy we need trapped.
 

4253
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:56,950
Right. It's this guy we need trapped.
All these guys, whoever was buying here,

4254
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:56,960
All these guys, whoever was buying here,
 

4255
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:58,310
All these guys, whoever was buying here,
that's who we need trapped. They need to

4256
01:36:58,310 --> 01:36:58,320
that's who we need trapped. They need to
 

4257
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:02,310
that's who we need trapped. They need to
stay trapped for us to move lower.

4258
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:02,320
stay trapped for us to move lower.
 

4259
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:05,189
stay trapped for us to move lower.
Okay, we have some guys here as well.

4260
01:37:05,189 --> 01:37:05,199
Okay, we have some guys here as well.
 

4261
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:07,910
Okay, we have some guys here as well.
This is all buyers stuck. All right, so

4262
01:37:07,910 --> 01:37:07,920
This is all buyers stuck. All right, so
 

4263
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:10,390
This is all buyers stuck. All right, so
this guy and this guy up here. Oh, we

4264
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:10,400
this guy and this guy up here. Oh, we
 

4265
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,470
this guy and this guy up here. Oh, we
need to keep them trapped. And if we can

4266
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:12,480
need to keep them trapped. And if we can
 

4267
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:13,669
need to keep them trapped. And if we can
keep them trapped, we can have a go

4268
01:37:13,669 --> 01:37:13,679
keep them trapped, we can have a go
 

4269
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:15,109
keep them trapped, we can have a go
lower. We need to be aware of where the

4270
01:37:15,109 --> 01:37:15,119
lower. We need to be aware of where the
 

4271
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:17,830
lower. We need to be aware of where the
shorts got stuck here. 350s. Right. So

4272
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:17,840
shorts got stuck here. 350s. Right. So
 

4273
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,350
shorts got stuck here. 350s. Right. So
if you get short now, the difference is

4274
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:19,360
if you get short now, the difference is
 

4275
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,590
if you get short now, the difference is
now if you're going to get short here,

4276
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:21,600
now if you're going to get short here,
 

4277
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,350
now if you're going to get short here,
you must cover some into this because

4278
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:23,360
you must cover some into this because
 

4279
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:26,229
you must cover some into this because
you don't know that this washes, right?

4280
01:37:26,229 --> 01:37:26,239
you don't know that this washes, right?
 

4281
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:28,709
you don't know that this washes, right?
You don't know. So if it offers a short

4282
01:37:28,709 --> 01:37:28,719
You don't know. So if it offers a short
 

4283
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:31,990
You don't know. So if it offers a short
up here, you must respect these levels,

4284
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:32,000
up here, you must respect these levels,
 

4285
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,270
up here, you must respect these levels,
mustn't you? You don't know that we make

4286
01:37:33,270 --> 01:37:33,280
mustn't you? You don't know that we make
 

4287
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,669
mustn't you? You don't know that we make
a lower low. So you always pay yourself

4288
01:37:35,669 --> 01:37:35,679
a lower low. So you always pay yourself
 

4289
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:37,510
a lower low. So you always pay yourself
now because now you've got structure

4290
01:37:37,510 --> 01:37:37,520
now because now you've got structure
 

4291
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:39,030
now because now you've got structure
where you must pay yourself some and

4292
01:37:39,030 --> 01:37:39,040
where you must pay yourself some and
 

4293
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:41,189
where you must pay yourself some and
then your runners for lower. Hopefully

4294
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:41,199
then your runners for lower. Hopefully
 

4295
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:42,790
then your runners for lower. Hopefully
that makes sense. I'm trying my best to

4296
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:42,800
that makes sense. I'm trying my best to
 

4297
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:50,229
that makes sense. I'm trying my best to
teach it as we go here.

4298
01:37:50,229 --> 01:37:50,239

 

4299
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:51,910

All right. So, if we go back to Bootmap,

4300
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:51,920
All right. So, if we go back to Bootmap,
 

4301
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,070
All right. So, if we go back to Bootmap,
we're rejecting that same box. We've

4302
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:54,080
we're rejecting that same box. We've
 

4303
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:55,510
we're rejecting that same box. We've
just created more buyers trapped up

4304
01:37:55,510 --> 01:37:55,520
just created more buyers trapped up
 

4305
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:57,189
just created more buyers trapped up
there again. They're currently stuck in

4306
01:37:57,189 --> 01:37:57,199
there again. They're currently stuck in
 

4307
01:37:57,199 --> 01:38:05,510
there again. They're currently stuck in
that same box we just talked about.

4308
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:05,520

 

4309
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:08,070

Starting to see aggressive sellers

4310
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:08,080
Starting to see aggressive sellers
 

4311
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:09,990
Starting to see aggressive sellers
stepping in here. And if you are now

4312
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:10,000
stepping in here. And if you are now
 

4313
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,950
stepping in here. And if you are now
short, you want to be covering into that

4314
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:12,960
short, you want to be covering into that
 

4315
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,390
short, you want to be covering into that
pivot that I just talked about. All

4316
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:14,400
pivot that I just talked about. All
 

4317
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,709
pivot that I just talked about. All
right? So you want to be watching down

4318
01:38:16,709 --> 01:38:16,719
right? So you want to be watching down
 

4319
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:19,270
right? So you want to be watching down
into 360s. You must cover some in 360s.

4320
01:38:19,270 --> 01:38:19,280
into 360s. You must cover some in 360s.
 

4321
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,430
into 360s. You must cover some in 360s.
I'm currently short in this now. And I

4322
01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:21,440
I'm currently short in this now. And I
 

4323
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,109
I'm currently short in this now. And I
will take some off into 360s and hold

4324
01:38:23,109 --> 01:38:23,119
will take some off into 360s and hold
 

4325
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:24,470
will take some off into 360s and hold
runners for a flush below. So there's

4326
01:38:24,470 --> 01:38:24,480
runners for a flush below. So there's
 

4327
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,950
runners for a flush below. So there's
the See how we instantly hit 360 and

4328
01:38:26,950 --> 01:38:26,960
the See how we instantly hit 360 and
 

4329
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:29,189
the See how we instantly hit 360 and
found an an initial bid. Now if we flush

4330
01:38:29,189 --> 01:38:29,199
found an an initial bid. Now if we flush
 

4331
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:30,550
found an an initial bid. Now if we flush
below this, it would be really nice. And

4332
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:30,560
below this, it would be really nice. And
 

4333
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:33,350
below this, it would be really nice. And
the next level here is 350. That's point

4334
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:33,360
the next level here is 350. That's point
 

4335
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,830
the next level here is 350. That's point
of control on the session now is 350. We

4336
01:38:35,830 --> 01:38:35,840
of control on the session now is 350. We
 

4337
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:38,709
of control on the session now is 350. We
need to get beneath 350. If we can't get

4338
01:38:38,709 --> 01:38:38,719
need to get beneath 350. If we can't get
 

4339
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:40,629
need to get beneath 350. If we can't get
beneath 350, it's a problem. I don't

4340
01:38:40,629 --> 01:38:40,639
beneath 350, it's a problem. I don't
 

4341
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:42,550
beneath 350, it's a problem. I don't
know why Trading View has PC up here,

4342
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:42,560
know why Trading View has PC up here,
 

4343
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,709
know why Trading View has PC up here,
but it's actually at 350 now. So, I'm

4344
01:38:44,709 --> 01:38:44,719
but it's actually at 350 now. So, I'm
 

4345
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:49,030
but it's actually at 350 now. So, I'm
watching 350.

4346
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:49,040

 

4347
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:51,030

Nice continuation. And if we can get

4348
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:51,040
Nice continuation. And if we can get
 

4349
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:52,709
Nice continuation. And if we can get
under here, there's potential to go

4350
01:38:52,709 --> 01:38:52,719
under here, there's potential to go
 

4351
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:54,470
under here, there's potential to go
lower.

4352
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:54,480
lower.
 

4353
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:57,430
lower.
So, already paid myself a bit into 60s

4354
01:38:57,430 --> 01:38:57,440
So, already paid myself a bit into 60s
 

4355
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,030
So, already paid myself a bit into 60s
now. Just waiting to see. Here we go.

4356
01:38:59,030 --> 01:38:59,040
now. Just waiting to see. Here we go.
 

4357
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:01,189
now. Just waiting to see. Here we go.
Come on, baby. You got to get through 50

4358
01:39:01,189 --> 01:39:01,199
Come on, baby. You got to get through 50
 

4359
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:03,510
Come on, baby. You got to get through 50
or I'm out. You got to get through 50 or

4360
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:03,520
or I'm out. You got to get through 50 or
 

4361
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,510
or I'm out. You got to get through 50 or
I am out.

4362
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:05,520
I am out.
 

4363
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:06,870
I am out.
Because a big seller just jumped in

4364
01:39:06,870 --> 01:39:06,880
Because a big seller just jumped in
 

4365
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,350
Because a big seller just jumped in
here. 361 lot. You can see them on bookm

4366
01:39:09,350 --> 01:39:09,360
here. 361 lot. You can see them on bookm
 

4367
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:13,189
here. 361 lot. You can see them on bookm
right here. 380. Here we go. 50 50 50 50

4368
01:39:13,189 --> 01:39:13,199
right here. 380. Here we go. 50 50 50 50
 

4369
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:14,870
right here. 380. Here we go. 50 50 50 50
50 50 50 50. They're reloading. We need

4370
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:14,880
50 50 50 50. They're reloading. We need
 

4371
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,870
50 50 50 50. They're reloading. We need
a snap now. Otherwise, Alex is out of

4372
01:39:16,870 --> 01:39:16,880
a snap now. Otherwise, Alex is out of
 

4373
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,790
a snap now. Otherwise, Alex is out of
this because they're trying to

4374
01:39:18,790 --> 01:39:18,800
this because they're trying to
 

4375
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:20,709
this because they're trying to
aggressively sell without the ability to

4376
01:39:20,709 --> 01:39:20,719
aggressively sell without the ability to
 

4377
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:22,149
aggressively sell without the ability to
move low, which means there is a passive

4378
01:39:22,149 --> 01:39:22,159
move low, which means there is a passive
 

4379
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:23,830
move low, which means there is a passive
buyer sitting here trying to absorb the

4380
01:39:23,830 --> 01:39:23,840
buyer sitting here trying to absorb the
 

4381
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:26,790
buyer sitting here trying to absorb the
tape. So, I'm out. There we go. And I

4382
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:26,800
tape. So, I'm out. There we go. And I
 

4383
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,070
tape. So, I'm out. There we go. And I
can always get back in. And this is how

4384
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:28,080
can always get back in. And this is how
 

4385
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,830
can always get back in. And this is how
I trade. Like, if I'm playing

4386
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:29,840
I trade. Like, if I'm playing
 

4387
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:37,910
I trade. Like, if I'm playing
continuation, I can always get back in.

4388
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:37,920

 

4389
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:41,270

Uh well it it actually is based on tick

4390
01:39:41,270 --> 01:39:41,280
Uh well it it actually is based on tick
 

4391
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,350
Uh well it it actually is based on tick
volume and delta volume. It is down here

4392
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:43,360
volume and delta volume. It is down here
 

4393
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:46,070
volume and delta volume. It is down here
now. It's moved down here

4394
01:39:46,070 --> 01:39:46,080
now. It's moved down here
 

4395
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,510
now. It's moved down here
right right here.

4396
01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:49,520
right right here.
 

4397
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:50,870
right right here.
Watching this level. You see see how

4398
01:39:50,870 --> 01:39:50,880
Watching this level. You see see how
 

4399
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:51,990
Watching this level. You see see how
we're respecting this level. Big

4400
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:52,000
we're respecting this level. Big
 

4401
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,750
we're respecting this level. Big
sellers. Big sellers. Big sellers. We

4402
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:53,760
sellers. Big sellers. Big sellers. We
 

4403
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,270
sellers. Big sellers. Big sellers. We
have to get below this. This is volume

4404
01:39:55,270 --> 01:39:55,280
have to get below this. This is volume
 

4405
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,990
have to get below this. This is volume
point control currently based on delta.

4406
01:39:57,990 --> 01:39:58,000
point control currently based on delta.
 

4407
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,270
point control currently based on delta.
And if we flush this we're going to come

4408
01:39:59,270 --> 01:39:59,280
And if we flush this we're going to come
 

4409
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:01,750
And if we flush this we're going to come
all the way down to here. So here we go.

4410
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:01,760
all the way down to here. So here we go.
 

4411
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:09,910
all the way down to here. So here we go.
If they hold this, squeeze back up.

4412
01:40:09,910 --> 01:40:09,920

 

4413
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,430

I'm just saying what I'm seeing. If it

4414
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:11,440
I'm just saying what I'm seeing. If it
 

4415
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,350
I'm just saying what I'm seeing. If it
doesn't line up with what you're seeing,

4416
01:40:13,350 --> 01:40:13,360
doesn't line up with what you're seeing,
 

4417
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:16,070
doesn't line up with what you're seeing,
uh, I don't know. This is just what I'm

4418
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:16,080
uh, I don't know. This is just what I'm
 

4419
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:17,669
uh, I don't know. This is just what I'm
seeing.

4420
01:40:17,669 --> 01:40:17,679
seeing.
 

4421
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:19,030
seeing.
You know, you can see they're absorbing

4422
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:19,040
You know, you can see they're absorbing
 

4423
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:22,229
You know, you can see they're absorbing
50 50. But it's based on delta, I guess.

4424
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:22,239
50 50. But it's based on delta, I guess.
 

4425
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:24,550
50 50. But it's based on delta, I guess.
So,

4426
01:40:24,550 --> 01:40:24,560
So,
 

4427
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:28,629
So,
it's big level.

4428
01:40:28,629 --> 01:40:28,639

 

4429
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:31,350

Big level. Lose this low day. Hold this

4430
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:31,360
Big level. Lose this low day. Hold this
 

4431
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,510
Big level. Lose this low day. Hold this
then second leg higher. All right. So

4432
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:33,520
then second leg higher. All right. So
 

4433
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:36,229
then second leg higher. All right. So
lose this.

4434
01:40:36,229 --> 01:40:36,239
lose this.
 

4435
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:39,669
lose this.
Oh, lose this. Come on Trading View.

4436
01:40:39,669 --> 01:40:39,679
Oh, lose this. Come on Trading View.
 

4437
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:41,510
Oh, lose this. Come on Trading View.
Come on. Come on. Trading View. Lose

4438
01:40:41,510 --> 01:40:41,520
Come on. Come on. Trading View. Lose
 

4439

4555
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,790
or it can actually go at 50, right? So
your stop now in the money. You protect

01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:00,800
your stop now in the money. You protect
 

4557
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,390
your stop now in the money. You protect
versus this shelf. You don't want to

4558
01:43:02,390 --> 01:43:02,400
versus this shelf. You don't want to
 

4559
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,070
versus this shelf. You don't want to
reclaim with that. So if you took any

4560
01:43:04,070 --> 01:43:04,080
reclaim with that. So if you took any
 

4561
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:06,310
reclaim with that. So if you took any
short here, stop now at 50. You look for

4562
01:43:06,310 --> 01:43:06,320
short here, stop now at 50. You look for
 

4563
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,390
short here, stop now at 50. You look for
low of dayb breakak and ideally you get

01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:08,400
low of dayb breakak and ideally you get
 

4565
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:10,950
low of dayb breakak and ideally you get
196 and 900. All right? So I don't want

4566
01:43:10,950 --> 01:43:10,960
196 and 900. All right? So I don't want
 

4567
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:13,990
196 and 900. All right? So I don't want

coming up, and the levels I'm looking

4632
01:44:36,790 --> 01:44:36,800
coming up, and the levels I'm looking
 

4633
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,870
coming up, and the levels I'm looking
at, the big levels that buyers and

4634
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:38,880
at, the big levels that buyers and
 

4635
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,550
at, the big levels that buyers and
sellers need to defend. If you just mark

4636
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:40,560
sellers need to defend. If you just mark
 

4637
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:41,830
sellers need to defend. If you just mark
those on your charts and you trade

4638
01:44:41,830 --> 01:44:41,840
those on your charts and you trade
 

4639
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:44,149
those on your charts and you trade
around those levels, you'll probably

4640
01:44:44,149 --> 01:44:44,159
around those levels, you'll probably
 

4641
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:45,990
around those levels, you'll probably
find that you start having better

4642
01:44:45,990 --> 01:44:46,000
find that you start having better
 

4643
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,270
find that you start having better
performing trades. Because for me, a big

4644
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:49,280
performing trades. Because for me, a big
 

4645
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:50,950
performing trades. Because for me, a big
part of trading is trading in the right

4646
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:50,960
part of trading is trading in the right
 

4647
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:53,189
part of trading is trading in the right
levels. Understanding the market is one

4648
01:44:53,189 --> 01:44:53,199
levels. Understanding the market is one
 

4649
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:55,109
levels. Understanding the market is one
thing, but trading in the right levels.

4650
01:44:55,109 --> 01:44:55,119
thing, but trading in the right levels.
 

4651
01:44:55,119 --> 01:44:57,830
thing, but trading in the right levels.
Having the discipline to not trade in

4652
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:57,840
Having the discipline to not trade in
 

4653
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:00,550
Having the discipline to not trade in
poor levels is important.

4654
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:00,560
poor levels is important.
 

4655
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:01,910
poor levels is important.
You're trading in poor levels, you will

4656
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:01,920
You're trading in poor levels, you will
 

4657
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:03,270
You're trading in poor levels, you will
get chopped up. If you traded in those

4658
01:45:03,270 --> 01:45:03,280
get chopped up. If you traded in those
 

4659
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:05,109
get chopped up. If you traded in those
range rotations all week, I mean, unless

4660
01:45:05,109 --> 01:45:05,119
range rotations all week, I mean, unless
 

4661
01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:06,390
range rotations all week, I mean, unless
you love that stuff, you will get

4662
01:45:06,390 --> 01:45:06,400
you love that stuff, you will get
 

4663
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:07,750
you love that stuff, you will get
chopped up. And big sellers coming in

4664
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:07,760
chopped up. And big sellers coming in
 

4665
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:09,109
chopped up. And big sellers coming in
here. We should break down here, folks.

4666
01:45:09,109 --> 01:45:09,119
here. We should break down here, folks.
 

4667
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:10,550
here. We should break down here, folks.
You should see a new low day. They're

4668
01:45:10,550 --> 01:45:10,560
You should see a new low day. They're
 

4669
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:11,830
You should see a new low day. They're
trying very hard to get underneath

4670
01:45:11,830 --> 01:45:11,840
trying very hard to get underneath
 

4671
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,510
trying very hard to get underneath
initial balance. Technically speaking,

4672
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:13,520
initial balance. Technically speaking,
 

4673
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:16,790
initial balance. Technically speaking,
if we get under IB, we can have an

4674
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:16,800
if we get under IB, we can have an
 

4675
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,350
if we get under IB, we can have an
expansion model of an IB, which would be

4676
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:19,360
expansion model of an IB, which would be
 

4677
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:23,910
expansion model of an IB, which would be
amazing.

4678
01:45:23,910 --> 01:45:23,920

 

4679
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,830

Why did you not sure if you knew it was

4680
01:45:25,830 --> 01:45:25,840
Why did you not sure if you knew it was
 

4681
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,310
Why did you not sure if you knew it was
happening? I I

4682
01:45:28,310 --> 01:45:28,320
happening? I I
 

4683
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:32,149
happening? I I
Jack, I did.

4684
01:45:32,149 --> 01:45:32,159
Jack, I did.
 

4685
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,229
Jack, I did.
Go back on stream. I did. There's the

4686
01:45:34,229 --> 01:45:34,239
Go back on stream. I did. There's the
 

4687
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:36,950
Go back on stream. I did. There's the
breakdown. I did. I just got knocked out

4688
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:36,960
breakdown. I did. I just got knocked out
 

4689
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:38,790
breakdown. I did. I just got knocked out
against 50s.

4690
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:38,800
against 50s.
 

4691
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,229
against 50s.
I don't know if you're purposely here to

4692
01:45:40,229 --> 01:45:40,239
I don't know if you're purposely here to
 

4693
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:42,149
I don't know if you're purposely here to
be a dick like normal or you're actually

4694
01:45:42,149 --> 01:45:42,159
be a dick like normal or you're actually
 

4695
01:45:42,159 --> 01:45:45,590
be a dick like normal or you're actually
like genuine, but I did. Here's the

4696
01:45:45,590 --> 01:45:45,600
like genuine, but I did. Here's the
 

4697
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:46,950
like genuine, but I did. Here's the
breakdown. So, here's the expansion

4698
01:45:46,950 --> 01:45:46,960
breakdown. So, here's the expansion
 

4699
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:48,629
breakdown. So, here's the expansion
model. Previous week low now is the

4700
01:45:48,629 --> 01:45:48,639
model. Previous week low now is the
 

4701
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:53,350
model. Previous week low now is the
level to come to. Big expansion.

4702
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:53,360
level to come to. Big expansion.
 

4703
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:56,390
level to come to. Big expansion.
Okay, so previous week low here, 190s.

4704
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:56,400
Okay, so previous week low here, 190s.
 

4705
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:58,310
Okay, so previous week low here, 190s.
And if you fail that, the naked point of

4706
01:45:58,310 --> 01:45:58,320
And if you fail that, the naked point of
 

4707
01:45:58,320 --> 01:45:59,669
And if you fail that, the naked point of
control. So, those of you holding for

4708
01:45:59,669 --> 01:45:59,679
control. So, those of you holding for
 

4709
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:04,629
control. So, those of you holding for
naked point of control might get it.

4710
01:46:04,629 --> 01:46:04,639

 

4711
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:06,310

Oh, I'm annoyed. I got knocked out of 50

4712
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:06,320
Oh, I'm annoyed. I got knocked out of 50
 

4713
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:10,629
Oh, I'm annoyed. I got knocked out of 50
now.

4714
01:46:10,629 --> 01:46:10,639

 

4715
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:12,709

150 point trade. Missed there. Why

4716
01:46:12,709 --> 01:46:12,719
150 point trade. Missed there. Why
 

4717
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:19,030
150 point trade. Missed there. Why
getting knocked out of 50 [\h__\h]

4718
01:46:19,030 --> 01:46:19,040

 

4719
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,950

So value area low moving lower now.

4720
01:46:20,950 --> 01:46:20,960
So value area low moving lower now.
 

4721
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,430
So value area low moving lower now.
Chasing the market down. Not me chasing

point. All right. There's the bare flag
 

4731
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:31,990
point. All right. There's the bare flag
we talked about. There's the breakdown.

4732
01:46:31,990 --> 01:46:32,000
we talked about. There's the breakdown.
 

4733
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,990
we talked about. There's the breakdown.
There's the fail of 50s. There's the

There's the fail of 50s. There's the
 

4735
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,950
There's the fail of 50s. There's the
move. Next point is here. So TP1 here,

4736
01:46:36,950 --> 01:46:36,960
move. Next point is here. So TP1 here,
 

4737
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:39,910
move. Next point is here. So TP1 here,
TP2 down here. You do not want to do

4738
01:46:39,910 --> 01:46:39,920
TP2 down here. You do not want to do
 

4739
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:41,750
TP2 down here. You do not want to do
anything beyond this. The market, if the

4740
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:41,760
anything beyond this. The market, if the
 

4741
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,709
anything beyond this. The market, if the
market gravitates to this, fantastic.

4742
01:46:44,709 --> 01:46:44,719
market gravitates to this, fantastic.
 

4743
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:46,310
market gravitates to this, fantastic.
You don't need to do anything beyond

4744
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:46,320
You don't need to do anything beyond
 

4745
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:48,149
You don't need to do anything beyond
that. That is probably maximum move for

4746
01:46:48,149 --> 01:46:48,159
that. That is probably maximum move for
 

4747
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:53,430
that. That is probably maximum move for
the day. Okay.

4748
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:53,440

 

4749
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:55,030

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Willer.

4750
01:46:55,030 --> 01:46:55,040
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Willer.
 

4751
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:56,870
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Willer.
That's Yeah, I mean, you will know I had

4752
01:46:56,870 --> 01:46:56,880
That's Yeah, I mean, you will know I had
 

4753
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,629
That's Yeah, I mean, you will know I had
CO what, two, three weeks ago. It's

4754
01:46:58,629 --> 01:46:58,639
CO what, two, three weeks ago. It's
 

4755
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:05,669
CO what, two, three weeks ago. It's
horrible.

4756
01:47:05,669 --> 01:47:05,679

 

4757
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:08,229

So maybe a reprice here, a rebalance

4758
01:47:08,229 --> 01:47:08,239
So maybe a reprice here, a rebalance
 

4759
01:47:08,239 --> 01:47:11,750
So maybe a reprice here, a rebalance
because that was a very thin move.

4760
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:11,760
because that was a very thin move.
 

4761
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,990
because that was a very thin move.
Buyers have come in here versus 55s. If

4762
01:47:13,990 --> 01:47:14,000
Buyers have come in here versus 55s. If
 

4763
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,910
Buyers have come in here versus 55s. If
they get through 55s, they can maybe get

4764
01:47:15,910 --> 01:47:15,920
they get through 55s, they can maybe get
 

4765
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:17,750
they get through 55s, they can maybe get
back up to 310s. If they get stuck at

4766
01:47:17,750 --> 01:47:17,760
back up to 310s. If they get stuck at
 

4767
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:21,189
back up to 310s. If they get stuck at
55s, you might might see continuation

4768
01:47:21,189 --> 01:47:21,199
55s, you might might see continuation
 

4769
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:22,790
55s, you might might see continuation
back down to that previous week value

4770
01:47:22,790 --> 01:47:22,800
back down to that previous week value
 

4771
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:41,510
back down to that previous week value
area low.

4772
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:41,520

 

4773
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,910

Okay, so watch these 55s because this is

4774
01:47:43,910 --> 01:47:43,920
Okay, so watch these 55s because this is
 

4775
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:45,189
Okay, so watch these 55s because this is
where these buyers keep coming in. If

4776
01:47:45,189 --> 01:47:45,199
where these buyers keep coming in. If
 

4777
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:46,870
where these buyers keep coming in. If
they get through this, they can very

4778
01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:46,880
they get through this, they can very
 

4779
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,310
they get through this, they can very
well squeeze all the way back to 310.

4780
01:47:48,310 --> 01:47:48,320
well squeeze all the way back to 310.
 

4781
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,229
well squeeze all the way back to 310.
Remember, this was a very sharp snap.

4782
01:47:50,229 --> 01:47:50,239
Remember, this was a very sharp snap.
 

4783
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:52,709
Remember, this was a very sharp snap.
So, we we need to fill in some of the

4784
01:47:52,709 --> 01:47:52,719
So, we we need to fill in some of the
 

4785
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:54,390
So, we we need to fill in some of the
participants here who are waiting to get

4786
01:47:54,390 --> 01:47:54,400
participants here who are waiting to get
 

4787
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:57,830
participants here who are waiting to get
filled. I would say now any reclaim of

4788
01:47:57,830 --> 01:47:57,840
filled. I would say now any reclaim of
 

4789
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,830
filled. I would say now any reclaim of
this, do not touch it. But all the time

4790
01:47:59,830 --> 01:47:59,840
this, do not touch it. But all the time
 

4791
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:02,229
this, do not touch it. But all the time
we reject this, we're still looking for

4792
01:48:02,229 --> 01:48:02,239
we reject this, we're still looking for
 

4793
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:03,990
we reject this, we're still looking for
lower prices. All right, we're in a

4794
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:04,000
lower prices. All right, we're in a
 

4795
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,510
lower prices. All right, we're in a
trend. We're in a trend continuation.

4796
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:05,520
trend. We're in a trend continuation.
 

4797
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,750
trend. We're in a trend continuation.
But if we start reclaiming this, I'd be

4798
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:07,760
But if we start reclaiming this, I'd be
 

4799
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:09,430
But if we start reclaiming this, I'd be
done with it for the day. I think the

4800
01:48:09,430 --> 01:48:09,440
done with it for the day. I think the
 

4801
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:11,510
done with it for the day. I think the
best moves probably happen now. You

4802
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:11,520
best moves probably happen now. You
 

4803
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,870
best moves probably happen now. You
should just be holding your positions

4804
01:48:12,870 --> 01:48:12,880
should just be holding your positions
 

4805
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:15,270
should just be holding your positions
that that you got in hopefully with what

4806
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:15,280
that that you got in hopefully with what
 

4807
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:16,470
that that you got in hopefully with what
I was calling out. Hopefully you didn't

4808
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:16,480
I was calling out. Hopefully you didn't
 

4809
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:18,550
I was calling out. Hopefully you didn't
get knocked out at 55 like I did like an

4810
01:48:18,550 --> 01:48:18,560
get knocked out at 55 like I did like an
 

4811
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:22,149
get knocked out at 55 like I did like an
absolute wally. We have imbalances here

4812
01:48:22,149 --> 01:48:22,159
absolute wally. We have imbalances here
 

4813
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:24,070
absolute wally. We have imbalances here
all the way up to 307s, right? all the

4814
01:48:24,070 --> 01:48:24,080
all the way up to 307s, right? all the
 

4815
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:28,390
all the way up to 307s, right? all the
way up to 307s.

4816
01:48:28,390 --> 01:48:28,400

 

4817

everyone.
Nice. Some of you catching that.

4828
01:48:43,030 --> 01:48:43,040
Nice. Some of you catching that.
 

4829
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:44,550
Nice. Some of you catching that.
I just talked you through your biggest

4830
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:44,560
I just talked you through your biggest
 

4831
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:46,870
I just talked you through your biggest
NQ win ever. That's awesome. Apex still

4834
01:48:48,229 --> 01:48:48,239

4835
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:53,830
on sale? Yeah, Apex is still on sale
till Tuesday, I believe.

4836
01:48:53,830 --> 01:48:53,840

 

4837
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,910

Okay. So, what happened at that low?

4838
01:48:55,910 --> 01:48:55,920
Okay. So, what happened at that low?
 

4839
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:58,229
Okay. So, what happened at that low?
Right at that low of day, we have 99

4840
01:48:58,229 --> 01:48:58,239
Right at that low of day, we have 99
 

4841
01:48:58,239 --> 01:49:00,790
Right at that low of day, we have 99
sellers caught offside there. All right.

4842
01:49:00,790 --> 01:49:00,800
sellers caught offside there. All right.
 

4843
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,030
sellers caught offside there. All right.
So, 24s, that's where the sellers are

4844
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:03,040
So, 24s, that's where the sellers are
 

4845
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:05,669
So, 24s, that's where the sellers are
caught offside at 24s.

4846
01:49:05,669 --> 01:49:05,679
caught offside at 24s.
 

4847
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:08,470
caught offside at 24s.
We have a balance to fill here. Some at

4848
01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:08,480
We have a balance to fill here. Some at
 

4849
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:12,229
We have a balance to fill here. Some at
80, some at 92, some at 95, some at 300,

4850
01:49:12,229 --> 01:49:12,239
80, some at 92, some at 95, some at 300,
 

4851
01:49:12,239 --> 01:49:20,629
80, some at 92, some at 95, some at 300,
some above that. All right.

4852
01:49:20,629 --> 01:49:20,639

 

4853
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:23,430

So sellers are stuck at 94s and there's

4854
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:23,440
So sellers are stuck at 94s and there's
 

4855
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:26,950
So sellers are stuck at 94s and there's
repric higher available. Um but you know

4856
01:49:26,950 --> 01:49:26,960
repric higher available. Um but you know
 

4857
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,350
repric higher available. Um but you know
I'd stay short bias unless we reclaim

4858
01:49:29,350 --> 01:49:29,360
I'd stay short bias unless we reclaim
 

4859
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:31,189
I'd stay short bias unless we reclaim
everything. But right now it's getting a

4860
01:49:31,189 --> 01:49:31,199
everything. But right now it's getting a
 

4861
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:32,870
everything. But right now it's getting a
little bit thin. So you just want to be

4862
01:49:32,870 --> 01:49:32,880
little bit thin. So you just want to be
 

4863
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:34,950
little bit thin. So you just want to be
a little bit careful.

4864
01:49:34,950 --> 01:49:34,960
a little bit careful.
 

4865
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:36,629
a little bit careful.
But I think we can still move down to

4866
01:49:36,629 --> 01:49:36,639
But I think we can still move down to
 

4867
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:39,430
But I think we can still move down to
that previous week low and then beyond

4868
01:49:39,430 --> 01:49:39,440
that previous week low and then beyond
 

4869
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,750
that previous week low and then beyond
that to that uh naked point of control I

4870
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:41,760
that to that uh naked point of control I
 

4871
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,990
that to that uh naked point of control I
keep banging on about.

4872
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:44,000
keep banging on about.
 

4873
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,229
keep banging on about.
Right. So this green line is ideally

4874
01:49:46,229 --> 01:49:46,239
Right. So this green line is ideally
 

4875
01:49:46,239 --> 01:49:48,310
Right. So this green line is ideally
your next TP. Ideally all this is a

4876
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:48,320
your next TP. Ideally all this is a
 

4877
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,950
your next TP. Ideally all this is a
build out. There's your TP and then in

4878
01:49:50,950 --> 01:49:50,960
build out. There's your TP and then in
 

4879
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:51,990
build out. There's your TP and then in
here. All right. And that's your

4880
01:49:51,990 --> 01:49:52,000
here. All right. And that's your
 

4881
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,470
here. All right. And that's your
ultimate TP. This is your ultimate TP.

4882
01:49:54,470 --> 01:49:54,480
ultimate TP. This is your ultimate TP.
 

4883
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:55,830
ultimate TP. This is your ultimate TP.
It's where I've said the market has

4884
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:55,840
It's where I've said the market has
 

4885
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,590
It's where I've said the market has
wanted to come for a long time. It needs

4886
01:49:57,590 --> 01:49:57,600
wanted to come for a long time. It needs
 

4887
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:59,750
wanted to come for a long time. It needs
to retest that area. It's left it alone

4888
01:49:59,750 --> 01:49:59,760
to retest that area. It's left it alone
 

4889
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:04,310
to retest that area. It's left it alone
far too long.

4890
01:50:04,310 --> 01:50:04,320

 

4891
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:06,310

This previous week low. Once we snap

4892
01:50:06,310 --> 01:50:06,320
This previous week low. Once we snap
 

4893
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:08,470
This previous week low. Once we snap
this, I tell you what, I'll put a little

4894
01:50:08,470 --> 01:50:08,480
this, I tell you what, I'll put a little
 

4895
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:10,149
this, I tell you what, I'll put a little
bit of volume in here so we can just see

4896
01:50:10,149 --> 01:50:10,159
bit of volume in here so we can just see
 

4897
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:12,310
bit of volume in here so we can just see
a level. Right? This is a level. Once we

01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:12,320
a level. Right? This is a level. Once we
 

4899
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:14,229
a level. Right? This is a level. Once we
snap this, this is the cue that we go

01:50:14,229 --> 01:50:14,239
snap this, this is the cue that we go
 

4901

snap this, this is the cue that we go
here. this gray box

4902
01:50:18,390 --> 01:50:18,400

 

4903

01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,750
um really from Wednesday the 26th
I think we're going to move low. I think

4910
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:27,760
I think we're going to move low. I think
 

4911
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:29,430
I think we're going to move low. I think
you're going to get it. Just be careful

4912
01:50:29,430 --> 01:50:29,440
you're going to get it. Just be careful
 

4913
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:30,709
you're going to get it. Just be careful
though. This is where these sellers keep

4914
01:50:30,709 --> 01:50:30,719
though. This is where these sellers keep
 

4915
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:32,790
though. This is where these sellers keep
trying to come in here at these 24s I

4916
01:50:32,790 --> 01:50:32,800
trying to come in here at these 24s I
 

4917
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,030
trying to come in here at these 24s I
keep talking about. But they look like

4918
01:50:35,030 --> 01:50:35,040
keep talking about. But they look like
 

4919
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:38,070
keep talking about. But they look like
they want it. Uh spy now under 82. That

4920
01:50:38,070 --> 01:50:38,080
they want it. Uh spy now under 82. That
 

4921
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,510
they want it. Uh spy now under 82. That
is a problem for the market. Like I

4922
01:50:39,510 --> 01:50:39,520
is a problem for the market. Like I
 

4923
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:41,750
is a problem for the market. Like I
said, anything under 82, this market can

4924
01:50:41,750 --> 01:50:41,760
said, anything under 82, this market can
 

4925
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:46,310
said, anything under 82, this market can
uh get quite nasty. And SPY is now half

4926
01:50:46,310 --> 01:50:46,320
uh get quite nasty. And SPY is now half
 

4927
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,229
uh get quite nasty. And SPY is now half
a point under it. And I think you're

4928
01:50:48,229 --> 01:50:48,239
a point under it. And I think you're
 

4929
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:49,750
a point under it. And I think you're
going to get the previous week low here.

I said that you don't have to choose
 

4971
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:58,310
I said that you don't have to choose

4995
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:21,350

fantastic. But, you know, anything

4996
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:21,360
fantastic. But, you know, anything
 

4997
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:24,390

spying to 680s. All right. If we lose

5000
01:52:26,950 --> 01:52:26,960
spying to 680s. All right. If we lose
 

5001
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:29,910
spying to 680s. All right. If we lose
680 and spy, when I checked last night,

5002
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:29,920
680 and spy, when I checked last night,
 

5003
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:32,950
680 and spy, when I checked last night,
there were no put walls. They were so

5004
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:32,960
there were no put walls. They were so
 

5005
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:35,270
there were no put walls. They were so
thin. The put walls, I don't think they

5006
01:52:35,270 --> 01:52:35,280
thin. The put walls, I don't think they
 

5007
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:38,070
thin. The put walls, I don't think they
expected this move. If they lose 680s on

5008
01:52:38,070 --> 01:52:38,080
expected this move. If they lose 680s on
 

5009
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:45,109
expected this move. If they lose 680s on
SPY, it is game over. Game over market.

5010
01:52:45,109 --> 01:52:45,119

 

5011

So, massive, massive levels. You see the
gray box, edge of the gray box. Just

5014
01:52:48,390 --> 01:52:48,400
gray box, edge of the gray box. Just
 

5015
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:49,990
gray box, edge of the gray box. Just
like we talked about the blue box. How

5016
01:52:49,990 --> 01:52:50,000
like we talked about the blue box. How
 

5017
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,390
like we talked about the blue box. How
did I do this? How did I do it? So that

5018
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:52,400
did I do this? How did I do it? So that
 

5019
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:53,990
did I do this? How did I do it? So that
you guys can learn. How did I find this

5020
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:54,000
you guys can learn. How did I find this
 

5021
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,470
you guys can learn. How did I find this
gray box? Why is it edge? Look at this

5022
01:52:56,470 --> 01:52:56,480
gray box? Why is it edge? Look at this
 

5023
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:58,070
gray box? Why is it edge? Look at this
volume here. All right. Can you see this

5024
01:52:58,070 --> 01:52:58,080
volume here. All right. Can you see this
 

5025
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,669
volume here. All right. Can you see this
volume here? This is a weekly volume

5026
01:52:59,669 --> 01:52:59,679
volume here? This is a weekly volume
 

5027
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:01,430
volume here? This is a weekly volume
level. All right. It was created here.

5028
01:53:01,430 --> 01:53:01,440
level. All right. It was created here.
 

5029
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,870
level. All right. It was created here.
Here's the edge of volume. Here's the

5030
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:02,880
Here's the edge of volume. Here's the
 

5031
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:04,709
Here's the edge of volume. Here's the
lower volume. This is the rotation.

5032
01:53:04,709 --> 01:53:04,719
lower volume. This is the rotation.
 

5033
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:06,790
lower volume. This is the rotation.
Remember, when you see big volume, we

5034
01:53:06,790 --> 01:53:06,800
Remember, when you see big volume, we
 

5035
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:09,669
Remember, when you see big volume, we
rotate in here. We might well rotate. We

5036
01:53:09,669 --> 01:53:09,679
rotate in here. We might well rotate. We
 

5037
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:12,550
rotate in here. We might well rotate. We
lose that shelf. We're coming to here,

5038
01:53:12,550 --> 01:53:12,560
lose that shelf. We're coming to here,
 

5039
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:15,350
lose that shelf. We're coming to here,
right? Because we're thin in there. We

5040
01:53:15,350 --> 01:53:15,360
right? Because we're thin in there. We
 

5041
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:18,629
right? Because we're thin in there. We
lose that shelf. we come to there.

5042
01:53:18,629 --> 01:53:18,639
lose that shelf. we come to there.
 

5043
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:20,229
lose that shelf. we come to there.
I'm about to get fully out of this on

5103
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:31,830

Yeah, it's that is a market in rotation,

5106
01:54:35,109 --> 01:54:35,119
Yeah, it's that is a market in rotation,
 

5107
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:36,709
Yeah, it's that is a market in rotation,
isn't it? That is the definition of a

5108
01:54:36,709 --> 01:54:36,719
isn't it? That is the definition of a
 

5109
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:39,109
isn't it? That is the definition of a
market in rotation, right? Think about

5110
01:54:39,109 --> 01:54:39,119
market in rotation, right? Think about
 

5111
01:54:39,119 --> 01:54:42,709
market in rotation, right? Think about
what that looks like on a chart. But my

5112
01:54:42,709 --> 01:54:42,719
what that looks like on a chart. But my
 

5113
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:44,550
what that looks like on a chart. But my
feeling now is we're probably in

5114
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:44,560
feeling now is we're probably in
 

5115
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:46,070
feeling now is we're probably in
breakout.

5116
01:54:46,070 --> 01:54:46,080
breakout.
 

5117
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:49,109
breakout.
We're probably unless we open up next

5118
01:54:49,109 --> 01:54:49,119
We're probably unless we open up next
 

5119
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:51,589
We're probably unless we open up next
week. All right, give you a clue what

5120
01:54:51,589 --> 01:54:51,599
week. All right, give you a clue what
 

5121
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:53,030
week. All right, give you a clue what
the newsletter is going to look like.

5122
01:54:53,030 --> 01:54:53,040
the newsletter is going to look like.
 

5123
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:54,790
the newsletter is going to look like.
Bears are in control. As long as we

5124
01:54:54,790 --> 01:54:54,800
Bears are in control. As long as we
 

5125
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:57,669
Bears are in control. As long as we
close down here, bears are in control,

5126
01:54:57,669 --> 01:54:57,679
close down here, bears are in control,
 

5127
01:54:57,679 --> 01:55:00,870
close down here, bears are in control,
right? Bulls need to reclaim 470. The

5128
01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:00,880
right? Bulls need to reclaim 470. The
 

5129
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:03,350
right? Bulls need to reclaim 470. The
big level of of contested area is going

5130
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:03,360
big level of of contested area is going
 

5131
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:06,310
big level of of contested area is going
to be the 900s. Yeah, we start getting

5132
01:55:06,310 --> 01:55:06,320
to be the 900s. Yeah, we start getting
 

5133
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:09,350
to be the 900s. Yeah, we start getting
under 900s, bulls are absolutely [\h__\h]

5134
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:09,360
under 900s, bulls are absolutely [\h__\h]
 

5135
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:11,430
under 900s, bulls are absolutely [\h__\h]
Um, but we can still see a higher time

5136
01:55:11,430 --> 01:55:11,440
Um, but we can still see a higher time
 

5137
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:14,070
Um, but we can still see a higher time
frame pull back into that. So, let's

5138
01:55:14,070 --> 01:55:14,080
frame pull back into that. So, let's
 

5139
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:15,990
frame pull back into that. So, let's
just think about

5140
01:55:15,990 --> 01:55:16,000
just think about
 

5141
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,830
just think about
daily,

5142
01:55:17,830 --> 01:55:17,840
daily,
 

5143
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:19,189
daily,
right? Think about what we're seeing on

5144
01:55:19,189 --> 01:55:19,199
right? Think about what we're seeing on
 

5145
01:55:19,199 --> 01:55:20,790
right? Think about what we're seeing on
the daily. What have we lost on the

5146
01:55:20,790 --> 01:55:20,800
the daily. What have we lost on the
 

5147
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:22,550
the daily. What have we lost on the
daily? The low volume node. Where are

5148
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:22,560
daily? The low volume node. Where are
 

5149
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:25,270
daily? The low volume node. Where are
we? 20-day, 50-day. Okay, this is mean

5150
01:55:25,270 --> 01:55:25,280
we? 20-day, 50-day. Okay, this is mean
 

5151
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:27,109
we? 20-day, 50-day. Okay, this is mean
reversion. We're at mean reversion. All

5152
01:55:27,109 --> 01:55:27,119
reversion. We're at mean reversion. All
 

5153
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:28,950
reversion. We're at mean reversion. All
right, two standard deviation, two

5154
01:55:28,950 --> 01:55:28,960
right, two standard deviation, two
 

5155
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:31,350
right, two standard deviation, two
standard deviation, mean reversion. Very

5156
01:55:31,350 --> 01:55:31,360
standard deviation, mean reversion. Very
 

5157
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:33,589
standard deviation, mean reversion. Very
well might find a bid here. But the

5158
01:55:33,589 --> 01:55:33,599
well might find a bid here. But the
 

5159
01:55:33,599 --> 01:55:38,790
well might find a bid here. But the
bigger level for me is the 900s

5160
01:55:38,790 --> 01:55:38,800

 

5161
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,550

here.

5162
01:55:40,550 --> 01:55:40,560
here.
 

5163
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:42,950
here.
Right? These kind of guys here, maybe

5164
01:55:42,950 --> 01:55:42,960
Right? These kind of guys here, maybe
 

5165
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:45,589
Right? These kind of guys here, maybe
even eights. This is that old weekly

5166
01:55:45,589 --> 01:55:45,599
even eights. This is that old weekly
 

5167
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:46,709
even eights. This is that old weekly
point of control. We can think about

5168
01:55:46,709 --> 01:55:46,719
point of control. We can think about
 

5169
01:55:46,719 --> 01:55:48,550
point of control. We can think about
this even in an RBS, right? Think about

5170
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:48,560
this even in an RBS, right? Think about
 

5171
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:50,950
this even in an RBS, right? Think about
structure,

5172
01:55:50,950 --> 01:55:50,960
structure,
 

5173
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:53,270
structure,
right? Pullback, right? We expect the

5174
01:55:53,270 --> 01:55:53,280
right? Pullback, right? We expect the
 

5175
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:54,629
right? Pullback, right? We expect the
market to pull back into this, don't we?

5176
01:55:54,629 --> 01:55:54,639
market to pull back into this, don't we?
 

5177
01:55:54,639 --> 01:55:57,189
market to pull back into this, don't we?
On a daily. I expect bulls to try and

5178
01:55:57,189 --> 01:55:57,199
On a daily. I expect bulls to try and
 

5179
01:55:57,199 --> 01:55:58,950
On a daily. I expect bulls to try and
defend this. If they successfully defend

5180
01:55:58,950 --> 01:55:58,960
defend this. If they successfully defend
 

5181
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:00,629
defend this. If they successfully defend
this and we reclaim, I'll tell you what

5182
01:56:00,629 --> 01:56:00,639
this and we reclaim, I'll tell you what
 

5183
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:02,790
this and we reclaim, I'll tell you what
I then I'm very confident about alltime

5184
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:02,800
I then I'm very confident about alltime
 

5185
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,709
I then I'm very confident about alltime
highs and that's probably going to be

5186
01:56:04,709 --> 01:56:04,719
highs and that's probably going to be
 

5187
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:08,390
highs and that's probably going to be
next year. But I'll also tell you this,

5188
01:56:08,390 --> 01:56:08,400
next year. But I'll also tell you this,
 

5189
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:10,950
next year. But I'll also tell you this,
this was done on no volume and if we

5190
01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:10,960
this was done on no volume and if we
 

5191
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:14,390
this was done on no volume and if we
lose this level here, then I'm very

5192
01:56:14,390 --> 01:56:14,400
lose this level here, then I'm very
 

5193
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:18,470
lose this level here, then I'm very
confident that it is night night time

5194
01:56:18,470 --> 01:56:18,480
confident that it is night night time
 

5195
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:21,669
confident that it is night night time
and we're going for a 200 day revisit

5196
01:56:21,669 --> 01:56:21,679
and we're going for a 200 day revisit
 

5197
01:56:21,679 --> 01:56:23,830
and we're going for a 200 day revisit
at least into here, right? And I think

5198
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:23,840
at least into here, right? And I think
 

5199
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:26,310
at least into here, right? And I think
this will be the 2026 move and this will

5200
01:56:26,310 --> 01:56:26,320
this will be the 2026 move and this will
 

5201
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:27,510
this will be the 2026 move and this will
be the decision point. So, I don't want

5202
01:56:27,510 --> 01:56:27,520
be the decision point. So, I don't want
 

5203
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,350
be the decision point. So, I don't want
to be too biased because this is

5204
01:56:29,350 --> 01:56:29,360
to be too biased because this is
 

5205
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:31,270
to be too biased because this is
possible and this is possible both on

5206
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:31,280
possible and this is possible both on
 

5207
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:32,790
possible and this is possible both on
the daily. And what matters is this

5208
01:56:32,790 --> 01:56:32,800
the daily. And what matters is this
 

5209
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:34,950
the daily. And what matters is this
because do they set a daily higher low

5210
01:56:34,950 --> 01:56:34,960
because do they set a daily higher low
 

5211
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:37,430
because do they set a daily higher low
and set this up or are we going to see

5212
01:56:37,430 --> 01:56:37,440
and set this up or are we going to see
 

5213
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:39,430
and set this up or are we going to see
the divergence? Same divergence we saw

5214
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:39,440
the divergence? Same divergence we saw
 

5215
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:42,310
the divergence? Same divergence we saw
in the 90s, same divergence we saw in 07

5216
01:56:42,310 --> 01:56:42,320
in the 90s, same divergence we saw in 07
 

5217
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,790
in the 90s, same divergence we saw in 07
where RTY makes an all-time high. Q's

5218
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:44,800
where RTY makes an all-time high. Q's
 

5219
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:46,790
where RTY makes an all-time high. Q's
don't and then you get the start of a

5220
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:46,800
don't and then you get the start of a
 

5221
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:50,950
don't and then you get the start of a
rollover and we get that JPY carry trade

5222
01:56:50,950 --> 01:56:50,960
rollover and we get that JPY carry trade
 

5223
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:52,310
rollover and we get that JPY carry trade
starting to happen. I think it's

5224
01:56:52,310 --> 01:56:52,320
starting to happen. I think it's
 

5225
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:57,990
starting to happen. I think it's
December 18th that comes into effect.

5226
01:56:57,990 --> 01:56:58,000

 

5227
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,910

Anyway, these are all things we went

01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:27,910
market. That and the jobs number is
going to cause a major issue.

5250
01:57:27,910 --> 01:57:27,920

43s

5262
01:57:57,910 --> 01:57:57,920
43s
 

5263
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:00,790
43s
I added at 19s

5264
01:58:00,790 --> 01:58:00,800
I added at 19s
 

5265
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:06,310
I added at 19s
and I got most that cover off into 93

5266

and I got most that cover off into 93
 

5267
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,390
and I got most that cover off into 93
and then stopped out on the rest might

5268
01:58:08,390 --> 01:58:08,400
and then stopped out on the rest might
 

5269
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:10,149
and then stopped out on the rest might
still break lower. Like I said, I you

5270
01:58:10,149 --> 01:58:10,159
still break lower. Like I said, I you

Willow, do I believe the market will

5286
01:58:39,830 --> 01:58:39,840
Willow, do I believe the market will
 

5287
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:45,990
Willow, do I believe the market will
have a continuation down next week? Um,

5288
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:46,000

 

5289
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,390

uh, it all depends where we close and

5290
01:58:48,390 --> 01:58:48,400
uh, it all depends where we close and
 

5291
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:50,629
uh, it all depends where we close and
what levels we've taken out. That's what

5292
01:58:50,629 --> 01:58:50,639
what levels we've taken out. That's what
 

5293
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:53,109
what levels we've taken out. That's what
I'd say. It's too early yet to say. Does

5294
01:58:53,109 --> 01:58:53,119
I'd say. It's too early yet to say. Does
 

5295
01:58:53,119 --> 01:58:54,629
I'd say. It's too early yet to say. Does
it have the ability to now do it?

5296
01:58:54,629 --> 01:58:54,639
it have the ability to now do it?
 

5297
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:57,350
it have the ability to now do it?
Absolutely. We've left volume, right?

5298
01:58:57,350 --> 01:58:57,360
Absolutely. We've left volume, right?
 

5299
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:01,750
Absolutely. We've left volume, right?
But it really depends where we close.

5300
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:01,760

 

5301
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:06,149

This gray box is key. You can see
 

5319
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:23,030
This gray box is key. You can see
they're trying to absorb in the low

going to put a red line on for that
 

5331
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:34,870

Which level on spy did you say to watch

5340
01:59:43,189 --> 01:59:43,199
Which level on spy did you say to watch
 

5341
01:59:43,199 --> 01:59:46,310

82, 80s. All right. So, if you look at
 

5345

01:59:52,310 --> 01:59:52,320
it's been the levels all week. Look at
 

5349
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:55,030
it's been the levels all week. Look at
this morning. Once we lost 88, we got a

5350
01:59:55,030 --> 01:59:55,040
this morning. Once we lost 88, we got a
 

5351
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:57,589
this morning. Once we lost 88, we got a
cascade to 85. We trade under 85, we

5352
01:59:57,589 --> 01:59:57,599
cascade to 85. We trade under 85, we
 

5353
01:59:57,599 --> 02:00:00,310
cascade to 85. We trade under 85, we
back test 85. If we stay heavy 85, we're

5354
02:00:00,310 --> 02:00:00,320
back test 85. If we stay heavy 85, we're
 

5355
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:02,790
back test 85. If we stay heavy 85, we're
now trading, we trade down to 82. We

5356
02:00:02,790 --> 02:00:02,800
now trading, we trade down to 82. We
 

5357
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:05,109
now trading, we trade down to 82. We
lose 82, we back test 82, we're now

5358
02:00:05,109 --> 02:00:05,119
lose 82, we back test 82, we're now
 

5359
02:00:05,119 --> 02:00:07,510
lose 82, we back test 82, we're now
trading down to 80. If they lose 80,

5360
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:07,520
trading down to 80. If they lose 80,
 

5361
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:08,709
trading down to 80. If they lose 80,
we're going to go 20 day. We're going to

5362
02:00:08,709 --> 02:00:08,719
we're going to go 20 day. We're going to
 

5363
02:00:08,719 --> 02:00:11,990
we're going to go 20 day. We're going to
go 75 and stuff. But I'd imagine they'd

5364
02:00:11,990 --> 02:00:12,000
go 75 and stuff. But I'd imagine they'd
 

5365
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,510
go 75 and stuff. But I'd imagine they'd
really want to pin this and hold 80. If

5366
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:13,520
really want to pin this and hold 80. If
 

5367
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:15,270
really want to pin this and hold 80. If
they lose that, it's such a big problem

5368
02:00:15,270 --> 02:00:15,280
they lose that, it's such a big problem
 

5369
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:17,030
they lose that, it's such a big problem
for the market because when I had a look

5370
02:00:17,030 --> 02:00:17,040
for the market because when I had a look
 

5371
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:19,350
for the market because when I had a look
at the put walls, it was so low on

5372
02:00:19,350 --> 02:00:19,360
at the put walls, it was so low on
 

5373
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:21,270
at the put walls, it was so low on
volume. Everything was cool wall.

5374
02:00:21,270 --> 02:00:21,280
volume. Everything was cool wall.
 

5375
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:23,830
volume. Everything was cool wall.
Everything was 90 and 700. The volume

5376
02:00:23,830 --> 02:00:23,840
Everything was 90 and 700. The volume
 

5377
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:32,390
Everything was 90 and 700. The volume
below for the put walls was not great.

5378
02:00:32,390 --> 02:00:32,400

 

5379
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:34,229

Do you have a video created on contract

5380
02:00:34,229 --> 02:00:34,239
Do you have a video created on contract
 

5381
02:00:34,239 --> 02:00:37,189
Do you have a video created on contract
sizes? I do not. I don't think. Uh maybe

5382
02:00:37,189 --> 02:00:37,199
sizes? I do not. I don't think. Uh maybe
 

5383
02:00:37,199 --> 02:00:39,669
sizes? I do not. I don't think. Uh maybe
on the apex videos. There might be some

5384
02:00:39,669 --> 02:00:39,679
on the apex videos. There might be some
 

5385
02:00:39,679 --> 02:00:41,750
on the apex videos. There might be some
stuff. Quick question. Are you looking

5386
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:41,760
stuff. Quick question. Are you looking
 

5387
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:43,830
stuff. Quick question. Are you looking
for closure below the gray box or a

5388
02:00:43,830 --> 02:00:43,840
for closure below the gray box or a
 

5389
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:45,830
for closure below the gray box or a
retest? Yeah, it would need for for to

5390
02:00:45,830 --> 02:00:45,840
retest? Yeah, it would need for for to
 

5391
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:47,669
retest? Yeah, it would need for for to
get a new position in. You mean? Yeah,

5392
02:00:47,669 --> 02:00:47,679
get a new position in. You mean? Yeah,
 

5393
02:00:47,679 --> 02:00:49,669
get a new position in. You mean? Yeah,
it would need to get underneath if I was

5394
02:00:49,669 --> 02:00:49,679
it would need to get underneath if I was
 

5395
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:51,589
it would need to get underneath if I was
going to put any more trade on today and

5396
02:00:51,589 --> 02:00:51,599
going to put any more trade on today and
 

5397
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:53,270
going to put any more trade on today and
I'm to be honest, I'm thinking probably

5398
02:00:53,270 --> 02:00:53,280
I'm to be honest, I'm thinking probably
 

5399
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:54,629
I'm to be honest, I'm thinking probably
just going to be risk off. I'd need

5400
02:00:54,629 --> 02:00:54,639
just going to be risk off. I'd need
 

5401
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:56,310
just going to be risk off. I'd need
something like this, right? I'd need

5402
02:00:56,310 --> 02:00:56,320
something like this, right? I'd need
 

5403
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:58,310
something like this, right? I'd need
volume built out here. We want to see

5404
02:00:58,310 --> 02:00:58,320
volume built out here. We want to see
 

5405
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:01,270
volume built out here. We want to see
like this kind of thing here, right? We

5406
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:01,280
like this kind of thing here, right? We
 

5407
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:02,709
like this kind of thing here, right? We
want to see volume built out, a trade

5408
02:01:02,709 --> 02:01:02,719
want to see volume built out, a trade
 

5409
02:01:02,719 --> 02:01:04,950
want to see volume built out, a trade
under, rejected it, and go lower. Just

5410
02:01:04,950 --> 02:01:04,960
under, rejected it, and go lower. Just
 

5411
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:06,470
under, rejected it, and go lower. Just
remember, we've taken out a weekly

5412
02:01:06,470 --> 02:01:06,480
remember, we've taken out a weekly
 

5413
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:09,189
remember, we've taken out a weekly
level. Th this is like an absolute bonus

5414
02:01:09,189 --> 02:01:09,199
level. Th this is like an absolute bonus
 

5415
02:01:09,199 --> 02:01:10,629
level. Th this is like an absolute bonus
if you get there. Remember that. That

5416
02:01:10,629 --> 02:01:10,639
if you get there. Remember that. That
 

5417
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:13,109
if you get there. Remember that. That
means we're a 3% down day. If we get

5418
02:01:13,109 --> 02:01:13,119
means we're a 3% down day. If we get
 

5419
02:01:13,119 --> 02:01:16,390
means we're a 3% down day. If we get
there or if we go from New York open

5420
02:01:16,390 --> 02:01:16,400
there or if we go from New York open
 

5421
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:18,790
there or if we go from New York open
2.4% down, we measured it earlier,

5422
02:01:18,790 --> 02:01:18,800
2.4% down, we measured it earlier,
 

5423
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:21,109
2.4% down, we measured it earlier,
right? So, I think this is the draw on

5424
02:01:21,109 --> 02:01:21,119
right? So, I think this is the draw on
 

5425
02:01:21,119 --> 02:01:22,790
right? So, I think this is the draw on
liquidity,

5426
02:01:22,790 --> 02:01:22,800
liquidity,
 

5427
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:24,950
liquidity,
but uh you know, maybe they save it for

5428
02:01:24,950 --> 02:01:24,960
but uh you know, maybe they save it for
 

5429
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:27,750
but uh you know, maybe they save it for
next week. I wouldn't mind if they did.

5430
02:01:27,750 --> 02:01:27,760
next week. I wouldn't mind if they did.
 

5431
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:29,109
next week. I wouldn't mind if they did.
If they if they could save it for next

5432
02:01:29,109 --> 02:01:29,119
If they if they could save it for next
 

5433
02:01:29,119 --> 02:01:30,390
If they if they could save it for next
week, it'd be really nice, right?

5434
02:01:30,390 --> 02:01:30,400
week, it'd be really nice, right?
 

5435
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:32,470
week, it'd be really nice, right?
Because what we could see, let's imagine

5436
02:01:32,470 --> 02:01:32,480
Because what we could see, let's imagine
 

5437
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:34,470
Because what we could see, let's imagine
market closes like it does now. That

5438
02:01:34,470 --> 02:01:34,480
market closes like it does now. That
 

5439
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:35,990
market closes like it does now. That
means what I'd be looking for next week

5440
02:01:35,990 --> 02:01:36,000
means what I'd be looking for next week
 

5441
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,709
means what I'd be looking for next week
is a trade into here, short side from

5442
02:01:38,709 --> 02:01:38,719
is a trade into here, short side from
 

5443
02:01:38,719 --> 02:01:41,189
is a trade into here, short side from
here, and a slam back down to there. And

5444
02:01:41,189 --> 02:01:41,199
here, and a slam back down to there. And
 

5445
02:01:41,199 --> 02:01:42,870
here, and a slam back down to there. And
then from here, I'd be considering a bid

5446
02:01:42,870 --> 02:01:42,880
then from here, I'd be considering a bid
 

5447
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:45,510
then from here, I'd be considering a bid
up

5448
02:01:45,510 --> 02:01:45,520
up
 

5449
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:49,189
up
higher time frame.

5450
02:01:49,189 --> 02:01:49,199

 

5451
02:01:49,199 --> 02:01:51,430

Is there a reason I don't trade GC? Um,

5452
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:51,440
Is there a reason I don't trade GC? Um,
 

5453
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:53,430
Is there a reason I don't trade GC? Um,
no, not really. Like, it's moved really

5454
02:01:53,430 --> 02:01:53,440
no, not really. Like, it's moved really
 

5455
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:56,790
no, not really. Like, it's moved really
well, but um I took a short on GC

5456
02:01:56,790 --> 02:01:56,800
well, but um I took a short on GC
 

5457
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:58,310
well, but um I took a short on GC
earlier this year, swing short. So, I

5458
02:01:58,310 --> 02:01:58,320
earlier this year, swing short. So, I
 

5459
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:00,149
earlier this year, swing short. So, I
was long

5460
02:02:00,149 --> 02:02:00,159
was long
 

5461
02:02:00,159 --> 02:02:03,270
was long
GLL, which is the two times or three

5462
02:02:03,270 --> 02:02:03,280
GLL, which is the two times or three
 

5463
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:06,229
GLL, which is the two times or three
times ETF on it. Um, short side. So, I

5464
02:02:06,229 --> 02:02:06,239
times ETF on it. Um, short side. So, I
 

5465
02:02:06,239 --> 02:02:08,950
times ETF on it. Um, short side. So, I
was long GL

5466
02:02:08,950 --> 02:02:08,960
was long GL
 

5467
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:11,030
was long GL
CGL. I can't remember what it is. I'd

5468
02:02:11,030 --> 02:02:11,040
CGL. I can't remember what it is. I'd
 

5469
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:13,350
CGL. I can't remember what it is. I'd
have to have a look at it. Um, but I

5470
02:02:13,350 --> 02:02:13,360
have to have a look at it. Um, but I
 

5471
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,109
have to have a look at it. Um, but I
just trade NASDAQ. I'm I'm used to

5472
02:02:15,109 --> 02:02:15,119
just trade NASDAQ. I'm I'm used to
 

5473
02:02:15,119 --> 02:02:17,830
just trade NASDAQ. I'm I'm used to
NASDAQ's personality. The whole reason I

5474
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:17,840
NASDAQ's personality. The whole reason I
 

5475
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:19,510
NASDAQ's personality. The whole reason I
left small caps and large caps is I

5476
02:02:19,510 --> 02:02:19,520
left small caps and large caps is I
 

5477
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:23,350
left small caps and large caps is I
don't like looking at scanners. Um I

5478
02:02:23,350 --> 02:02:23,360
don't like looking at scanners. Um I
 

5479
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:25,750
don't like looking at scanners. Um I
don't want to see

5480
02:02:25,750 --> 02:02:25,760
don't want to see
 

5481
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:27,270
don't want to see
even though I think there's more edge in

5482
02:02:27,270 --> 02:02:27,280
even though I think there's more edge in
 

5483
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,990
even though I think there's more edge in
in there's way more edge in stocks than

5484
02:02:29,990 --> 02:02:30,000
in there's way more edge in stocks than
 

5485
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:31,990
in there's way more edge in stocks than
there are in futures uh because they're

5486
02:02:31,990 --> 02:02:32,000
there are in futures uh because they're
 

5487
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,310
there are in futures uh because they're
way more inefficient. All right. You

5488
02:02:34,310 --> 02:02:34,320
way more inefficient. All right. You
 

5489
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:37,030
way more inefficient. All right. You
don't you like

5490
02:02:37,030 --> 02:02:37,040
don't you like
 

5491
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:39,350
don't you like
if if if the cues and spire down on the

5492
02:02:39,350 --> 02:02:39,360
if if if the cues and spire down on the
 

5493
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:41,669
if if if the cues and spire down on the
day and like you can find a market which

5494
02:02:41,669 --> 02:02:41,679
day and like you can find a market which
 

5495
02:02:41,679 --> 02:02:44,550
day and like you can find a market which
is weak like Nvidia, you know, Nvidia,

5496
02:02:44,550 --> 02:02:44,560
is weak like Nvidia, you know, Nvidia,
 

5497
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:46,950
is weak like Nvidia, you know, Nvidia,
AVGO, Oracle today. You just want to be

5498
02:02:46,950 --> 02:02:46,960
AVGO, Oracle today. You just want to be
 

5499
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:48,229
AVGO, Oracle today. You just want to be
short those, don't you? Relative

5500
02:02:48,229 --> 02:02:48,239
short those, don't you? Relative
 

5501
02:02:48,239 --> 02:02:50,149
short those, don't you? Relative
weakness. It's a way easier trade than

5502
02:02:50,149 --> 02:02:50,159
weakness. It's a way easier trade than
 

5503
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:53,669
weakness. It's a way easier trade than
than this, but it require requires way

5504
02:02:53,669 --> 02:02:53,679
than this, but it require requires way
 

5505
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:55,750
than this, but it require requires way
more brain waves. Maybe I should go back

5506
02:02:55,750 --> 02:02:55,760
more brain waves. Maybe I should go back
 

5507
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:58,070
more brain waves. Maybe I should go back
to it. I think I've improved as a trader

5508
02:02:58,070 --> 02:02:58,080
to it. I think I've improved as a trader
 

5509
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:59,830
to it. I think I've improved as a trader
so much the last three, four years that

5510
02:02:59,830 --> 02:02:59,840
so much the last three, four years that
 

5511
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:02,390
so much the last three, four years that
I could probably absolutely smash stocks

5512
02:03:02,390 --> 02:03:02,400
I could probably absolutely smash stocks
 

5513
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:05,030
I could probably absolutely smash stocks
to bits. Um,

5514
02:03:05,030 --> 02:03:05,040
to bits. Um,
 

5515
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:06,550
to bits. Um,
but for GC, I don't know its

5516
02:03:06,550 --> 02:03:06,560
but for GC, I don't know its
 

5517
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:09,990
but for GC, I don't know its
personality. Um, I know that hedges are

5518
02:03:09,990 --> 02:03:10,000
personality. Um, I know that hedges are
 

5519
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,430
personality. Um, I know that hedges are
just going to keep printing it up. I

5520
02:03:11,430 --> 02:03:11,440
just going to keep printing it up. I
 

5521
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:14,070
just going to keep printing it up. I
know that all the time this market has

5522
02:03:14,070 --> 02:03:14,080
know that all the time this market has
 

5523
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:16,629
know that all the time this market has
under the hood a engine which is rotting

5524
02:03:16,629 --> 02:03:16,639
under the hood a engine which is rotting
 

5525
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:18,070
under the hood a engine which is rotting
where they haven't put any oil in and

5526
02:03:18,070 --> 02:03:18,080
where they haven't put any oil in and
 

5527
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:19,350
where they haven't put any oil in and
it's about to blow up. Then they're

5528
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:19,360
it's about to blow up. Then they're
 

5529
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:23,030
it's about to blow up. Then they're
going to keep bidding up GC.

5530
02:03:23,030 --> 02:03:23,040
going to keep bidding up GC.
 

5531
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:24,709
going to keep bidding up GC.
So,

5532
02:03:24,709 --> 02:03:24,719
So,
 

5533
02:03:24,719 --> 02:03:26,470
So,
I don't know. What can I say? I've only

5534
02:03:26,470 --> 02:03:26,480
I don't know. What can I say? I've only
 

5535
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:28,709
I don't know. What can I say? I've only
got so many brain waves, I guess, is a

5536
02:03:28,709 --> 02:03:28,719
got so many brain waves, I guess, is a
 

5537
02:03:28,719 --> 02:03:30,070
got so many brain waves, I guess, is a
way of putting it. So much I've only got

5538
02:03:30,070 --> 02:03:30,080
way of putting it. So much I've only got
 

5539
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:34,629
way of putting it. So much I've only got
so much energy.

5540
02:03:34,629 --> 02:03:34,639

 

5541
02:03:34,639 --> 02:03:36,310

Yeah, you're right, Zar. You're right.

5542
02:03:36,310 --> 02:03:36,320
Yeah, you're right, Zar. You're right.
 

5543
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:39,669
Yeah, you're right, Zar. You're right.
OPEX next week. You are right. We talked

5544
02:03:39,669 --> 02:03:39,679
OPEX next week. You are right. We talked
 

5545
02:03:39,679 --> 02:03:46,629
OPEX next week. You are right. We talked
about that in Discord.

5546
02:03:46,629 --> 02:03:46,639

 

5547
02:03:46,639 --> 02:03:48,310

What indicator are you using for volume

5548
02:03:48,310 --> 02:03:48,320
What indicator are you using for volume
 

5549
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:49,910
What indicator are you using for volume
on the right side of the screen? I'm

5550
02:03:49,910 --> 02:03:49,920
on the right side of the screen? I'm
 

5551
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:54,870
on the right side of the screen? I'm
using VR. Oh, uh, anchored. Anchored.

5552
02:03:54,870 --> 02:03:54,880
using VR. Oh, uh, anchored. Anchored.
 

5553
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:57,589
using VR. Oh, uh, anchored. Anchored.
So,

5554
02:03:57,589 --> 02:03:57,599
So,
 

5555
02:03:57,599 --> 02:03:59,830
So,
this one here, anchored volume profile.

5556
02:03:59,830 --> 02:03:59,840
this one here, anchored volume profile.
 

5557
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:02,229
this one here, anchored volume profile.
And then I just anchor it from 9:30. And

5558
02:04:02,229 --> 02:04:02,239
And then I just anchor it from 9:30. And
 

5559
02:04:02,239 --> 02:04:06,790
And then I just anchor it from 9:30. And
you just have to in the settings.

5560
02:04:06,790 --> 02:04:06,800

 

5561
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:18,709

Uh you have to tell it placement, right?

5562
02:04:18,709 --> 02:04:18,719

 

5563
02:04:18,719 --> 02:04:20,790

Thank you. The best. Yeah. I mean, it

5564
02:04:20,790 --> 02:04:20,800
Thank you. The best. Yeah. I mean, it
 

5565
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:23,350
Thank you. The best. Yeah. I mean, it
can be when when she's playing kind,

5566
02:04:23,350 --> 02:04:23,360
can be when when she's playing kind,
 

5567
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:25,350

5570
02:04:27,830 --> 02:04:27,840
when she's being a little [\h__\h] it's
 

5571
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:30,790
when she's being a little [\h__\h] it's
[\h__\h] pissed me off. There's days like

5572
02:04:30,790 --> 02:04:30,800
[\h__\h] pissed me off. There's days like
 

5573
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:31,990
[\h__\h] pissed me off. There's days like
that when I'm like, why don't I just

5574
02:04:31,990 --> 02:04:32,000
that when I'm like, why don't I just
 

5575
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,350
that when I'm like, why don't I just
trade stocks? It's so much easier. Um,

5576
02:04:35,350 --> 02:04:35,360
trade stocks? It's so much easier. Um,
 

5577
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:36,950
trade stocks? It's so much easier. Um,
new here and I love your analysis, mate.

5578
02:04:36,950 --> 02:04:36,960
new here and I love your analysis, mate.
 

5579
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:39,109
new here and I love your analysis, mate.
Do I have any content for swing trading?

5580
02:04:39,109 --> 02:04:39,119
Do I have any content for swing trading?
 

5581
02:04:39,119 --> 02:04:42,310
Do I have any content for swing trading?
Um, no, but every everything that I

5582
02:04:42,310 --> 02:04:42,320
Um, no, but every everything that I
 

5583
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:45,990
Um, no, but every everything that I
teach you, um, it works the same for

5584
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:46,000
teach you, um, it works the same for
 

5585
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,589
teach you, um, it works the same for
swing trading. It's just the difference

5586
02:04:47,589 --> 02:04:47,599
swing trading. It's just the difference
 

5587
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:49,510
swing trading. It's just the difference
in in swing trading. You you really

5588
02:04:49,510 --> 02:04:49,520
in in swing trading. You you really
 

5589
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:50,870
in in swing trading. You you really
don't need to pay attention to any of

5590
02:04:50,870 --> 02:04:50,880
don't need to pay attention to any of
 

5591
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:52,709
don't need to pay attention to any of
this. All right. So, if we were going to

5592
02:04:52,709 --> 02:04:52,719
this. All right. So, if we were going to
 

5593
02:04:52,719 --> 02:04:56,149
this. All right. So, if we were going to
look for swings now,

5594
02:04:56,149 --> 02:04:56,159
look for swings now,
 

5595
02:04:56,159 --> 02:04:58,229
look for swings now,
um let's have a think about what's

5596
02:04:58,229 --> 02:04:58,239
um let's have a think about what's
 

5597
02:04:58,239 --> 02:05:01,030
um let's have a think about what's
moving today. Uh AVGO. All right, let's

5598
02:05:01,030 --> 02:05:01,040
moving today. Uh AVGO. All right, let's
 

5599
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:03,669
moving today. Uh AVGO. All right, let's
go to AVGO. Right, I'd start everything

5600
02:05:03,669 --> 02:05:03,679
go to AVGO. Right, I'd start everything
 

5601
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:05,109
go to AVGO. Right, I'd start everything
works the same way. So, I'd start on a

5602
02:05:05,109 --> 02:05:05,119
works the same way. So, I'd start on a
 

5603
02:05:05,119 --> 02:05:06,629
works the same way. So, I'd start on a
daily and I'd be like, okay, who's

5604
02:05:06,629 --> 02:05:06,639
daily and I'd be like, okay, who's
 

5605
02:05:06,639 --> 02:05:08,629
daily and I'd be like, okay, who's
trapped on ABGO? Okay, very clearly all

5606
02:05:08,629 --> 02:05:08,639
trapped on ABGO? Okay, very clearly all
 

5607
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:10,870
trapped on ABGO? Okay, very clearly all
I all I need to see is here. All right,

5608
02:05:10,870 --> 02:05:10,880
I all I need to see is here. All right,
 

5609
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:13,350
I all I need to see is here. All right,
pain point for a ABGO is all the buyers

5610
02:05:13,350 --> 02:05:13,360
pain point for a ABGO is all the buyers
 

5611
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:14,870
pain point for a ABGO is all the buyers
trapped above here right now. Right, big

5612
02:05:14,870 --> 02:05:14,880
trapped above here right now. Right, big
 

5613
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,669
trapped above here right now. Right, big
gap down. Buyers are trapped. Where's

5614
02:05:17,669 --> 02:05:17,679
gap down. Buyers are trapped. Where's
 

5615
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:19,189
gap down. Buyers are trapped. Where's
the big puke? Well, the big puke will

5616
02:05:19,189 --> 02:05:19,199
the big puke? Well, the big puke will
 

5617
02:05:19,199 --> 02:05:20,870
the big puke? Well, the big puke will
happen under here for a gap fill. All

5618
02:05:20,870 --> 02:05:20,880
happen under here for a gap fill. All
 

5619
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:22,229
happen under here for a gap fill. All
right. So, we've got higher highs,

5620
02:05:22,229 --> 02:05:22,239
right. So, we've got higher highs,
 

5621
02:05:22,239 --> 02:05:24,149
right. So, we've got higher highs,
technically higher lows, but any return

5622
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:24,159
technically higher lows, but any return
 

5623
02:05:24,159 --> 02:05:26,229
technically higher lows, but any return
back in here offers a possible swing

5624
02:05:26,229 --> 02:05:26,239
back in here offers a possible swing
 

5625
02:05:26,239 --> 02:05:27,830
back in here offers a possible swing
short down to here. Any break of that

5626
02:05:27,830 --> 02:05:27,840
short down to here. Any break of that
 

5627
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:30,390
short down to here. Any break of that
fills the gap. All right. And that's

5628
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:30,400
fills the gap. All right. And that's
 

5629
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:33,030
fills the gap. All right. And that's
just how I would trade it. And

5630
02:05:33,030 --> 02:05:33,040
just how I would trade it. And
 

5631
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:34,709
just how I would trade it. And
it would be the same for absolutely

5632
02:05:34,709 --> 02:05:34,719
it would be the same for absolutely
 

5633
02:05:34,719 --> 02:05:36,310
it would be the same for absolutely
anything. I can show you big swings that

5634
02:05:36,310 --> 02:05:36,320
anything. I can show you big swings that
 

5635
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:40,870
anything. I can show you big swings that
I took this year. Um, so AMD,

5636
02:05:40,870 --> 02:05:40,880
I took this year. Um, so AMD,
 

5637
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:43,109
I took this year. Um, so AMD,
all right, my big swing

5638
02:05:43,109 --> 02:05:43,119
all right, my big swing
 

5639
02:05:43,119 --> 02:05:44,709
all right, my big swing
was

5640
02:05:44,709 --> 02:05:44,719
was
 

5641
02:05:44,719 --> 02:05:49,669
was
58s, I believe. So, I bought this um

5642
02:05:49,669 --> 02:05:49,679
58s, I believe. So, I bought this um
 

5643
02:05:49,679 --> 02:05:51,350
58s, I believe. So, I bought this um
right here. So the same thing we look at

5644
02:05:51,350 --> 02:05:51,360
right here. So the same thing we look at
 

5645
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:52,870
right here. So the same thing we look at
lower time frame inverse head and

5646
02:05:52,870 --> 02:05:52,880
lower time frame inverse head and
 

5647
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:56,470
lower time frame inverse head and
shoulders right flag consolidation.

5648
02:05:56,470 --> 02:05:56,480
shoulders right flag consolidation.
 

5649
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:59,109
shoulders right flag consolidation.
Um, if we move this into like an hourly,

5650
02:05:59,109 --> 02:05:59,119
Um, if we move this into like an hourly,
 

5651
02:05:59,119 --> 02:06:01,350
Um, if we move this into like an hourly,
I have to get back to that same level

5652
02:06:01,350 --> 02:06:01,360
I have to get back to that same level
 

5653
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:03,189
I have to get back to that same level
right into an hourly. You can see here

5654
02:06:03,189 --> 02:06:03,199
right into an hourly. You can see here
 

5655
02:06:03,199 --> 02:06:06,070
right into an hourly. You can see here
that we were starting

5656
02:06:06,070 --> 02:06:06,080
that we were starting
 

5657
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:11,030
that we were starting
to liquidate guys under here.

5658
02:06:11,030 --> 02:06:11,040
to liquidate guys under here.
 

5659
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:12,950
to liquidate guys under here.
All right, Woff theory. Bulls were

5660
02:06:12,950 --> 02:06:12,960
All right, Woff theory. Bulls were
 

5661
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:14,629
All right, Woff theory. Bulls were
buying this. So, short side came flying

5662
02:06:14,629 --> 02:06:14,639
buying this. So, short side came flying
 

5663
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:16,390
buying this. So, short side came flying
in. Absorption on the tape here. I got

5664
02:06:16,390 --> 02:06:16,400
in. Absorption on the tape here. I got
 

5665
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:19,109
in. Absorption on the tape here. I got
long at 58 right in here and I'm still

5666
02:06:19,109 --> 02:06:19,119
long at 58 right in here and I'm still
 

5667
02:06:19,119 --> 02:06:21,510
long at 58 right in here and I'm still
long and I sold 80% of it into this move

5668
02:06:21,510 --> 02:06:21,520
long and I sold 80% of it into this move
 

5669
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:23,189
long and I sold 80% of it into this move
because it's a ridiculous move. So, if

5670
02:06:23,189 --> 02:06:23,199
because it's a ridiculous move. So, if
 

5671
02:06:23,199 --> 02:06:24,790
because it's a ridiculous move. So, if
we just think about this, same thing we

5672
02:06:24,790 --> 02:06:24,800
we just think about this, same thing we
 

5673
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:26,550
we just think about this, same thing we
would do. What's the measurement of the

5674
02:06:26,550 --> 02:06:26,560
would do. What's the measurement of the
 

5675
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:29,030
would do. What's the measurement of the
move or what's the expansion of that?

5676
02:06:29,030 --> 02:06:29,040
move or what's the expansion of that?
 

5677
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:32,149
move or what's the expansion of that?
All right, 3x 261. I actually got

5678
02:06:32,149 --> 02:06:32,159
All right, 3x 261. I actually got
 

5679
02:06:32,159 --> 02:06:33,669
All right, 3x 261. I actually got
filled. So, I'm above that, which was

5680
02:06:33,669 --> 02:06:33,679
filled. So, I'm above that, which was
 

5681
02:06:33,679 --> 02:06:35,430
filled. So, I'm above that, which was
amazing. And I'm down to tiny size. So,

5682
02:06:35,430 --> 02:06:35,440
amazing. And I'm down to tiny size. So,
 

5683
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:37,430
amazing. And I'm down to tiny size. So,
80% of me is filled here. And I'm just

5684
02:06:37,430 --> 02:06:37,440
80% of me is filled here. And I'm just
 

5685
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:38,629
80% of me is filled here. And I'm just
going to hold this now from here

5686
02:06:38,629 --> 02:06:38,639
going to hold this now from here
 

5687
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:40,550
going to hold this now from here
because, you know, I I don't care. Maybe

5688
02:06:40,550 --> 02:06:40,560
because, you know, I I don't care. Maybe
 

5689
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:42,390
because, you know, I I don't care. Maybe
we come back and I stop out break even

5690
02:06:42,390 --> 02:06:42,400
we come back and I stop out break even
 

5691
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:45,669
we come back and I stop out break even
on it. But, uh, maybe they want to do a

5692
02:06:45,669 --> 02:06:45,679
on it. But, uh, maybe they want to do a
 

5693
02:06:45,679 --> 02:06:48,149
on it. But, uh, maybe they want to do a
resqueeze next year. I don't know. It's

5694
02:06:48,149 --> 02:06:48,159
resqueeze next year. I don't know. It's
 

5695
02:06:48,159 --> 02:06:50,229
resqueeze next year. I don't know. It's
all the same things. It's exactly the

5696
02:06:50,229 --> 02:06:50,239
all the same things. It's exactly the
 

5697
02:06:50,239 --> 02:06:51,589
all the same things. It's exactly the
same things. And the best areas to buy

5698
02:06:51,589 --> 02:06:51,599
same things. And the best areas to buy
 

5699
02:06:51,599 --> 02:06:54,310
same things. And the best areas to buy
on are the same levels I always talk

5700
02:06:54,310 --> 02:06:54,320
on are the same levels I always talk
 

5701
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:56,069
on are the same levels I always talk
about. It's really you you want

5702
02:06:56,069 --> 02:06:56,079
about. It's really you you want
 

5703
02:06:56,079 --> 02:07:00,550
about. It's really you you want
consolidation on a 200 day. Um so if I

5704
02:07:00,550 --> 02:07:00,560
consolidation on a 200 day. Um so if I
 

5705
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:02,390
consolidation on a 200 day. Um so if I
go get you on a daily so it makes more

5706
02:07:02,390 --> 02:07:02,400
go get you on a daily so it makes more
 

5707
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:04,709
go get you on a daily so it makes more
sense. Market's calmed down now. So we

5708
02:07:04,709 --> 02:07:04,719
sense. Market's calmed down now. So we
 

5709
02:07:04,719 --> 02:07:07,990
sense. Market's calmed down now. So we
can do this. All right. So if we go to

5710
02:07:07,990 --> 02:07:08,000
can do this. All right. So if we go to
 

5711
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:12,470
can do this. All right. So if we go to
here like AMD

5712
02:07:12,470 --> 02:07:12,480

 

5713
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:13,910

so you can see where I got long. Look my

5714
02:07:13,910 --> 02:07:13,920
so you can see where I got long. Look my
 

5715
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:15,990
so you can see where I got long. Look my
stuff's still on it.

5716
02:07:15,990 --> 02:07:16,000
stuff's still on it.
 

5717
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,990
stuff's still on it.
My charts are still on it. All right. So

5718
02:07:17,990 --> 02:07:18,000
My charts are still on it. All right. So
 

5719
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,069
My charts are still on it. All right. So
we got back above the 200 day. We were

5720
02:07:20,069 --> 02:07:20,079
we got back above the 200 day. We were
 

5721
02:07:20,079 --> 02:07:21,430
we got back above the 200 day. We were
holding in this Ballinger band. We

5722
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:21,440
holding in this Ballinger band. We
 

5723
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:23,030
holding in this Ballinger band. We
created a squeeze. Here's the Ballinger

5724
02:07:23,030 --> 02:07:23,040
created a squeeze. Here's the Ballinger
 

5725
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:24,550
created a squeeze. Here's the Ballinger
band squeeze. You see how tight it got

5726
02:07:24,550 --> 02:07:24,560
band squeeze. You see how tight it got
 

5727
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:25,990
band squeeze. You see how tight it got
here? Once we do a squeeze on Ballinger

5728
02:07:25,990 --> 02:07:26,000
here? Once we do a squeeze on Ballinger
 

5729
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,149
here? Once we do a squeeze on Ballinger
band, we're going to expect expansion.

5730
02:07:28,149 --> 02:07:28,159
band, we're going to expect expansion.
 

5731
02:07:28,159 --> 02:07:29,669
band, we're going to expect expansion.
And because of the type of market

5732
02:07:29,669 --> 02:07:29,679
And because of the type of market
 

5733
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:31,430
And because of the type of market
condition we were in, right, we're

5734
02:07:31,430 --> 02:07:31,440
condition we were in, right, we're
 

5735
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:33,669
condition we were in, right, we're
looking to abuse these stops. And

5736
02:07:33,669 --> 02:07:33,679
looking to abuse these stops. And
 

5737
02:07:33,679 --> 02:07:35,350
looking to abuse these stops. And
there's the swing. There's the trigger

5738
02:07:35,350 --> 02:07:35,360
there's the swing. There's the trigger
 

5739
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:36,709
there's the swing. There's the trigger
higher. And we can do the same thing. I

5740
02:07:36,709 --> 02:07:36,719
higher. And we can do the same thing. I
 

5741
02:07:36,719 --> 02:07:38,310
higher. And we can do the same thing. I
did the same on Apple. On Apple. I'm

5742
02:07:38,310 --> 02:07:38,320
did the same on Apple. On Apple. I'm
 

5743
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:40,390
did the same on Apple. On Apple. I'm
still long Apple

5744
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:40,400
still long Apple
 

5745
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:42,390
still long Apple
from 202s,

5746
02:07:42,390 --> 02:07:42,400
from 202s,
 

5747
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:43,910
from 202s,
right? And it's exactly the same from

5748
02:07:43,910 --> 02:07:43,920
right? And it's exactly the same from
 

5749
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:46,950
right? And it's exactly the same from
202. Same kind of thing. Is it 202 or

5750
02:07:46,950 --> 02:07:46,960
202. Same kind of thing. Is it 202 or
 

5751
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:49,030
202. Same kind of thing. Is it 202 or
220? I have to have a look. Maybe it was

5752
02:07:49,030 --> 02:07:49,040
220? I have to have a look. Maybe it was
 

5753
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:52,470
220? I have to have a look. Maybe it was
220.

5754
02:07:52,470 --> 02:07:52,480

 

5755
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:55,510

August. No, it's 202s. I think it's the

5756
02:07:55,510 --> 02:07:55,520
August. No, it's 202s. I think it's the
 

5757
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:57,589
August. No, it's 202s. I think it's the
same kind of thing, right? Squeeze on

5758
02:07:57,589 --> 02:07:57,599
same kind of thing, right? Squeeze on
 

5759
02:07:57,599 --> 02:08:00,149
same kind of thing, right? Squeeze on
the Ballinger bands.

5760
02:08:00,149 --> 02:08:00,159
the Ballinger bands.
 

5761
02:08:00,159 --> 02:08:01,669
the Ballinger bands.
Oh, no. It would have been 220 cuz I

5762
02:08:01,669 --> 02:08:01,679
Oh, no. It would have been 220 cuz I
 

5763
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:03,189
Oh, no. It would have been 220 cuz I
always wait to get back above the 200.

5764
02:08:03,189 --> 02:08:03,199
always wait to get back above the 200.
 

5765
02:08:03,199 --> 02:08:05,430
always wait to get back above the 200.
So, there's the 200, right? There's the

5766
02:08:05,430 --> 02:08:05,440
So, there's the 200, right? There's the
 

5767
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:09,589
So, there's the 200, right? There's the
higher low and long trigger here. Abuse

5768
02:08:09,589 --> 02:08:09,599
higher low and long trigger here. Abuse
 

5769
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:11,109
higher low and long trigger here. Abuse
these stops. And I'm still longing this

5770
02:08:11,109 --> 02:08:11,119
these stops. And I'm still longing this
 

5771
02:08:11,119 --> 02:08:12,790
these stops. And I'm still longing this
because I've got no reason to sell right

5772
02:08:12,790 --> 02:08:12,800
because I've got no reason to sell right
 

5773
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,950
because I've got no reason to sell right
now.

5774
02:08:14,950 --> 02:08:14,960
now.
 

5775
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:17,830
now.
Um, yeah. Other ones I took this year

5776
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:17,840
Um, yeah. Other ones I took this year
 

5777
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:21,910
Um, yeah. Other ones I took this year
open, I took for the squeeze from 198.

5778
02:08:21,910 --> 02:08:21,920
open, I took for the squeeze from 198.
 

5779
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:24,870
open, I took for the squeeze from 198.
All right. So, this is about as easy

5780
02:08:24,870 --> 02:08:24,880
All right. So, this is about as easy
 

5781
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:27,030
All right. So, this is about as easy
pattern as you can get. Shorts will pile

5782
02:08:27,030 --> 02:08:27,040
pattern as you can get. Shorts will pile
 

5783
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:28,790
pattern as you can get. Shorts will pile
into this. Remember, my bias is always

5784
02:08:28,790 --> 02:08:28,800
into this. Remember, my bias is always
 

5785
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:30,950
into this. Remember, my bias is always
short side in small caps. There's a

5786
02:08:30,950 --> 02:08:30,960
short side in small caps. There's a
 

5787
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:33,510
short side in small caps. There's a
higher low. There's a hold of 198. And

5788
02:08:33,510 --> 02:08:33,520
higher low. There's a hold of 198. And
 

5789
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:35,510
higher low. There's a hold of 198. And
uh we got long for this squeeze and we

5790
02:08:35,510 --> 02:08:35,520
uh we got long for this squeeze and we
 

5791
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:38,550
uh we got long for this squeeze and we
sold up into here.

5792
02:08:38,550 --> 02:08:38,560
sold up into here.
 

5793
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:40,390
sold up into here.
Really simple. Use these stops. We're

5794
02:08:40,390 --> 02:08:40,400
Really simple. Use these stops. We're
 

5795
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:42,709
Really simple. Use these stops. We're
still hold like open's still valid. I

5796
02:08:42,709 --> 02:08:42,719
still hold like open's still valid. I
 

5797
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:45,109
still hold like open's still valid. I
mean that it's a [\h__\h] company, don't get

5798
02:08:45,109 --> 02:08:45,119
mean that it's a [\h__\h] company, don't get
 

5799
02:08:45,119 --> 02:08:46,950
mean that it's a [\h__\h] company, don't get
me wrong, but it's still valid. It's

5800
02:08:46,950 --> 02:08:46,960
me wrong, but it's still valid. It's
 

5801
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:48,629
me wrong, but it's still valid. It's
still holding a higher low here. Like

5802
02:08:48,629 --> 02:08:48,639
still holding a higher low here. Like
 

5803
02:08:48,639 --> 02:08:50,229
still holding a higher low here. Like
they can resqueeze this. If they get

5804
02:08:50,229 --> 02:08:50,239
they can resqueeze this. If they get
 

5805
02:08:50,239 --> 02:08:51,510
they can resqueeze this. If they get
enough shorts caught in here, they can

5806
02:08:51,510 --> 02:08:51,520
enough shorts caught in here, they can
 

5807
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:54,310
enough shorts caught in here, they can
resqueeze it long term. Doesn't mean the

5808
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:54,320
resqueeze it long term. Doesn't mean the
 

5809
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:57,270
resqueeze it long term. Doesn't mean the
outlook longterm is good. But yeah,

5810
02:08:57,270 --> 02:08:57,280
outlook longterm is good. But yeah,
 

5811
02:08:57,280 --> 02:08:59,030
outlook longterm is good. But yeah,
that's that's literally everything's in

5812
02:08:59,030 --> 02:08:59,040
that's that's literally everything's in
 

5813
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:01,589
that's that's literally everything's in
the course. It's the same the same way I

5814
02:09:01,589 --> 02:09:01,599
the course. It's the same the same way I
 

5815
02:09:01,599 --> 02:09:03,589
the course. It's the same the same way I
treat anything, right? Same way I treat

5816
02:09:03,589 --> 02:09:03,599
treat anything, right? Same way I treat
 

5817
02:09:03,599 --> 02:09:05,669
treat anything, right? Same way I treat
anything. So I I would love this market

5818
02:09:05,669 --> 02:09:05,679
anything. So I I would love this market
 

5819
02:09:05,679 --> 02:09:07,510
anything. So I I would love this market
to come back down to here longterm at

5820
02:09:07,510 --> 02:09:07,520
to come back down to here longterm at
 

5821
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:09,910
to come back down to here longterm at
the moment. I think a buying opportunity

5822
02:09:09,910 --> 02:09:09,920
the moment. I think a buying opportunity
 

5823
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:13,030
the moment. I think a buying opportunity
becomes from Oh my god, going to let me

5824
02:09:13,030 --> 02:09:13,040
becomes from Oh my god, going to let me
 

5825
02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:15,109
becomes from Oh my god, going to let me
do it from here. If this keeps drifting

5826
02:09:15,109 --> 02:09:15,119
do it from here. If this keeps drifting
 

5827
02:09:15,119 --> 02:09:17,510
do it from here. If this keeps drifting
higher, right, that might be a buying

5828
02:09:17,510 --> 02:09:17,520
higher, right, that might be a buying
 

5829
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:19,589
higher, right, that might be a buying
opportunity. If we lose that, then all

5830
02:09:19,589 --> 02:09:19,599
opportunity. If we lose that, then all
 

5831
02:09:19,599 --> 02:09:21,430
opportunity. If we lose that, then all
hell breaks loose in the market. It's

5832
02:09:21,430 --> 02:09:21,440
hell breaks loose in the market. It's
 

5833
02:09:21,440 --> 02:09:23,030
hell breaks loose in the market. It's
the same thing. No matter what you're

5834
02:09:23,030 --> 02:09:23,040
the same thing. No matter what you're
 

5835
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:24,470
the same thing. No matter what you're
looking at, market's moving the same

5836
02:09:24,470 --> 02:09:24,480
looking at, market's moving the same
 

5837
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,470
looking at, market's moving the same
way,

5838
02:09:26,470 --> 02:09:26,480
way,
 

5839
02:09:26,480 --> 02:09:27,669
way,
right? Aren't we starting to see a

5840
02:09:27,669 --> 02:09:27,679
right? Aren't we starting to see a
 

5841
02:09:27,679 --> 02:09:39,910
right? Aren't we starting to see a
breakdown here,

5842
02:09:39,910 --> 02:09:39,920

low volume node and they know if they
 

5851
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:53,270
low volume node and they know if they
lose this they are in mega mega problem.

bit here, but I'm a bit pissed off with
 

5953
02:12:16,639 --> 02:12:19,030
bit here, but I'm a bit pissed off with
myself if I'm honest. I got knocked out

5954
02:12:19,030 --> 02:12:19,040
myself if I'm honest. I got knocked out
 

5955
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:21,430
myself if I'm honest. I got knocked out
of the 50s here. I didn't want to get

5956
02:12:21,430 --> 02:12:21,440
of the 50s here. I didn't want to get
 

5957
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:23,589
of the 50s here. I didn't want to get
recaught on it, but uh you know, so I

5958
02:12:23,589 --> 02:12:23,599
recaught on it, but uh you know, so I
 

5959
02:12:23,599 --> 02:12:26,390
recaught on it, but uh you know, so I
had to grab a bit later, but

5960
02:12:26,390 --> 02:12:26,400
had to grab a bit later, but
 

5961
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:29,030
had to grab a bit later, but
annoying. Annoying because I if I if I

5962
02:12:29,030 --> 02:12:29,040
annoying. Annoying because I if I if I
 

5963
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:30,550
annoying. Annoying because I if I if I
still had that entry from up here, I'd

5964
02:12:30,550 --> 02:12:30,560
still had that entry from up here, I'd
 

5965
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:32,069
still had that entry from up here, I'd
still be sat in this trying to let it

5966
02:12:32,069 --> 02:12:32,079
still be sat in this trying to let it
 

5967
02:12:32,079 --> 02:12:33,830
still be sat in this trying to let it
work.

5968
02:12:33,830 --> 02:12:33,840
work.
 

5969
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:40,550
work.
There we go. Is what it is.

5970
02:12:40,550 --> 02:12:40,560

 

5971
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:42,229

Can you join the Discord without the

5972
02:12:42,229 --> 02:12:42,239
Can you join the Discord without the
 

5973
02:12:42,239 --> 02:12:44,550
Can you join the Discord without the
course? No, unfortunately not. There's a

5974
02:12:44,550 --> 02:12:44,560
course? No, unfortunately not. There's a
 

5975
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:47,189
course? No, unfortunately not. There's a
reason for that. It's not to make you

5976
02:12:47,189 --> 02:12:47,199
reason for that. It's not to make you
 

5977
02:12:47,199 --> 02:12:48,870
reason for that. It's not to make you
you don't have to do the course, but

5978
02:12:48,870 --> 02:12:48,880
you don't have to do the course, but
 

5979
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:51,350
you don't have to do the course, but
it's because I have been in many many

5980
02:12:51,350 --> 02:12:51,360
it's because I have been in many many
 

5981
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:53,270
it's because I have been in many many
Discords, as I I'm sure lots of other

5982
02:12:53,270 --> 02:12:53,280
Discords, as I I'm sure lots of other
 

5983
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:54,709
Discords, as I I'm sure lots of other
people have on the in the past. If

5984
02:12:54,709 --> 02:12:54,719
people have on the in the past. If
 

5985
02:12:54,719 --> 02:12:56,950
people have on the in the past. If
you're in like a free discord or a

5986
02:12:56,950 --> 02:12:56,960
you're in like a free discord or a
 

5987
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:58,550
you're in like a free discord or a
monthly fee Discord or anything like

5988
02:12:58,550 --> 02:12:58,560
monthly fee Discord or anything like
 

5989
02:12:58,560 --> 02:13:00,709
monthly fee Discord or anything like
that where there's no education, you

5990
02:13:00,709 --> 02:13:00,719
that where there's no education, you
 

5991
02:13:00,719 --> 02:13:02,229
that where there's no education, you
will all trade different ways and you

5992
02:13:02,229 --> 02:13:02,239
will all trade different ways and you
 

5993
02:13:02,239 --> 02:13:04,470
will all trade different ways and you
will all just piss each other off and

5994
02:13:04,470 --> 02:13:04,480
will all just piss each other off and
 

5995
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:06,870
will all just piss each other off and
you'll start calling stuff which the

5996
02:13:06,870 --> 02:13:06,880
you'll start calling stuff which the
 

5997
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:08,550
you'll start calling stuff which the
other person in in the chat's looking at

5998
02:13:08,550 --> 02:13:08,560
other person in in the chat's looking at
 

5999
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:10,069
other person in in the chat's looking at
the other direction and it just causes

6000
02:13:10,069 --> 02:13:10,079
the other direction and it just causes
 

6001
02:13:10,079 --> 02:13:13,270
the other direction and it just causes
confusion. So the way we've set it up is

6002
02:13:13,270 --> 02:13:13,280
confusion. So the way we've set it up is
 

6003
02:13:13,280 --> 02:13:15,030
confusion. So the way we've set it up is
just for members only who have done the

6004
02:13:15,030 --> 02:13:15,040
just for members only who have done the
 

6005
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:16,470
just for members only who have done the
course and it means that they're all

6006
02:13:16,470 --> 02:13:16,480
course and it means that they're all
 

6007
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:17,990
course and it means that they're all
looking at the same thing in the same

6008
02:13:17,990 --> 02:13:18,000
looking at the same thing in the same
 

6009
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,830
looking at the same thing in the same
way and can support each other and for

6010
02:13:19,830 --> 02:13:19,840
way and can support each other and for
 

6011
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:23,910
way and can support each other and for
me that cultivates a very good community

6012
02:13:23,910 --> 02:13:23,920
me that cultivates a very good community
 

6013
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:26,790
me that cultivates a very good community
who are there to support each other and

6014
02:13:26,790 --> 02:13:26,800
who are there to support each other and
 

6015
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:28,790
who are there to support each other and
I feel like that's what we've got. It

6016
02:13:28,790 --> 02:13:28,800
I feel like that's what we've got. It
 

6017
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:30,790
I feel like that's what we've got. It
might be a smaller community as a couple

6018
02:13:30,790 --> 02:13:30,800
might be a smaller community as a couple
 

6019
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:33,189
might be a smaller community as a couple
hundred of us, but it's an active

6020
02:13:33,189 --> 02:13:33,199
hundred of us, but it's an active
 

6021
02:13:33,199 --> 02:13:34,870
hundred of us, but it's an active
community who support each other trading

6022
02:13:34,870 --> 02:13:34,880
community who support each other trading
 

6023
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:45,109
community who support each other trading
the same way.

6024
02:13:45,109 --> 02:13:45,119

 

6025
02:13:45,119 --> 02:13:48,790

Yeah, quite exactly, Rosco. Exactly. But

6026
02:13:48,790 --> 02:13:48,800
Yeah, quite exactly, Rosco. Exactly. But
 

6027
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:52,229
Yeah, quite exactly, Rosco. Exactly. But
like this week's kind of a good example

6028
02:13:52,229 --> 02:13:52,239
like this week's kind of a good example
 

6029
02:13:52,239 --> 02:13:53,990
like this week's kind of a good example
like so many of you would have seen me

6030
02:13:53,990 --> 02:13:54,000
like so many of you would have seen me
 

6031
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,470
like so many of you would have seen me
here all week and last week being like

6032
02:13:56,470 --> 02:13:56,480
here all week and last week being like
 

6033
02:13:56,480 --> 02:13:59,189
here all week and last week being like
please caning leave this range. Can we

6034
02:13:59,189 --> 02:13:59,199
please caning leave this range. Can we
 

6035
02:13:59,199 --> 02:14:00,870
please caning leave this range. Can we
leave this range? We've got to leave

6036
02:14:00,870 --> 02:14:00,880
leave this range? We've got to leave
 

6037
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:02,229
leave this range? We've got to leave
this range. I don't want to trade in

6038
02:14:02,229 --> 02:14:02,239
this range. I don't want to trade in
 

6039
02:14:02,239 --> 02:14:03,990
this range. I don't want to trade in
this range. And eventually we leave the

6040
02:14:03,990 --> 02:14:04,000
this range. And eventually we leave the
 

6041
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,830
this range. And eventually we leave the
range and it's a beautiful, beautiful

6042
02:14:05,830 --> 02:14:05,840
range and it's a beautiful, beautiful
 

6043
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:08,790
range and it's a beautiful, beautiful
day. It's so much easier to trade where

6044
02:14:08,790 --> 02:14:08,800
day. It's so much easier to trade where
 

6045
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:11,030
day. It's so much easier to trade where
momentum is obvious, where liquidity

6046
02:14:11,030 --> 02:14:11,040
momentum is obvious, where liquidity
 

6047
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:13,270
momentum is obvious, where liquidity
hunting for one side is obvious. So much

6048
02:14:13,270 --> 02:14:13,280
hunting for one side is obvious. So much
 

6049
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:19,189
hunting for one side is obvious. So much
easier than just playing that chop.

6050
02:14:19,189 --> 02:14:19,199

 

6051
02:14:19,199 --> 02:14:22,069

Where would the re-entry be? Uh, okay.

6052
02:14:22,069 --> 02:14:22,079
Where would the re-entry be? Uh, okay.
 

6053
02:14:22,079 --> 02:14:23,669
Where would the re-entry be? Uh, okay.
I'll have to focus in on this to have a

6054
02:14:23,669 --> 02:14:23,679
I'll have to focus in on this to have a
 

6055
02:14:23,679 --> 02:14:29,910
I'll have to focus in on this to have a
look you.

6056
02:14:29,910 --> 02:14:29,920

 

6057
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:31,669

Well,

6058
02:14:31,669 --> 02:14:31,679
Well,
 

6059
02:14:31,679 --> 02:14:33,270
Well,
what I'd say, they've already regained

6060
02:14:33,270 --> 02:14:33,280
what I'd say, they've already regained
 

6061
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:36,470
what I'd say, they've already regained
87. I wouldn't like that.

6062
02:14:36,470 --> 02:14:36,480
87. I wouldn't like that.
 

6063
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:40,149
87. I wouldn't like that.
If they start taking out 23s

6064
02:14:40,149 --> 02:14:40,159
If they start taking out 23s
 

6065
02:14:40,159 --> 02:14:41,910
If they start taking out 23s
and 30s, I don't think there's a

6066
02:14:41,910 --> 02:14:41,920
and 30s, I don't think there's a
 

6067
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:43,669
and 30s, I don't think there's a
re-entry. I'm going to be honest. Uh,

6068
02:14:43,669 --> 02:14:43,679
re-entry. I'm going to be honest. Uh,
 

6069
02:14:43,679 --> 02:14:47,030
re-entry. I'm going to be honest. Uh,
not anywhere down here. So maybe an IB,

6070
02:14:47,030 --> 02:14:47,040
not anywhere down here. So maybe an IB,
 

6071
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:48,550
not anywhere down here. So maybe an IB,
they might well squeeze this all the way

6072
02:14:48,550 --> 02:14:48,560
they might well squeeze this all the way
 

6073
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:50,470
they might well squeeze this all the way
back up to IB. You're starting to see

6074
02:14:50,470 --> 02:14:50,480
back up to IB. You're starting to see
 

6075
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:52,470
back up to IB. You're starting to see
compression down here, right? You're

6076
02:14:52,470 --> 02:14:52,480
compression down here, right? You're
 

6077
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:53,750
compression down here, right? You're
starting to see compression down here.

6078
02:14:53,750 --> 02:14:53,760
starting to see compression down here.
 

6079
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:55,910
starting to see compression down here.
They they've had this chance to move.

6080
02:14:55,910 --> 02:14:55,920
They they've had this chance to move.
 

6081
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:58,310
They they've had this chance to move.
Remember, this is a level here, but it's

6082
02:14:58,310 --> 02:14:58,320
Remember, this is a level here, but it's
 

6083
02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:01,109
Remember, this is a level here, but it's
also a level off the uh yearly chart.

6084
02:15:01,109 --> 02:15:01,119
also a level off the uh yearly chart.
 

6085
02:15:01,119 --> 02:15:03,350
also a level off the uh yearly chart.
Their chance to do this has has happened

6086
02:15:03,350 --> 02:15:03,360
Their chance to do this has has happened
 

6087
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:05,589
Their chance to do this has has happened
and they haven't taken it. It's very

6088
02:15:05,589 --> 02:15:05,599
and they haven't taken it. It's very
 

6089
02:15:05,599 --> 02:15:08,069
and they haven't taken it. It's very
very possible if too many shorts pile in

6090
02:15:08,069 --> 02:15:08,079
very possible if too many shorts pile in
 

6091
02:15:08,079 --> 02:15:10,470
very possible if too many shorts pile in
here and they haven't done this. If too

6092
02:15:10,470 --> 02:15:10,480
here and they haven't done this. If too
 

6093
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:12,390
here and they haven't done this. If too
many shorts pile in and they reclaim, I

6094
02:15:12,390 --> 02:15:12,400
many shorts pile in and they reclaim, I
 

6095
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:13,830
many shorts pile in and they reclaim, I
mean, they're rejecting the edge of this

6096
02:15:13,830 --> 02:15:13,840
mean, they're rejecting the edge of this
 

6097
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:16,310
mean, they're rejecting the edge of this
right now. If you think about tightening

6098
02:15:16,310 --> 02:15:16,320
right now. If you think about tightening
 

6099
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:17,830
right now. If you think about tightening
this up a little bit, if we put one of

6100
02:15:17,830 --> 02:15:17,840
this up a little bit, if we put one of
 

6101
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:19,750
this up a little bit, if we put one of
these in here, right, they're rejecting

6102
02:15:19,750 --> 02:15:19,760
these in here, right, they're rejecting
 

6103
02:15:19,760 --> 02:15:21,030
these in here, right, they're rejecting
the edge. They've still got the chance

6104
02:15:21,030 --> 02:15:21,040
the edge. They've still got the chance
 

6105
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:23,430
the edge. They've still got the chance
to protect 210s, but I'd say if they

6106
02:15:23,430 --> 02:15:23,440
to protect 210s, but I'd say if they
 

6107
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:25,669
to protect 210s, but I'd say if they
start getting above 210, I would

6108
02:15:25,669 --> 02:15:25,679
start getting above 210, I would
 

6109
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:28,310
start getting above 210, I would
potentially uh leave it alone. All

6110
02:15:28,310 --> 02:15:28,320
potentially uh leave it alone. All
 

6111
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:29,990
potentially uh leave it alone. All
right, if they start getting above this

6112
02:15:29,990 --> 02:15:30,000
right, if they start getting above this
 

6113
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,709
right, if they start getting above this
and holding above it, we're thin in

6114
02:15:32,709 --> 02:15:32,719
and holding above it, we're thin in
 

6115
02:15:32,719 --> 02:15:34,470
and holding above it, we're thin in
here. I would imagine we come and fill

6116
02:15:34,470 --> 02:15:34,480
here. I would imagine we come and fill
 

6117
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:37,510
here. I would imagine we come and fill
this into this level. And then how we at

6118
02:15:37,510 --> 02:15:37,520
this into this level. And then how we at
 

6119
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:38,870
this into this level. And then how we at
here becomes important. Maybe there's a

6120
02:15:38,870 --> 02:15:38,880
here becomes important. Maybe there's a
 

6121
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:40,790
here becomes important. Maybe there's a
re-short there, but we did just take out

6122
02:15:40,790 --> 02:15:40,800
re-short there, but we did just take out
 

6123
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,229
re-short there, but we did just take out
a weekly low. Remember, they don't have

6124
02:15:42,229 --> 02:15:42,239
a weekly low. Remember, they don't have
 

6125
02:15:42,239 --> 02:15:43,750
a weekly low. Remember, they don't have
to do this today. they can leave it for

6126
02:15:43,750 --> 02:15:43,760
to do this today. they can leave it for
 

6127
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:47,030
to do this today. they can leave it for
next week.

6215

basic principles about the market. It's
it's I think it's over 20 modules so

6620
02:27:49,030 --> 02:27:49,040
it's I think it's over 20 modules so
 

6621
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:51,830
it's I think it's over 20 modules so
that by the end of it you've got you

6622
02:27:51,830 --> 02:27:51,840
that by the end of it you've got you
 

6623
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:54,150
that by the end of it you've got you
know we put the foundation in so you

6624
02:27:54,150 --> 02:27:54,160
know we put the foundation in so you
 

6625
02:27:54,160 --> 02:27:56,630
know we put the foundation in so you
understand how and why the market moves

6626

02:27:58,950 --> 02:27:58,960
and we build blocks on top of that so
 

6629
02:27:58,960 --> 02:28:01,270
and we build blocks on top of that so
you've got a nice broad understanding

6630
02:28:01,270 --> 02:28:01,280
you've got a nice broad understanding
 

6631
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:02,389
you've got a nice broad understanding
because I think there's too much out

6632
02:28:02,389 --> 02:28:02,399
because I think there's too much out
 

6633
02:28:02,399 --> 02:28:03,590
because I think there's too much out
there where people come to the market

6634
02:28:03,590 --> 02:28:03,600
there where people come to the market
 

6635
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:06,550
there where people come to the market
and that and this isn't against one one

6636
02:28:06,550 --> 02:28:06,560
and that and this isn't against one one
 

6637
02:28:06,560 --> 02:28:07,990
and that and this isn't against one one
teaching method or anything else but

6638
02:28:07,990 --> 02:28:08,000
teaching method or anything else but
 

6639
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,150
teaching method or anything else but
they learn like oh this is my setup you

6640
02:28:10,150 --> 02:28:10,160
they learn like oh this is my setup you
 

6641
02:28:10,160 --> 02:28:12,150
they learn like oh this is my setup you
never understand why it does or doesn't

6642
02:28:12,150 --> 02:28:12,160
never understand why it does or doesn't
 

6643
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:14,950
never understand why it does or doesn't
work so you'll never understand then

6644
02:28:14,950 --> 02:28:14,960
work so you'll never understand then
 

6645
02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:17,830
work so you'll never understand then
like the nuances of like when not to

6667
02:28:55,120 --> 02:28:58,630
Techno producer here. I was better with
Ableton than Topep X.

6668
02:28:58,630 --> 02:28:58,640
Ableton than Topep X.
 

6669
02:28:58,640 --> 02:29:00,309
Ableton than Topep X.
Ableton was never my jam, man. I was a

6670
02:29:00,309 --> 02:29:00,319
Ableton was never my jam, man. I was a
 

6671
02:29:00,319 --> 02:29:02,550
Ableton was never my jam, man. I was a
Logic Logic X guy. I mean, I used to do

6672
02:29:02,550 --> 02:29:02,560
Logic Logic X guy. I mean, I used to do
 

6673
02:29:02,560 --> 02:29:05,910

my mixes in Ableton, but um

6674
02:29:05,910 --> 02:29:05,920
my mixes in Ableton, but um
 

6675
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:07,590
my mixes in Ableton, but um
I never used it the right way. So, if I

6676
02:29:07,590 --> 02:29:07,600
I never used it the right way. So, if I
 

6677
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:09,110
I never used it the right way. So, if I
was using Ableton, I was you always

6678
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:09,120
was using Ableton, I was you always
 

6679
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:11,750
was using Ableton, I was you always
using it in like the horizontal axis.

6680
02:29:11,750 --> 02:29:11,760
using it in like the horizontal axis.
 

6681
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:13,830
using it in like the horizontal axis.
I'd never did all the like clips and

6682
02:29:13,830 --> 02:29:13,840
I'd never did all the like clips and
 

6683
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:15,270
I'd never did all the like clips and
stuff. It used to drive me [\h__\h] mad.

6684
02:29:15,270 --> 02:29:15,280
stuff. It used to drive me [\h__\h] mad.
 

6685
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:16,950
stuff. It used to drive me [\h__\h] mad.
But I think it's super powerful. People

6686
02:29:16,950 --> 02:29:16,960
But I think it's super powerful. People
 

6687
02:29:16,960 --> 02:29:18,469
But I think it's super powerful. People
People love it. If I was going to start

6688
02:29:18,469 --> 02:29:18,479
People love it. If I was going to start
 

6689
02:29:18,479 --> 02:29:20,950
People love it. If I was going to start
all over again, I'd probably probably do

6690
02:29:20,950 --> 02:29:20,960
all over again, I'd probably probably do
 

6691
02:29:20,960 --> 02:29:23,429
all over again, I'd probably probably do
that.

6692
02:29:23,429 --> 02:29:23,439
that.
 

6693
02:29:23,439 --> 02:29:26,389
that.
No re-entry. Um, oh, it's tough, man, to

No re-entry. Um, oh, it's tough, man, to
 

6695
02:29:26,399 --> 02:29:28,070
No re-entry. Um, oh, it's tough, man, to
think I mean, look, you can think about

6696
02:29:28,070 --> 02:29:28,080
think I mean, look, you can think about
 

6697
02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:30,710
think I mean, look, you can think about
this same level here. It's just tough.

6698
02:29:30,710 --> 02:29:30,720
this same level here. It's just tough.
 

6699
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:32,309
this same level here. It's just tough.
Like, you're entering low of day to try

6700
02:29:32,309 --> 02:29:32,319
Like, you're entering low of day to try
 

6701
02:29:32,319 --> 02:29:35,429
Like, you're entering low of day to try
and go lower. Like, it's not it's not

6702
02:29:35,429 --> 02:29:35,439
and go lower. Like, it's not it's not
 

6703
02:29:35,439 --> 02:29:37,750
and go lower. Like, it's not it's not
you still got compression.

6704
02:29:37,750 --> 02:29:37,760
you still got compression.
 

6705
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:39,750
you still got compression.
This guy here is still like you're under

6706
02:29:39,750 --> 02:29:39,760
This guy here is still like you're under
 

6707
02:29:39,760 --> 02:29:44,469
This guy here is still like you're under
over. Uh let me check on the delta. Um

6708
02:29:44,469 --> 02:29:44,479
over. Uh let me check on the delta. Um
 

6709
02:29:44,479 --> 02:29:47,349
over. Uh let me check on the delta. Um
88s are still 88 and 94 are still big

6710
02:29:47,349 --> 02:29:47,359
88s are still 88 and 94 are still big
 

6711
02:29:47,359 --> 02:29:49,270
88s are still 88 and 94 are still big
levels. So buyers are trapped over that.

6712
02:29:49,270 --> 02:29:49,280
levels. So buyers are trapped over that.
 

6713
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:51,030
levels. So buyers are trapped over that.
So I guess 88. Yeah, it's the same

6714
02:29:51,030 --> 02:29:51,040
So I guess 88. Yeah, it's the same
 

6715
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:52,790
So I guess 88. Yeah, it's the same
level. This shelf here all the time that

6716
02:29:52,790 --> 02:29:52,800
level. This shelf here all the time that
 

6717
02:29:52,800 --> 02:29:54,790
level. This shelf here all the time that
this is being protected potentially

6718
02:29:54,790 --> 02:29:54,800
this is being protected potentially
 

6719
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:57,510
this is being protected potentially
lower. The pro the problem is is how for

6720
02:29:57,510 --> 02:29:57,520
lower. The pro the problem is is how for
 

6721
02:29:57,520 --> 02:30:00,710
lower. The pro the problem is is how for
me if we zoom out. All right. The

6722
02:30:00,710 --> 02:30:00,720
me if we zoom out. All right. The
 

6723
02:30:00,720 --> 02:30:04,150
me if we zoom out. All right. The
entries today have been here, here, and

6724
02:30:04,150 --> 02:30:04,160
entries today have been here, here, and
 

6725
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:05,910
entries today have been here, here, and
here. We're now trying to like we're

6726
02:30:05,910 --> 02:30:05,920
here. We're now trying to like we're
 

6727
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:07,590
here. We're now trying to like we're
trying to get that. What if it doesn't

6728
02:30:07,590 --> 02:30:07,600
trying to get that. What if it doesn't
 

6729
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:08,870
trying to get that. What if it doesn't
come? That's all that goes through my

6730
02:30:08,870 --> 02:30:08,880
come? That's all that goes through my
 

6731
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:11,990
come? That's all that goes through my
head. Like if in terms of RR, we're

6732
02:30:11,990 --> 02:30:12,000
head. Like if in terms of RR, we're
 

6733
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,309
head. Like if in terms of RR, we're
losing RR, right? We're losing RR. And

6734
02:30:14,309 --> 02:30:14,319
losing RR, right? We're losing RR. And
 

6735
02:30:14,319 --> 02:30:15,830
losing RR, right? We're losing RR. And
you want to be careful of this little

6736
02:30:15,830 --> 02:30:15,840
you want to be careful of this little
 

6737
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:17,270
you want to be careful of this little
nugget down here. Let me just check.

6738
02:30:17,270 --> 02:30:17,280
nugget down here. Let me just check.
 

6739
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:19,830
nugget down here. Let me just check.
Yeah, there is excess at the low. So I'd

6740
02:30:19,830 --> 02:30:19,840
Yeah, there is excess at the low. So I'd
 

6741
02:30:19,840 --> 02:30:22,710
Yeah, there is excess at the low. So I'd
say be very careful of this right here.

6742
02:30:22,710 --> 02:30:22,720
say be very careful of this right here.
 

6743
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:24,550
say be very careful of this right here.
Now,

6744
02:30:24,550 --> 02:30:24,560
Now,
 

6745
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:26,469
Now,
if they hold this, so I'd say your

6746
02:30:26,469 --> 02:30:26,479
if they hold this, so I'd say your
 

6747
02:30:26,479 --> 02:30:28,950
if they hold this, so I'd say your
rotations are between here, right? Now,

6748
02:30:28,950 --> 02:30:28,960
rotations are between here, right? Now,
 

6749
02:30:28,960 --> 02:30:33,750
rotations are between here, right? Now,
this is the buildout liquidity.

6750
02:30:33,750 --> 02:30:33,760

 

6751
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:36,070

That's the buildout, right? You can just

6752
02:30:36,070 --> 02:30:36,080
That's the buildout, right? You can just
 

6753
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:37,270
That's the buildout, right? You can just
see that on the volume profile. You

6754
02:30:37,270 --> 02:30:37,280
see that on the volume profile. You
 

6755
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:38,550
see that on the volume profile. You
don't even need the footprint for that.

6756
02:30:38,550 --> 02:30:38,560
don't even need the footprint for that.
 

6757
02:30:38,560 --> 02:30:39,990
don't even need the footprint for that.
If we go to the footprint and have a

6758
02:30:39,990 --> 02:30:40,000
If we go to the footprint and have a
 

6759
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:41,750
If we go to the footprint and have a
look what's been going on the last few

6760
02:30:41,750 --> 02:30:41,760
look what's been going on the last few
 

6761
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:43,910
look what's been going on the last few
minutes,

6762
02:30:43,910 --> 02:30:43,920
minutes,
 

6763
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:45,830
minutes,
you would see just in this there sellers

6764
02:30:45,830 --> 02:30:45,840
you would see just in this there sellers
 

6765
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:47,190
you would see just in this there sellers
just caught there. I just saw it. There

6766
02:30:47,190 --> 02:30:47,200
just caught there. I just saw it. There
 

6767
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:48,950
just caught there. I just saw it. There
you go. All right. So, this is the

6768
02:30:48,950 --> 02:30:48,960
you go. All right. So, this is the
 

6769
02:30:48,960 --> 02:30:50,150
you go. All right. So, this is the
problem. When you're trying to play low

6770
02:30:50,150 --> 02:30:50,160
problem. When you're trying to play low
 

6771
02:30:50,160 --> 02:30:51,590
problem. When you're trying to play low
of day, you've got everyone trying to

6772
02:30:51,590 --> 02:30:51,600
of day, you've got everyone trying to
 

6773
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:53,670
of day, you've got everyone trying to
force the breakdown of the lows. You're

6774
02:30:53,670 --> 02:30:53,680
force the breakdown of the lows. You're
 

6775
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:55,590
force the breakdown of the lows. You're
seeing absorption here. If you remember,

6776
02:30:55,590 --> 02:30:55,600
seeing absorption here. If you remember,
 

6777
02:30:55,600 --> 02:30:57,270
seeing absorption here. If you remember,
these are all market orders, right? If

6778
02:30:57,270 --> 02:30:57,280
these are all market orders, right? If
 

6779
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:58,469
these are all market orders, right? If
you're seeing all these market orders

6780
02:30:58,469 --> 02:30:58,479
you're seeing all these market orders
 

6781
02:30:58,479 --> 02:31:01,349
you're seeing all these market orders
flying in and we're not moving lower,

6782
02:31:01,349 --> 02:31:01,359
flying in and we're not moving lower,
 

6783
02:31:01,359 --> 02:31:02,790
flying in and we're not moving lower,
right? we're not moving lower. It means

6784
02:31:02,790 --> 02:31:02,800
right? we're not moving lower. It means
 

6785
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:04,790
right? we're not moving lower. It means
there's a passive buyer here and the

6786
02:31:04,790 --> 02:31:04,800
there's a passive buyer here and the
 

6787
02:31:04,800 --> 02:31:07,110
there's a passive buyer here and the
squeezes can potentially happen. And if

6788
02:31:07,110 --> 02:31:07,120
squeezes can potentially happen. And if
 

6789
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:09,030
squeezes can potentially happen. And if
we look to the upside, we want to see

6790
02:31:09,030 --> 02:31:09,040
we look to the upside, we want to see
 

6791
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:10,550
we look to the upside, we want to see
where the buyers are caught to the

6792
02:31:10,550 --> 02:31:10,560
where the buyers are caught to the
 

6793
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:19,349
where the buyers are caught to the
upside. So there's a little bit in here.

6794
02:31:19,349 --> 02:31:19,359

 

6795
02:31:19,359 --> 02:31:23,110

Yeah, a little bit at 50s

6796
02:31:23,110 --> 02:31:23,120
Yeah, a little bit at 50s
 

6797
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:26,790
Yeah, a little bit at 50s
and big selling came in above 50. So I'd

6798
02:31:26,790 --> 02:31:26,800
and big selling came in above 50. So I'd
 

6799
02:31:26,800 --> 02:31:29,349
and big selling came in above 50. So I'd
say if it can start printing above this

6800
02:31:29,349 --> 02:31:29,359
say if it can start printing above this
 

6801
02:31:29,359 --> 02:31:30,790
say if it can start printing above this
can probably be repriced. You can see

6802
02:31:30,790 --> 02:31:30,800
can probably be repriced. You can see
 

6803
02:31:30,800 --> 02:31:33,270
can probably be repriced. You can see
how thick that was there. If we look

6804
02:31:33,270 --> 02:31:33,280
how thick that was there. If we look
 

6805
02:31:33,280 --> 02:31:36,150
how thick that was there. If we look
left, yeah, same area. So, this is the

6806
02:31:36,150 --> 02:31:36,160
left, yeah, same area. So, this is the
 

6807
02:31:36,160 --> 02:31:38,070
left, yeah, same area. So, this is the
thing now, right? Definitely some

6808
02:31:38,070 --> 02:31:38,080
thing now, right? Definitely some
 

6809
02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:39,670
thing now, right? Definitely some
sellers caught down there at the lows

6810
02:31:39,670 --> 02:31:39,680
sellers caught down there at the lows
 

6811
02:31:39,680 --> 02:31:41,429
sellers caught down there at the lows
and they can very easily give a squeeze

6812
02:31:41,429 --> 02:31:41,439
and they can very easily give a squeeze
 

6813
02:31:41,439 --> 02:31:43,590
and they can very easily give a squeeze
relief. And we can see this is a proper

6814
02:31:43,590 --> 02:31:43,600
relief. And we can see this is a proper
 

6815
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:46,550
relief. And we can see this is a proper
imbalance, not a fair value gap, a legit

6816
02:31:46,550 --> 02:31:46,560
imbalance, not a fair value gap, a legit
 

6817
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:48,469
imbalance, not a fair value gap, a legit
imbalances right here. It is a fair

6818
02:31:48,469 --> 02:31:48,479
imbalances right here. It is a fair
 

6819
02:31:48,479 --> 02:31:50,070
imbalances right here. It is a fair
value gap, but you can actually see the

6820
02:31:50,070 --> 02:31:50,080
value gap, but you can actually see the
 

6821
02:31:50,080 --> 02:31:53,750
value gap, but you can actually see the
imbalance. This is washed out because

6822
02:31:53,750 --> 02:31:53,760
imbalance. This is washed out because
 

6823
02:31:53,760 --> 02:31:55,349
imbalance. This is washed out because
stocks got run out here. We're going to

6824
02:31:55,349 --> 02:31:55,359
stocks got run out here. We're going to
 

6825
02:31:55,359 --> 02:31:57,270
stocks got run out here. We're going to
do a lesson on liquidity later in

6826
02:31:57,270 --> 02:31:57,280
do a lesson on liquidity later in
 

6827
02:31:57,280 --> 02:31:58,870
do a lesson on liquidity later in
Discord. We talked about that. Once we

6828
02:31:58,870 --> 02:31:58,880
Discord. We talked about that. Once we
 

6829
02:31:58,880 --> 02:32:03,190
Discord. We talked about that. Once we
get off stream, let's do it like uh

6830
02:32:03,190 --> 02:32:03,200
get off stream, let's do it like uh
 

6831
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:05,030
get off stream, let's do it like uh
maybe maybe we can do it straight after

6832
02:32:05,030 --> 02:32:05,040
maybe maybe we can do it straight after
 

6833
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:07,110
maybe maybe we can do it straight after
stream. Maybe we do it straight after

6834
02:32:07,110 --> 02:32:07,120
stream. Maybe we do it straight after
 

6835
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:08,790
stream. Maybe we do it straight after
stream. Then I get my the rest of my day

6836
02:32:08,790 --> 02:32:08,800
stream. Then I get my the rest of my day
 

6837
02:32:08,800 --> 02:32:10,469
stream. Then I get my the rest of my day
free. All right. So, you can see you see

6838
02:32:10,469 --> 02:32:10,479
free. All right. So, you can see you see
 

6839
02:32:10,479 --> 02:32:14,230
free. All right. So, you can see you see
this delta flip. You see this sell sell.

6840
02:32:14,230 --> 02:32:14,240
this delta flip. You see this sell sell.
 

6841
02:32:14,240 --> 02:32:16,309
this delta flip. You see this sell sell.
No more selling or lots of selling but

6842
02:32:16,309 --> 02:32:16,319
No more selling or lots of selling but
 

6843
02:32:16,319 --> 02:32:19,270
No more selling or lots of selling but
no more available lower and we shift up.

6844
02:32:19,270 --> 02:32:19,280
no more available lower and we shift up.
 

6845
02:32:19,280 --> 02:32:20,870
no more available lower and we shift up.
All right, because these sellers are

6846
02:32:20,870 --> 02:32:20,880
All right, because these sellers are
 

6847
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:23,750
All right, because these sellers are
caught. So we've got an imbalance here

6848
02:32:23,750 --> 02:32:23,760
caught. So we've got an imbalance here
 

6849
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:26,550
caught. So we've got an imbalance here
and if we trade through 90s then I'd say

6850
02:32:26,550 --> 02:32:26,560
and if we trade through 90s then I'd say
 

6851
02:32:26,560 --> 02:32:28,950
and if we trade through 90s then I'd say
we can come and test 220s.

6852
02:32:28,950 --> 02:32:28,960
we can come and test 220s.
 

6853
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:30,389
we can come and test 220s.
You can see this imbalance here being

6854
02:32:30,389 --> 02:32:30,399
You can see this imbalance here being
 

6855
02:32:30,399 --> 02:32:32,469
You can see this imbalance here being
filled in. This is where buyers were

6856
02:32:32,469 --> 02:32:32,479
filled in. This is where buyers were
 

6857
02:32:32,479 --> 02:32:33,910
filled in. This is where buyers were
caught. So this is why we're doing a

6858
02:32:33,910 --> 02:32:33,920
caught. So this is why we're doing a
 

6859
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:36,230
caught. So this is why we're doing a
rotation between these right now and you

6860
02:32:36,230 --> 02:32:36,240
rotation between these right now and you
 

6861
02:32:36,240 --> 02:32:37,990
rotation between these right now and you
need to wait for acceptance outside of

6862
02:32:37,990 --> 02:32:38,000
need to wait for acceptance outside of
 

6863
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,550
need to wait for acceptance outside of
that in my opinion which will probably

6864
02:32:40,550 --> 02:32:40,560
that in my opinion which will probably
 

6865
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:42,070
that in my opinion which will probably
line up with there. There you go. So

6866
02:32:42,070 --> 02:32:42,080
line up with there. There you go. So
 

6867
02:32:42,080 --> 02:32:43,590
line up with there. There you go. So
exactly the same levels. If you think

6868
02:32:43,590 --> 02:32:43,600
exactly the same levels. If you think
 

6869
02:32:43,600 --> 02:32:45,110
exactly the same levels. If you think
about what we just looked at the same

6870
02:32:45,110 --> 02:32:45,120
about what we just looked at the same
 

6871
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:47,429
about what we just looked at the same
levels are the same levels here. So

6872
02:32:47,429 --> 02:32:47,439
levels are the same levels here. So
 

6873
02:32:47,439 --> 02:32:49,670
levels are the same levels here. So
confluence here. This is what sellers

6874
02:32:49,670 --> 02:32:49,680
confluence here. This is what sellers
 

6875
02:32:49,680 --> 02:32:51,110
confluence here. This is what sellers
are trying to protect. This is what

6876
02:32:51,110 --> 02:32:51,120
are trying to protect. This is what
 

6877
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:53,270
are trying to protect. This is what
buyers are trying to protect. This is

6878
02:32:53,270 --> 02:32:53,280
buyers are trying to protect. This is
 

6879
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:55,510
buyers are trying to protect. This is
the rotation within this tiny range.

6880
02:32:55,510 --> 02:32:55,520
the rotation within this tiny range.
 

6881
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:57,349
the rotation within this tiny range.

Acceptance above, squeeze, acceptance
 

6883
02:32:57,359 --> 02:33:03,190
Acceptance above, squeeze, acceptance

Let's change that now before I forget

6892
02:33:20,389 --> 02:33:20,399
Let's change that now before I forget
 

6893
02:33:20,399 --> 02:33:22,150
Let's change that now before I forget
that people will watch this back and get

02:33:22,150 --> 02:33:22,160
that people will watch this back and get
 

6895
02:33:22,160 --> 02:33:24,950
that people will watch this back and get
confused. Let's change that 12. There we

6896
02:33:24,950 --> 02:33:24,960
confused. Let's change that 12. There we
 

6897
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:33,910
confused. Let's change that 12. There we
go.

6898
02:33:33,910 --> 02:33:33,920

 

6899
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:35,750

Jeremiah, your live is one of the best
 

6917
02:33:58,560 --> 02:34:00,070
Jeremiah, your live is one of the best
I've seen in a while. Great education.

6918
02:34:00,070 --> 02:34:00,080
I've seen in a while. Great education.
 

6919
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:01,510
I've seen in a while. Great education.
Thanks, man. Thanks, everyone.

6920

Appreciate it.
Where do I anchor volume profile? Um, so

6924
02:34:06,150 --> 02:34:06,160
Where do I anchor volume profile? Um, so
 

6925
02:34:06,160 --> 02:34:07,750
Where do I anchor volume profile? Um, so
if if you're doing it intraday, you want

6926
02:34:07,750 --> 02:34:07,760
if if you're doing it intraday, you want
 

6927
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:11,190
if if you're doing it intraday, you want
it how I would do it. Uh, 9:30. All

6928
02:34:11,190 --> 02:34:11,200
it how I would do it. Uh, 9:30. All
 

6929
02:34:11,200 --> 02:34:13,110
it how I would do it. Uh, 9:30. All
right. So, I'm interested in 9:30. You

6930
02:34:13,110 --> 02:34:13,120
right. So, I'm interested in 9:30. You
 

6931
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:14,790
right. So, I'm interested in 9:30. You
can of course measure out GlobeEx if

6932
02:34:14,790 --> 02:34:14,800
can of course measure out GlobeEx if
 

6933
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:15,830
can of course measure out GlobeEx if
you're interested how we trade in

6934
02:34:15,830 --> 02:34:15,840
you're interested how we trade in
 

6935
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:18,230
you're interested how we trade in
GlobeEx. Then you go from the open of

6936
02:34:18,230 --> 02:34:18,240
GlobeEx. Then you go from the open of
 

6937
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:20,790
GlobeEx. Then you go from the open of
the new day into 9:30. But I only really

6938
02:34:20,790 --> 02:34:20,800
the new day into 9:30. But I only really
 

6939
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:22,550
the new day into 9:30. But I only really
care about where volume's traded. 9:30

6940
02:34:22,550 --> 02:34:22,560
care about where volume's traded. 9:30
 

6941
02:34:22,560 --> 02:34:25,670
care about where volume's traded. 9:30
onwards. And if you're doing a weekly,

6942
02:34:25,670 --> 02:34:25,680
onwards. And if you're doing a weekly,
 

6943
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:27,110
onwards. And if you're doing a weekly,
then obviously the whole week. If you're

6944
02:34:27,110 --> 02:34:27,120
then obviously the whole week. If you're
 

6945
02:34:27,120 --> 02:34:28,870
then obviously the whole week. If you're
doing a monthly, the whole month. If

6946
02:34:28,870 --> 02:34:28,880
doing a monthly, the whole month. If
 

6947
02:34:28,880 --> 02:34:45,429
doing a monthly, the whole month. If
you're doing the yearly, the whole year.

6948
02:34:45,429 --> 02:34:45,439

 

6949
02:34:45,439 --> 02:34:47,429

Yeah, I I would agree with you, Rosco.

6950
02:34:47,429 --> 02:34:47,439
Yeah, I I would agree with you, Rosco.
 

6951
02:34:47,439 --> 02:34:49,270
Yeah, I I would agree with you, Rosco.
Like to go lower is lower probability,

6952
02:34:49,270 --> 02:34:49,280
Like to go lower is lower probability,
 

6953
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:51,110
Like to go lower is lower probability,
but there's still a draw there. The only

6954
02:34:51,110 --> 02:34:51,120
but there's still a draw there. The only
 

6955
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:52,870
but there's still a draw there. The only
thing I'd say is look, look at SPY at

6956
02:34:52,870 --> 02:34:52,880
thing I'd say is look, look at SPY at
 

6957
02:34:52,880 --> 02:34:57,510
thing I'd say is look, look at SPY at
these 280s. It can't break down 280 680.

6958
02:34:57,510 --> 02:34:57,520
these 280s. It can't break down 280 680.
 

6959
02:34:57,520 --> 02:34:59,910
these 280s. It can't break down 280 680.
That's the level, right? So, it might

6960
02:34:59,910 --> 02:34:59,920
That's the level, right? So, it might
 

6961
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:02,950
That's the level, right? So, it might
need to retest 82 and uh see if they

6962
02:35:02,950 --> 02:35:02,960
need to retest 82 and uh see if they
 

6963
02:35:02,960 --> 02:35:04,710
need to retest 82 and uh see if they
actually want to sell 82 and get follow

6964
02:35:04,710 --> 02:35:04,720
actually want to sell 82 and get follow
 

6965
02:35:04,720 --> 02:35:07,030
actually want to sell 82 and get follow
through. Remember, the levels on spy

6966
02:35:07,030 --> 02:35:07,040
through. Remember, the levels on spy
 

6967
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:10,950
through. Remember, the levels on spy
were clear. 88 or 90, 88, 85, 82, 80.

6968
02:35:10,950 --> 02:35:10,960
were clear. 88 or 90, 88, 85, 82, 80.
 

6969
02:35:10,960 --> 02:35:12,870
were clear. 88 or 90, 88, 85, 82, 80.
Those have been the options levels all

6970
02:35:12,870 --> 02:35:12,880
Those have been the options levels all
 

6971
02:35:12,880 --> 02:35:15,030
Those have been the options levels all
week, probably for two weeks. So, here

6972
02:35:15,030 --> 02:35:15,040
week, probably for two weeks. So, here
 

6973
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:16,230
week, probably for two weeks. So, here
we go. So, starting to reclaim. We're

6974
02:35:16,230 --> 02:35:16,240
we go. So, starting to reclaim. We're
 

6975
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:17,750
we go. So, starting to reclaim. We're
going to go and test the top of this or

6976
02:35:17,750 --> 02:35:17,760
going to go and test the top of this or
 

6977
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:20,469
going to go and test the top of this or
the the red box above. We're going to go

6978
02:35:20,469 --> 02:35:20,479
the the red box above. We're going to go
 

6979
02:35:20,479 --> 02:35:21,990
the the red box above. We're going to go
and test this red box above, which is

6980
02:35:21,990 --> 02:35:22,000
and test this red box above, which is
 

6981
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:23,270
and test this red box above, which is
previous week low there as well. The

6982
02:35:23,270 --> 02:35:23,280
previous week low there as well. The
 

6983
02:35:23,280 --> 02:35:25,030
previous week low there as well. The
green line is previous week low. If they

6984
02:35:25,030 --> 02:35:25,040
green line is previous week low. If they
 

6985
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:27,110
green line is previous week low. If they
get through that red box, they can

6986
02:35:27,110 --> 02:35:27,120
get through that red box, they can
 

6987
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:28,630
get through that red box, they can
potentially come and run these stops.

6988
02:35:28,630 --> 02:35:28,640
potentially come and run these stops.
 

6989
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:30,150
potentially come and run these stops.
Remember, this is like compression like

6990
02:35:30,150 --> 02:35:30,160
Remember, this is like compression like
 

6991
02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:32,469
Remember, this is like compression like
we've talked about. All right? So, if we

6992
02:35:32,469 --> 02:35:32,479
we've talked about. All right? So, if we
 

6993
02:35:32,479 --> 02:35:35,670
we've talked about. All right? So, if we
start doing this and this, all right,

6994
02:35:35,670 --> 02:35:35,680
start doing this and this, all right,
 

6995
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:37,030
start doing this and this, all right,
then we're going to get a squeeze relief

6996
02:35:37,030 --> 02:35:37,040
then we're going to get a squeeze relief
 

6997
02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:38,469
then we're going to get a squeeze relief
to here because all the shorts will get

6998
02:35:38,469 --> 02:35:38,479
to here because all the shorts will get
 

6999
02:35:38,479 --> 02:35:40,070
to here because all the shorts will get
caught. If they reject this and we keep

7000
02:35:40,070 --> 02:35:40,080
caught. If they reject this and we keep
 

7001
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:42,070
caught. If they reject this and we keep
rotating in here, and if we do that long

7002
02:35:42,070 --> 02:35:42,080
rotating in here, and if we do that long
 

7003
02:35:42,080 --> 02:35:43,750
rotating in here, and if we do that long
enough and then they get the breakdown,

7004
02:35:43,750 --> 02:35:43,760
enough and then they get the breakdown,
 

7005
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:45,270
enough and then they get the breakdown,
then maybe there's enough bulls caught.

7006
02:35:45,270 --> 02:35:45,280
then maybe there's enough bulls caught.
 

7007
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:47,190
then maybe there's enough bulls caught.
But there's a lot of if buts and may

7008
02:35:47,190 --> 02:35:47,200
But there's a lot of if buts and may
 

7009
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:55,510
But there's a lot of if buts and may
right now.

7010
02:35:55,510 --> 02:35:55,520

 

7011
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:57,590

How does volume profile fit into that?

7012
02:35:57,590 --> 02:35:57,600
How does volume profile fit into that?
 

7013
02:35:57,600 --> 02:36:00,469
How does volume profile fit into that?
Uh, fit into watch bit which bit deluxe.

7014
02:36:00,469 --> 02:36:00,479
Uh, fit into watch bit which bit deluxe.
 

7015
02:36:00,479 --> 02:36:02,469
Uh, fit into watch bit which bit deluxe.
Sorry, you might have written that a few

7016
02:36:02,469 --> 02:36:02,479
Sorry, you might have written that a few
 

7017
02:36:02,479 --> 02:36:07,750
Sorry, you might have written that a few
minutes ago and I've missed it.

7018
02:36:07,750 --> 02:36:07,760
minutes ago and I've missed it.
 

7019

So they're fading this top edge again,

7034
02:36:38,469 --> 02:36:38,479
So they're fading this top edge again,
 

7035
02:36:38,479 --> 02:36:39,830
So they're fading this top edge again,
getting thicker and thicker and thicker

Remember the the main trade is downside

7040
02:36:45,190 --> 02:36:45,200
Remember the the main trade is downside
 

7041
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:47,429
Remember the the main trade is downside
today. This is the final target it can

7042
02:36:47,429 --> 02:36:47,439
today. This is the final target it can
 

7043
02:36:47,439 --> 02:36:50,469

hit. The main trade is downside. So, if

7044
02:36:50,469 --> 02:36:50,479
hit. The main trade is downside. So, if
 

7045
02:36:50,479 --> 02:36:51,750

7057
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:01,910
Traps can live in here, right? All traps
can live in here. I wouldn't expect it

7058
02:37:01,910 --> 02:37:01,920

7059
02:37:01,920 --> 02:37:04,150
can live in here. I wouldn't expect it
to get above any of this really today.

7060
02:37:04,150 --> 02:37:04,160
to get above any of this really today.
 

7061
02:37:04,160 --> 02:37:05,910

7064
02:37:08,150 --> 02:37:08,160
But traps can live in there. This is the
 

7065
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:10,309
But traps can live in there. This is the
main trend today. This is why I'm not I

7066
02:37:10,309 --> 02:37:10,319
main trend today. This is why I'm not I
 

7067
02:37:10,319 --> 02:37:12,150

never play counter trend. I do not play

7068
02:37:12,150 --> 02:37:12,160
never play counter trend. I do not play
 

7069
02:37:12,160 --> 02:37:14,469
never play counter trend. I do not play
counter trend in trending markets. We

7070
02:37:14,469 --> 02:37:14,479
counter trend in trending markets. We
 

7071
02:37:14,479 --> 02:37:16,469
counter trend in trending markets. We
are actually in a trending market today.

7072
02:37:16,469 --> 02:37:16,479
are actually in a trending market today.
 

7073
02:37:16,479 --> 02:37:18,469
are actually in a trending market today.
It's the first time. We had the chance

7074
02:37:18,469 --> 02:37:18,479
It's the first time. We had the chance
 

7075
02:37:18,479 --> 02:37:20,150
It's the first time. We had the chance
to go into trend a few times this week,

7076
02:37:20,150 --> 02:37:20,160
to go into trend a few times this week,
 

7077
02:37:20,160 --> 02:37:22,469
to go into trend a few times this week,
but this is the first day we've seen a

7078
02:37:22,469 --> 02:37:22,479
but this is the first day we've seen a
 

7079
02:37:22,479 --> 02:37:24,469
but this is the first day we've seen a
sustained auction outside. So, we're

7080
02:37:24,469 --> 02:37:24,479
sustained auction outside. So, we're
 

7081
02:37:24,479 --> 02:37:35,110
sustained auction outside. So, we're
definitely in trend.

7082
02:37:35,110 --> 02:37:35,120

 

7083
02:37:35,120 --> 02:37:36,870

Back to this blue box. Now, do they let

7084
02:37:36,870 --> 02:37:36,880
Back to this blue box. Now, do they let
 

7085
02:37:36,880 --> 02:37:39,190
Back to this blue box. Now, do they let
go of this blue box? Now, this is where

7086
02:37:39,190 --> 02:37:39,200
go of this blue box? Now, this is where
 

7087
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:40,630
go of this blue box? Now, this is where
buyers are trying to defend like we

7088
02:37:40,630 --> 02:37:40,640
buyers are trying to defend like we
 

7089
02:37:40,640 --> 02:37:42,230
buyers are trying to defend like we
talked about. So you can see the

7090
02:37:42,230 --> 02:37:42,240
talked about. So you can see the
 

7091
02:37:42,240 --> 02:37:44,070
talked about. So you can see the
rotation between these two areas over

7092
02:37:44,070 --> 02:37:44,080
rotation between these two areas over
 

7093
02:37:44,080 --> 02:37:45,429
rotation between these two areas over
and over and over and over and over

7094
02:37:45,429 --> 02:37:45,439
and over and over and over and over
 

7095
02:37:45,439 --> 02:37:47,190
and over and over and over and over
again. Eventually someone will win.

7096
02:37:47,190 --> 02:37:47,200
again. Eventually someone will win.
 

7097
02:37:47,200 --> 02:37:51,510
again. Eventually someone will win.
Won't stay here forever.

7098
02:37:51,510 --> 02:37:51,520

tighter and tighter and tighter. This is
 

7331

02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:27,830
nice uh look for a continuation lower.
This is the opposite of what I would

7336
02:44:27,830 --> 02:44:27,840
This is the opposite of what I would
 

7337
02:44:27,840 --> 02:44:29,269
This is the opposite of what I would
like to see for a continuation lower,

7338
02:44:29,269 --> 02:44:29,279
like to see for a continuation lower,
 

7339
02:44:29,279 --> 02:44:31,429
like to see for a continuation lower,
but we're getting tight. Something's

7340
02:44:31,429 --> 02:44:31,439
but we're getting tight. Something's
 

7341
02:44:31,439 --> 02:44:33,910
but we're getting tight. Something's
going to give holding on by a thread.

7342
02:44:33,910 --> 02:44:33,920
going to give holding on by a thread.
 

7343
02:44:33,920 --> 02:44:37,670
going to give holding on by a thread.
These buyers

7344
02:44:37,670 --> 02:44:37,680

 

7345
02:44:37,680 --> 02:45:20,710

you guys another minute

7346
02:45:20,710 --> 02:45:20,720

 

7347
02:45:20,720 --> 02:45:22,230

All right, let's reclaim that little red

7348
02:45:22,230 --> 02:45:22,240
All right, let's reclaim that little red
 

7349
02:45:22,240 --> 02:45:25,670
All right, let's reclaim that little red
node. It's going to try and now come up

7350
02:45:25,670 --> 02:45:25,680
node. It's going to try and now come up
 

7351
02:45:25,680 --> 02:45:29,349
node. It's going to try and now come up
490s to 200. If it breaks out of there,

7352
02:45:29,349 --> 02:45:29,359
490s to 200. If it breaks out of there,
 

7353
02:45:29,359 --> 02:45:30,950
490s to 200. If it breaks out of there,
potential squeeze into this low volume

7354
02:45:30,950 --> 02:45:30,960
potential squeeze into this low volume
 

7355
02:45:30,960 --> 02:45:32,630
potential squeeze into this low volume
node all the way back to IV is

7359
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:36,469

wouldn't be trading counter trend today.

7360
02:45:36,469 --> 02:45:36,479
wouldn't be trading counter trend today.
 

7361
02:45:36,479 --> 02:45:40,309
wouldn't be trading counter trend today.

7424

7425
02:47:51,600 --> 02:47:53,590

Awesome.

7426
02:47:53,590 --> 02:47:53,600
Awesome.
 

7427
02:47:53,600 --> 02:47:55,590
Awesome.
All right, guys. We are at lunch and

7428
02:47:55,590 --> 02:47:55,600
All right, guys. We are at lunch and
 

7429
02:47:55,600 --> 02:47:56,870
All right, guys. We are at lunch and
you're seeing that relief now starting

7430
02:47:56,870 --> 02:47:56,880
you're seeing that relief now starting
 

7431
02:47:56,880 --> 02:48:00,469
you're seeing that relief now starting
to play out. Okay, so finally buyers did

7432
02:48:00,469 --> 02:48:00,479
to play out. Okay, so finally buyers did
 

7433
02:48:00,479 --> 02:48:01,990
to play out. Okay, so finally buyers did
not let them come underneath this blue

7434
02:48:01,990 --> 02:48:02,000
not let them come underneath this blue
 

7435
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:03,670
not let them come underneath this blue
box. So when we call these sellers were

7436
02:48:03,670 --> 02:48:03,680
box. So when we call these sellers were
 

7437
02:48:03,680 --> 02:48:05,349
box. So when we call these sellers were
stuck here, they had one more attempt to

7438
02:48:05,349 --> 02:48:05,359
stuck here, they had one more attempt to
 

7439
02:48:05,359 --> 02:48:06,790
stuck here, they had one more attempt to
move lower. They didn't. Buyers

7440
02:48:06,790 --> 02:48:06,800
move lower. They didn't. Buyers
 

7441
02:48:06,800 --> 02:48:08,230
move lower. They didn't. Buyers
absorbed. They took this little red

7442
02:48:08,230 --> 02:48:08,240
absorbed. They took this little red
 

7443
02:48:08,240 --> 02:48:09,990
absorbed. They took this little red
block out. We come up to this red block

7444
02:48:09,990 --> 02:48:10,000
block out. We come up to this red block
 

7445
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:11,830
block out. We come up to this red block
now. And any relief over here is likely

7446
02:48:11,830 --> 02:48:11,840
now. And any relief over here is likely
 

7447
02:48:11,840 --> 02:48:14,389
now. And any relief over here is likely
to come back up into this. Right. we can

7448
02:48:14,389 --> 02:48:14,399
to come back up into this. Right. we can
 

7449
02:48:14,399 --> 02:48:17,510
to come back up into this. Right. we can
repric some of this low volume up into

7450
02:48:17,510 --> 02:48:17,520
repric some of this low volume up into
 

7451
02:48:17,520 --> 02:48:19,830
repric some of this low volume up into
here. So, I would say shorts now are off

7452
02:48:19,830 --> 02:48:19,840
here. So, I would say shorts now are off
 

7453
02:48:19,840 --> 02:48:22,630
here. So, I would say shorts now are off
the table. My expectation would be

7454
02:48:22,630 --> 02:48:22,640
the table. My expectation would be
 

7455
02:48:22,640 --> 02:48:24,630
the table. My expectation would be
potential squeeze out here. It wouldn't

7456
02:48:24,630 --> 02:48:24,640
potential squeeze out here. It wouldn't
 

7457
02:48:24,640 --> 02:48:25,990
potential squeeze out here. It wouldn't
necessarily be high and then maybe

7458
02:48:25,990 --> 02:48:26,000
necessarily be high and then maybe
 

7459
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,150
necessarily be high and then maybe
there's a short back up here. Maybe you

7460
02:48:28,150 --> 02:48:28,160
there's a short back up here. Maybe you
 

7461
02:48:28,160 --> 02:48:30,710
there's a short back up here. Maybe you
can think about a short uh as we get

7462
02:48:30,710 --> 02:48:30,720
can think about a short uh as we get
 

7463
02:48:30,720 --> 02:48:32,150
can think about a short uh as we get
into some of these nodes here, but I'd

7464
02:48:32,150 --> 02:48:32,160
into some of these nodes here, but I'd
 

7465
02:48:32,160 --> 02:48:34,790
into some of these nodes here, but I'd
say most of the damage has been done for

7466
02:48:34,790 --> 02:48:34,800
say most of the damage has been done for
 

7467
02:48:34,800 --> 02:48:37,030
say most of the damage has been done for
the day.

7468
02:48:37,030 --> 02:48:37,040
the day.
 

7469
02:48:37,040 --> 02:48:39,110
the day.
So, the long here once they held this

7470
02:48:39,110 --> 02:48:39,120
So, the long here once they held this
 

7471
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:40,630
So, the long here once they held this
and I said if they take this red line

7472
02:48:40,630 --> 02:48:40,640
and I said if they take this red line
 

7473
02:48:40,640 --> 02:48:41,910
and I said if they take this red line
out, they're going to come back to this

7474
02:48:41,910 --> 02:48:41,920
out, they're going to come back to this
 

7475
02:48:41,920 --> 02:48:43,510
out, they're going to come back to this
one. And if they hold above this now,

7476
02:48:43,510 --> 02:48:43,520
one. And if they hold above this now,
 

7477
02:48:43,520 --> 02:48:45,830
one. And if they hold above this now,
then they can repric into here. I'd

7478
02:48:45,830 --> 02:48:45,840
then they can repric into here. I'd
 

7479
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:47,830
then they can repric into here. I'd
expect bears to defend this level here.

7480
02:48:47,830 --> 02:48:47,840
expect bears to defend this level here.
 

7481
02:48:47,840 --> 02:48:49,030
expect bears to defend this level here.
All right, especially we've got both

7482
02:48:49,030 --> 02:48:49,040
All right, especially we've got both
 

7483
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:50,550
All right, especially we've got both
VWAPs. By the time you get there, you're

7484
02:48:50,550 --> 02:48:50,560
VWAPs. By the time you get there, you're
 

7485
02:48:50,560 --> 02:48:52,550
VWAPs. By the time you get there, you're
going to have everything in one place,

7486
02:48:52,550 --> 02:48:52,560
going to have everything in one place,
 

7487
02:48:52,560 --> 02:48:57,030
going to have everything in one place,
right? We can move this to red. And um

7488
02:48:57,030 --> 02:48:57,040
right? We can move this to red. And um
 

7489
02:48:57,040 --> 02:48:59,030
right? We can move this to red. And um
I would say once we get up there, I

7490
02:48:59,030 --> 02:48:59,040
I would say once we get up there, I
 

7491
02:48:59,040 --> 02:49:01,030
I would say once we get up there, I
would expect bears to defend that level.

7492
02:49:01,030 --> 02:49:01,040
would expect bears to defend that level.
 

7493
02:49:01,040 --> 02:49:02,710
would expect bears to defend that level.
If they fail to defend that level, well,

7494
02:49:02,710 --> 02:49:02,720
If they fail to defend that level, well,
 

7495
02:49:02,720 --> 02:49:03,990
If they fail to defend that level, well,
then they're opening themselves up to

7496
02:49:03,990 --> 02:49:04,000
then they're opening themselves up to
 

7497
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:05,510
then they're opening themselves up to
get caught in a squeeze, aren't they? is

7498
02:49:05,510 --> 02:49:05,520
get caught in a squeeze, aren't they? is
 

7499
02:49:05,520 --> 02:49:08,150
get caught in a squeeze, aren't they? is
through previous daily low. If bears

7500
02:49:08,150 --> 02:49:08,160
through previous daily low. If bears
 

7501
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:09,990
through previous daily low. If bears
can't defend

7502
02:49:09,990 --> 02:49:10,000
can't defend
 

7503
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,309
can't defend
this under here, all right, bears need

7504
02:49:12,309 --> 02:49:12,319
this under here, all right, bears need
 

7505
02:49:12,319 --> 02:49:15,429
this under here, all right, bears need
to defend this. They want to do this,

7506
02:49:15,429 --> 02:49:15,439
to defend this. They want to do this,
 

7507
02:49:15,439 --> 02:49:17,510
to defend this. They want to do this,
cover some runners. If they don't do

7508
02:49:17,510 --> 02:49:17,520
cover some runners. If they don't do
 

7509
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:19,590
cover some runners. If they don't do
that and they get caught here and it's a

7510
02:49:19,590 --> 02:49:19,600
that and they get caught here and it's a
 

7511
02:49:19,600 --> 02:49:22,150
that and they get caught here and it's a
fail, look below previous day low and we

7512
02:49:22,150 --> 02:49:22,160
fail, look below previous day low and we
 

7513
02:49:22,160 --> 02:49:24,309
fail, look below previous day low and we
will trade back inside range. I will

7514
02:49:24,309 --> 02:49:24,319
will trade back inside range. I will
 

7515
02:49:24,319 --> 02:49:26,710
will trade back inside range. I will
absolutely pray to the ENQ gods that

7516
02:49:26,710 --> 02:49:26,720
absolutely pray to the ENQ gods that
 

7517
02:49:26,720 --> 02:49:29,269
absolutely pray to the ENQ gods that
that is not how today finishes. All

7518
02:49:29,269 --> 02:49:29,279
that is not how today finishes. All
 

7519
02:49:29,279 --> 02:49:33,190
that is not how today finishes. All
right. I would love us to say close any

7520
02:49:33,190 --> 02:49:33,200
right. I would love us to say close any
 

7521
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:35,510
right. I would love us to say close any
any close under here is good. It doesn't

7522
02:49:35,510 --> 02:49:35,520
any close under here is good. It doesn't
 

7523
02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:37,110
any close under here is good. It doesn't
need to close down here. I'd actually

7524
02:49:37,110 --> 02:49:37,120
need to close down here. I'd actually
 

7525
02:49:37,120 --> 02:49:38,630
need to close down here. I'd actually
wouldn't mind them leaving that for next

7526
02:49:38,630 --> 02:49:38,640
wouldn't mind them leaving that for next
 

7527
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:40,389
wouldn't mind them leaving that for next
week. But if we can just close around

7528
02:49:40,389 --> 02:49:40,399
week. But if we can just close around
 

7529
02:49:40,399 --> 02:49:43,269
week. But if we can just close around
here for the day, fine. And like build

7530
02:49:43,269 --> 02:49:43,279
here for the day, fine. And like build
 

7531
02:49:43,279 --> 02:49:45,110
here for the day, fine. And like build
out a range here, fine. Because then we

7532
02:49:45,110 --> 02:49:45,120
out a range here, fine. Because then we
 

7533
02:49:45,120 --> 02:49:47,910
out a range here, fine. Because then we
have a range to play come Monday for a

7534
02:49:47,910 --> 02:49:47,920
have a range to play come Monday for a
 

7535
02:49:47,920 --> 02:49:49,269
have a range to play come Monday for a
breakdown underneath, which would be

7536
02:49:49,269 --> 02:49:49,279
breakdown underneath, which would be
 

7537
02:49:49,279 --> 02:49:50,950
breakdown underneath, which would be
fantastic.

7538
02:49:50,950 --> 02:49:50,960
fantastic.
 

7539
02:49:50,960 --> 02:49:53,830
fantastic.
Uh I think that's probably it from me,

7540
02:49:53,830 --> 02:49:53,840
Uh I think that's probably it from me,
 

7541
02:49:53,840 --> 02:49:57,750
Uh I think that's probably it from me,
folks. Um sorry, catch up on chat. Quick

7542
02:49:57,750 --> 02:49:57,760
folks. Um sorry, catch up on chat. Quick
 

7543
02:49:57,760 --> 02:50:00,630
folks. Um sorry, catch up on chat. Quick
question. when we've broken down below

7544
02:50:00,630 --> 02:50:00,640
question. when we've broken down below
 

7545
02:50:00,640 --> 02:50:03,030
question. when we've broken down below
previous week's value, do you just go

7546
02:50:03,030 --> 02:50:03,040
previous week's value, do you just go
 

7547
02:50:03,040 --> 02:50:06,389
previous week's value, do you just go
back to the last week that was in range

7548
02:50:06,389 --> 02:50:06,399
back to the last week that was in range
 

7549
02:50:06,399 --> 02:50:08,550
back to the last week that was in range
that we are trading into? Yeah. So, it

7550
02:50:08,550 --> 02:50:08,560
that we are trading into? Yeah. So, it
 

7551
02:50:08,560 --> 02:50:11,030
that we are trading into? Yeah. So, it
really depends where that week is. It's

7552
02:50:11,030 --> 02:50:11,040
really depends where that week is. It's
 

7553
02:50:11,040 --> 02:50:13,910
really depends where that week is. It's
a good question, but yes, effectively.

7554
02:50:13,910 --> 02:50:13,920
a good question, but yes, effectively.
 

7555
02:50:13,920 --> 02:50:15,990
a good question, but yes, effectively.
So, you look for the last area of

7556
02:50:15,990 --> 02:50:16,000
So, you look for the last area of
 

7557
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:17,750
So, you look for the last area of
support and resistance, right? So, if we

7558
02:50:17,750 --> 02:50:17,760
support and resistance, right? So, if we
 

7559
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:22,950
support and resistance, right? So, if we
look at what we've built here,

7560
02:50:22,950 --> 02:50:22,960

 

7561
02:50:22,960 --> 02:50:25,349

just think about value since October.

7562
02:50:25,349 --> 02:50:25,359
just think about value since October.
 

7563
02:50:25,359 --> 02:50:26,870
just think about value since October.
So, we're looking basically three months

7564
02:50:26,870 --> 02:50:26,880
So, we're looking basically three months
 

7565
02:50:26,880 --> 02:50:28,710
So, we're looking basically three months
worth of value. Make sure you can see me

7566
02:50:28,710 --> 02:50:28,720
worth of value. Make sure you can see me
 

7567
02:50:28,720 --> 02:50:30,550
worth of value. Make sure you can see me
in screen. All right. So, why was there

7568
02:50:30,550 --> 02:50:30,560
in screen. All right. So, why was there
 

7569
02:50:30,560 --> 02:50:32,309
in screen. All right. So, why was there
supply up here? Because we had we spent

7570
02:50:32,309 --> 02:50:32,319
supply up here? Because we had we spent
 

7571
02:50:32,319 --> 02:50:35,030
supply up here? Because we had we spent
a week up here, right? And we failed

7572
02:50:35,030 --> 02:50:35,040
a week up here, right? And we failed
 

7573
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:37,110
a week up here, right? And we failed
under it, right? So, we know buyers are

7574
02:50:37,110 --> 02:50:37,120
under it, right? So, we know buyers are
 

7575
02:50:37,120 --> 02:50:38,790
under it, right? So, we know buyers are
trapped up there. They become our supply

7576
02:50:38,790 --> 02:50:38,800
trapped up there. They become our supply
 

7577
02:50:38,800 --> 02:50:42,389
trapped up there. They become our supply
level into 900. We spend a week moving

7578
02:50:42,389 --> 02:50:42,399
level into 900. We spend a week moving
 

7579
02:50:42,399 --> 02:50:44,630
level into 900. We spend a week moving
away from it. The next week we spend

7580
02:50:44,630 --> 02:50:44,640
away from it. The next week we spend
 

7581
02:50:44,640 --> 02:50:46,790
away from it. The next week we spend
inside. So, we now have consolidation.

7582
02:50:46,790 --> 02:50:46,800
inside. So, we now have consolidation.
 

7583
02:50:46,800 --> 02:50:49,510
inside. So, we now have consolidation.
All right. So, we move point of control

7584
02:50:49,510 --> 02:50:49,520
All right. So, we move point of control
 

7585
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:51,830
All right. So, we move point of control
down, down, down. Value is moving lower,

7586
02:50:51,830 --> 02:50:51,840
down, down, down. Value is moving lower,
 

7587
02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:53,429
down, down, down. Value is moving lower,
but we create an inside. Once we break

7588
02:50:53,429 --> 02:50:53,439
but we create an inside. Once we break
 

7589
02:50:53,439 --> 02:50:54,790
but we create an inside. Once we break
outside of this, we're going to see a

7590
02:50:54,790 --> 02:50:54,800
outside of this, we're going to see a
 

7591
02:50:54,800 --> 02:50:56,070
outside of this, we're going to see a
liquidation event. There's the

7592
02:50:56,070 --> 02:50:56,080
liquidation event. There's the
 

7593
02:50:56,080 --> 02:50:58,790
liquidation event. There's the
liquidation event. We move value lower.

7594
02:50:58,790 --> 02:50:58,800
liquidation event. We move value lower.
 

7595
02:50:58,800 --> 02:51:01,670
liquidation event. We move value lower.
The next week we hold the old point of

7596
02:51:01,670 --> 02:51:01,680
The next week we hold the old point of
 

7597
02:51:01,680 --> 02:51:04,790
The next week we hold the old point of
control. We move value higher higher but

7598
02:51:04,790 --> 02:51:04,800
control. We move value higher higher but
 

7599
02:51:04,800 --> 02:51:07,429
control. We move value higher higher but
we get stuck in this same box. Right?

7600
02:51:07,429 --> 02:51:07,439
we get stuck in this same box. Right?
 

7601
02:51:07,439 --> 02:51:10,150
we get stuck in this same box. Right?
This same box is the problem. Market

7602
02:51:10,150 --> 02:51:10,160
This same box is the problem. Market
 

7603
02:51:10,160 --> 02:51:11,750
This same box is the problem. Market
does not want to let out these buyers.

7604
02:51:11,750 --> 02:51:11,760
does not want to let out these buyers.
 

7605
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:13,429
does not want to let out these buyers.
That's the big problem right now. So now

7606
02:51:13,429 --> 02:51:13,439
That's the big problem right now. So now
 

7607
02:51:13,439 --> 02:51:16,950
That's the big problem right now. So now
that we failed

7608
02:51:16,950 --> 02:51:16,960
that we failed
 

7609
02:51:16,960 --> 02:51:19,670
that we failed
two weeks worth of value,

7610
02:51:19,670 --> 02:51:19,680
two weeks worth of value,
 

7611
02:51:19,680 --> 02:51:22,469
two weeks worth of value,
right, we failed previous week and on a

7612
02:51:22,469 --> 02:51:22,479
right, we failed previous week and on a
 

7613
02:51:22,479 --> 02:51:25,590
right, we failed previous week and on a
Friday we're failing current week.

7614
02:51:25,590 --> 02:51:25,600
Friday we're failing current week.
 

7615
02:51:25,600 --> 02:51:27,349
Friday we're failing current week.
All we're ever going to do is look left,

7616
02:51:27,349 --> 02:51:27,359
All we're ever going to do is look left,
 

7617
02:51:27,359 --> 02:51:28,950
All we're ever going to do is look left,
right? We can never look right. It'd be

7618
02:51:28,950 --> 02:51:28,960
right? We can never look right. It'd be
 

7619
02:51:28,960 --> 02:51:30,309
right? We can never look right. It'd be
amazing if we could look right. Magic

7620
02:51:30,309 --> 02:51:30,319
amazing if we could look right. Magic
 

7621
02:51:30,319 --> 02:51:31,750
amazing if we could look right. Magic
eightball. We're only ever going to look

7622
02:51:31,750 --> 02:51:31,760
eightball. We're only ever going to look
 

7623
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:34,950
eightball. We're only ever going to look
left. So, if we look left, if we think

7624
02:51:34,950 --> 02:51:34,960
left. So, if we look left, if we think
 

7625
02:51:34,960 --> 02:51:37,590
left. So, if we look left, if we think
about this red box was at one point

7626
02:51:37,590 --> 02:51:37,600
about this red box was at one point
 

7627
02:51:37,600 --> 02:51:39,030
about this red box was at one point
blue, wasn't it? Right? Because we're

7628
02:51:39,030 --> 02:51:39,040
blue, wasn't it? Right? Because we're
 

7629
02:51:39,040 --> 02:51:40,469
blue, wasn't it? Right? Because we're
thinking, well, the market might pause

7630
02:51:40,469 --> 02:51:40,479
thinking, well, the market might pause
 

7631
02:51:40,479 --> 02:51:41,990
thinking, well, the market might pause
here. It might come down to the old

7632
02:51:41,990 --> 02:51:42,000
here. It might come down to the old
 

7633
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,630
here. It might come down to the old
value area high and find a bid. But it

7634
02:51:44,630 --> 02:51:44,640
value area high and find a bid. But it
 

7635
02:51:44,640 --> 02:51:47,510
value area high and find a bid. But it
didn't. So, if we come back up and we

7636
02:51:47,510 --> 02:51:47,520
didn't. So, if we come back up and we
 

7637
02:51:47,520 --> 02:51:49,590
didn't. So, if we come back up and we
reject this red box, what are we saying?

7638
02:51:49,590 --> 02:51:49,600
reject this red box, what are we saying?
 

7639
02:51:49,600 --> 02:51:51,190
reject this red box, what are we saying?
We're not willing to move back outside

7640
02:51:51,190 --> 02:51:51,200
We're not willing to move back outside
 

7641
02:51:51,200 --> 02:51:52,790
We're not willing to move back outside
of this value. So, if we're going to

7642
02:51:52,790 --> 02:51:52,800
of this value. So, if we're going to
 

7643
02:51:52,800 --> 02:51:56,630
of this value. So, if we're going to
rotate value from Monday the 24th, that

7644
02:51:56,630 --> 02:51:56,640
rotate value from Monday the 24th, that
 

7645
02:51:56,640 --> 02:51:58,950
rotate value from Monday the 24th, that
whole week from Monday the 24th, where

7646
02:51:58,950 --> 02:51:58,960
whole week from Monday the 24th, where
 

7647
02:51:58,960 --> 02:52:00,389
whole week from Monday the 24th, where
are we going to go? Well, if we lose

7648
02:52:00,389 --> 02:52:00,399
are we going to go? Well, if we lose
 

7649
02:52:00,399 --> 02:52:02,070
are we going to go? Well, if we lose
gray box, remember there's a little node

7650
02:52:02,070 --> 02:52:02,080
gray box, remember there's a little node
 

7651
02:52:02,080 --> 02:52:04,230
gray box, remember there's a little node
here, which is why it's singled out

7652
02:52:04,230 --> 02:52:04,240
here, which is why it's singled out
 

7653
02:52:04,240 --> 02:52:06,309
here, which is why it's singled out
right here. If we lose gray box, so if

7654
02:52:06,309 --> 02:52:06,319
right here. If we lose gray box, so if
 

7655
02:52:06,319 --> 02:52:08,389
right here. If we lose gray box, so if
we come to red and we lose that and we

7656
02:52:08,389 --> 02:52:08,399
we come to red and we lose that and we
 

7657
02:52:08,399 --> 02:52:09,910
we come to red and we lose that and we
lose gray, we're going to go naked point

7658
02:52:09,910 --> 02:52:09,920
lose gray, we're going to go naked point
 

7659
02:52:09,920 --> 02:52:11,990
lose gray, we're going to go naked point
of control, which is also the week

7660
02:52:11,990 --> 02:52:12,000
of control, which is also the week
 

7661
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,550
of control, which is also the week
before that value area high. All right,

7662
02:52:14,550 --> 02:52:14,560
before that value area high. All right,
 

7663
02:52:14,560 --> 02:52:15,750
before that value area high. All right,
so this is why I want to watch this

7664
02:52:15,750 --> 02:52:15,760
so this is why I want to watch this
 

7665
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:17,750
so this is why I want to watch this
because this is a confluence level. It's

7666
02:52:17,750 --> 02:52:17,760
because this is a confluence level. It's
 

7667
02:52:17,760 --> 02:52:19,830
because this is a confluence level. It's
two levels. It's a value error high and

7668
02:52:19,830 --> 02:52:19,840
two levels. It's a value error high and
 

7669
02:52:19,840 --> 02:52:21,590
two levels. It's a value error high and
a point of control. Both of which are

7670
02:52:21,590 --> 02:52:21,600
a point of control. Both of which are
 

7671
02:52:21,600 --> 02:52:23,429
a point of control. Both of which are
untested. I think we're coming down

7672
02:52:23,429 --> 02:52:23,439
untested. I think we're coming down
 

7673
02:52:23,439 --> 02:52:25,510
untested. I think we're coming down
here. It is a matter of time. Today,

7674
02:52:25,510 --> 02:52:25,520
here. It is a matter of time. Today,
 

7675
02:52:25,520 --> 02:52:27,030
here. It is a matter of time. Today,
next week, I don't know when. It's a

7676
02:52:27,030 --> 02:52:27,040
next week, I don't know when. It's a
 

7677
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:28,469
next week, I don't know when. It's a
matter of time. So, in answer to your

7678
02:52:28,469 --> 02:52:28,479
matter of time. So, in answer to your
 

7679
02:52:28,479 --> 02:52:31,110
matter of time. So, in answer to your
question, yes, you always look at the

7680
02:52:31,110 --> 02:52:31,120
question, yes, you always look at the
 

7681
02:52:31,120 --> 02:52:32,710
question, yes, you always look at the
previous week's value or not necessarily

7682
02:52:32,710 --> 02:52:32,720
previous week's value or not necessarily
 

7683
02:52:32,720 --> 02:52:35,590
previous week's value or not necessarily
the previous week's value. The last the

7684
02:52:35,590 --> 02:52:35,600
the previous week's value. The last the
 

7685
02:52:35,600 --> 02:52:38,230
the previous week's value. The last the
last closest bit of value because I'll

7686
02:52:38,230 --> 02:52:38,240
last closest bit of value because I'll
 

7687
02:52:38,240 --> 02:52:40,070
last closest bit of value because I'll
give you an example why I say that.

7688
02:52:40,070 --> 02:52:40,080
give you an example why I say that.
 

7689
02:52:40,080 --> 02:52:43,030
give you an example why I say that.
Imagine we had this and then for some

7690
02:52:43,030 --> 02:52:43,040
Imagine we had this and then for some
 

7691
02:52:43,040 --> 02:52:45,429
Imagine we had this and then for some
reason we had this down here and then we

7692
02:52:45,429 --> 02:52:45,439
reason we had this down here and then we
 

7693
02:52:45,439 --> 02:52:47,910
reason we had this down here and then we
had a gap up week here, right? And then

7694
02:52:47,910 --> 02:52:47,920
had a gap up week here, right? And then
 

7695
02:52:47,920 --> 02:52:49,830
had a gap up week here, right? And then
we had a void in here, we'd we'd respect

7696
02:52:49,830 --> 02:52:49,840
we had a void in here, we'd we'd respect
 

7697
02:52:49,840 --> 02:52:52,230
we had a void in here, we'd we'd respect
this level, right? It's not necessarily

7698
02:52:52,230 --> 02:52:52,240
this level, right? It's not necessarily
 

7699
02:52:52,240 --> 02:52:54,230
this level, right? It's not necessarily
the week before. It's the next week to

7700
02:52:54,230 --> 02:52:54,240
the week before. It's the next week to
 

7701
02:52:54,240 --> 02:52:56,630
the week before. It's the next week to
retest. And the fresher it is, the

7702
02:52:56,630 --> 02:52:56,640
retest. And the fresher it is, the
 

7703
02:52:56,640 --> 02:52:58,950
retest. And the fresher it is, the
better. All right? So, the fact that we

7704
02:52:58,950 --> 02:52:58,960
better. All right? So, the fact that we
 

7705
02:52:58,960 --> 02:53:01,510
better. All right? So, the fact that we
haven't retested this is important,

7706
02:53:01,510 --> 02:53:01,520
haven't retested this is important,
 

7707
02:53:01,520 --> 02:53:05,510
haven't retested this is important,
right? Because once we left value here,

7708
02:53:05,510 --> 02:53:05,520
right? Because once we left value here,
 

7709
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:07,190
right? Because once we left value here,
this is our first retest of this value

7710
02:53:07,190 --> 02:53:07,200
this is our first retest of this value
 

7711
02:53:07,200 --> 02:53:09,670
this is our first retest of this value
area high. Never retested this. It's a

7712
02:53:09,670 --> 02:53:09,680
area high. Never retested this. It's a
 

7713
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:12,230
area high. Never retested this. It's a
fresh level. Fresh level. Which is why

7714
02:53:12,230 --> 02:53:12,240
fresh level. Fresh level. Which is why
 

7715
02:53:12,240 --> 02:53:14,710
fresh level. Fresh level. Which is why
on the lower time frame,

7716
02:53:14,710 --> 02:53:14,720
on the lower time frame,
 

7717

this.

this range, I think we have some uh

7770
02:54:24,870 --> 02:54:24,880
this range, I think we have some uh
 

7771
02:54:24,880 --> 02:54:27,429
this range, I think we have some uh
really really good trade setups for the

7772
02:54:27,429 --> 02:54:27,439
really really good trade setups for the
 

7773
