14
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
can move this chair down a bit.
 

15
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,310
can move this chair down a bit.
Okay.

16
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
Okay.
 

17
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,030

00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,749
How's everyone doing?
Oh, we're having tech nightmare already

20
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
Oh, we're having tech nightmare already
 

21
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,110
Oh, we're having tech nightmare already
to start the day. Funning games.

22
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
to start the day. Funning games.
 

23
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,390
to start the day. Funning games.
There we go.

24
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400

 

25
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,950

easy short yesterday. super super clear.
 

31
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,390
easy short yesterday. super super clear.
If you had the newsletter, you would

32
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
If you had the newsletter, you would
 

33
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,909
If you had the newsletter, you would
have been ready. All bears had to do was

34
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
have been ready. All bears had to do was
 

35
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,550
have been ready. All bears had to do was
defend 900, which they did, right? So,

36
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:24,560
defend 900, which they did, right? So,
 

37
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,629
defend 900, which they did, right? So,
on a daily chart, here we are. Here's

38
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
on a daily chart, here we are. Here's
 

39
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,870
on a daily chart, here we are. Here's
the defending level. There's the old

40
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
the defending level. There's the old
 

41
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,950
the defending level. There's the old
gap. There's the old swing high. Bears

42
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
gap. There's the old swing high. Bears
 

43
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,790
gap. There's the old swing high. Bears
are trying to defend this. Bulls will

44
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
are trying to defend this. Bulls will
 

45
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,110
are trying to defend this. Bulls will
want to catch a bid either here or here

46
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
want to catch a bid either here or here
 

47
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,870
want to catch a bid either here or here
to go back to alltime highs. That's the

48
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
to go back to alltime highs. That's the
 

49
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,029
to go back to alltime highs. That's the
game right now. We're not in multi-time

50
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
game right now. We're not in multi-time
 

51
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,390
game right now. We're not in multi-time
frame confluence. All right, you can see

52
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
frame confluence. All right, you can see
 

53
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,110
frame confluence. All right, you can see
on the daily, it's probably very likely

54
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
on the daily, it's probably very likely
 

55
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,710
on the daily, it's probably very likely
that we need to set a higher low

56
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
that we need to set a higher low
 

57
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,990
that we need to set a higher low
somewhere. We don't know where that's

58
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000
somewhere. We don't know where that's
 

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,830
somewhere. We don't know where that's
going to be. All right. If they fail to

60
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,840
going to be. All right. If they fail to
 

61
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,350
going to be. All right. If they fail to
set high low, obviously we come all the

62
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
set high low, obviously we come all the
 

63
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,870
set high low, obviously we come all the
way back down to this volume node down

64
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
way back down to this volume node down
 

65
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,990
way back down to this volume node down
here. But uh that's what uh the market's

66
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
here. But uh that's what uh the market's
 

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,670
here. But uh that's what uh the market's
looking for at the moment, which means

68
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
looking for at the moment, which means
 

69
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,270
looking for at the moment, which means
all the time there's sellside pressure

70
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
all the time there's sellside pressure
 

71
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,670
all the time there's sellside pressure
down here. Bears have the chance have

72
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
down here. Bears have the chance have
 

73
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,430
down here. Bears have the chance have
the chance, not necessarily confirmed,

74
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
the chance, not necessarily confirmed,
 

75
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,909
the chance, not necessarily confirmed,
have the chance to try and have a little

76
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
have the chance to try and have a little
 

77
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,950
have the chance to try and have a little
break down here and a wash back to the

78
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
break down here and a wash back to the
 

79
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,950
break down here and a wash back to the
mean. Remember, you've got 50-day, 20

80
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
mean. Remember, you've got 50-day, 20
 

81
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,830
mean. Remember, you've got 50-day, 20
days sitting right there. So top bowl,

82
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
days sitting right there. So top bowl,
 

83
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,550
days sitting right there. So top bowl,
bottom bowl, mean. All right. two

84
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
bottom bowl, mean. All right. two
 

85
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,070
bottom bowl, mean. All right. two
standard deviation two standard

86
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
standard deviation two standard
 

87
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,830
standard deviation two standard
deviation. So it's very possible we see

88
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
deviation. So it's very possible we see
 

89
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,110
deviation. So it's very possible we see
this rotation at some point. All right,

90
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
this rotation at some point. All right,
 

91
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,950
this rotation at some point. All right,
bulls very clearly. They just got to get

92
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960
bulls very clearly. They just got to get
 

93
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,510
bulls very clearly. They just got to get
back over well really the first stop

94
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
back over well really the first stop
 

95
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,309
back over well really the first stop
would be to get over 760 U because they

96
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
would be to get over 760 U because they
 

97
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,830
would be to get over 760 U because they
failed to hold there 760 740 750 that

98
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
failed to hold there 760 740 750 that
 

99
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,950
failed to hold there 760 740 750 that
kind of level that I talked about in the

100
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
kind of level that I talked about in the
 

101
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,469
kind of level that I talked about in the
newsletter. They have failed to get a

102
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
newsletter. They have failed to get a
 

103
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,150
newsletter. They have failed to get a
close above and hold. That's not very

104
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
close above and hold. That's not very
 

105
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,070
close above and hold. That's not very
good. This high here from Thursday last

106
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
good. This high here from Thursday last
 

107
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,909
good. This high here from Thursday last
week. All they needed to do was hold

108
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
week. All they needed to do was hold
 

109
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,469
week. All they needed to do was hold
that to force the squeeze. They haven't

110
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
that to force the squeeze. They haven't
 

111
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,350
that to force the squeeze. They haven't
um but they have built in supply up

112
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
um but they have built in supply up
 

113
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,590
um but they have built in supply up
here. So bulls need to get over 760 over

114
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600
here. So bulls need to get over 760 over
 

115
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,870
here. So bulls need to get over 760 over
that. They're looking for 926,000 break.

116
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
that. They're looking for 926,000 break.
 

117
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,629
that. They're looking for 926,000 break.
Very, very simple. Into this old balance

118
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
Very, very simple. Into this old balance
 

119
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,070
Very, very simple. Into this old balance
range where we don't really get thick

120
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
range where we don't really get thick
 

121
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,270
range where we don't really get thick
until we get to uh 26. All right. So,

122
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,280
until we get to uh 26. All right. So,
 

123
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,870
until we get to uh 26. All right. So,
that's the story right now. So, what are

124
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
that's the story right now. So, what are
 

125
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,990
that's the story right now. So, what are
we watching? Well, if we get a

126
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
we watching? Well, if we get a
 

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,990
we watching? Well, if we get a
breakdown, we're watching for a break

128
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
breakdown, we're watching for a break
 

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,510
breakdown, we're watching for a break
underneath previous day low. If they

130
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
underneath previous day low. If they
 

131
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,150
underneath previous day low. If they
stay heavy for that rotation, right? If

132
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
stay heavy for that rotation, right? If
 

133
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,469
stay heavy for that rotation, right? If
they do a little sweep or a hold, then

134
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
they do a little sweep or a hold, then
 

135
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,070
they do a little sweep or a hold, then
you're just expecting more range to be

136
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
you're just expecting more range to be
 

137
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,790
you're just expecting more range to be
built out until there's a close above

138
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
built out until there's a close above
 

139
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,189
built out until there's a close above
25750.

140
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
25750.
 

141
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,469
25750.
And we can look at that more on the

142
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
And we can look at that more on the
 

143
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,390
And we can look at that more on the
hourly to make it make sense for you.

144
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
hourly to make it make sense for you.
 

145
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,550
hourly to make it make sense for you.
All right. So just focus on this chart

146
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
All right. So just focus on this chart
 

147
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,909
All right. So just focus on this chart
here. This is going to become really

148
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
here. This is going to become really
 

149
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,070
here. This is going to become really
key. All right. All we've got so far,

150
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,080
key. All right. All we've got so far,
 

151
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,469
key. All right. All we've got so far,
this is your previous week value. All

152
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:26,479
this is your previous week value. All
 

153
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,870
this is your previous week value. All
right. And we have had a look above on

154
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
right. And we have had a look above on
 

155
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,950
right. And we have had a look above on
Friday, fail. A look above Sunday and

156
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
Friday, fail. A look above Sunday and
 

157
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,510
Friday, fail. A look above Sunday and
Monday, fail. We're back inside previous

158
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
Monday, fail. We're back inside previous
 

159
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,749
Monday, fail. We're back inside previous
week's value. There you go. Right. We're

160
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:35,759
week's value. There you go. Right. We're
 

161
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,029
week's value. There you go. Right. We're
back inside balance. So we're rejecting

162
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
back inside balance. So we're rejecting
 

163
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,189
back inside balance. So we're rejecting
uh old supply. If we look left, we're

164
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
uh old supply. If we look left, we're
 

165
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,029
uh old supply. If we look left, we're
rejecting this. We can't even get up

166
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
rejecting this. We can't even get up
 

167
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,270
rejecting this. We can't even get up
into it. All right. So, this little node

168
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
into it. All right. So, this little node
 

169
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,309
into it. All right. So, this little node
here, right? Wait, from uh Monday the

170
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
here, right? Wait, from uh Monday the
 

171
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,990
here, right? Wait, from uh Monday the
3rd. All right, we can't get through

172
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000
3rd. All right, we can't get through
 

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,550
3rd. All right, we can't get through
that. We're rejecting that, which means

174
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
that. We're rejecting that, which means
 

175
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,309
that. We're rejecting that, which means
we can't get back into these trapped

176
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
we can't get back into these trapped
 

177
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,150
we can't get back into these trapped
buyers up here. And we're back into an

178
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
buyers up here. And we're back into an
 

179
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,670
buyers up here. And we're back into an
old balance range. Look how much time

180
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
old balance range. Look how much time
 

181
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,830
old balance range. Look how much time
we've spent here this year, right? One

182
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
we've spent here this year, right? One
 

183
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,189
we've spent here this year, right? One
week, two week, 3 week, we're now into

184
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
week, two week, 3 week, we're now into
 

185
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,830
week, two week, 3 week, we're now into
week four. You can tell this is a huge

186
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
week four. You can tell this is a huge
 

187
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,110
week four. You can tell this is a huge
level, folks. All right, so that sort of

188
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
level, folks. All right, so that sort of
 

189
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,029
level, folks. All right, so that sort of
25, 900 down to 25, let's just call it

190
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
25, 900 down to 25, let's just call it
 

191
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,629
25, 900 down to 25, let's just call it
400. 20 25 450 massive level of rotation

192
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
400. 20 25 450 massive level of rotation
 

193
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,790
400. 20 25 450 massive level of rotation
because we've done it for uh this is

194
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
because we've done it for uh this is
 

195
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,270
because we've done it for uh this is
week four of doing it. So that's what

196
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
week four of doing it. So that's what
 

197
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,510
week four of doing it. So that's what
we're watching. So we have to pay close

198
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
we're watching. So we have to pay close
 

199
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,430
we're watching. So we have to pay close
attention to that previous week value. I

200
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
attention to that previous week value. I
 

201
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,189
attention to that previous week value. I
think all the time we keep failing where

202
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
think all the time we keep failing where
 

203
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,670
think all the time we keep failing where
I've put this now red box on. If we fail

204
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,680
I've put this now red box on. If we fail
 

205
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,270
I've put this now red box on. If we fail
previous days value area high, there's

206
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
previous days value area high, there's
 

207
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,469
previous days value area high, there's
probably a rotation back down to

208
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479
probably a rotation back down to
 

209
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,389
probably a rotation back down to
previous day value area low. If we look

210
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
previous day value area low. If we look
 

211
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,909
previous day value area low. If we look
below reclaim that, that's probably a

212
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
below reclaim that, that's probably a
 

213
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,230
below reclaim that, that's probably a
rotation back up. We might well build a

214
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
rotation back up. We might well build a
 

215
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,469
rotation back up. We might well build a
Dshape in here because we've got FOMC

216
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
Dshape in here because we've got FOMC
 

217
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,670
Dshape in here because we've got FOMC
coming tomorrow. If big big big if, but

218
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
coming tomorrow. If big big big if, but
 

219
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,910
coming tomorrow. If big big big if, but
if we get weakness underneath previous

220
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
if we get weakness underneath previous
 

221
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,230
if we get weakness underneath previous
day value area low and previous day,

222
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240
day value area low and previous day,
 

223
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,590
day value area low and previous day,
previous weak point of control. All

224
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
previous weak point of control. All
 

225
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,949
previous weak point of control. All
right, so we've got a double confluence

226
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
right, so we've got a double confluence
 

227
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,949
right, so we've got a double confluence
here. We know this is a massive area.

228
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
here. We know this is a massive area.
 

229
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,949
here. We know this is a massive area.
We've soaked off it. We couldn't close

230
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
We've soaked off it. We couldn't close
 

231
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,389
We've soaked off it. We couldn't close
below. We bounced off it. We couldn't

232
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
below. We bounced off it. We couldn't
 

233
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,910
below. We bounced off it. We couldn't
close below. We bounced off it. We

234
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
close below. We bounced off it. We
 

235
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,070
close below. We bounced off it. We
bounced off it. We bounced off it. If

236
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
bounced off it. We bounced off it. If
 

237
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,990
bounced off it. We bounced off it. If
this actually starts to let go and we

238
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
this actually starts to let go and we
 

239
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,230
this actually starts to let go and we
turn this into resistance, then I'd be

240
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
turn this into resistance, then I'd be
 

241
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,389
turn this into resistance, then I'd be
looking for this rotation down into at

242
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
looking for this rotation down into at
 

243
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,030
looking for this rotation down into at
least take out 500 and maybe down into

244
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
least take out 500 and maybe down into
 

245
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,350
least take out 500 and maybe down into
this 470. And we've got these double

246
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
this 470. And we've got these double
 

247
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,230
this 470. And we've got these double
wicks down here into 400. So that's what

248
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
wicks down here into 400. So that's what
 

249
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,910
wicks down here into 400. So that's what
I'm looking for. All right, it's very

250
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920
I'm looking for. All right, it's very
 

251
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,550
I'm looking for. All right, it's very
clear. Very, very clear. Either we break

252
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
clear. Very, very clear. Either we break
 

253
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,430
clear. Very, very clear. Either we break
down, stay heavy rotation, or we come

254
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
down, stay heavy rotation, or we come
 

255
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,509
down, stay heavy rotation, or we come
in, find a wick just like we have sort

256
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
in, find a wick just like we have sort
 

257
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,829
in, find a wick just like we have sort
of here. All right, reclaim and come up

258
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839
of here. All right, reclaim and come up
 

259
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,509
of here. All right, reclaim and come up
here. It might have to go deeper like it

260
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
here. It might have to go deeper like it
 

261
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,670
here. It might have to go deeper like it
did here. But we will see. At these top

262
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
did here. But we will see. At these top
 

263
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,350
did here. But we will see. At these top
ranges, I don't want to be bullish. All

264
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
ranges, I don't want to be bullish. All
 

265
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,430
ranges, I don't want to be bullish. All
right. So, we want to be bullish if we

266
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
right. So, we want to be bullish if we
 

267
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,750
right. So, we want to be bullish if we
do a fake out and a reclaim up to here.

268
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,760
do a fake out and a reclaim up to here.
 

269
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,269
do a fake out and a reclaim up to here.
And we want to be taking profit off the

270
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
And we want to be taking profit off the
 

271
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,550
And we want to be taking profit off the
table up here. And then if we get a

272
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560
table up here. And then if we get a
 

273
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,030
table up here. And then if we get a
runner, great. Alternatively, if we

274
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,040
runner, great. Alternatively, if we
 

275
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,710
runner, great. Alternatively, if we
break down, stay heavy. I want to get

276
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
break down, stay heavy. I want to get
 

277
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,949
break down, stay heavy. I want to get
short side here for that snap rotation

278
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
short side here for that snap rotation
 

279
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,630
short side here for that snap rotation
down. Hold a runner just in case it lets

280
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640
down. Hold a runner just in case it lets
 

281
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,389
down. Hold a runner just in case it lets
go. That's the plan today, folks. And in

282
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399
go. That's the plan today, folks. And in
 

283
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,470
go. That's the plan today, folks. And in
here, if you are a rotational trader, if

284
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480
here, if you are a rotational trader, if
 

285
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,310
here, if you are a rotational trader, if
you love this stuff, which I hate, you

286
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
you love this stuff, which I hate, you
 

287
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,470
you love this stuff, which I hate, you
can potentially trade here, right? Edge

288
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
can potentially trade here, right? Edge
 

289
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,070
can potentially trade here, right? Edge
to edge, edge to edge. But we can see

290
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
to edge, edge to edge. But we can see
 

291
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,230
to edge, edge to edge. But we can see
we've set a lower high here on the

292
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
we've set a lower high here on the
 

293
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,070
we've set a lower high here on the
hourlys. What we haven't done yet is

294
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
hourlys. What we haven't done yet is
 

295
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,750
hourlys. What we haven't done yet is
confirm it with a lower low. All right.

296
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
confirm it with a lower low. All right.
 

297
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,430
confirm it with a lower low. All right.
So, if we think about what we've done

298
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
So, if we think about what we've done
 

299
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,070
So, if we think about what we've done
ever since this pivot,

300
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:06,080
ever since this pivot,
 

301
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,430
ever since this pivot,
I'm not going to go too far back, but

302
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
I'm not going to go too far back, but
 

303
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,630
I'm not going to go too far back, but
we're going to higher low, higher, low,

304
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
we're going to higher low, higher, low,
 

305
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,910
we're going to higher low, higher, low,
higher, low, higher, low, internal

306
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
higher, low, higher, low, internal
 

307
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,190
higher, low, higher, low, internal
range, internal range, higher low,

308
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,200
range, internal range, higher low,
 

309
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,269
range, internal range, higher low,
higher low, higher low, lower high. All

310
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
higher low, higher low, lower high. All
 

311
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,670
higher low, higher low, lower high. All
right, this is potentially rolling over

312
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680
right, this is potentially rolling over
 

313
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,389
right, this is potentially rolling over
the backside. Thank you. But it's a tiny

314
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
the backside. Thank you. But it's a tiny
 

315
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,150
the backside. Thank you. But it's a tiny
bit too early yet to say, but

316
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
bit too early yet to say, but
 

317
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,949
bit too early yet to say, but
potentially this lower high here can set

318
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:22,959
potentially this lower high here can set
 

319
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,870
potentially this lower high here can set
in for that roll over. So, that's what

320
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:24,880
in for that roll over. So, that's what
 

321
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,310
in for that roll over. So, that's what
I'm looking at. All right, that's what

322
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320
I'm looking at. All right, that's what
 

323
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,750
I'm looking at. All right, that's what
I'm looking at. You can see overnight if

324
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:27,760
I'm looking at. You can see overnight if
 

325
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,949
I'm looking at. You can see overnight if
we look above Asia went sideways uh

326
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
we look above Asia went sideways uh
 

327
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,269
we look above Asia went sideways uh
London liquidated Asia rejected top of

328
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
London liquidated Asia rejected top of
 

329
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,389
London liquidated Asia rejected top of
Asia and then we've moved lower. So

330
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
Asia and then we've moved lower. So
 

331
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,150
Asia and then we've moved lower. So
not actually that nice when we see that

332
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
not actually that nice when we see that
 

333
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,590
not actually that nice when we see that
because we might want to run back up the

334
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
because we might want to run back up the
 

335
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,150
because we might want to run back up the
stops but we will see. Let's move

336
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
stops but we will see. Let's move
 

337
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,750
stops but we will see. Let's move
up. I've got to get through these pretty

338
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:45,760
up. I've got to get through these pretty
 

339
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,750
up. I've got to get through these pretty
quickly now. Um we have slight

340
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
quickly now. Um we have slight
 

341
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,030
quickly now. Um we have slight
divergence here to the ES right which

342
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
divergence here to the ES right which
 

343
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,590
divergence here to the ES right which
has relative strength. Um, so if you

344
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
has relative strength. Um, so if you
 

345
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,990
has relative strength. Um, so if you
didn't see some of the news coming out

346
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000
didn't see some of the news coming out
 

347
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,990
didn't see some of the news coming out
last night was that we are going to be

348
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
last night was that we are going to be
 

349
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,030
last night was that we are going to be
allowed to ship uh chips to Nvidia chips

350
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
allowed to ship uh chips to Nvidia chips
 

351
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,069
allowed to ship uh chips to Nvidia chips
to uh China at a 25%

352
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
to uh China at a 25%
 

353
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,550
to uh China at a 25%
tariff price. Um, so that got the market

354
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:06,560
tariff price. Um, so that got the market
 

355
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,750
tariff price. Um, so that got the market
moving yesterday and then this morning

356
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
moving yesterday and then this morning
 

357
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,350
moving yesterday and then this morning
they announced I think there was some

358
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
they announced I think there was some
 

359
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,069
they announced I think there was some
tariff to Mexico an extra 5%. There is

360
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
tariff to Mexico an extra 5%. There is
 

361
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,269
tariff to Mexico an extra 5%. There is
actually a lower high here. I could

362
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
actually a lower high here. I could
 

363
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,790
actually a lower high here. I could
convince myself that wasn't the case.

364
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
convince myself that wasn't the case.
 

365
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,630
convince myself that wasn't the case.
Let me have a look at spy.

366
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
Let me have a look at spy.
 

367
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,069
Let me have a look at spy.
All right, SPY is still the gamma

368
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:20,079
All right, SPY is still the gamma
 

369
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,829
All right, SPY is still the gamma
levels. All right, we're going to make

370
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
levels. All right, we're going to make
 

371
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,030
levels. All right, we're going to make
this really easy. 88 85 82 80. Those are

372
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
this really easy. 88 85 82 80. Those are
 

373
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,590
this really easy. 88 85 82 80. Those are
your gamma levels. So here's your 85. We

374
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600
your gamma levels. So here's your 85. We
 

375
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,550
your gamma levels. So here's your 85. We
lost it. All right, so once we lost

376
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,560
lost it. All right, so once we lost
 

377
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,790
lost it. All right, so once we lost
failed 88,

378
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
failed 88,
 

379
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,069
failed 88,
failed 88,

380
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
failed 88,
 

381
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,990
failed 88,
lost 85, traded down to 82, traded back

382
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
lost 85, traded down to 82, traded back
 

383
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,310
lost 85, traded down to 82, traded back
towards 85. There's your range. 85 to

384
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
towards 85. There's your range. 85 to
 

385
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,230
towards 85. There's your range. 85 to
82. If you get weakness under 82, we're

386
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
82. If you get weakness under 82, we're
 

387
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,829
82. If you get weakness under 82, we're
going to come to 80. That's the last

388
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
going to come to 80. That's the last
 

389
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,829
going to come to 80. That's the last
line in the sand. If they lose 80, well,

390
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
line in the sand. If they lose 80, well,
 

391
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,230
line in the sand. If they lose 80, well,
good night. as we would say in England,

392
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
good night. as we would say in England,
 

393
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,670
good night. as we would say in England,
good night, sweetheart. And we're coming

394
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
good night, sweetheart. And we're coming
 

395
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,190
good night, sweetheart. And we're coming
way, way, way down. Right. So, a similar

396
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
way, way, way down. Right. So, a similar
 

397
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,509
way, way, way down. Right. So, a similar
kind of setup in spy. Um, but slightly

398
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:57,519
kind of setup in spy. Um, but slightly
 

399
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,350
kind of setup in spy. Um, but slightly
more strength we've had there. Let's

400
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
more strength we've had there. Let's
 

401
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,790
more strength we've had there. Let's
just have a quick look at the mag then

402
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
just have a quick look at the mag then
 

403
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,630
just have a quick look at the mag then
the VIX,

404
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:04,640
the VIX,
 

405
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,590
the VIX,
gapping up on the VIX.

406
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
gapping up on the VIX.
 

407
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,670
gapping up on the VIX.
Nice drive out. So, uh, that thing got

408
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680
Nice drive out. So, uh, that thing got
 

409
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,030
Nice drive out. So, uh, that thing got
buried for too long. We're just coming

410
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
buried for too long. We're just coming
 

411
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,550
buried for too long. We're just coming
to the top side of the range, though, as

412
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
to the top side of the range, though, as
 

413
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,389
to the top side of the range, though, as
you can see. Here's your range. Want to

414
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
you can see. Here's your range. Want to
 

415
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,829
you can see. Here's your range. Want to
be aware of this. Caught a bid down

416
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
be aware of this. Caught a bid down
 

417
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,670
be aware of this. Caught a bid down
here. Failed to break down. Reclaimed

418
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
here. Failed to break down. Reclaimed
 

419
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,949
here. Failed to break down. Reclaimed
top side of the range. I want to be

420
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
top side of the range. I want to be
 

421
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,550
top side of the range. I want to be
careful if they get stuck here. So, this

422
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
careful if they get stuck here. So, this
 

423
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,990
careful if they get stuck here. So, this
would be red, obviously.

424
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
would be red, obviously.
 

425
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,710
would be red, obviously.
Okay, moving into the mag. Let's have a

426
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
Okay, moving into the mag. Let's have a
 

427
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,629
Okay, moving into the mag. Let's have a
look. Looks a bit backsidy for Apple,

428
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:28,639
look. Looks a bit backsidy for Apple,
 

429
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,030
look. Looks a bit backsidy for Apple,
but again, into an area of interest into

430
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
but again, into an area of interest into
 

431
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,230
but again, into an area of interest into
here. Failed to hold back to this level

432
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
here. Failed to hold back to this level
 

433
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,069
here. Failed to hold back to this level
where we've traded at for quite a long

434
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
where we've traded at for quite a long
 

435
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,269
where we've traded at for quite a long
time. If we zoom out, right, this is the

436
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
time. If we zoom out, right, this is the
 

437
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,230
time. If we zoom out, right, this is the
old base highs. Highs, right? If it

438
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
old base highs. Highs, right? If it
 

439
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,750
old base highs. Highs, right? If it
can't hold this, we're going to go back

440
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:43,760
can't hold this, we're going to go back
 

441
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,750
can't hold this, we're going to go back
into this range and the dance would be

442
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
into this range and the dance would be
 

443
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,750
into this range and the dance would be
back down to here. If we hold this, it's

444
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
back down to here. If we hold this, it's
 

445
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,790
back down to here. If we hold this, it's
got a chance of making another base to

446
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:50,800
got a chance of making another base to
 

447
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,949
got a chance of making another base to
go again. So, we will see in time. But,

448
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
go again. So, we will see in time. But,
 

449
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,470
go again. So, we will see in time. But,
uh,

450
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
uh,
 

451
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,990
uh,
not looking too good. But, we're opening

452
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
not looking too good. But, we're opening
 

453
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,310
not looking too good. But, we're opening
up flat on it. It's the most important

454
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
up flat on it. It's the most important
 

455
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,230
up flat on it. It's the most important
thing. Opening up flat. So, no edge on

456
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
thing. Opening up flat. So, no edge on
 

457
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,470
thing. Opening up flat. So, no edge on
Apple. Uh, that looks like a gap down.

458
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480
Apple. Uh, that looks like a gap down.
 

459
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,990
Apple. Uh, that looks like a gap down.
Yes. No, actually opening up flat on

460
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
Yes. No, actually opening up flat on
 

461
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,030
Yes. No, actually opening up flat on
Amazon as well. Google, that also looks

462
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,040
Amazon as well. Google, that also looks
 

463
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,190
Amazon as well. Google, that also looks
flat. Slight gap down. Meta, that is an

464
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
flat. Slight gap down. Meta, that is an
 

465
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,949
flat. Slight gap down. Meta, that is an
ugly looking chart right now.

466
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:16,959
ugly looking chart right now.
 

467
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,310
ugly looking chart right now.
Microsoft slight gap down. [sighs]

468
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
Microsoft slight gap down. [sighs]
 

469
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,590
Microsoft slight gap down. [sighs]
That's actually looking a bit more

470
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
That's actually looking a bit more
 

471
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,269
That's actually looking a bit more
bullish if it can break out. So that's

472
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
bullish if it can break out. So that's
 

473
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,990
bullish if it can break out. So that's
the first one I'd look at. It can set

474
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
the first one I'd look at. It can set
 

475
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,910
the first one I'd look at. It can set
some price alerts. I'd say up here

476
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
some price alerts. I'd say up here
 

477
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,030
some price alerts. I'd say up here
really 95 96.

478
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040

 

479
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,590

Nvidia. All right. That caught a bid

480
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
Nvidia. All right. That caught a bid
 

481
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,150
Nvidia. All right. That caught a bid
yesterday in after hours like we talked

482
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
yesterday in after hours like we talked
 

483
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,069
yesterday in after hours like we talked
about off that news off the chip news.

484
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079
about off that news off the chip news.
 

485
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,829
about off that news off the chip news.
There's the bid. It's already closed the

486
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
There's the bid. It's already closed the
 

487
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,350
There's the bid. It's already closed the
gap.

488
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:43,360
gap.
 

489
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,030
gap.
So, they didn't like it that much. They

490
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,040
So, they didn't like it that much. They
 

491
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,550
So, they didn't like it that much. They
liked it enough for a push and then that

492
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
liked it enough for a push and then that
 

493
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,190
liked it enough for a push and then that
was it. Tesla,

494
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:49,200
was it. Tesla,
 

495
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,870
was it. Tesla,
that's not looking too good, is it? All

496
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
that's not looking too good, is it? All
 

497
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,949
that's not looking too good, is it? All
right. A little bit like Apple leaving a

498
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
right. A little bit like Apple leaving a
 

499
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,269
right. A little bit like Apple leaving a
high, rolling over back into its old

500
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
high, rolling over back into its old
 

501
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,509
high, rolling over back into its old
base. Have to see how Tesla acts. Does

502
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:57,519
base. Have to see how Tesla acts. Does
 

503
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,870
base. Have to see how Tesla acts. Does
it find a bid here or is it going to

504
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:58,880
it find a bid here or is it going to
 

505
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,550
it find a bid here or is it going to
come into here and go sideways for a bit

506
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:00,560
come into here and go sideways for a bit
 

507
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,189
come into here and go sideways for a bit
and then offer one of these trades?

508
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
and then offer one of these trades?
 

509
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,230
and then offer one of these trades?
That's it folks. Um, remember market is

510
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,240
That's it folks. Um, remember market is
 

511
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,750
That's it folks. Um, remember market is
probably waiting for FOMC. And we also

512
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
probably waiting for FOMC. And we also
 

513
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,550
probably waiting for FOMC. And we also

Oracle.

516
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
Oracle.
 

517
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,470
Oracle.
So got one eye on this. It's trying to

518
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
So got one eye on this. It's trying to
 

519
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,389
So got one eye on this. It's trying to
find a bid. Remember Oracle last

520
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
find a bid. Remember Oracle last
 

521
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,269
find a bid. Remember Oracle last
earnings were blowout earnings

522
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279
earnings were blowout earnings
 

523
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,990
earnings were blowout earnings
which got us all the way up here.

524
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,000
which got us all the way up here.
 

525
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,430
which got us all the way up here.
Right. We're starting to come back to

526
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
Right. We're starting to come back to
 

527
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,839
Right. We're starting to come back to
reality more recently

528
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:29,849
reality more recently
 

529
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:32,230
reality more recently
[clears throat] of this base after this

530
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240
[clears throat] of this base after this
 

531
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,509
[clears throat] of this base after this
April low. But uh if we sell this and

532
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
April low. But uh if we sell this and
 

533
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,430
April low. But uh if we sell this and
set a lower high, you know what's going

534
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
set a lower high, you know what's going
 

535
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,110
set a lower high, you know what's going
to happen. That's a daily shift at that

536
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,120
to happen. That's a daily shift at that
 

537
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,629
to happen. That's a daily shift at that
point. It's already shifted to be

538
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:40,639
point. It's already shifted to be
 

539
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,230
point. It's already shifted to be
honest. It just if they can't reclaim

540
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
honest. It just if they can't reclaim
 

541
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,030
honest. It just if they can't reclaim
that on earnings, it's night night. And

542
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,040
that on earnings, it's night night. And
 

543
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,629
that on earnings, it's night night. And
uh the other one to look out for this

544
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
uh the other one to look out for this
 

545
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,750
uh the other one to look out for this
week, I think it's Thursday

00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
week, I think it's Thursday

is Broadcom, AVGO, this thing on a tear

548
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:53,360
is Broadcom, AVGO, this thing on a tear
 

549
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,430
is Broadcom, AVGO, this thing on a tear
again,

550
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
again,
 

551
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,910
again,
right? Alltime highs. You can see just

552
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:57,920
right? Alltime highs. You can see just
 

553
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,310
right? Alltime highs. You can see just
since these pivots, just massive,

554
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,320
since these pivots, just massive,
 

555
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,949
since these pivots, just massive,
massive runs. I mean, that is insane.

556
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
massive runs. I mean, that is insane.
 

557
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,389
massive runs. I mean, that is insane.
Absolute insanity. Um, but yeah,

558
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:06,399
Absolute insanity. Um, but yeah,
 

559
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,870
Absolute insanity. Um, but yeah,
earnings coming. I think it's Thursday.

560
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
earnings coming. I think it's Thursday.
 

561
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,990
earnings coming. I think it's Thursday.
Look at that. 190% gain this year. Wild.

562
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,000
Look at that. 190% gain this year. Wild.
 

563
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,509
Look at that. 190% gain this year. Wild.
So, that's us. That's what we're looking

564
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519
So, that's us. That's what we're looking
 

565
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,949
So, that's us. That's what we're looking
for. Gets you set

566
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959

 

567
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,629

in range till we prove otherwise,

568
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:22,639
in range till we prove otherwise,
 

569
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,870
in range till we prove otherwise,
basically. And, uh, we'll wait to see if

570
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:24,880
basically. And, uh, we'll wait to see if
 

571
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,990
basically. And, uh, we'll wait to see if
the edges become fadable or if we get a

572
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,000
the edges become fadable or if we get a
 

573
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,189
the edges become fadable or if we get a
trend.

574
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,199

 

575
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:39,750

Can have a quick look.

576
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:39,760

 

577
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:46,069

this in a bit.

578
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079

 

579
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,269

Any outliers?

580
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
Any outliers?
 

581
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,790
Any outliers?
605

582
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:50,800
605
 

583
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,350
605
608

584
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360
608
 

585
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,509
608
612. There's lots of buying gone on

586
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
612. There's lots of buying gone on
 

587
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,870
612. There's lots of buying gone on
around here. 618 620.

588
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
around here. 618 620.
 

589
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,749
around here. 618 620.
Okay.

590
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:05,759

 

591
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,509

about two minutes away from the open.

592
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:07,519
about two minutes away from the open.
 

593
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,670
about two minutes away from the open.
We're just trading around that big core

594
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:09,680
We're just trading around that big core
 

595
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,110
We're just trading around that big core
level that we talked about that previous

596
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,120
level that we talked about that previous
 

597
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,189
level that we talked about that previous
week point of control, previous day

598
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
week point of control, previous day
 

599
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,990
week point of control, previous day
value low, previous day low. So don't

600
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,000
value low, previous day low. So don't
 

601
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,910
value low, previous day low. So don't
really want to short the low of this

602
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
really want to short the low of this
 

603
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,670
really want to short the low of this
range because we bid off this quite a

604
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
range because we bid off this quite a
 

605
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,389
range because we bid off this quite a
few times. So ideally this morning

606
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
few times. So ideally this morning
 

607
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,269
few times. So ideally this morning
offers a pop which is shortable or

608
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
offers a pop which is shortable or
 

609
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,310
offers a pop which is shortable or
drifts underneath and then collapses. Um

610
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,320
drifts underneath and then collapses. Um
 

611
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,670
drifts underneath and then collapses. Um
if we go underneath obviously and

612
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
if we go underneath obviously and
 

613
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,749
if we go underneath obviously and
reclaim um we're long for the trade back

614
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:31,759
reclaim um we're long for the trade back
 

615
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,910
reclaim um we're long for the trade back
upside.

616
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920

 

617
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,189

Sipping my coffee here. I won't get

618
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199

Pre-market, we haven't been able to

Pre-market, we haven't been able to
 

713
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,549

break down under these se 600. So, it's

having an attempt now. Let's see if

there's some follow through or not.

Doesn't feel like it really knows what
it wants to do. Here comes the breakdown

Oh, that's a shame.

730
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
Oh, that's a shame.
 

731
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,029
Oh, that's a shame.
Why is it not filled all of me on my

00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:27,039
Why is it not filled all of me on my
 

733
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,789
Why is it not filled all of me on my

So, letting go of 600. I'm short here

736
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,200
So, letting go of 600. I'm short here
 

737
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,870
So, letting go of 600. I'm short here
for that breakdown of 600 at that

for that breakdown of 600 at that

covering some here into previous day
 

743
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,549
covering some here into previous day
low. Now we need to wait to see if we

744
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
low. Now we need to wait to see if we
 

745
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,070
low. Now we need to wait to see if we
get acceptance below this because we can

746
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,080
get acceptance below this because we can
 

747
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,830
get acceptance below this because we can
get a trap here folks. So just being

748
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
get a trap here folks. So just being
 

749
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,750
get a trap here folks. So just being
very very cautious here. Still very

very very cautious here. Still very
 

751

very very cautious here. Still very
early in the day. But that first move we

752
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,520
early in the day. But that first move we
 

753
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,950
early in the day. But that first move we
trapped delta at the highs like I talked

754
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:46,960
trapped delta at the highs like I talked
 

755
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,630
trapped delta at the highs like I talked
about. First time we're getting a

00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:48,640
about. First time we're getting a
 

757
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,150
about. First time we're getting a
breakdown of 600s. Don't want to short

758
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
breakdown of 600s. Don't want to short
 

759

breakdown of 600s. Don't want to short
these lows cuz everyone else is trying

to short these lows and getting caught
 

763
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,270
to short these lows and getting caught
right now. All right. Can tell you sell

764
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,280
right now. All right. Can tell you sell

side is currently stuck under 73s. They

keep trying to force their way in at
 

769
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,029
keep trying to force their way in at
these lows. So a retest of 600. How we

770
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:01,039
these lows. So a retest of 600. How we
 

771
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,390
these lows. So a retest of 600. How we
at there would be key. If they reclaim

772
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:02,400
at there would be key. If they reclaim
 

773
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,590
at there would be key. If they reclaim
it be a failed breakdown. We'll go

774
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:03,600
it be a failed breakdown. We'll go
 

775
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,203
it be a failed breakdown. We'll go
straight back upside.

776
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:05,213
straight back upside.
 

777

of this morning session if they're going
 

937
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,070
of this morning session if they're going

938
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,080
to look for a rotation to that New York
 

939
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,230
to look for a rotation to that New York
open. So far, I'd say sellers are in

940
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,240
open. So far, I'd say sellers are in
 

941
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,430
open. So far, I'd say sellers are in
control, but we've tightened up in

942
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,440
control, but we've tightened up in
 

943
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,669
control, but we've tightened up in
range.

944
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:27,679
range.
 

945
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,470
range.
Tightened up in range. VIX also failing

946
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:30,480
Tightened up in range. VIX also failing
 

947
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,390
Tightened up in range. VIX also failing
that break. So, came into that top side

948
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:32,400
that break. So, came into that top side
 

949
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,710
that break. So, came into that top side
of supply, looked above, and failed. Be

950
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:34,720
of supply, looked above, and failed. Be
 

951
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:43,750

aware of that. Be aware of that.

952

953
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,990

There's the 600.

954
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,000
There's the 600.
 

955
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,669
There's the 600.
So, their next target will be New York

956
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:47,679
So, their next target will be New York
 

957
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,870
So, their next target will be New York
open if they're going to hold this

958
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:48,880
open if they're going to hold this
 

959
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,470
open if they're going to hold this
range. So, if this is a look below and

960
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:50,480
range. So, if this is a look below and
 

961
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,750
range. So, if this is a look below and
fail, remember we talked about this

962
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
fail, remember we talked about this
 

963
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,430
fail, remember we talked about this
pre-market. We don't want to get short

00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,440
pre-market. We don't want to get short
 

965
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,750
pre-market. We don't want to get short
down here. And the short is on a pop and

966
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:55,760

969
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,190
fail.
Pop and fail 600 break rotation. You

970
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200
Pop and fail 600 break rotation. You
 

971
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,590
Pop and fail 600 break rotation. You
don't want to get short here because if

972
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:03,600
don't want to get short here because if
 

973
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,990

That's what they've done every time so
 

979

currently we're just in
the edge of a range until we prove

00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:16,559
the edge of a range until we prove
 

985
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,029
the edge of a range until we prove
otherwise. Let's get this anchor on.

here. So, trading back inside. I'd just

1010
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,320
here. So, trading back inside. I'd just
 

1011
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,990
here. So, trading back inside. I'd just
be very careful in this range. Can go

1012
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
be very careful in this range. Can go
 

1013
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,717
be very careful in this range. Can go
both ways very, very quickly.

1014
00:24:54,717 --> 00:24:54,727
both ways very, very quickly.
 

1015

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,750
All right, we went over this pre-market
like why I don't want to get short in

1064
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:47,760
like why I don't want to get short in
 

1065
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,350
like why I don't want to get short in
the hole. There's a snap short down to

1066
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,360
the hole. There's a snap short down to
 

1067
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,950
the hole. There's a snap short down to
there, but I'm not sizing in unless we

1068
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:50,960
there, but I'm not sizing in unless we
 

1069
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,390
there, but I'm not sizing in unless we
break down and stay heavy. We haven't

1070
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
break down and stay heavy. We haven't
 

1071
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,909
break down and stay heavy. We haven't
broken down, stay heavy, and you're

1072
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:53,919
broken down, stay heavy, and you're
 

1073
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,830
broken down, stay heavy, and you're
starting to see the squeeze back upside

1074
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:55,840
starting to see the squeeze back upside
 

1075
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,149
starting to see the squeeze back upside
now. So, probably going to come up here

1076
00:25:58,149 --> 00:25:58,159
now. So, probably going to come up here
 

1077
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,310
now. So, probably going to come up here
to test sort of 640 650, which is

1078
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,320
to test sort of 640 650, which is
 

1079
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,470
to test sort of 640 650, which is
previous day's point of control, and

1080
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:02,480
previous day's point of control, and
 

1081
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,870
previous day's point of control, and
your uh 24hour VWAP. If they get through

1082
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:04,880
your uh 24hour VWAP. If they get through
 

1083
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,510
your uh 24hour VWAP. If they get through
there, then all we're looking at is a

1084
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:07,520
there, then all we're looking at is a
 

1085
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,669
there, then all we're looking at is a
failed look below yesterday's balance

1086
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:09,679
failed look below yesterday's balance
 

1087
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,230
failed look below yesterday's balance
low. There's yesterday's balance high.

1088
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,240
low. There's yesterday's balance high.
 

1089
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,149
low. There's yesterday's balance high.
So here will be important if they

1090
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:14,159
So here will be important if they
 

1091
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,909
So here will be important if they
squeeze through here back up to the top

1092
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:15,919
squeeze through here back up to the top
 

1093
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,390
squeeze through here back up to the top
side of that. If they fail here, they

1094
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:18,400
side of that. If they fail here, they
 

1095
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,750
side of that. If they fail here, they
have a reattempt to this previous day

1096
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:19,760
have a reattempt to this previous day
 

1097
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,269
have a reattempt to this previous day
value area low. If we build out enough

1098
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:21,279
value area low. If we build out enough
 

1099
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,029
value area low. If we build out enough
liquidity there and break down under, we

1100
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,039
liquidity there and break down under, we
 

1101
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,350
liquidity there and break down under, we
can use that to move lower back into

1102
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,360
can use that to move lower back into
 

1103
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,070
can use that to move lower back into
here. But the moment flat on this and

1104
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,080
here. But the moment flat on this and
 

1105
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,630
here. But the moment flat on this and
just waiting.

1106
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:30,640
just waiting.
 

1107
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,870
just waiting.
Let them mess around with it before FC.

1108
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:32,880
Let them mess around with it before FC.
 

1109
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,630
Let them mess around with it before FC.
I do not want to get caught at the low

1110
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:34,640
I do not want to get caught at the low
 

1111
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,553
I do not want to get caught at the low
side of a balance range.

1112
00:26:37,553 --> 00:26:37,563
side of a balance range.
 

1113
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:39,518
side of a balance range.

00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,120
asking. Yeah, as some of you know, I've
 

1121
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,230
asking. Yeah, as some of you know, I've
got um a lot going on outside of trading

got um a lot going on outside of trading
 

1123
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,510
got um a lot going on outside of trading
right now. So, I'm just trying to keep a

right now. So, I'm just trying to keep a
 

1125
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,830
right now. So, I'm just trying to keep a
a steady head, let's say. Not always

1126
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:57,840
a steady head, let's say. Not always
 

1127
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,110
a steady head, let's say. Not always
easy when you've got uh

1128
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,120
easy when you've got uh
 

1129
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,549
easy when you've got uh
family stuff going on outside of

family stuff going on outside of
 

1131
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,149
family stuff going on outside of
trading. The last thing I want to do is

1132
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:04,159
trading. The last thing I want to do is
 

1133
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,789
trading. The last thing I want to do is
sit here when I'm feeling emotional or

1134
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:06,799
sit here when I'm feeling emotional or
 

1135
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,669
sit here when I'm feeling emotional or
I'm being delivered uh tough news and

1136
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:09,679
I'm being delivered uh tough news and
 

1137
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,269
I'm being delivered uh tough news and
stuff like that. So, that's why I wasn't

1138
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:11,279
stuff like that. So, that's why I wasn't
 

1139
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,870
stuff like that. So, that's why I wasn't
here yesterday. Had to deal with some

1140
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:12,880
here yesterday. Had to deal with some
 

1141
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,190
here yesterday. Had to deal with some
stuff. I won't go into it. Don't really

1142
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,200
stuff. I won't go into it. Don't really
 

1143
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,990
stuff. I won't go into it. Don't really
want to uh share all that stuff, but

1144
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,000
want to uh share all that stuff, but
 

1145
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,830
want to uh share all that stuff, but
yes, it's uh it's why I wasn't here

1146
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:19,840
yes, it's uh it's why I wasn't here
 

1147
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,950
yes, it's uh it's why I wasn't here
yesterday. I had some stuff I had to

1148
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:20,960
yesterday. I had some stuff I had to
 

1149
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,470
yesterday. I had some stuff I had to
deal with. All right, there's the drive

1150
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:22,480
deal with. All right, there's the drive
 

1151
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,470
deal with. All right, there's the drive
into the VWAP and the previous day point

1152
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:24,480
into the VWAP and the previous day point
 

1153
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,990
into the VWAP and the previous day point
of control, the 50s like we talked

1154
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,000
of control, the 50s like we talked
 

1155
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,310
of control, the 50s like we talked
about.

1156
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:28,320
about.
 

1157
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,630
about.
And how we act is going to be important.

1158
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:30,640
And how we act is going to be important.
 

1159
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,630
And how we act is going to be important.
If we start breaking above here, they

1160
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:32,640
If we start breaking above here, they
 

1161
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,710
If we start breaking above here, they
might look for that rotation up to 700s.

1162
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:34,720
might look for that rotation up to 700s.
 

1163
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,310
might look for that rotation up to 700s.
I think they might struggle to get above

1164
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:36,320
I think they might struggle to get above
 

1165
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,149
I think they might struggle to get above
700s today unless they really turn it

1166
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:38,159
700s today unless they really turn it
 

1167
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,990
700s today unless they really turn it
on. So that would be the probably the

1168
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,000
on. So that would be the probably the
 

1169
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,269
on. So that would be the probably the
top side for uh bulls if you're bullish

1170
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:43,279
top side for uh bulls if you're bullish
 

1171
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,110
top side for uh bulls if you're bullish
will be up here. But I'd be if you took

1172
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,120
will be up here. But I'd be if you took
 

1173
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,029
will be up here. But I'd be if you took
that rotation, that failed breakdown,

1174
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,039
that rotation, that failed breakdown,
 

1175
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,549
that rotation, that failed breakdown,
I'd be taking some profit here and

1176
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:48,559
I'd be taking some profit here and
 

1177
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,149
I'd be taking some profit here and
holding some for another 50 points in

1178
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:50,159
holding some for another 50 points in
 

1179
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,149
holding some for another 50 points in
case you go, but not expecting it

1180
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:52,159
case you go, but not expecting it
 

1181
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,669
case you go, but not expecting it
because we're just in range. I wouldn't

1182
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:53,679
because we're just in range. I wouldn't
 

1183
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:04,470
because we're just in range. I wouldn't
expect anything. [snorts]

1187
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,110

So on a 5m minute strong delta flip at

1188
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,120
So on a 5m minute strong delta flip at
 

1189
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,870
So on a 5m minute strong delta flip at
those lows. Positive delta coming into

1190
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:12,880
those lows. Positive delta coming into
 

1191
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,230
those lows. Positive delta coming into
the market which means we're seeing more

1192

the market which means we're seeing more
 

1193
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,769

aggressive buying.

TP on long. Your TP on long should be

this 700 mate. So if if you get if you
took the long if you took the fail

1206
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:28,559
took the long if you took the fail
 

1207
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,389
took the long if you took the fail
breakdown under here or the reclaim of

1215
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,470

down. We don't know what they're going

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,430
40 point dance at the moment.
Yeah, thanks Gigi. Thank thank goodness

1398
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:47,440
Yeah, thanks Gigi. Thank thank goodness
 

1399
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,350
Yeah, thanks Gigi. Thank thank goodness
you made me uh read it again because I

1400
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:49,360
you made me uh read it again because I
 

1401
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,549
you made me uh read it again because I
was thinking that's really weird. How's

1402
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:50,559
was thinking that's really weird. How's
 

1403
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,710
was thinking that's really weird. How's
he changed his tone? You're not going to

1404
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:52,720
he changed his tone? You're not going to
 

1405
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,269
he changed his tone? You're not going to
be put in his uh

1406
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:55,279
be put in his uh
 

1407
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,389
be put in his uh
head of Fed

1408
00:32:58,389 --> 00:32:58,399
head of Fed
 

1409
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,630
head of Fed
if you do that. So yeah, you you were

1410
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:00,640
if you do that. So yeah, you you were
 

1411
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,389
if you do that. So yeah, you you were
right. Okay, now they come do they come

1412
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:02,399
right. Okay, now they come do they come
 

1413
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,470
right. Okay, now they come do they come
up to these uh imbalances up here? This

1414
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:04,480
up to these uh imbalances up here? This
 

1415
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,990
up to these uh imbalances up here? This
market doesn't know what it wants to do

1416
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:06,000
market doesn't know what it wants to do
 

1417
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,669
market doesn't know what it wants to do
obviously.

1418
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:07,679
obviously.
 

1419
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,029
obviously.
Of course it doesn't. It's the day

1420
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:09,039
Of course it doesn't. It's the day
 

1421
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,710
Of course it doesn't. It's the day
before FMC. It's not going to know what

1422
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:10,720
before FMC. It's not going to know what
 

1423
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:28,470
before FMC. It's not going to know what
it wants.

1424
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:28,480

 

1425
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,149

I would say low hanging fruit has been

1426
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:30,159
I would say low hanging fruit has been
 

1427
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,990
I would say low hanging fruit has been
taken for the day downside underneath

1428
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,000
taken for the day downside underneath
 

1429
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,430
taken for the day downside underneath
that previous day low. That is one thing

1430
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:33,440
that previous day low. That is one thing
 

1431
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,669
that previous day low. That is one thing
to be aware of. I've got a feeling we

1432
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:35,679
to be aware of. I've got a feeling we
 

1433
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,149
to be aware of. I've got a feeling we
might want to edge lower today, but I

1434
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:38,159
might want to edge lower today, but I
 

1435
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,669
might want to edge lower today, but I
wouldn't be banking on it. I wouldn't be

1436
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:39,679
wouldn't be banking on it. I wouldn't be
 

1437
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,509
wouldn't be banking on it. I wouldn't be
like confirming that. Nothing in the

1438
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:41,519
like confirming that. Nothing in the
 

1439
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,909
like confirming that. Nothing in the
chart is telling me that right now. I

1440
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:43,919
chart is telling me that right now. I
 

1441
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,350
chart is telling me that right now. I
just wondered, did they wash them out

1442
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:45,360
just wondered, did they wash them out
 

1443
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,590
just wondered, did they wash them out
today? Use everyone's stops to go lower

1444
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:47,600
today? Use everyone's stops to go lower
 

1445
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,590
today? Use everyone's stops to go lower
to bid it back up tomorrow

1446
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:53,600

 

1447
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,029

or are we just going to go sideways? All

1448
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:55,039
or are we just going to go sideways? All
 

1449
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,389
or are we just going to go sideways? All
right, Vick's trying to find a bid here

1450
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:56,399
right, Vick's trying to find a bid here
 

1451
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:01,648
right, Vick's trying to find a bid here
at 17 like we talked about.

1452
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:01,658

 

1453
00:34:01,658 --> 00:34:06,389

[snorts]

1454
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:06,399

 

1455
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,310

These imbalances are still up here. 30

1456
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:08,320
These imbalances are still up here. 30
 

1457
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,349
These imbalances are still up here. 30
to 40. We left in in this sort of pocket

1458
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:11,359
to 40. We left in in this sort of pocket
 

1459
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,869
to 40. We left in in this sort of pocket
here.

1460
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:12,879
here.
 

1461
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,190
here.
We left an imbalance. Buyers are trapped

1462
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,200
We left an imbalance. Buyers are trapped
 

1463
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,270
We left an imbalance. Buyers are trapped
right now over 44. Over 44. So they all

1464
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,280
right now over 44. Over 44. So they all
 

1465
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,710
right now over 44. Over 44. So they all
came in. All of this is buy side. So

1466
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:20,720
came in. All of this is buy side. So
 

1467
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,149
came in. All of this is buy side. So
there's been a passive seller up here

1468
00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:22,159
there's been a passive seller up here
 

1469
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,310
there's been a passive seller up here
this morning and we're now starting to

1470
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:24,320
this morning and we're now starting to
 

1471
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,589
this morning and we're now starting to
fill this imbalance. Well, we're trying

1472
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:25,599
fill this imbalance. Well, we're trying
 

1473
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,950
fill this imbalance. Well, we're trying
to. It needs to get through here. So

1474
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:26,960
to. It needs to get through here. So
 

1475
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,790
to. It needs to get through here. So
there's the imbalance. 30 to 40 is the

1476
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:28,800
there's the imbalance. 30 to 40 is the
 

1477
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,230
there's the imbalance. 30 to 40 is the
imbalance into that previous day point

1478
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,240
imbalance into that previous day point
 

1479
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,230
imbalance into that previous day point
of control. Sellers need to hold that.

1480
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:32,240
of control. Sellers need to hold that.
 

1481
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,829
of control. Sellers need to hold that.
That's the edge of their range on the

1482
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:33,839
That's the edge of their range on the
 

1483
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,589
That's the edge of their range on the
current day. Just on the current day,

1484
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:35,599
current day. Just on the current day,
 

1485
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,629
current day. Just on the current day,
not previous on the current day.

1486
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:38,639
not previous on the current day.
 

1487
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,230
not previous on the current day.
Sellers will need to stay heavy there.

1488
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,240
Sellers will need to stay heavy there.
 

1489
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,790
Sellers will need to stay heavy there.
If they can't stay heavy there, then we

1490
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:42,800
If they can't stay heavy there, then we
 

1491
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,550
If they can't stay heavy there, then we
probably let those buyers out who are

1492
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:44,560
probably let those buyers out who are
 

1493
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,230
probably let those buyers out who are
stuck at 640 and we probably do that

1494
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,240
stuck at 640 and we probably do that
 

1495
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,470
stuck at 640 and we probably do that
rotation to 700. So sellers need to

1496
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:48,480
rotation to 700. So sellers need to
 

1497
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,790
rotation to 700. So sellers need to
protect this area right now. That's

1498
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:50,800
protect this area right now. That's
 

1499
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,310
protect this area right now. That's
their job at the moment is to protect

1500
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:52,320
their job at the moment is to protect
 

1501
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,389
their job at the moment is to protect
this area. Buyers want to reclaim it and

1502
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:54,399
this area. Buyers want to reclaim it and
 

1503
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,430
this area. Buyers want to reclaim it and
go for 700s. That's your battle. When I

1504
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:57,440
go for 700s. That's your battle. When I
 

1505
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,870
go for 700s. That's your battle. When I
look at the higher time frame right now,

1506
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:58,880
look at the higher time frame right now,
 

1507
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,990
look at the higher time frame right now,
the reason I'm become less interested

1508
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:02,000
the reason I'm become less interested
 

1509
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,670
the reason I'm become less interested
on the high time frame like we talked

1510
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:03,680
on the high time frame like we talked
 

1511
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,270
on the high time frame like we talked
about. We've set a lower high.

1512
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:07,280
about. We've set a lower high.
 

1513
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,550
about. We've set a lower high.
All right, think about this. If you're a

1514
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:08,560
All right, think about this. If you're a
 

1515
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,190
All right, think about this. If you're a
seller, we've set a lower high here.

1516
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,200
seller, we've set a lower high here.
 

1517
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,790
seller, we've set a lower high here.
What do sellers need for confirmation?

1518
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:12,800
What do sellers need for confirmation?
 

1519
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,990
What do sellers need for confirmation?
Break down under here. What have they

1520
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,000
Break down under here. What have they
 

1521
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,589
Break down under here. What have they
not done this morning? They have not

1522
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:15,599
not done this morning? They have not
 

1523
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,030
not done this morning? They have not
done it. All right, they've had a fail

1524
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,040
done it. All right, they've had a fail
 

1525
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,430
done it. All right, they've had a fail
break and then move back inside. This is

1526
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:19,440
break and then move back inside. This is
 

1527
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,630
break and then move back inside. This is
where sellers get caught. So, this is

1528
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:20,640
where sellers get caught. So, this is
 

1529
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,270
where sellers get caught. So, this is
why I don't want to sell the lows today

1530
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:23,280
why I don't want to sell the lows today
 

1531
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,790
why I don't want to sell the lows today
because if we're not going to do this

1532
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:24,800
because if we're not going to do this
 

1533
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,710
because if we're not going to do this
move and if we're going to do the one we

1534
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:26,720
move and if we're going to do the one we
 

1535
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,310
move and if we're going to do the one we
talked about pre-market, which would be

1536
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:28,320
talked about pre-market, which would be
 

1537
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,310
talked about pre-market, which would be
a look below and a fail, then this up

1538
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:30,320
a look below and a fail, then this up
 

1539
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,470
a look below and a fail, then this up
here becomes possible. This becomes our

1540
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:32,480
here becomes possible. This becomes our
 

1541
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,829
here becomes possible. This becomes our
range. This becomes the rotation.

1542
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:35,839
range. This becomes the rotation.
 

1543
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,630
range. This becomes the rotation.
So, selling down here, psychopath move,

1544
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:38,640
So, selling down here, psychopath move,
 

1545
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,030
So, selling down here, psychopath move,
you need to wait for that.

1546
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,040
you need to wait for that.
 

1547
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,270
you need to wait for that.
Or you sell the top of the range looking

1548
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:43,280
Or you sell the top of the range looking
 

1549
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,109
Or you sell the top of the range looking

and they see this level here. They
 

1773
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,870

cannot get under it. They've they've
 

1775
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,270
cannot get under it. They've they've
sold this very aggressively this morning

1776
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:07,280
sold this very aggressively this morning
 

1777
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,270
sold this very aggressively this morning
and they're not getting that move. And

1778
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:09,280
and they're not getting that move. And
 

1779
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,950
and they're not getting that move. And
if they don't get that move, they will

1780
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:10,960
if they don't get that move, they will
 

1781
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,630
if they don't get that move, they will
get themselves caught on a break above

1782
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:12,640
get themselves caught on a break above
 

1783
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,230
get themselves caught on a break above
here for a squeeze. So, that's their

here for a squeeze. So, that's their
 

1785

level. 613 to 610. That's their level
 

1787
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,470
level. 613 to 610. That's their level
that they need to get under the bears.

00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:20,480
that they need to get under the bears.
 

1789
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,030

they get a close underneath and start to
 

1801
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,910
they get a close underneath and start to

1803
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,829
rotate? If they can close heavy here and
get under 600, they've got a shot of low

1804
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:53,839
get under 600, they've got a shot of low
 

1805

lot at 90s right now. Let's see if we

1940
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:28,640
lot at 90s right now. Let's see if we
 

1941
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,870
lot at 90s right now. Let's see if we
come down to him and if he pulls. Just

1942
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:30,880
come down to him and if he pulls. Just
 

1943
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,710
come down to him and if he pulls. Just
interested if he's a magnet that pulls

1944
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:32,720
interested if he's a magnet that pulls
 

1945
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,150
interested if he's a magnet that pulls
here because he feels like he might be

1946
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,160
here because he feels like he might be
 

1947
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:52,230
here because he feels like he might be
with that kind of size.

1948
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:52,240

 

1949
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,950

same level again.

1950
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:56,960

 

1951
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:06,470

New York view up. [sighs]

1953
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,710

Definitely a passive seller now. Present

1954
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:08,720
Definitely a passive seller now. Present
 

1955
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,270
Definitely a passive seller now. Present
at 20s and above. They haven't been able

1956
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:11,280
at 20s and above. They haven't been able
 

1957
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,750
at 20s and above. They haven't been able
to close above and definitely passive

1958
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:13,760
to close above and definitely passive
 

1959
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,829
to close above and definitely passive
buyer at 600. So you got a 20 point

1960
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:15,839
buyer at 600. So you got a 20 point
 

1961
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,829
buyer at 600. So you got a 20 point
range here and that's it. That's all

1962
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:17,839
range here and that's it. That's all
 

1963
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:22,309

you've got right now.

1964
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:22,319

Bit of a joke really, isn't it? We all
 

1967
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,550
Bit of a joke really, isn't it? We all
know this is likely before FOMC. We said

1968
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:28,560
know this is likely before FOMC. We said
 

1969
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,230
know this is likely before FOMC. We said
it's very likely we can go sideways

1970
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:30,240
it's very likely we can go sideways
 

1971
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,069
it's very likely we can go sideways
here.

1972
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:32,079
here.
 

1973
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,910

1976
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:35,200
news. Well, it's not actually without
 

1977
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,710
news. Well, it's not actually without
news today. There's plenty of news

1978
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:36,720

1981
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,630
today.
We had news pre-market. Uh we've got uh

1982
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:42,640
We had news pre-market. Uh we've got uh
 

1983
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,069
We had news pre-market. Uh we've got uh
jobs report coming, delayed data. We had

1984
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:46,079
jobs report coming, delayed data. We had
 

1985
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,030

00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:49,040
uh Mexican tariffs. We had chips being
 

1987
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,910
uh Mexican tariffs. We had chips being
allowed to China. So, I wouldn't say

1988
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:51,920
allowed to China. So, I wouldn't say
 

1989
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,390
allowed to China. So, I wouldn't say
it's a no news day. And we've got a big

1990
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:54,400
it's a no news day. And we've got a big
 

1991
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:00,470
it's a no news day. And we've got a big
bond auction at 1:00.

1992
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:00,480

 

1993
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,390

Uh probably just a liquidity provider

1994
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:02,400
Uh probably just a liquidity provider
 

1995
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,950
Uh probably just a liquidity provider
then, Adam. Let's have a look.

1996
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:04,960
then, Adam. Let's have a look.
 

1997
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,630
then, Adam. Let's have a look.
He'll be real, but he's just a liquidity

1998
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:06,640
He'll be real, but he's just a liquidity
 

1999
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,670
He'll be real, but he's just a liquidity
provider. It's just whether they

2000
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:07,680
provider. It's just whether they
 

2001
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,270
provider. It's just whether they
actually fill him or not.

2002
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:11,280
actually fill him or not.
 

2003
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,589
actually fill him or not.
Yeah, still holding that uh 860 we

00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:13,599
Yeah, still holding that uh 860 we
 

2005
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:23,030
Yeah, still holding that uh 860 we

gain. Now, the rest of the market's not
actually really doing very much. As per

2016
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:33,359
actually really doing very much. As per
 

2017
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,270
actually really doing very much. As per
usual, we've got divergence between the

2018
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:35,280
usual, we've got divergence between the
 

2019
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,270
usual, we've got divergence between the
MAG 7. It's been like that for as long

2020
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:37,280
MAG 7. It's been like that for as long
 

2021
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,790
MAG 7. It's been like that for as long
as I can remember now. I cannot remember

2022
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:38,800
as I can remember now. I cannot remember
 

2023
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,309
as I can remember now. I cannot remember
a day where they all sell or all buy for

2024
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:42,319
a day where they all sell or all buy for
 

2025
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,470
a day where they all sell or all buy for
so long on the cues. I can't remember

2026
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:44,480
so long on the cues. I can't remember
 

2027
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,630
so long on the cues. I can't remember
it. Right. It we have to go back months

2028
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:46,640
it. Right. It we have to go back months
 

2029
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:53,109
it. Right. It we have to go back months
now which is not a good look.

2030
00:47:53,109 --> 00:47:53,119

 

2031
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,589

So back into this top side into previous

2032
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:55,599
So back into this top side into previous
 

2033
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:11,670
So back into this top side into previous
day point of control now.

2034
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:11,680

 

2035
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,433

What the [\h__\h] was that?

2036
00:48:16,433 --> 00:48:16,443

How much? That was literally in a
 

2043

nanocond.
 

2045
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,790
nanocond.
In less than a second we did that drop

2046
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:26,800
In less than a second we did that drop
 

2047
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:36,390
In less than a second we did that drop
and scoop.

2048
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:36,400

 

2049
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,710

00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,030
they've cooked those books. They love
doing it. No way do we have more job

2080
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:11,040
doing it. No way do we have more job
 

2081
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:19,910
doing it. No way do we have more job
openings right now. Absolute horseshit.

2082
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:19,920

 

2083
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,190

Yeah, exactly. It's nonsense. Yeah, we

00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:23,200
Yeah, exactly. It's nonsense. Yeah, we
 

2085
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,030
Yeah, exactly. It's nonsense. Yeah, we
we you can't have any of the data that

2086
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:25,040
we you can't have any of the data that
 

2087
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,790
we you can't have any of the data that
shows it's bad, but we will cook the

2088
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:26,800
shows it's bad, but we will cook the
 

2089
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,870
shows it's bad, but we will cook the
books and find a way of showing you some

2090
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:28,880
books and find a way of showing you some
 

2091
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,910
books and find a way of showing you some
data which is good.

2092
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:33,920

 

2093
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,829

Exactly, Ronald. Exactly. I agree with

2094
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:35,839
Exactly, Ronald. Exactly. I agree with
 

2095
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,150
Exactly, Ronald. Exactly. I agree with
you. I agree with you, my friend. It's

2096
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:38,160
you. I agree with you, my friend. It's
 

2097
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:43,750
you. I agree with you, my friend. It's
absolute bollocks and they know it.

2098
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:43,760

 

2099
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,069

Still just in a range. Nothing happening

2100
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:46,079
Still just in a range. Nothing happening
 

2101
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,069
Still just in a range. Nothing happening
here. Buyers just got caught again over

2102
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:48,079
here. Buyers just got caught again over
 

2103
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,150
here. Buyers just got caught again over
34s,

2104
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:50,160
34s,
 

2105
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,390
34s,
but we have no close underneath the 600.

2106
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:52,400
but we have no close underneath the 600.
 

2107
00:49:52,400 --> 00:50:08,549
but we have no close underneath the 600.
So, we're in like 30 point range.

2108
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:08,559

 

2109
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,150

What are they going to do with this

2110
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:10,160
What are they going to do with this
 

2111
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:21,190
What are they going to do with this

00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:21,200

 

2113
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,630

Are they just going to shove it higher

2114
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:22,640
Are they just going to shove it higher
 

2115
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,190
Are they just going to shove it higher
now? Looks like it.

2116
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:27,200

 

2117
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,150

Q's trying to play catch up. Still not

2118
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:30,160
Q's trying to play catch up. Still not

00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:33,119
that's what ES has done. It's closed its
 

2123
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,950
that's what ES has done. It's closed its
gap and it's well over its gap as well.

2124
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:34,960
gap and it's well over its gap as well.
 

2125
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,309
gap and it's well over its gap as well.

on uh probably a fake jobs report. So

2130
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:41,920
on uh probably a fake jobs report. So
 

2131
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,670
on uh probably a fake jobs report. So
PDC is probably the target here. Here

2132
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:43,680
PDC is probably the target here. Here
 

2133
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,150
PDC is probably the target here. Here
you go. There's your PDC. So finally

bulls get up to 700 that's probably

2140
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:51,040
bulls get up to 700 that's probably
 

2141
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,950

So, here's your opening range. Do they

2178
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:34,640
So, here's your opening range. Do they
 

2179
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,150
So, here's your opening range. Do they
hold a bid here or do we go back into

2180
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:36,160
hold a bid here or do we go back into
 

2181
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,069
hold a bid here or do we go back into
the opening range and go right back down

2182
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:38,079
the opening range and go right back down
 

2183
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,829

What a mess this market is right now.

2188
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:49,119

 

2189
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:57,349

Doing that orb dance at the moment.

2190
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:57,359

 

2191
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,349

still holding there or thereabouts, but

2192
00:51:59,349 --> 00:51:59,359
still holding there or thereabouts, but
 

2193
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,470
still holding there or thereabouts, but
if they can't hold it too much longer,

2194
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:00,480
if they can't hold it too much longer,
 

2195
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,750
if they can't hold it too much longer,
you might see a bit of a flush here.

2196
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:03,760
you might see a bit of a flush here.
 

2197
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,270
you might see a bit of a flush here.
We've seen like top of the range has

2198
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:05,280
We've seen like top of the range has
 

2199
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,030
We've seen like top of the range has
been rotated numerous times today.

2200
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:07,040
been rotated numerous times today.
 

2201
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:13,990
been rotated numerous times today.
Remember,

2202
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:14,000

 

2203
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,790

back down they go into it into the VWAP.

2204
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:16,800
back down they go into it into the VWAP.
 

2205
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,150
back down they go into it into the VWAP.
And if they lose this, we can go right

2206
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:18,160
And if they lose this, we can go right
 

2207
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,670
And if they lose this, we can go right
back to the other side of the range all

2208
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:19,680
back to the other side of the range all
 

2209
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,430
back to the other side of the range all
the way down. So, this is current value

2210
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:21,440
the way down. So, this is current value
 

2211
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,430
the way down. So, this is current value
area high on the day. If they lose this,

2212
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:23,440
area high on the day. If they lose this,
 

2213
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,990
area high on the day. If they lose this,
we probably trade back down to uh 620s

2214
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:26,000
we probably trade back down to uh 620s
 

2215
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,301
we probably trade back down to uh 620s
again.

2216
00:52:27,301 --> 00:52:27,311
again.
 

2217
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:37,190
again.
>> [clears throat]

2218
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:37,200

 

2219
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,589

>> What mess?

2220
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:39,599
>> What mess?
 

2221
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,870
>> What mess?
So, I'd say uh yeah, 620 is possible

2222
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:42,880
So, I'd say uh yeah, 620 is possible
 

2223
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,309
So, I'd say uh yeah, 620 is possible
now. And if they lose 620s, low they

2224
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:46,319
now. And if they lose 620s, low they
 

2225
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,790
now. And if they lose 620s, low they
gone from one side to the other. So,

2226
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:48,800
gone from one side to the other. So,
 

2227
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,549
gone from one side to the other. So,
here comes the dance. Can they reclaim

2228
00:52:50,549 --> 00:52:50,559
here comes the dance. Can they reclaim
 

2229
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,470
here comes the dance. Can they reclaim
orb or do they fail 620? like 20

2230
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:54,480
orb or do they fail 620? like 20
 

2231
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,549
orb or do they fail 620? like 20
to 44 will be the rotation and if they

2232
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:56,559
to 44 will be the rotation and if they
 

2233
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,109
to 44 will be the rotation and if they
lose 20s then I'd be watching uh 600s

2234
00:52:59,109 --> 00:52:59,119
lose 20s then I'd be watching uh 600s
 

2235
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,069
lose 20s then I'd be watching uh 600s
and if we lose 600's low day

2236
00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:02,079
and if we lose 600's low day
 

2237
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,190
and if we lose 600's low day
that's what you're looking at at the

2238
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:03,200
that's what you're looking at at the
 

2239
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:14,390
that's what you're looking at at the
moment

2240
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:14,400

 

2241
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:33,190

Wait.

2242
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:33,200

 

2243
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,630

They've got a chance to come in here

2244
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:34,640
They've got a chance to come in here
 

2245
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,630
They've got a chance to come in here
bears again to try and force a rotation.

2246
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:36,640
bears again to try and force a rotation.
 

2247
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,309
bears again to try and force a rotation.
They're not doing a very good job again.

2248
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:38,319
They're not doing a very good job again.
 

2249
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,790
They're not doing a very good job again.
It's the story of their life. ES holding

00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:40,800
It's the story of their life. ES holding
 

2251
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,549
It's the story of their life. ES holding
up really well. So ES just soaked that

2252
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:42,559
up really well. So ES just soaked that
 

2253
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,030
up really well. So ES just soaked that
860 again that we talked about. Uh

2254
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:45,040
860 again that we talked about. Uh
 

2255
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,670
860 again that we talked about. Uh
notice the top side on SPY is 85. We

2256
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:47,680
notice the top side on SPY is 85. We
 

2257
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,069
notice the top side on SPY is 85. We
talked about it pre-market. 85 to 82 is

2258
00:53:50,069 --> 00:53:50,079
talked about it pre-market. 85 to 82 is
 

2259
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,549
talked about it pre-market. 85 to 82 is
the rotation on SPY. Low of day is 8259.

2260
00:53:52,549 --> 00:53:52,559
the rotation on SPY. Low of day is 8259.
 

2261
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,630
the rotation on SPY. Low of day is 8259.
High of day 8493. Those are your gamma

2262
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:54,640
High of day 8493. Those are your gamma
 

2263
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,309
High of day 8493. Those are your gamma
levels. Here comes the rotation back

2264
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:56,319
levels. Here comes the rotation back
 

2265
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:59,430
levels. Here comes the rotation back
down to 20. And if they lose 20, then we

2266
00:53:59,430 --> 00:53:59,440
down to 20. And if they lose 20, then we
 

2267
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,549
down to 20. And if they lose 20, then we
probably come right the way back down

2268
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:00,559
probably come right the way back down
 

2269
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,510
probably come right the way back down
here cuz it' be a failed look above. So,

2270
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:03,520
here cuz it' be a failed look above. So,
 

2271
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:17,910
here cuz it' be a failed look above. So,
we'll have to see.

2272
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:17,920

 

2273
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,670

They're trying to force that move under

2274
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:19,680
They're trying to force that move under
 

2275
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,190
They're trying to force that move under
20 right now. If they get under 20, then

2276
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:21,200
20 right now. If they get under 20, then
 

2277
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,069
20 right now. If they get under 20, then
the move is to 600. But so far today,

2278
00:54:24,069 --> 00:54:24,079
the move is to 600. But so far today,
 

2279
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:25,910
the move is to 600. But so far today,
bears haven't been able to get rotation

2280
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:25,920
bears haven't been able to get rotation
 

2281
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,589
bears haven't been able to get rotation
under these levels.

2282
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:29,599

 

2283
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:46,230

I still got croak in my throat.

2284
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:46,240

 

2285
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,069

We just go sideways. Vix is finding a

2286
00:54:48,069 --> 00:54:48,079
We just go sideways. Vix is finding a
 

2287
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,230
We just go sideways. Vix is finding a
bid here on the old demand level.

2288
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:52,240
bid here on the old demand level.
 

2289
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,069
bid here on the old demand level.
So, do they sell the next pop-up or is

2290
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:54,079
So, do they sell the next pop-up or is
 

2291
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,987
So, do they sell the next pop-up or is
this just going to go straight back?

2292
00:54:55,987 --> 00:54:55,997
this just going to go straight back?
 

2293
00:54:55,997 --> 00:54:58,790
this just going to go straight back?
[sighs] So, you'd be watching

2294
00:54:58,790 --> 00:54:58,800
[sighs] So, you'd be watching
 

2295
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,670
[sighs] So, you'd be watching
44s to 55s. The bears will want to sell

2296
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:01,680
44s to 55s. The bears will want to sell
 

2297
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,270
44s to 55s. The bears will want to sell
and bulls obviously want to reclaim that

2298
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:03,280
and bulls obviously want to reclaim that
 

2299
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:09,750
and bulls obviously want to reclaim that
for a move back to high day.

2300
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:09,760

 

2301
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,790

Unconvinced right now of anything.

2302
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:14,800

 

2303
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,710

50% of opening range. Yeah. Well, a

2304
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:16,720
50% of opening range. Yeah. Well, a
 

2305
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,069
50% of opening range. Yeah. Well, a
trade back into it. Yeah, a lot of

2306
00:55:18,069 --> 00:55:18,079
trade back into it. Yeah, a lot of
 

2307
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:19,750
trade back into it. Yeah, a lot of
people like that trade, but it's not a

2308
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:19,760
people like that trade, but it's not a
 

2309
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,589
people like that trade, but it's not a
trade I've ever taken. I don't

2310
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:21,599
trade I've ever taken. I don't
 

2311
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,829
trade I've ever taken. I don't
understand why

2312
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:23,839
understand why
 

2313
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:27,750
understand why
me people love that trade so much

2314
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:27,760
me people love that trade so much
 

2315
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,430
me people love that trade so much
because it's not based on even volume

2316
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:29,440
because it's not based on even volume
 

2317
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,710
because it's not based on even volume
traders take it. I'm like, but it's not

2318
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:30,720
traders take it. I'm like, but it's not
 

2319
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,230
traders take it. I'm like, but it's not
even based on structural volume. It's

2320
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:32,240
even based on structural volume. It's
 

2321
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,910
even based on structural volume. It's
just a percent of a range. There we go.

2322
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:35,920
just a percent of a range. There we go.
 

2323
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:51,510
just a percent of a range. There we go.
If it works, it works. Okay.

2324
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:51,520

 

2325
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:58,549

So that 860 is key on SPY.

2326
00:55:58,549 --> 00:55:58,559

 

2327
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,309

This is the potential lower high if they

2328
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:00,319
This is the potential lower high if they
 

2329
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:01,910
This is the potential lower high if they
want to do the rotation back down. The

2330
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:01,920
want to do the rotation back down. The
 

2331
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,150
want to do the rotation back down. The
bears need a close under here. Now we've

2332
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:04,160
bears need a close under here. Now we've
 

2333
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,829
bears need a close under here. Now we've
come to that 620 we talked about. If

2334
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:05,839
come to that 620 we talked about. If
 

2335
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,990
come to that 620 we talked about. If
they get under 620 now, they've got a

2336
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:08,000
they get under 620 now, they've got a
 

2337
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,230
they get under 620 now, they've got a
chance to move to 600 and low lower low

2338
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:10,240
chance to move to 600 and low lower low
 

2339
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,109
chance to move to 600 and low lower low
day under that. But it's uh

2340
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:13,119
day under that. But it's uh
 

2341
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,190
day under that. But it's uh
they've got to get under 620 first. So

2342
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:15,200
they've got to get under 620 first. So
 

2343
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,710
they've got to get under 620 first. So
this is potential for a lower high. It

2344
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:16,720
this is potential for a lower high. It
 

2345
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,549
this is potential for a lower high. It
can also be trapped here.

2346
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:20,559

 

2347
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,230

This is where bears got stuck last time

2348
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:22,240
This is where bears got stuck last time
 

2349
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,670
This is where bears got stuck last time
where we are right now. This is where

2350
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:23,680
where we are right now. This is where
 

2351
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,910
where we are right now. This is where
they keep kind of trying to keep trying

2352
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:25,920
they keep kind of trying to keep trying
 

2353
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,670
they keep kind of trying to keep trying
to come in and sell and not get in their

2354
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:27,680
to come in and sell and not get in their
 

2355
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,069
to come in and sell and not get in their
way. So so far they're being soaked.

2356
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:30,079
way. So so far they're being soaked.
 

2357
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,829
way. So so far they're being soaked.
They can't get that close under 20 that

2358
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:31,839
They can't get that close under 20 that
 

2359
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:48,789
They can't get that close under 20 that
they need. So far,

2360
00:56:48,789 --> 00:56:48,799

 

2361
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,789

there's the 20s again. They're trying

2362
00:56:50,789 --> 00:56:50,799
there's the 20s again. They're trying
 

2363
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,549
there's the 20s again. They're trying
they're desperately trying here to get

2364
00:56:52,549 --> 00:56:52,559
they're desperately trying here to get
 

2365
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,789
they're desperately trying here to get
underneath this volume point of control

2366
00:56:54,789 --> 00:56:54,799
underneath this volume point of control
 

2367
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:56,789
underneath this volume point of control
and the New York open. If we lose that

2368
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:56,799
and the New York open. If we lose that
 

2369
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,710
and the New York open. If we lose that
600s and then lower day is possible like

2370
00:56:58,710 --> 00:56:58,720
600s and then lower day is possible like
 

2371
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,589
600s and then lower day is possible like
we talked about

2372
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:01,599
we talked about
 

2373
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,069
we talked about
still soaking there. Can they get a

2374
00:57:04,069 --> 00:57:04,079
still soaking there. Can they get a
 

2375
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:09,510
still soaking there. Can they get a
close underneath it?

2376
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:09,520

 

2377
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,150

Oh, it's so boring, man. We're in like

2378
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:12,160
Oh, it's so boring, man. We're in like
 

2379
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,950
Oh, it's so boring, man. We're in like
20 point rotations again.

2380
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:16,960

 

2381
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:47,910

20 point rotations again.

2382
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:47,920

 

2383
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,630

the grab it again there. No close under

2384
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:50,640
the grab it again there. No close under
 

2385
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,470
the grab it again there. No close under
the 20s. Back to the top side we go

2386
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:52,480
the 20s. Back to the top side we go
 

2387
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,349
the 20s. Back to the top side we go
again to test that over. Rinse, repeat,

2388
00:57:55,349 --> 00:57:55,359
again to test that over. Rinse, repeat,
 

2389
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:56,789
again to test that over. Rinse, repeat,
rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat. So you can

2390
00:57:56,789 --> 00:57:56,799
rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat. So you can
 

2391
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,710
rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat. So you can
see ES doing the same thing. Holding the

2392
00:57:58,710 --> 00:57:58,720
see ES doing the same thing. Holding the
 

2393
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,270
see ES doing the same thing. Holding the
60s. did get just slightly under 60s but

2394
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:01,280
60s. did get just slightly under 60s but
 

2395
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,990
60s. did get just slightly under 60s but
holding it for now. Market will need to

2396
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:04,000
holding it for now. Market will need to
 

2397
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,589
holding it for now. Market will need to
make a decision. We cannot just keep

2398
00:58:05,589 --> 00:58:05,599
make a decision. We cannot just keep
 

2399
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:08,630
make a decision. We cannot just keep
staying here forever.

2400
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:08,640
staying here forever.
 

2401
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,230
staying here forever.
But that decision doesn't need to come

2402
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:10,240
But that decision doesn't need to come
 

2403
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,309
But that decision doesn't need to come
today. So yeah, we don't need to stay

2404
00:58:12,309 --> 00:58:12,319
today. So yeah, we don't need to stay
 

2405
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,230
today. So yeah, we don't need to stay
here forever.

2406
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:14,240
here forever.
 

2407
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,750
here forever.
Back to where these bears tried again.

2408
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:15,760
Back to where these bears tried again.
 

2409
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,390
Back to where these bears tried again.
So bears came in aggressive from 30 to

2410
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:18,400
So bears came in aggressive from 30 to
 

2411
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,230
So bears came in aggressive from 30 to
17 and did not get their way. They got

2412
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:20,240
17 and did not get their way. They got
 

2413
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,750
17 and did not get their way. They got
soaked from 30 to 17. From 30 to 17

2414
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:23,760
soaked from 30 to 17. From 30 to 17
 

2415
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,190
soaked from 30 to 17. From 30 to 17
they've been soaked. So there's a

2416
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:25,200
they've been soaked. So there's a
 

2417
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,910
they've been soaked. So there's a
passive buyer now. soaking from 30 to

2418
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:27,920
passive buyer now. soaking from 30 to
 

2419
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,390
passive buyer now. soaking from 30 to
17. Top side of it, where do we have

2420
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:30,400
17. Top side of it, where do we have
 

2421
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,510
17. Top side of it, where do we have
balls trapped? Well, we have some

2422
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:31,520
balls trapped? Well, we have some
 

2423
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,670
balls trapped? Well, we have some
trapped into 50. Most of them are

2424
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:33,680
trapped into 50. Most of them are
 

2425
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,870
trapped into 50. Most of them are
trapped up at 67 and above.

2426
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:38,880

 

2427
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,670

Mad doesn't look very good. You take

2428
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:41,680
Mad doesn't look very good. You take
 

2429
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,190
Mad doesn't look very good. You take
Tesla out the equation and it doesn't

2430
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:43,200
Tesla out the equation and it doesn't
 

2431
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:50,950
Tesla out the equation and it doesn't
look very good. Right now,

2432
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:50,960

 

2433
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,710

no, with rotation, I do not mean

2434
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:52,720
no, with rotation, I do not mean
 

2435
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,710
no, with rotation, I do not mean
consolidation. I mean to take to test

2436
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:54,720
consolidation. I mean to take to test
 

2437
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,630
consolidation. I mean to take to test
one side to the other. Yes,

2438
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:56,640
one side to the other. Yes,
 

2439
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,309
one side to the other. Yes,
consolidation is that range, but the

2440
00:58:58,309 --> 00:58:58,319
consolidation is that range, but the
 

2441
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,870
consolidation is that range, but the
rotation is the move from one side to

2442
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:00,880
rotation is the move from one side to
 

2443
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:08,710
rotation is the move from one side to
the other, from one side to the other.

2444
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:08,720

 

2445
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,349

Big selling coming in here. Is there

2446
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:11,359
Big selling coming in here. Is there
 

2447
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,910
Big selling coming in here. Is there
still a bid down here? Who's soaking?

2448
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:13,920
still a bid down here? Who's soaking?
 

2449
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,109
still a bid down here? Who's soaking?
This is what I'm interested now. We're

2450
00:59:15,109 --> 00:59:15,119
This is what I'm interested now. We're
 

2451
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,789
This is what I'm interested now. We're
seeing very aggressive market selling

2452
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:16,799
seeing very aggressive market selling
 

2453
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:19,030
seeing very aggressive market selling
here and we're not moving lower. It just

2454
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:19,040
here and we're not moving lower. It just
 

2455
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,870
here and we're not moving lower. It just
came flying in there and we're not

2456
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:20,880
came flying in there and we're not
 

2457
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,630
came flying in there and we're not
moving lower. So, we've got a passive

2458
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:22,640
moving lower. So, we've got a passive
 

2459
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,670
moving lower. So, we've got a passive
buyer on the tape again. This level here

2460
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:25,680
buyer on the tape again. This level here
 

2461
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,430
buyer on the tape again. This level here
at 30 has become key. They've trapped

2462
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:27,440
at 30 has become key. They've trapped
 

2463
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,870
at 30 has become key. They've trapped
all the shorts under there for the last

2464
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:28,880
all the shorts under there for the last
 

2465
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,309
all the shorts under there for the last
10 minutes. So 30's become key without a

2466
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:32,319
10 minutes. So 30's become key without a
 

2467
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,990
10 minutes. So 30's become key without a
doubt because they just tried to

2468
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:34,000
doubt because they just tried to
 

2469
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,349
doubt because they just tried to
aggressively sell it here. There was

2470
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:35,359
aggressively sell it here. There was
 

2471
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:36,950
aggressively sell it here. There was
over a 100 lot came flying in and we

2472
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:36,960
over a 100 lot came flying in and we
 

2473
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,990
over a 100 lot came flying in and we
didn't move lower. So we've got a

2474
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:38,000
didn't move lower. So we've got a
 

2475
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,470
didn't move lower. So we've got a
passive buyer right now trying to absorb

2476
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:40,480
passive buyer right now trying to absorb
 

2477
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,630
passive buyer right now trying to absorb

forward and divergence, right? Garbage

2508
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:15,920
forward and divergence, right? Garbage
 

2509
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,069
forward and divergence, right? Garbage
range and divergence. Like you look at

2510
01:00:18,069 --> 01:00:18,079
range and divergence. Like you look at
 

2511
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:21,670
range and divergence. Like you look at
um ES versus Q's like we've closed the

2512
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:21,680
um ES versus Q's like we've closed the
 

2513
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,549
um ES versus Q's like we've closed the
gap and failed. ES ES man is way up

2514
01:00:24,549 --> 01:00:24,559
gap and failed. ES ES man is way up
 

2515
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,270
gap and failed. ES ES man is way up
here, right? So massive divergence in

2516
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:27,280
here, right? So massive divergence in
 

2517
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,990
here, right? So massive divergence in
the market. So breth probably I'll have

2518
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:30,000
the market. So breth probably I'll have
 

2519
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,829
the market. So breth probably I'll have
a look but I'm guessing energy or banks

2520
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:31,839
a look but I'm guessing energy or banks
 

2521
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:38,230
a look but I'm guessing energy or banks
are doing something. [snorts]

2522
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:38,240

 

2523
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,990

Let's have a look at the sectors. Yes.

2524
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:40,000
Let's have a look at the sectors. Yes.
 

2525
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,430
Let's have a look at the sectors. Yes.
So again this is why so banks are up. So

2526
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:43,440
So again this is why so banks are up. So
 

2527
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,589
So again this is why so banks are up. So
finance up, healthcare up, real estate

2528
01:00:45,589 --> 01:00:45,599
finance up, healthcare up, real estate
 

2529
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,390
finance up, healthcare up, real estate
up, energy up,

2530
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:48,400
up, energy up,
 

2531
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,510
up, energy up,
households up, and semis down. So

2532
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:51,520
households up, and semis down. So
 

2533
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,109
households up, and semis down. So
massive divergence. So you've got the

2534
01:00:53,109 --> 01:00:53,119
massive divergence. So you've got the
 

2535
01:00:53,119 --> 01:01:13,910
massive divergence. So you've got the
broader market looking good.

2536
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:13,920

big trouble. The question is how much
 

2615
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:26,630
big trouble. The question is how much

01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:41,029
numbers, if I was an American, I'd be
asking why I pay tax for them to hide

2626
01:03:41,029 --> 01:03:41,039
asking why I pay tax for them to hide
 

2627
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:51,510
asking why I pay tax for them to hide
important data.

Still must be a buyer on this book. He's
 

2683
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:15,349
Still must be a buyer on this book. He's
absorbed everyone who's tried to sell.

2684
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:15,359

 

2685
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,750

So he's still not letting them out. So

2686
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:17,760
So he's still not letting them out. So
 

2687
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,390
So he's still not letting them out. So
sell sellers are stuck. Like I said 30

2688
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:20,400
sell sellers are stuck. Like I said 30
 

2689
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,230
sell sellers are stuck. Like I said 30
to 18 that 30 is your level. That's your

2690
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:24,240
to 18 that 30 is your level. That's your
 

2691
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,910
to 18 that 30 is your level. That's your
level where he's just soaking soaking

2692
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:25,920

2693

level where he's just soaking soaking
soaking soaking the tape. Once that goes

2694

soaking soaking the tape. Once that goes
 

2695
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,390
soaking soaking the tape. Once that goes
and they get follow through, if he's not

2696
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:30,400
and they get follow through, if he's not
 

2697
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,990
and they get follow through, if he's not
there anymore, you got to wonder who's

2698
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:32,000
there anymore, you got to wonder who's
 

2699
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,430
there anymore, you got to wonder who's
going to absorb that tape any longer

2700
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:33,440
going to absorb that tape any longer
 

2701
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,950
going to absorb that tape any longer
because he's been there for the last

2702
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:36,960
because he's been there for the last
 

2703
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:51,990
because he's been there for the last
20 minutes gobbling it up.

2704
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:52,000

 

2705
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,910

He's still trying to gobble it up for

2706
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:53,920
He's still trying to gobble it up for
 

2707

He's still trying to gobble it up for
higher. They're just not seeing any

2708
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:55,760
higher. They're just not seeing any
 

2709
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:01,510
higher. They're just not seeing any
follow through though.

2711
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,510

I think once 30 goes, he's in trouble.

2712
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:03,520
I think once 30 goes, he's in trouble.
 

2713
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,349
I think once 30 goes, he's in trouble.

2750
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:43,760
gobble it. If he gets out the way
 

2751
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,950
gobble it. If he gets out the way
though, I wouldn't be surprised to see a

35. And that's got a bit must be his

2784
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:32,240
35. And that's got a bit must be his
 

2785
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,750
35. And that's got a bit must be his
average price because we've got huge

2786
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:33,760
average price because we've got huge
 

2787
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,230
average price because we've got huge
delta there. Now

2788
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:36,240
delta there. Now
 

2789
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,230
delta there. Now
he keeps bidding around there. I'm just

2790
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:38,240
he keeps bidding around there. I'm just
 

2791
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,990
he keeps bidding around there. I'm just
looking at the book map. I'm looking at

2792
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:40,000
looking at the book map. I'm looking at
 

2793
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,630
looking at the book map. I'm looking at
the uh volume profile delta here. And

2794
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:42,640
the uh volume profile delta here. And
 

2795
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,150
the uh volume profile delta here. And
this stands out here. This where we're

2796
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:44,160
this stands out here. This where we're
 

2797
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,349
this stands out here. This where we're
trading right now. You can see it's all

2798
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:45,359
trading right now. You can see it's all
 

2799
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,589
trading right now. You can see it's all
buy side where we are right now. That's

2800
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:47,599
buy side where we are right now. That's
 

2801
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:50,150
buy side where we are right now. That's
kind of giving me sentiment for where we

2802
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:50,160
kind of giving me sentiment for where we
 

2803
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,910
kind of giving me sentiment for where we
are in this range. This sort of 34,

2804
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:51,920
are in this range. This sort of 34,
 

2805
01:07:51,920 --> 01:08:20,390
are in this range. This sort of 34,
let's just call it 35.

2806
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:20,400

 

2807
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,669

Well, eventually there'll be a move

2808
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:21,679
Well, eventually there'll be a move
 

2809
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:23,669
Well, eventually there'll be a move
outside of this one way or another. We

2810
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:23,679
outside of this one way or another. We
 

2811
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:38,229
outside of this one way or another. We
can't stay this tight rather.

2812
01:08:38,229 --> 01:08:38,239

 

2813
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:41,749

Yes. Finding a bid on VW up.

2814
01:08:41,749 --> 01:08:41,759
Yes. Finding a bid on VW up.
 

2815
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:43,749
Yes. Finding a bid on VW up.
We're still trading the same level. Oh

2816
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:43,759
We're still trading the same level. Oh
 

2817
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:45,829
We're still trading the same level. Oh
my god. How many How long have we been

2818
01:08:45,829 --> 01:08:45,839
my god. How many How long have we been
 

2819
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:48,470
my god. How many How long have we been
here? All day, basically.

2820
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:48,480
here? All day, basically.
 

2821
01:08:48,480 --> 01:09:06,950
here? All day, basically.
All day.

2822
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:06,960

 

2823
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,590

Sorry folks. Can't do anything with with

2824
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:09,600
Sorry folks. Can't do anything with with
 

2825
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,749
Sorry folks. Can't do anything with with
this. We had one trade today

2826
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:13,759

 

2827
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:16,950

here. Low hanging fruit gone and now

2828
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:16,960
here. Low hanging fruit gone and now
 

2829
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,709
here. Low hanging fruit gone and now
we're stuck.

2830
01:09:18,709 --> 01:09:18,719
we're stuck.
 

2831
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,309
we're stuck.
All right. My bias is actually that

2832
01:09:20,309 --> 01:09:20,319
All right. My bias is actually that
 

2833
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:21,749
All right. My bias is actually that
they're going to do this because they

2834
01:09:21,749 --> 01:09:21,759
they're going to do this because they
 

2835
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:24,070
they're going to do this because they
failed to get above here. But we've got

2836
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:24,080
failed to get above here. But we've got
 

2837
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,829
failed to get above here. But we've got
a buyer in here gobbling everything up.

2838
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:25,839
a buyer in here gobbling everything up.
 

2839
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:27,430
a buyer in here gobbling everything up.
So it doesn't matter what my bias is

2840
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:27,440
So it doesn't matter what my bias is
 

2841
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,189
So it doesn't matter what my bias is
until I see this. I don't see

2842
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:29,199
until I see this. I don't see
 

2843
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:30,550
until I see this. I don't see
acceptance. And we are just going to

2844
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:30,560
acceptance. And we are just going to
 

2845
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,189
acceptance. And we are just going to
trade in this range forever until

2846
01:09:33,189 --> 01:09:33,199
trade in this range forever until
 

2847
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:35,430
trade in this range forever until
they're done with it by the looks of it

2848
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:35,440
they're done with it by the looks of it
 

2849
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,590
they're done with it by the looks of it
at the moment.

2850
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:37,600
at the moment.
 

2851
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,030
at the moment.
And if they want to come and test up

2852
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:39,040
And if they want to come and test up
 

2853
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,789
And if they want to come and test up
here, they can remember 700s is the

2854
01:09:40,789 --> 01:09:40,799
here, they can remember 700s is the
 

2855
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:43,110
here, they can remember 700s is the
target for bulls. Um, but this doesn't

2856
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:43,120
target for bulls. Um, but this doesn't
 

2857
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,870
target for bulls. Um, but this doesn't
look very bullish at the moment. Yes,

2858
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:44,880
look very bullish at the moment. Yes,
 

2859
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,070
look very bullish at the moment. Yes,
like we are drifting, but this feel Oh,

2860
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:48,080
like we are drifting, but this feel Oh,
 

2861
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,630
like we are drifting, but this feel Oh,
don't do that. This feels like a just a

2862
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:50,640
don't do that. This feels like a just a
 

2863
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,189
don't do that. This feels like a just a
guy's in here,

2864
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:53,199
guy's in here,
 

2865
01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:55,350
guy's in here,
right? Just eating this market. And my

2866
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:55,360
right? Just eating this market. And my
 

2867
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,510
right? Just eating this market. And my
concern is if he keeps getting size and

2868
01:09:57,510 --> 01:09:57,520
concern is if he keeps getting size and
 

2869
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,950
concern is if he keeps getting size and
we've got a passive seller here saying

2870
01:09:58,950 --> 01:09:58,960
we've got a passive seller here saying
 

2871
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,510
we've got a passive seller here saying
no, this happens and eventually either

2872
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:01,520
no, this happens and eventually either
 

2873
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,669
no, this happens and eventually either
this or this happens probably pretty

2874
01:10:03,669 --> 01:10:03,679
this or this happens probably pretty
 

2875
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:06,310
this or this happens probably pretty
quickly once one side wins because this

2876
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:06,320
quickly once one side wins because this
 

2877
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,830
quickly once one side wins because this
is getting going to get very tight in

2878
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:07,840
is getting going to get very tight in
 

2879
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,550
is getting going to get very tight in
here.

2880
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:12,560

 

2881
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,430

So back to these 34s and 35s again. This

2882
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:15,440
So back to these 34s and 35s again. This
 

2883
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,870
So back to these 34s and 35s again. This
is where I think the buyers been

2884
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:16,880
is where I think the buyers been
 

2885
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,550
is where I think the buyers been
starting to move away from him now and

2886
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:18,560
starting to move away from him now and
 

2887
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,669
starting to move away from him now and
he keeps absorbing into 30. So if he

2888
01:10:21,669 --> 01:10:21,679
he keeps absorbing into 30. So if he
 

2889
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:23,189
he keeps absorbing into 30. So if he
gets out the way, I would not be

2890
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:23,199
gets out the way, I would not be
 

2891
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:24,630
gets out the way, I would not be
surprised to see a bigger flush in this

2892
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:24,640
surprised to see a bigger flush in this
 

2893
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,149
surprised to see a bigger flush in this
market. It just depends if he gets out

2894
01:10:26,149 --> 01:10:26,159
market. It just depends if he gets out
 

2895
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:28,709
market. It just depends if he gets out
the way and use the New York openers

2896
01:10:28,709 --> 01:10:28,719
the way and use the New York openers
 

2897
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:33,510
the way and use the New York openers
sentiment shift really.

2898
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:33,520

 

2899
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,870

Gosh.

2926
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:18,640

 

2927
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,910

I mean, this is just awful, man.

2928

I mean, this is just awful, man.
 

2929
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,910
I mean, this is just awful, man.
Probably my side. Yeah, I never changed

2930
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:23,920
Probably my side. Yeah, I never changed
 

2931

Probably my side. Yeah, I never changed
anything. So, do do you know how to do

anything. So, do do you know how to do
 

2933
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,350
anything. So, do do you know how to do
that? I can't see it. I've looked on the

2934
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:27,360
that? I can't see it. I've looked on the
 

2935
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,030
that? I can't see it. I've looked on the
internet. I cannot see a way of doing

2936
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:29,040
internet. I cannot see a way of doing
 

2937
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:35,510
internet. I cannot see a way of doing
it.

2938
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:35,520

 

2939
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,350

Back to VWAP. Everything flat. Look,

2940
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:37,360
Back to VWAP. Everything flat. Look,
 

2941
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,510
Back to VWAP. Everything flat. Look,
everything's tightening up. This is one

2942
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:39,520
everything's tightening up. This is one
 

2943
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,630
everything's tightening up. This is one
way or another, someone's going to get

2944
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:40,640
way or another, someone's going to get
 

2945
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,149
way or another, someone's going to get
hurt. Otherwise, we're either we're

2946
01:11:42,149 --> 01:11:42,159
hurt. Otherwise, we're either we're
 

2947
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:43,669
hurt. Otherwise, we're either we're
squeezing out of here and ripping out

2948
01:11:43,669 --> 01:11:43,679
squeezing out of here and ripping out
 

2949
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,110
squeezing out of here and ripping out
all the shorts or we're going to dump

2950
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:45,120
all the shorts or we're going to dump
 

2951
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:51,830
all the shorts or we're going to dump
here and rip out all the bulls.

2952
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:51,840

 

2953
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,149

Yeah, it's changed everywhere, has it?

2954
01:11:54,149 --> 01:11:54,159
Yeah, it's changed everywhere, has it?
 

2955
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:56,550
Yeah, it's changed everywhere, has it?
Yeah, I asked AI. It didn't have the end

2956
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:56,560
Yeah, I asked AI. It didn't have the end
 

2957
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:01,030
Yeah, I asked AI. It didn't have the end
of the answers.

2958
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:01,040

 

2959
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:06,630

Just wondered if any of you knew.

2960
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:06,640

 

2961
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:07,669

It's annoying that they've done it,

2962
01:12:07,669 --> 01:12:07,679
It's annoying that they've done it,
 

2963
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:11,830
It's annoying that they've done it,
though. I think it's a bad change.

2964
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:11,840

 

2965
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,870

Big bar coming in here.

2966
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:14,880
Big bar coming in here.
 

2967
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,229
Big bar coming in here.
Big bar coming in here. Maybe they're

2968
01:12:16,229 --> 01:12:16,239
Big bar coming in here. Maybe they're
 

2969
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:19,189
Big bar coming in here. Maybe they're
going to force this breakout now.

2970
01:12:19,189 --> 01:12:19,199
going to force this breakout now.
 

2971
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,790
going to force this breakout now.
It's really stupid that YouTube have

2972
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:20,800
It's really stupid that YouTube have
 

2973
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,430
It's really stupid that YouTube have
done that though. Like what a

2974
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:23,440
done that though. Like what a
 

2975
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,189
done that though. Like what a
what [\h__\h] idiot has sat there and

2976
01:12:25,189 --> 01:12:25,199
what [\h__\h] idiot has sat there and
 

2977
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:27,030
what [\h__\h] idiot has sat there and
gone, "Oh, I know what we'll do. We'll

2978
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:27,040
gone, "Oh, I know what we'll do. We'll
 

2979
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,030
gone, "Oh, I know what we'll do. We'll
uh do it so we can't see their names

2980
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:29,040
uh do it so we can't see their names
 

2981
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,550
uh do it so we can't see their names
anymore and we see their hand." I don't

2982
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:30,560
anymore and we see their hand." I don't
 

2983
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,470
anymore and we see their hand." I don't
know who half of you are now. Whereas

2984
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:32,480
know who half of you are now. Whereas
 

2985
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,229
know who half of you are now. Whereas
like some of you have been here for a

2986
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:34,239
like some of you have been here for a
 

2987
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:35,910
like some of you have been here for a
year plus with me and I I don't know who

2988
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:35,920
year plus with me and I I don't know who
 

2989
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,910
year plus with me and I I don't know who
you are. It just seems like the most

2990
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:37,920
you are. It just seems like the most
 

2991
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:47,350
you are. It just seems like the most
stupid decision from YouTube.

2992
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:47,360

 

2993
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,310

There you go. So, Hercules, I'm Stefan.

But you don't have to have your full
 

3005

But you don't have to have your full

it's your choice what your username is.

3008
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:19,280
it's your choice what your username is.

You're probably right, Rosco. Yeah,

You're probably right, Rosco. Yeah,

All right, they're juggling this book
around now. They're just being silly

around now. They're just being silly
 

3025
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,310
around now. They're just being silly
with it. Still nothing to do while they

3026
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:46,320
with it. Still nothing to do while they
 

3027
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:52,149

act like complete Pratts this morning.

3028
01:13:52,149 --> 01:13:52,159

 

3029
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:54,149

So, Vicks failed to get back above 17.

So, Vicks failed to get back above 17.

So, Vicks failed to get back above 17.
that's failing in front of it. So, you

3032

that's failing in front of it. So, you
 

3033
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:57,669
that's failing in front of it. So, you
got to watch out here. VIX sets a lower

3083
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,470
down. Is there still a soaker there?
Yeah, 30 is still the level. And we've

3084
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:16,480
Yeah, 30 is still the level. And we've
 

3085
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,830
Yeah, 30 is still the level. And we've
said it's been the level the whole time.

3086
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:19,840
said it's been the level the whole time.
 

3087

said it's been the level the whole time.
They need to trade under 30s, otherwise

They need to trade under 30s, otherwise
you've still got someone just soaking

you've still got someone just soaking
 

3091
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:25,270
you've still got someone just soaking
the tape. If 30s lets go, there'll be a

01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:25,280
the tape. If 30s lets go, there'll be a
 

3093
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,149
the tape. If 30s lets go, there'll be a
move. But there has someone there has

3094
01:16:28,149 --> 01:16:28,159
move. But there has someone there has
 

3095
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:29,830
move. But there has someone there has
been someone trying to soak it over and

3096
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:29,840
been someone trying to soak it over and
 

3097
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,030
been someone trying to soak it over and
over and over and over and over again.

3098
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:33,040
over and over and over and over again.
 

3099
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,390
over and over and over and over again.
And the delta is really 35 to yeah,

3100
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:36,400
And the delta is really 35 to yeah,
 

3101
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,390
And the delta is really 35 to yeah,
let's just call it 35 to 34. That's

3102
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:38,400
let's just call it 35 to 34. That's
 

3103
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,709
let's just call it 35 to 34. That's
where we've had big buy side delta and

3104
01:16:40,709 --> 01:16:40,719
where we've had big buy side delta and
 

3105
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:42,950
where we've had big buy side delta and
sellside delta's been under 30. That's

3106
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:42,960
sellside delta's been under 30. That's
 

3107
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,270
sellside delta's been under 30. That's
why you need to get a close under 30 for

3108
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:45,280
why you need to get a close under 30 for
 

3109
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,990
why you need to get a close under 30 for
shorts to have an available legitimate

3110
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:48,000
shorts to have an available legitimate
 

3111
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,350
shorts to have an available legitimate
trade downside. But you're not seeing

3112
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:49,360
trade downside. But you're not seeing
 

3113
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,110
trade downside. But you're not seeing
it. And SPY is holding this market up.

3114
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:51,120
it. And SPY is holding this market up.
 

3115
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,350

SPY and ES are holding above PDC. They

3116
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:53,360
SPY and ES are holding above PDC. They
 

3117
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,790

01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:57,040
complete divergence. VIX just failed in
 

3121
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,790
complete divergence. VIX just failed in
front of 17 to do a lower high like we

3122
01:16:58,790 --> 01:16:58,800
front of 17 to do a lower high like we
 

3123
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,550
front of 17 to do a lower high like we
talked about as well. This is just

3124
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:00,560
talked about as well. This is just
 

3125
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,990
talked about as well. This is just
trash. Like absolute trash that you're

3127
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,350
trash. Like absolute trash that you're
watching this morning. There's nothing

3128
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:05,360
watching this morning. There's nothing
 

3129
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,030
watching this morning. There's nothing
to do here. I feel like I'm on repeat

3130
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:07,040
to do here. I feel like I'm on repeat
 

3131
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,630
to do here. I feel like I'm on repeat
from last week when I last traded with

01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:08,640
from last week when I last traded with
 

3133
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,229
from last week when I last traded with
you guys and I just said it's a [\h__\h]

market being controlled by options. Just

3136
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:12,960
market being controlled by options. Just
 

3137
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:17,910
market being controlled by options. Just
look at SPY 85 82 808 888.

3138
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:17,920
look at SPY 85 82 808 888.
 

3139
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,910
look at SPY 85 82 808 888.
It's just options dealers. Like there's

3140
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:19,920
It's just options dealers. Like there's
 

3141
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,750
It's just options dealers. Like there's
there's no momentum in this market.

3142
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:21,760
there's no momentum in this market.
 

3143
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,590
there's no momentum in this market.
There's nothing to do. Like I see money,

3144
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:25,600
There's nothing to do. Like I see money,
 

3145
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,590
There's nothing to do. Like I see money,
take money, and

3146
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:27,600
take money, and
 

3147
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,110
take money, and
get the [\h__\h] away from it, honestly.

3148
01:17:29,110 --> 01:17:29,120
get the [\h__\h] away from it, honestly.
 

3149
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,870
get the [\h__\h] away from it, honestly.
Like, just avoid avoid it like the

3150
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:30,880
Like, just avoid avoid it like the
 

3151
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,390
Like, just avoid avoid it like the
plague. Try and just get to January

3152
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:32,400
plague. Try and just get to January
 

3153
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,390
plague. Try and just get to January
without doing something stupid. I'd see

3154
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:34,400
without doing something stupid. I'd see
 

3155
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:38,470
without doing something stupid. I'd see
is I'd say is probably your best bet

3156
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:38,480
is I'd say is probably your best bet
 

3157
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,790
is I'd say is probably your best bet
because I can't see why anyone would be

3158
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:40,800
because I can't see why anyone would be
 

3159
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,030
because I can't see why anyone would be
risk going into December 13th with the

3160
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:43,040
risk going into December 13th with the
 

3161
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,550
risk going into December 13th with the
carry trade and with what bonds are

3162
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:44,560
carry trade and with what bonds are
 

3163
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,270
carry trade and with what bonds are
doing. In fact, let me just have a look

3164
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:47,280
doing. In fact, let me just have a look
 

3165
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:57,990
doing. In fact, let me just have a look
what we seeing here this morning.

3166
01:17:57,990 --> 01:17:58,000

 

3167
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,669

Yeah, it's uh if that turns around

3168
01:18:01,669 --> 01:18:01,679
Yeah, it's uh if that turns around
 

3169
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:09,189
Yeah, it's uh if that turns around
the 10 year,

3170
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:09,199

 

3171
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:11,110

mate.

3172
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:11,120
mate.
 

3173
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:15,430
mate.
That's what I've been calling for.

3174
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:15,440

 

3175
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,750

I don't see how anyone can be risk on in

3176
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:17,760
I don't see how anyone can be risk on in
 

3177
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,590
I don't see how anyone can be risk on in
this market right now. It is a

3178
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:19,600
this market right now. It is a
 

3179
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,350
this market right now. It is a
psychopath move, but

3180
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:23,360
psychopath move, but
 

3181
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,870
psychopath move, but
we all know like if they're going to

3182
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:24,880
we all know like if they're going to
 

3183
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,270
we all know like if they're going to
build it out, it takes a while. I've

3184
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:27,280
build it out, it takes a while. I've
 

3185
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,030
build it out, it takes a while. I've
talked about it numerous times. You

3186
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:29,040
talked about it numerous times. You
 

3187
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:37,830
talked about it numerous times. You
can't be early.

3188
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:37,840

 

3189
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,189

So, we're just slap bang in the middle

3190
01:18:39,189 --> 01:18:39,199
So, we're just slap bang in the middle
 

3191
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:41,590
So, we're just slap bang in the middle
of yesterday's range.

3192
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:41,600
of yesterday's range.
 

3193
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,990
of yesterday's range.
Oh, don't want to do that. How do I get

3194
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:44,000
Oh, don't want to do that. How do I get
 

3195
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,990
Oh, don't want to do that. How do I get
out of that?

3196
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:48,000

 

3197
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,510

There we go.

3198
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:51,520

 

3199
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,149

All right, finding value. [sighs]

3200
01:18:54,149 --> 01:18:54,159
All right, finding value. [sighs]
 

3201
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:56,149
All right, finding value. [sighs]
So, fail breakout beneath yesterday's

3202
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:56,159
So, fail breakout beneath yesterday's
 

3203
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:58,390
So, fail breakout beneath yesterday's
value. There's the trap play back

3204
01:18:58,390 --> 01:18:58,400
value. There's the trap play back
 

3205
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,990
value. There's the trap play back
through to a previous day's point of

3206
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:00,000
through to a previous day's point of
 

3207
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,070
through to a previous day's point of
control. Buyers want to get up here.

3208
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:02,080
control. Buyers want to get up here.
 

3209
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,910
control. Buyers want to get up here.
Sellers want to get back down here. Here

3210
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:03,920
Sellers want to get back down here. Here
 

3211
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:07,669
Sellers want to get back down here. Here
is a level of the most traded area. This

3212
01:19:07,669 --> 01:19:07,679
is a level of the most traded area. This
 

3213
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:09,430
is a level of the most traded area. This
is fair value. You don't want to trade

3214
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:09,440
is fair value. You don't want to trade
 

3215
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,030
is fair value. You don't want to trade
at fair value because this is what

3216
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:11,040
at fair value because this is what
 

3217
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,669
at fair value because this is what
happens. You don't really want to trade

3218
01:19:13,669 --> 01:19:13,679
happens. You don't really want to trade
 

3219
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:16,149
happens. You don't really want to trade
there. Market needs to move away. This

3220
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:16,159
there. Market needs to move away. This
 

3221
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:18,390
there. Market needs to move away. This
is market imbalance. You don't want to

3222
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:18,400
is market imbalance. You don't want to
 

3223
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,990
is market imbalance. You don't want to
trade in balance. Not in these ranges.

3224
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:20,000
trade in balance. Not in these ranges.
 

3225
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,830
trade in balance. Not in these ranges.
You want to trade out of balance. Out of

01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:21,840
You want to trade out of balance. Out of
 

3227
01:19:21,840 --> 01:20:48,630
You want to trade out of balance. Out of
balance.

3229
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:52,229

Oh my god. Market. [\h__\h] me. What are you

01:20:59,669 --> 01:20:59,679

 

3233
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:02,070

I'm going to give this a couple more

3234
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:02,080
I'm going to give this a couple more

01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,669
I'm going to give this a couple more
minutes and then I'm getting off. I'm

3239
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:18,390
definitely not going to sit here any
longer and watch this slop.

3240
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:18,400

 

3241
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,149

It's just a snoozefest. You can't trade

3242
01:21:20,149 --> 01:21:20,159
It's just a snoozefest. You can't trade
 

3243
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:21,830
It's just a snoozefest. You can't trade
this guys. We can't trade around these

3244
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:21,840
this guys. We can't trade around these
 

3245
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,830
this guys. We can't trade around these
areas. These are where we can't trade.

3246

It would struggle if it was doing this,
 

3333

Well, you've got to you've got to well,

3352
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:00,480
Well, you've got to you've got to well,
 

3353
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,629
Well, you've got to you've got to well,
two things. Firstly, don't say something

3354
01:24:02,629 --> 01:24:02,639
two things. Firstly, don't say something
 

3355
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:04,229
two things. Firstly, don't say something
then in chat if you don't know what

3356
01:24:04,229 --> 01:24:04,239
then in chat if you don't know what
 

3357
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:06,149
then in chat if you don't know what
you're talking about in all honesty

3358
01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:06,159
you're talking about in all honesty
 

3359
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:07,830
you're talking about in all honesty
because you can get other people caught.

3360
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:07,840
because you can get other people caught.
 

3361
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,910
because you can get other people caught.
Secondly, it's pretty clear, isn't it?

3362
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:09,920
Secondly, it's pretty clear, isn't it?
 

3363
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,750
Secondly, it's pretty clear, isn't it?
If you've got VW up on your chart, if

3364
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:11,760
If you've got VW up on your chart, if
 

3365
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,470
If you've got VW up on your chart, if
you're over it, if you're over it, then

3366
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:14,480
you're over it, if you're over it, then
 

3367
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,990
you're over it, if you're over it, then
you're using it as support. If you're

3368
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:16,000
you're using it as support. If you're
 

3369
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,669
you're using it as support. If you're
under it, then you're using it as

3370
01:24:17,669 --> 01:24:17,679
under it, then you're using it as
 

3371
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:19,669
under it, then you're using it as
resistance. So if you're over it, then

3372
01:24:19,669 --> 01:24:19,679
resistance. So if you're over it, then
 

3373
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:22,229
resistance. So if you're over it, then
the average participant in the market

3374
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:22,239
the average participant in the market
 

3375
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:24,870
the average participant in the market
based on volume is a buyer and they're

3376
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:24,880
based on volume is a buyer and they're
 

3377
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,709
based on volume is a buyer and they're
comfortable. When we're under it means

3378
01:24:26,709 --> 01:24:26,719
comfortable. When we're under it means
 

3379
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:28,470
comfortable. When we're under it means
the average participant based in the

3380
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:28,480
the average participant based in the
 

3381
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,030
the average participant based in the
market based on volume, sellers would be

3382
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:31,040
market based on volume, sellers would be
 

3383
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,110
market based on volume, sellers would be
in control because remember VWAP doesn't

3384
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:33,120
in control because remember VWAP doesn't
 

3385
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,510
in control because remember VWAP doesn't
identify anything based on anything else

3386
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:35,520
identify anything based on anything else
 

3387
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,189
identify anything based on anything else
other than volume, right? It doesn't

3388
01:24:37,189 --> 01:24:37,199
other than volume, right? It doesn't
 

3389
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:38,470
other than volume, right? It doesn't
know who's a buyer and seller. So if

3390
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:38,480
know who's a buyer and seller. So if
 

3391
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,910
know who's a buyer and seller. So if
you're going to use it sentiment all the

3392
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:39,920
you're going to use it sentiment all the
 

3393
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,709
you're going to use it sentiment all the
time, we're over New York VWAP. Then

3394
01:24:42,709 --> 01:24:42,719
time, we're over New York VWAP. Then
 

3395
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:44,709
time, we're over New York VWAP. Then
anyone off the open who's a buyer is

3396
01:24:44,709 --> 01:24:44,719

01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:28,400
is where he says, "Hey, I don't play
 

3435
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,790
is where he says, "Hey, I don't play
rotations. I'm not interested." You hear

interested in playing inside balance
 

3441
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,709
interested in playing inside balance
ranges. It's too dangerous in this

3442
01:25:36,709 --> 01:25:36,719
ranges. It's too dangerous in this
 

3443
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:39,510
ranges. It's too dangerous in this
market. I can't play a balance range in

it was like the first day here, sure,
 

3449
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:47,830
it was like the first day here, sure,
this is week four in this same place.

3450
01:25:47,830 --> 01:25:47,840
this is week four in this same place.
 

3451
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,990

01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:50,000
We leave balance, I'll be aggressive
 

3453
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:58,470

with it. We've got to leave balance.

3454
01:25:58,470 --> 01:25:58,480

 

3455
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:02,149

Remember 30s is the level.

3456
01:26:02,149 --> 01:26:02,159
Remember 30s is the level.
 

3457
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:04,149
Remember 30s is the level.
Are they still there at 30? Just zooming

3458
01:26:04,149 --> 01:26:04,159
Are they still there at 30? Just zooming
 

3459
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:07,189
Are they still there at 30? Just zooming
down. And it is still offside delta 35s.

3460
01:26:07,189 --> 01:26:07,199
down. And it is still offside delta 35s.
 

3461
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:09,350
down. And it is still offside delta 35s.
That's the level. 35 and 30s is the

3462
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:09,360
That's the level. 35 and 30s is the
 

3463
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,910
That's the level. 35 and 30s is the
level. Sellers need to take control

3464
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:11,920
level. Sellers need to take control
 

3465
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,830
level. Sellers need to take control
beneath that. Beneath that.

3466
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:15,840
beneath that. Beneath that.
 

3467
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,310
beneath that. Beneath that.

stupid because we all know what's
 

3471
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,870
stupid because we all know what's
happening tomorrow.

3472
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:22,880
happening tomorrow.
 

3473
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,510
happening tomorrow.
We priced it in quart

3474
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:25,520
We priced it in quart
 

3475
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:30,629

Jack, you keep calling for this big
short, but you were big short here

3480
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:33,520
short, but you were big short here
 

3481
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,189
short, but you were big short here
before. You've taken draw down all the

3482
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:35,199
before. You've taken draw down all the
 

3483
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:37,030
before. You've taken draw down all the
way to 55s and we're just back to the

way to 55s and we're just back to the
 

3485
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,430
way to 55s and we're just back to the
same level. Nothing's changed, my

3486
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:39,440
same level. Nothing's changed, my
 

3487
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:44,310
same level. Nothing's changed, my
friend. I'm afraid until it changes.

3491
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,629

Can they get under 35s? That's the key.

3492
01:26:58,629 --> 01:26:58,639
Can they get under 35s? That's the key.
 

3493
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:00,709
Can they get under 35s? That's the key.

35s to 30s and then you got to get under
 

3505
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:23,750
35s to 30s and then you got to get under
18. So why I'm saying like you're just

3506
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:23,760
18. So why I'm saying like you're just
 

3507
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,510
18. So why I'm saying like you're just
in a rotation. There's no big move here.

3508
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:27,520
in a rotation. There's no big move here.
 

3509
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,270
in a rotation. There's no big move here.
So, I ignored your thing earlier like

3510
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:29,280
So, I ignored your thing earlier like
 

3511
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,990
So, I ignored your thing earlier like

short hair. You you you you ate a [\h__\h]
 

3513
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,350
short hair. You you you you ate a [\h__\h]
ton of draw down. I just didn't want to

3514
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:33,360
ton of draw down. I just didn't want to
 

3515
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,709
ton of draw down. I just didn't want to
even talk about it because you do the

3516
01:27:34,709 --> 01:27:34,719
even talk about it because you do the
 

3517
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:49,110
even talk about it because you do the
same thing every day.

3518
01:27:49,110 --> 01:27:49,120

 

3519
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,950

So, like we talked, buyers keep getting

3520
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:50,960
So, like we talked, buyers keep getting
 

3521
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:53,270
So, like we talked, buyers keep getting
stuck over 60, sellers are stuck under

3522
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:53,280
stuck over 60, sellers are stuck under
 

3523
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:56,629
stuck over 60, sellers are stuck under
30s. That's That's it. 30 point range.

3524
01:27:56,629 --> 01:27:56,639
30s. That's That's it. 30 point range.
 

3525
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:01,910
30s. That's That's it. 30 point range.
Nothing's changed. Nothing has changed.

3526
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:01,920

 

3527
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,350

You're still holding V up. You're still

3528
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:03,360

You're still holding V up. You're still
holding point of control

3530
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:06,239
holding point of control
 

3531
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,790
holding point of control
till they let go of that.

3532
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:08,800
till they let go of that.
 

3533
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,189
till they let go of that.
You're trying to fade a slow grind,

3534
01:28:11,189 --> 01:28:11,199
You're trying to fade a slow grind,
 

3535
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:13,270
You're trying to fade a slow grind,
which is dangerous. Or just let volume

3536
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:13,280
which is dangerous. Or just let volume
 

3537
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,430
which is dangerous. Or just let volume
come in.

3538
01:28:15,430 --> 01:28:15,440
come in.
 

3539
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,790
come in.
At least that's what I would do. I just

3540
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:16,800
At least that's what I would do. I just
 

3541
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,390
At least that's what I would do. I just
wait and let someone come in and take

3542
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:18,400
wait and let someone come in and take
 

3543
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:33,350
wait and let someone come in and take
control of the market.

3544
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:33,360

 

3545
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:39,189

say ES into PDC becomes key.

3546
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:39,199

 

3547
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:41,510

If they do a gamma rotation to 82 on

3548
01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:41,520
If they do a gamma rotation to 82 on
 

3549
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:42,950
If they do a gamma rotation to 82 on
spy, it would be it would be fun. It

3550

spy, it would be it would be fun. It
 

3551
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,310
spy, it would be it would be fun. It
would drag the market, but it just

3552
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:44,320
would drag the market, but it just
 

3553
01:28:44,320 --> 01:29:04,950
would drag the market, but it just
depends what their intentions are.

3554

3555
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,950

3556
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:06,960
still between these 60s and 30s. No
 

3557
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,189
still between these 60s and 30s. No
change. Buyers try going to try and take

3558
01:29:09,189 --> 01:29:09,199
change. Buyers try going to try and take
 

3559
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:11,830
change. Buyers try going to try and take
control here above 60s now. So they want

3560
01:29:11,830 --> 01:29:11,840
control here above 60s now. So they want
 

3561
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,990
control here above 60s now. So they want
to push for high day. That will let all

3562
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:14,000

3563
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,229
to push for high day. That will let all
the buyers out. And then again, you're

3564
01:29:16,229 --> 01:29:16,239
the buyers out. And then again, you're
 

3565
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:18,870
the buyers out. And then again, you're
seeing VWAP hold on the spiders. Soak,

3566
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:18,880
seeing VWAP hold on the spiders. Soak,
 

3567
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:21,750
seeing VWAP hold on the spiders. Soak,
soak, soak, soak, soak. But buyers have

3568
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:21,760
soak, soak, soak, soak. But buyers have
 

3569
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,750
soak, soak, soak, soak. But buyers have
been stuck over 60 today. But again,

3581
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:36,950

01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:23,990

Yeah, you've done one. Well, uh, Black

3706
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:24,000
Yeah, you've done one. Well, uh, Black
 

3707
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,430
Yeah, you've done one. Well, uh, Black
Widow, if you've done that, that's

3708
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:25,440
Widow, if you've done that, that's
 

3709
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,870
Widow, if you've done that, that's
that's I think that's all that's been

3710
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:26,880
that's I think that's all that's been
 

3711
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,030
that's I think that's all that's been
available. Unless the only trade the

3712
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:29,040
available. Unless the only trade the
 

3713
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:32,149
available. Unless the only trade the
other side, I'd say, is, you know, along

3714
01:32:32,149 --> 01:32:32,159
other side, I'd say, is, you know, along
 

3715
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:33,430
other side, I'd say, is, you know, along
here, you'd have to risk that,

3716
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:33,440
here, you'd have to risk that,
 

3717
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,590
here, you'd have to risk that,
unfortunately, due to structure, and it

3718
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:35,600
unfortunately, due to structure, and it
 

3719
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,390
unfortunately, due to structure, and it
would be what do we talk about? TP1 in

3720
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:38,400
would be what do we talk about? TP1 in
 

3721
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,110
would be what do we talk about? TP1 in
here, TP2 up here. Unless you were long

3722
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:41,120
here, TP2 up here. Unless you were long
 

3723
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,110
here, TP2 up here. Unless you were long
here. So, I think the only trades are

3724
01:32:43,110 --> 01:32:43,120
here. So, I think the only trades are
 

3725
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:45,669
here. So, I think the only trades are
like that fail and break down and that

3726
01:32:45,669 --> 01:32:45,679
like that fail and break down and that
 

3727
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:47,189
like that fail and break down and that
grind higher. And I think since then

3728
01:32:47,189 --> 01:32:47,199
grind higher. And I think since then
 

3729
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:55,750
grind higher. And I think since then
there's been nothing to do.

3730
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:55,760

 

3731
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,750

They're probably going to look for

3732
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:57,760
They're probably going to look for
 

3733
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:59,590
They're probably going to look for
value, aren't they? Right? Because

3734
01:32:59,590 --> 01:32:59,600
value, aren't they? Right? Because
 

3735
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,270
value, aren't they? Right? Because
that's yesterday's value. Look below and

3736
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:01,280
that's yesterday's value. Look below and
 

3737
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,550
that's yesterday's value. Look below and
fail. They're probably going to try and

3738
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:02,560
fail. They're probably going to try and
 

3739
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,470
fail. They're probably going to try and
trade up to yesterday's value. And if

3740
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:04,480
trade up to yesterday's value. And if
 

3741
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:05,990
trade up to yesterday's value. And if
they can try and get GlobeEx out the

3742
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:06,000
they can try and get GlobeEx out the
 

3743
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,189
they can try and get GlobeEx out the
way, they will. Like if they get

3744
01:33:07,189 --> 01:33:07,199
way, they will. Like if they get
 

3745
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:10,390
way, they will. Like if they get
acceptance over value,

3746
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:10,400
acceptance over value,
 

3747
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:13,990
acceptance over value,
then I'd say London at 713. Basically

3748
01:33:13,990 --> 01:33:14,000
then I'd say London at 713. Basically
 

3749
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:39,299
then I'd say London at 713. Basically
that red block and the top side 730.

3750
01:33:39,299 --> 01:33:39,309

those uh 630s I kept talking about were.

3758
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:03,760
those uh 630s I kept talking about were.
 

3759
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,430
those uh 630s I kept talking about were.
I kept telling you there's someone

3760
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:05,440
I kept telling you there's someone
 

3761
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:07,830
I kept telling you there's someone
absorbing. Go back and rewind this when

3762
01:34:07,830 --> 01:34:07,840
absorbing. Go back and rewind this when
 

3763
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,270
absorbing. Go back and rewind this when
I'm done. When we were here, I kept

3764
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:09,280
I'm done. When we were here, I kept
 

3765
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:12,149
I'm done. When we were here, I kept
telling you they keep trying to sell 630

3766
01:34:12,149 --> 01:34:12,159
telling you they keep trying to sell 630
 

3767
01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:14,629
telling you they keep trying to sell 630
to 600 and we're not moving lower. All

3768
01:34:14,629 --> 01:34:14,639
to 600 and we're not moving lower. All
 

3769
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:16,550
to 600 and we're not moving lower. All
right, we had negative delta here. They

3770
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:16,560
right, we had negative delta here. They
 

3771
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,070
right, we had negative delta here. They
were trying to shove us down and I kept

3772
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:18,080
were trying to shove us down and I kept
 

3773
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,750
were trying to shove us down and I kept
saying there's someone absorbing and

3774
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:19,760
saying there's someone absorbing and
 

3775
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,430
saying there's someone absorbing and
then they moved up to 630 and they

3776
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:21,440
then they moved up to 630 and they
 

3777
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,870
then they moved up to 630 and they
started absorbing here and you're all

3778
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:22,880
started absorbing here and you're all
 

3779
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,390
started absorbing here and you're all
shorting into him. Well, not all of you,

3780
01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:24,400
shorting into him. Well, not all of you,
 

3781
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,310
shorting into him. Well, not all of you,
but some of you keep shorting into him.

3782
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:26,320
but some of you keep shorting into him.
 

3783
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,310
but some of you keep shorting into him.
He's a bigger player than you. Right? If

3784
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:28,320
He's a bigger player than you. Right? If
 

3785
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,830
He's a bigger player than you. Right? If
he's got his exit here, where will the

3786
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:29,840
he's got his exit here, where will the
 

3787
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,910
he's got his exit here, where will the
short be? Right under here. That's going

3788
01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:31,920
short be? Right under here. That's going
 

3789
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,070
short be? Right under here. That's going
to be the safest entry once he is out

3790
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:34,080
to be the safest entry once he is out
 

3791
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:37,030
to be the safest entry once he is out
the way. But there is a big boy who's

3792
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:37,040
the way. But there is a big boy who's
 

3793
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,550
the way. But there is a big boy who's
just absorbing. Like I said, he kept

3794
01:34:38,550 --> 01:34:38,560
just absorbing. Like I said, he kept
 

3795
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,390
just absorbing. Like I said, he kept
flashing 100 lot, 100 lot, 100 lot, 100

3796
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:40,400
flashing 100 lot, 100 lot, 100 lot, 100

I said to you, go back and rewind it.

3800
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:44,320
I said to you, go back and rewind it.
 

3801
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,790
I said to you, go back and rewind it.
He's probably a buyer trying to attract

3802
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:46,800
He's probably a buyer trying to attract
 

3803
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,310
He's probably a buyer trying to attract
the market to go higher. If you see

3804
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:48,320
the market to go higher. If you see
 

3805
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,990
the market to go higher. If you see
someone flashing and removing, flashing

3806
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:50,000
someone flashing and removing, flashing

they want it to come up there, which

3810
01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:53,040
they want it to come up there, which
 

3811
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:54,470
they want it to come up there, which
means what? Are they likely to be a

01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:54,480
means what? Are they likely to be a
 

3813
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,790
means what? Are they likely to be a
short seller? No. They're likely to be a

3814
01:34:56,790 --> 01:34:56,800
short seller? No. They're likely to be a
 

3815
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,870
short seller? No. They're likely to be a
buyer attracting price higher, removing

3816
01:34:58,870 --> 01:34:58,880
buyer attracting price higher, removing
 

3817
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:00,629
buyer attracting price higher, removing
their offer so it skips up. That's what

3818
01:35:00,629 --> 01:35:00,639
their offer so it skips up. That's what
 

3819
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:02,709
their offer so it skips up. That's what
they try and do. It's naughty, naughty,

3820
01:35:02,709 --> 01:35:02,719
they try and do. It's naughty, naughty,
 

3821
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:04,229
they try and do. It's naughty, naughty,
naughty games, but that is the game that

3822
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:04,239
naughty games, but that is the game that
 

3823
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:07,510
naughty games, but that is the game that
they play.

3824
01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:07,520

 

3825
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,350

Right, we just had a big lot come in.

3826
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:09,360
Right, we just had a big lot come in.
 

3827
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,430
Right, we just had a big lot come in.
500 lot just came in and sold here at

3828
01:35:11,430 --> 01:35:11,440
500 lot just came in and sold here at
 

3829
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,830
500 lot just came in and sold here at
63s.

3830
01:35:13,830 --> 01:35:13,840
63s.
 

3831
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,830
63s.
And if he gets absorbed again cuz he

3832
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:15,840
And if he gets absorbed again cuz he
 

3833
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,990
And if he gets absorbed again cuz he
just sold at the market, then again,

3834
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:18,000
just sold at the market, then again,
 

3835
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,510
just sold at the market, then again,
we're going to have short sellers stuck

3836
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:19,520
we're going to have short sellers stuck
 

3837
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,030
we're going to have short sellers stuck
higher. So, we need to start moving

3838
01:35:21,030 --> 01:35:21,040
higher. So, we need to start moving
 

3839
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,910
higher. So, we need to start moving
under 63s now to see follow through. And

3840
01:35:23,910 --> 01:35:23,920
under 63s now to see follow through. And
 

3841
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,830
under 63s now to see follow through. And
then it's the same levels, folks. It's

3842
01:35:25,830 --> 01:35:25,840
then it's the same levels, folks. It's
 

3843
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:35,830
then it's the same levels, folks. It's
30s and 600s.

3844
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:35,840

 

3845
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,510

Nice. Full forward. Yeah, good. Good

work. I forgot that you took that off
 

3849
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:41,430
work. I forgot that you took that off
the bottoms. Nice.

3850
01:35:41,430 --> 01:35:41,440
the bottoms. Nice.
 

3851
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,510
the bottoms. Nice.
So, sellers are starting to come in here

3852

3855
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,790
at 60. So, they're starting to take
control. 30s is still the level. In my

3856
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:46,800
control. 30s is still the level. In my
 

3857
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,870
control. 30s is still the level. In my
opinion, 30s is the big big level. They

3858
01:35:48,870 --> 01:35:48,880
opinion, 30s is the big big level. They
 

3859
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,390
opinion, 30s is the big big level. They
start closing on the 30s, we can think

3860
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:50,400
start closing on the 30s, we can think
 

3861
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:52,709
start closing on the 30s, we can think
about 600 and then lower a day. Those

3862
01:35:52,709 --> 01:35:52,719
about 600 and then lower a day. Those
 

3863
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:54,950
about 600 and then lower a day. Those
are the big levels in my opinion. My

3864
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:54,960
are the big levels in my opinion. My
 

3865
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,830
are the big levels in my opinion. My
personal humble opinion is VWAP. So, can

3866
01:35:57,830 --> 01:35:57,840
personal humble opinion is VWAP. So, can
 

3867
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,990
personal humble opinion is VWAP. So, can
we trade under point of control here?

3868
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:00,000
we trade under point of control here?
 

3869
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,750
we trade under point of control here?
This is where the big delta is now at

3870
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:01,760
This is where the big delta is now at
 

3871
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:05,110
This is where the big delta is now at
40. It's standing out and 30. So, you

3872
01:36:05,110 --> 01:36:05,120
40. It's standing out and 30. So, you
 

3873
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,189
40. It's standing out and 30. So, you
can see back down to that level 30 and

3874
01:36:07,189 --> 01:36:07,199
can see back down to that level 30 and
 

3875
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:09,030
can see back down to that level 30 and
40 is this huge huge level that I keep

3876
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:09,040
40 is this huge huge level that I keep
 

3877
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:10,550
40 is this huge huge level that I keep
talking about where they keep absorbing

3878
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:10,560
talking about where they keep absorbing
 

3879
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,629
talking about where they keep absorbing
the tape point of control. This red

3880
01:36:12,629 --> 01:36:12,639
the tape point of control. This red
 

3881
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:14,950
the tape point of control. This red
line, right? This is where they keep

3882
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:14,960
line, right? This is where they keep
 

3883
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,790
line, right? This is where they keep
absorbing. If he gets out the way and we

3884
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:16,800
absorbing. If he gets out the way and we
 

3885
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,030
absorbing. If he gets out the way and we
get closures or we can trade. If he gets

3886
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:19,040
get closures or we can trade. If he gets
 

3887
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:20,709
get closures or we can trade. If he gets
out the way, we trade to 600. If they

3888
01:36:20,709 --> 01:36:20,719
out the way, we trade to 600. If they
 

3889
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:22,229
out the way, we trade to 600. If they
get out of the way, we'll probably trade

3890
01:36:22,229 --> 01:36:22,239
get out of the way, we'll probably trade
 

3891
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:23,669
get out of the way, we'll probably trade
back down to low of day. If they keep

3892
01:36:23,669 --> 01:36:23,679
back down to low of day. If they keep
 

3893
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:25,030
back down to low of day. If they keep
absorbing here, we're going straight

3894
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:25,040
absorbing here, we're going straight
 

3895
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:32,229
absorbing here, we're going straight
back up.

3896
01:36:32,229 --> 01:36:32,239

 

3897
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:35,189

Big selling coming in here.

3898
01:36:35,189 --> 01:36:35,199
Big selling coming in here.
 

3899
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:36,550
Big selling coming in here.
They're trying to force it down. They

3900
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:36,560
They're trying to force it down. They
 

3901
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,310
They're trying to force it down. They
want to get back under 30. They're

3902
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:38,320
want to get back under 30. They're
 

3903
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:41,110
want to get back under 30. They're
desperate. ES back into PDC here. So,

3904
01:36:41,110 --> 01:36:41,120
desperate. ES back into PDC here. So,
 

3905
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:43,350
desperate. ES back into PDC here. So,
this is sentiment now for the day. We're

3906
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:43,360
this is sentiment now for the day. We're
 

3907
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,990
this is sentiment now for the day. We're
at close price from uh from Monday for

3908
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:46,000
at close price from uh from Monday for
 

3909
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,910
at close price from uh from Monday for
the ES. It just failed again. SPY

3910
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:49,920
the ES. It just failed again. SPY
 

3911
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,830
the ES. It just failed again. SPY
couldn't get back up to the 85. So, if

3912
01:36:51,830 --> 01:36:51,840
couldn't get back up to the 85. So, if
 

3913
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:54,070
couldn't get back up to the 85. So, if
they fail PDC, there's a move back down

3914
01:36:54,070 --> 01:36:54,080
they fail PDC, there's a move back down
 

3915
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:57,030
they fail PDC, there's a move back down
to 82s in the SPY. just based on gamma.

3916
01:36:57,030 --> 01:36:57,040
to 82s in the SPY. just based on gamma.
 

3917
01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:11,109
to 82s in the SPY. just based on gamma.
Big selling now starting to come in.

3918
01:37:11,109 --> 01:37:11,119

 

3919
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:13,669

30 is still the level.

3920
01:37:13,669 --> 01:37:13,679
30 is still the level.
 

3921
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:17,350
30 is still the level.
35s really 35s is where the big buyer

3922
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:17,360
35s really 35s is where the big buyer
 

3923
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:18,870
35s really 35s is where the big buyer
has been. That's his average price where

3924
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:18,880
has been. That's his average price where
 

3925
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,790
has been. That's his average price where
he keeps absorbing. You're going to need

3926
01:37:20,790 --> 01:37:20,800
he keeps absorbing. You're going to need
 

3927
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,070
he keeps absorbing. You're going to need
to see a lower high here if you're

3928
01:37:22,070 --> 01:37:22,080
to see a lower high here if you're
 

3929
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:25,510
to see a lower high here if you're
adamant on shorting it. and uh

3930
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:25,520
adamant on shorting it. and uh
 

3931
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,430
adamant on shorting it. and uh
you've got an imbalance [clears throat]

3932
01:37:27,430 --> 01:37:27,440
you've got an imbalance [clears throat]
 

3933
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,350
you've got an imbalance [clears throat]
from sort of 55 to 60. So you wouldn't

3934
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:29,360
from sort of 55 to 60. So you wouldn't
 

3935
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:30,870
from sort of 55 to 60. So you wouldn't
want them if but bulls reclaim that

3936
01:37:30,870 --> 01:37:30,880
want them if but bulls reclaim that
 

3937
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,830
want them if but bulls reclaim that
you're in trouble. You wouldn't really

3938
01:37:31,830 --> 01:37:31,840
you're in trouble. You wouldn't really
 

3939
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,910
you're in trouble. You wouldn't really
want that to happen.

3940
01:37:33,910 --> 01:37:33,920
want that to happen.
 

3941
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:37,109
want that to happen.
You're adamant on selling this back down

3942
01:37:37,109 --> 01:37:37,119
You're adamant on selling this back down
 

3943
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:39,590
You're adamant on selling this back down
again. I would maintain 30s is big big

3944
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:39,600
again. I would maintain 30s is big big
 

3945
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:44,950
again. I would maintain 30s is big big
big big level is big. [snorts]

3946
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:44,960
big big level is big. [snorts]
 

3947
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,470
big big level is big. [snorts]
are starting to see backside. But you

3948
01:37:46,470 --> 01:37:46,480
are starting to see backside. But you
 

3949
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:49,030
are starting to see backside. But you
need this to set a lower high here. And

3950
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:49,040
need this to set a lower high here. And
 

3951
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,629
need this to set a lower high here. And
really, you need to get under this and

3952
01:37:50,629 --> 01:37:50,639
really, you need to get under this and
 

3953
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:53,189
really, you need to get under this and
this to see that otherwise

3954
01:37:53,189 --> 01:37:53,199
this to see that otherwise
 

3955
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:54,550
this to see that otherwise
this is their level which they keep

3956
01:37:54,550 --> 01:37:54,560
this is their level which they keep
 

3957
01:37:54,560 --> 01:38:00,950
this is their level which they keep
absorbing all day.

3958
01:38:00,950 --> 01:38:00,960

 

3959
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:13,030

Back to the imbalance 55 to 60s.

3960
01:38:13,030 --> 01:38:13,040

 

3961
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,790

If they get back through 65, that's

3962
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:14,800
If they get back through 65, that's
 

3963
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,510
If they get back through 65, that's
where you have that 524 lot come in. If

3964
01:38:17,510 --> 01:38:17,520
where you have that 524 lot come in. If
 

3965
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,510
where you have that 524 lot come in. If
they get back above 65, you might be

3966
01:38:19,510 --> 01:38:19,520
they get back above 65, you might be
 

3967
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,790
they get back above 65, you might be
forced to cover and you'll see a

3968
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:20,800
forced to cover and you'll see a
 

3969
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,990
forced to cover and you'll see a
squeeze. So, just to give you an idea of

3970
01:38:23,990 --> 01:38:24,000
squeeze. So, just to give you an idea of
 

3971
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:38,229
squeeze. So, just to give you an idea of
what's going on.

3972
01:38:38,229 --> 01:38:38,239

 

3973
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:39,990

Here's the 65. This is where the big

3974
01:38:39,990 --> 01:38:40,000
Here's the 65. This is where the big
 

3975
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,830
Here's the 65. This is where the big
seller came in. If he doesn't resell

3976
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:41,840
seller came in. If he doesn't resell
 

3977
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,550
seller came in. If he doesn't resell
this, you are open to a squeeze here.

3978
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:44,560
this, you are open to a squeeze here.
 

3979
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,390
this, you are open to a squeeze here.
This is where he came in with size and

3980
01:38:46,390 --> 01:38:46,400
This is where he came in with size and
 

3981
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,669
This is where he came in with size and
he's now out of the money.

3982
01:38:49,669 --> 01:38:49,679
he's now out of the money.
 

3983
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:51,750
he's now out of the money.
And guess what? Did we get a close under

3984
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:51,760
And guess what? Did we get a close under
 

3985
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,910
And guess what? Did we get a close under
30? No,

3986
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:53,920
30? No,
 

3987
01:38:53,920 --> 01:39:10,070
30? No,
we did not.

3988
01:39:10,070 --> 01:39:10,080

 

3989
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,070

rotations all the way back to 700. They

3990
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:12,080
rotations all the way back to 700. They
 

3991
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,750
rotations all the way back to 700. They
haven't finished testing previous day

3992
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:13,760
haven't finished testing previous day
 

3993
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,430
haven't finished testing previous day
value area high by the looks of it. So,

3994
01:39:15,430 --> 01:39:15,440
value area high by the looks of it. So,
 

3995
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:19,750
value area high by the looks of it. So,
they're going to come back for it.

3996
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:19,760

 

3997
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:22,870

Yes. Again, held PDC.

4001
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:28,790

You can buy 635. I'm not stopping you

4002
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:28,800
You can buy 635. I'm not stopping you
 

4003
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:32,070
You can buy 635. I'm not stopping you

01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:35,040
want, but I'm not trading inside
 

4007
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,629
want, but I'm not trading inside
yesterday's value. I've made that

4008
01:39:36,629 --> 01:39:36,639
yesterday's value. I've made that
 

4009
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:39,669
yesterday's value. I've made that
crystal clear.

4010
01:39:39,669 --> 01:39:39,679
crystal clear.
 

4011
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:41,030
crystal clear.
And I'm definitely not trading the

4012
01:39:41,030 --> 01:39:41,040
And I'm definitely not trading the
 

4013
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:45,109
And I'm definitely not trading the
midpoint.

4014
01:39:45,109 --> 01:39:45,119

 

4015
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:47,109

Here's yesterday's value. You want to

4016
01:39:47,109 --> 01:39:47,119
Here's yesterday's value. You want to

Here's yesterday's value. You want to

trade that midpoint, go ahead. I'm not
 

4021
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:52,550
trade that midpoint, go ahead. I'm not
trading it. I've made it absolutely

4022
01:39:52,550 --> 01:39:52,560
trading it. I've made it absolutely
 

4023
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:55,189
trading it. I've made it absolutely
clear what I'm looking for today.

4024
01:39:55,189 --> 01:39:55,199
clear what I'm looking for today.
 

4025
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:57,430
clear what I'm looking for today.
I will stick to my thesis. You guys

4026
01:39:57,430 --> 01:39:57,440
I will stick to my thesis. You guys
 

4027
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,590
I will stick to my thesis. You guys
learn to trade your setups. I've given

4028
01:39:59,590 --> 01:39:59,600
learn to trade your setups. I've given
 

4029
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,270
learn to trade your setups. I've given
you the levels. You can use them how you

4030
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:01,280
you the levels. You can use them how you
 

4031
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:16,550
you the levels. You can use them how you
see fit.

4032
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:16,560

 

4033
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:21,750

Who's this guy? Where's his stuff again?

4034
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:21,760

 

4035
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:30,950

664 665

4036
01:40:30,950 --> 01:40:30,960

 

4037
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:38,070

trading back down towards lower days.

4038
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:38,080

 

4039
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:39,669

I I just don't understand. I don't I

4040
01:40:39,669 --> 01:40:39,679
I I just don't understand. I don't I
 

4041
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:40,870
I I just don't understand. I don't I
don't look at this and think, "Oh, I

4042
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:40,880
don't look at this and think, "Oh, I
 

4043
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:43,350
don't look at this and think, "Oh, I
can't wait to trade it." So, it's just

4044
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:43,360
can't wait to trade it." So, it's just
 

4045
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:45,350
can't wait to trade it." So, it's just
amazing that people want to put a risk

4046
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:45,360
amazing that people want to put a risk
 

4047
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,270
amazing that people want to put a risk
on or or do something in this market.

4048
01:40:47,270 --> 01:40:47,280
on or or do something in this market.
 

4049
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,790
on or or do something in this market.
Like,

4050
01:40:48,790 --> 01:40:48,800
Like,
 

4051
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,229
Like,
I don't look at this and think, "Well,

4052
01:40:50,229 --> 01:40:50,239
I don't look at this and think, "Well,
 

4053
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:53,990
I don't look at this and think, "Well,
this is a great market to trade."

4054
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:54,000
this is a great market to trade."
 

4055
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,109
this is a great market to trade."
I don't understand. Like why would you

4056
01:40:57,109 --> 01:40:57,119
I don't understand. Like why would you
 

4057
01:40:57,119 --> 01:40:59,030
I don't understand. Like why would you
want to trade

4058
01:40:59,030 --> 01:40:59,040
want to trade
 

4059
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:02,470
want to trade
inside this?

4060
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:02,480
inside this?
 

4061
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:05,830
inside this?
Inside this

4062
01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:05,840
Inside this
 

4063
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:10,390
Inside this
inside this

4064
01:41:10,390 --> 01:41:10,400

 

4065
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,390

just should I keep going? Do you get the

4066
01:41:12,390 --> 01:41:12,400
just should I keep going? Do you get the
 

4067
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:22,310
just should I keep going? Do you get the
point? Inside this.

4068
01:41:22,310 --> 01:41:22,320

 

4069
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:25,030

You get the point? Until we move outside

4070
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:25,040
You get the point? Until we move outside
 

4071
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,109
You get the point? Until we move outside
of this, you're going to see [\h__\h]

4072
01:41:27,109 --> 01:41:27,119
of this, you're going to see [\h__\h]
 

4073
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:29,109
of this, you're going to see [\h__\h]
action. It's tell it's already told you.

4074
01:41:29,109 --> 01:41:29,119
action. It's tell it's already told you.
 

4075
01:41:29,119 --> 01:41:31,590
action. It's tell it's already told you.
It's told you for four weeks, but some

4076
01:41:31,590 --> 01:41:31,600
It's told you for four weeks, but some
 

4077
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,590
It's told you for four weeks, but some
of you just can't help but clicking by

4078
01:41:33,590 --> 01:41:33,600
of you just can't help but clicking by
 

4079
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,109
of you just can't help but clicking by
the looks of it. Like, you have to be in

4080
01:41:35,109 --> 01:41:35,119
the looks of it. Like, you have to be in
 

4081
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:38,950
the looks of it. Like, you have to be in
a trade. It's

4082
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:38,960
a trade. It's
 

4083
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,030
a trade. It's
the best traders out there make money

4084
01:41:41,030 --> 01:41:41,040
the best traders out there make money
 

4085
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:43,350
the best traders out there make money
from when everything's lined up on their

4086
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:43,360
from when everything's lined up on their
 

4087
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:47,189
from when everything's lined up on their
side. You don't have that right now. So,

4088
01:41:47,189 --> 01:41:47,199
side. You don't have that right now. So,
 

4089
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:49,030
side. You don't have that right now. So,
I don't know. Unless you're like trading

4090
01:41:49,030 --> 01:41:49,040
I don't know. Unless you're like trading
 

4091
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:50,470
I don't know. Unless you're like trading
a little bit of range rotation for a

4092
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:50,480
a little bit of range rotation for a
 

4093
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:51,990
a little bit of range rotation for a
scalp, I don't see what you're looking

4094
01:41:51,990 --> 01:41:52,000
scalp, I don't see what you're looking
 

4095
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,070
scalp, I don't see what you're looking
at here, which is saying, "Trade me,

4096
01:41:54,070 --> 01:41:54,080
at here, which is saying, "Trade me,
 

4097
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:55,590
at here, which is saying, "Trade me,
trade me, trade me, trade me, trade me."

4098
01:41:55,590 --> 01:41:55,600
trade me, trade me, trade me, trade me."
 

4099
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:56,870
trade me, trade me, trade me, trade me."
There's nothing saying it. It's quite

4100
01:41:56,870 --> 01:41:56,880
There's nothing saying it. It's quite
 

4101
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,550
There's nothing saying it. It's quite
the opposite. This should be screaming

4102
01:41:58,550 --> 01:41:58,560
the opposite. This should be screaming
 

4103
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,149
the opposite. This should be screaming
at you. Don't trade me. Don't trade me.

4104
01:42:00,149 --> 01:42:00,159
at you. Don't trade me. Don't trade me.
 

4105
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:11,430
at you. Don't trade me. Don't trade me.
Don't trade me. Don't trade me.

4106
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:11,440

 

4107
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,350

Jack, why don't you be more patient when

4108
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:13,360
Jack, why don't you be more patient when
 

4109
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:16,229
Jack, why don't you be more patient when
you're front siding it? And do you think

4110
01:42:16,229 --> 01:42:16,239
you're front siding it? And do you think
 

4111
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:18,229
you're front siding it? And do you think
I don't trade when I'm not with you? You

4112
01:42:18,229 --> 01:42:18,239
I don't trade when I'm not with you? You
 

4113
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:22,470
I don't trade when I'm not with you? You
think I don't trade with my community?

4114
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:22,480

 

4115
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,070

Why don't you be more patient instead of

4116
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:24,080
Why don't you be more patient instead of
 

4117
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:26,229
Why don't you be more patient instead of
guessing and saying the big shorts

4118
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:26,239
guessing and saying the big shorts
 

4119
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:35,669
guessing and saying the big shorts
coming and then sitting in draw down?

4120
01:42:35,669 --> 01:42:35,679

 

4121
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:39,910

I'm not whining, Donnie.

4122
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:39,920

 

4123
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,750

This is going to get really easy. Got

4124
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:41,760
This is going to get really easy. Got
 

4125
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:47,910
This is going to get really easy. Got
[\h__\h] idiots on stream again.

4126
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:47,920

 

4127
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,109

There's a difference between knowing

4128
01:42:49,109 --> 01:42:49,119
There's a difference between knowing
 

4129
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:50,629
There's a difference between knowing
when to trade, knowing not winning a

4130
01:42:50,629 --> 01:42:50,639
when to trade, knowing not winning a
 

4131
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:55,910
when to trade, knowing not winning a
trade, and teaching you. And uh

4132
01:42:55,910 --> 01:42:55,920

 

4133
01:42:55,920 --> 01:43:09,430

and you are gone. See you.

4134
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:09,440

 

4135
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:10,629

Yeah, they've already gone. They're

4136
01:43:10,629 --> 01:43:10,639
Yeah, they've already gone. They're
 

4137
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:17,030
Yeah, they've already gone. They're
gone.

4138
01:43:17,030 --> 01:43:17,040

 

4139
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,790

All right, drift higher because they

4140
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:18,800
All right, drift higher because they
 

4141
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:23,189
All right, drift higher because they
protected 30s

4142
01:43:23,189 --> 01:43:23,199

 

4143
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:24,629

and they want to come for previous day

4144
01:43:24,629 --> 01:43:24,639
and they want to come for previous day
 

4145
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:25,910
and they want to come for previous day
value area high. That's where they want

4146
01:43:25,910 --> 01:43:25,920
value area high. That's where they want
 

4147
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:26,950
value area high. That's where they want
to come. And if they get through that,

4148
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:26,960
to come. And if they get through that,
 

4149
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,310
to come. And if they get through that,
they want to come for GlobeEx. All

4150
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:28,320
they want to come for GlobeEx. All
 

4151
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:34,629
they want to come for GlobeEx. All
right, which is up here.

4152
01:43:34,629 --> 01:43:34,639

 

4153
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:37,910

Yeah, it's funny. I try and teach, but

4154
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:37,920
Yeah, it's funny. I try and teach, but
 

4155
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,669
Yeah, it's funny. I try and teach, but
amount of people who won't, you just

4156
01:43:39,669 --> 01:43:39,679
amount of people who won't, you just
 

4157
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:42,629
amount of people who won't, you just
don't listen. So

4158
01:43:42,629 --> 01:43:42,639
don't listen. So
 

4159
01:43:42,639 --> 01:44:00,470
don't listen. So
God help you. God help you. Honestly,

4160
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:00,480

 

4161
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:01,590

all right. They're adding liquidity

4162
01:44:01,590 --> 01:44:01,600
all right. They're adding liquidity
 

4163
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,189
all right. They're adding liquidity
above because they want this market to

4164
01:44:03,189 --> 01:44:03,199
above because they want this market to
 

4165
01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:06,870
above because they want this market to
drive into 700s.

4166
01:44:06,870 --> 01:44:06,880

 

4167
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,390

They want to come and test previous day

4168
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:08,400
They want to come and test previous day
 

4169
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:13,590
They want to come and test previous day
value.

4170
01:44:13,590 --> 01:44:13,600

 

4171
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,510

VIX lower day. It wants to close its gap

4172
01:44:15,510 --> 01:44:15,520
VIX lower day. It wants to close its gap
 

4173
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:20,390
VIX lower day. It wants to close its gap
to PDC by the looks of it on the VIX.

4174
01:44:20,390 --> 01:44:20,400

 

4175
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:21,910

And we can consider what happens after

4176
01:44:21,910 --> 01:44:21,920
And we can consider what happens after
 

4177
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:40,470
And we can consider what happens after
we get some of these moves.

4178
01:44:40,470 --> 01:44:40,480

 

4179
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:42,149

They're now above initial balance as

4180
01:44:42,149 --> 01:44:42,159
They're now above initial balance as
 

4181
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:50,470
They're now above initial balance as
well. So always been protecting 30s.

4182
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:50,480

 

4183
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:51,669

You're starting to see some bullish

4184
01:44:51,669 --> 01:44:51,679
You're starting to see some bullish
 

4185
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:53,430
You're starting to see some bullish
action take place above 80s. They are

4186
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:53,440
action take place above 80s. They are
 

4187
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:54,709
action take place above 80s. They are
starting to get stuck up here again

4188
01:44:54,709 --> 01:44:54,719
starting to get stuck up here again
 

4189
01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:56,709
starting to get stuck up here again
above 80s. So aggressive participants

4190
01:44:56,709 --> 01:44:56,719
above 80s. So aggressive participants
 

4191
01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:58,310
above 80s. So aggressive participants
keep buying. The guy that's in the money

4192
01:44:58,310 --> 01:44:58,320
keep buying. The guy that's in the money
 

4193
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,750
keep buying. The guy that's in the money
is the guy that's soaking. These guys

4194
01:44:59,750 --> 01:44:59,760
is the guy that's soaking. These guys
 

4195
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,830
is the guy that's soaking. These guys
who keep buying the highs who just got

4196
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:01,840
who keep buying the highs who just got
 

4197
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,430
who keep buying the highs who just got
stuck above 80s again, they will get

4198
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:03,440
stuck above 80s again, they will get
 

4199
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,109
stuck above 80s again, they will get
themselves in trouble unless they this

4200
01:45:05,109 --> 01:45:05,119
themselves in trouble unless they this
 

4201
01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:07,350
themselves in trouble unless they this
Mr. bid at 30 steps up and starts

4202
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:07,360
Mr. bid at 30 steps up and starts
 

4203
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:09,669
Mr. bid at 30 steps up and starts
soaking for them. Just seeing buying

4204
01:45:09,669 --> 01:45:09,679
soaking for them. Just seeing buying
 

4205
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:11,910
soaking for them. Just seeing buying
delta come in offside above 30 in this

4206
01:45:11,910 --> 01:45:11,920
delta come in offside above 30 in this
 

4207
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:13,430
delta come in offside above 30 in this
current 5m minutee bar. You still got

4208
01:45:13,430 --> 01:45:13,440
current 5m minutee bar. You still got
 

4209
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:14,629
current 5m minutee bar. You still got
another two and a half minutes for this

4210
01:45:14,629 --> 01:45:14,639
another two and a half minutes for this
 

4211
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:16,790
another two and a half minutes for this
to close. But definitely they keep

4212
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:16,800
to close. But definitely they keep
 

4213
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,790
to close. But definitely they keep
getting caught trying to aggressively

4214
01:45:18,790 --> 01:45:18,800
getting caught trying to aggressively
 

4215
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,790
getting caught trying to aggressively
buy above 680 at the moment. The

4216
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:20,800
buy above 680 at the moment. The
 

4217
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,629
buy above 680 at the moment. The
rotation is up to 700. That's where

4218
01:45:22,629 --> 01:45:22,639
rotation is up to 700. That's where
 

4219
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:25,270
rotation is up to 700. That's where
they're trying to get to or to 94

4220
01:45:25,270 --> 01:45:25,280
they're trying to get to or to 94
 

4221
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:29,990
they're trying to get to or to 94
previous day value area high.

4222
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:30,000

 

4223
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,910

Yeah, Tesla pushing. Like I said, Tesla

4224
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:31,920
Yeah, Tesla pushing. Like I said, Tesla
 

4225
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,270
Yeah, Tesla pushing. Like I said, Tesla
is the one doing the damage. It is

4226
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:33,280
is the one doing the damage. It is
 

4227
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:34,950
is the one doing the damage. It is
dragging this market up with it at the

4228
01:45:34,950 --> 01:45:34,960
dragging this market up with it at the
 

4229
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:41,590
dragging this market up with it at the
moment. We can have a look at it.

4230
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:41,600

 

4231
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,350

Right, just straight upside. This is

4232
01:45:43,350 --> 01:45:43,360
Right, just straight upside. This is
 

4233
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:44,950
Right, just straight upside. This is
what's dragging the cues up. It probably

4234
01:45:44,950 --> 01:45:44,960
what's dragging the cues up. It probably
 

4235
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,709
what's dragging the cues up. It probably
just wants to get to previous day high

4236
01:45:46,709 --> 01:45:46,719
just wants to get to previous day high
 

4237
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:48,310
just wants to get to previous day high
and then it's probably game over from

4238
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:48,320
and then it's probably game over from
 

4239
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:49,910
and then it's probably game over from
there.

4240
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:49,920
there.
 

4241
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:50,950
there.
Have a look at how they sell it

4242
01:45:50,950 --> 01:45:50,960
Have a look at how they sell it
 

4243
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,390
Have a look at how they sell it
yesterday. Yeah. Or maybe a little bit

4244
01:45:52,390 --> 01:45:52,400
yesterday. Yeah. Or maybe a little bit
 

4245
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,550
yesterday. Yeah. Or maybe a little bit
above. So you got an old range here.

4246
01:45:54,550 --> 01:45:54,560
above. So you got an old range here.
 

4247
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,149
above. So you got an old range here.
It's coming up to back test. All right.

4248
01:45:56,149 --> 01:45:56,159
It's coming up to back test. All right.
 

4249
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:58,790
It's coming up to back test. All right.
So double bottom drive up. They probably

4250
01:45:58,790 --> 01:45:58,800
So double bottom drive up. They probably
 

4251
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,550
So double bottom drive up. They probably
sell it in here unless there's some huge

4252
01:46:00,550 --> 01:46:00,560
sell it in here unless there's some huge
 

4253
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:03,030
sell it in here unless there's some huge
gamma squeeze. But you see like 50 is a

4254
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:03,040
gamma squeeze. But you see like 50 is a
 

4255
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:04,709
gamma squeeze. But you see like 50 is a
big level as well. But you know there's

4256
01:46:04,709 --> 01:46:04,719
big level as well. But you know there's
 

4257
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:07,030
big level as well. But you know there's
going to be probably going to be a cool

4258
01:46:07,030 --> 01:46:07,040
going to be probably going to be a cool
 

4259
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:10,790
going to be probably going to be a cool
wall here.

4260
01:46:10,790 --> 01:46:10,800

 

4261
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,470

So this is what's doing the damage. If

4262
01:46:12,470 --> 01:46:12,480
So this is what's doing the damage. If
 

4263
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,629
So this is what's doing the damage. If
we look at the rest of the mag, are you

4264
01:46:14,629 --> 01:46:14,639
we look at the rest of the mag, are you
 

4265
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:16,709
we look at the rest of the mag, are you
seeing that kind of participation? No,

4266
01:46:16,709 --> 01:46:16,719
seeing that kind of participation? No,
 

4267
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:19,990
seeing that kind of participation? No,
definitely not. Apple, no. Amazon tried

4268
01:46:19,990 --> 01:46:20,000
definitely not. Apple, no. Amazon tried
 

4269
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,629
definitely not. Apple, no. Amazon tried
has caught a bid. Google trying as well

4270
01:46:22,629 --> 01:46:22,639
has caught a bid. Google trying as well
 

4271
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:24,950
has caught a bid. Google trying as well
to be fair. Coming up to uh pre-market

4272
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:24,960
to be fair. Coming up to uh pre-market
 

4273
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:27,910
to be fair. Coming up to uh pre-market
high. Nothing from Meta, nothing from

4274
01:46:27,910 --> 01:46:27,920
high. Nothing from Meta, nothing from
 

4275
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:30,229
high. Nothing from Meta, nothing from
Microsoft, nothing from Nvidia. Just

4276
01:46:30,229 --> 01:46:30,239
Microsoft, nothing from Nvidia. Just
 

4277
01:46:30,239 --> 01:47:00,790
Microsoft, nothing from Nvidia. Just
Tesla and Amazon then really

4278
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:00,800

 

4279
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:02,870

you're trading em ES then you're trading

4280
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:02,880
you're trading em ES then you're trading
 

4281
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,550
you're trading em ES then you're trading
even worse because that's been even more

4282
01:47:04,550 --> 01:47:04,560
even worse because that's been even more
 

4283
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:06,550
even worse because that's been even more
upside all day. And you do this every

4284
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:06,560
upside all day. And you do this every
 

4285
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,149
upside all day. And you do this every
day. You say one thing and then you try

4286
01:47:08,149 --> 01:47:08,159
day. You say one thing and then you try
 

4287
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:12,550
day. You say one thing and then you try
and change it later. Um you just

4288
01:47:12,550 --> 01:47:12,560
and change it later. Um you just
 

4289
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:15,669
and change it later. Um you just
I can't help you, man.

4290
01:47:15,669 --> 01:47:15,679
I can't help you, man.
 

4291
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:17,350
I can't help you, man.
You do the same thing every day. I can't

4292
01:47:17,350 --> 01:47:17,360
You do the same thing every day. I can't
 

4293
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,910
You do the same thing every day. I can't
I can't help you. You call for a big

4294
01:47:19,910 --> 01:47:19,920
I can't help you. You call for a big
 

4295
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:22,070
I can't help you. You call for a big
short you set and then you wait for it

4296
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:22,080
short you set and then you wait for it
 

4297
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,350
short you set and then you wait for it
to squeeze you out. Then you say, "Yeah,

4298
01:47:23,350 --> 01:47:23,360
to squeeze you out. Then you say, "Yeah,
 

4299
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:25,189
to squeeze you out. Then you say, "Yeah,
now now it's now it's doing." It doesn't

4300
01:47:25,189 --> 01:47:25,199
now now it's now it's doing." It doesn't
 

4301
01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:26,870
now now it's now it's doing." It doesn't
do it. And then afterwards when we still

4302
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:26,880
do it. And then afterwards when we still
 

4303
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,229
do it. And then afterwards when we still
squeeze up, you go, "Oh yeah, I'm in

4304
01:47:28,229 --> 01:47:28,239
squeeze up, you go, "Oh yeah, I'm in
 

4305
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:31,270
squeeze up, you go, "Oh yeah, I'm in
MEES, which is still squeezing up near

4306
01:47:31,270 --> 01:47:31,280
MEES, which is still squeezing up near
 

4307
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:35,830
MEES, which is still squeezing up near
day." So

4308
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:35,840

 

4309
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,990

I can't help. At some point, I'm just

4310
01:47:37,990 --> 01:47:38,000
I can't help. At some point, I'm just
 

4311
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,750
I can't help. At some point, I'm just
going to delete chat because it's just

4312
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:39,760
going to delete chat because it's just
 

4313
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:44,629
going to delete chat because it's just
become becoming pointless.

4314
01:47:44,629 --> 01:47:44,639

 

4315
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:46,149

It's not like I'm always right or

4316
01:47:46,149 --> 01:47:46,159
It's not like I'm always right or
 

4317
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:47,510
It's not like I'm always right or
anything like that. It's not an arrogant

4318
01:47:47,510 --> 01:47:47,520
anything like that. It's not an arrogant
 

4319
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:51,030
anything like that. It's not an arrogant
thing, but

4320

I would expect we'll probably complete
 

4337
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:09,430
I would expect we'll probably complete
that rotation up there. It makes sense

that rotation up there. It makes sense
 

4339
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:10,709
that rotation up there. It makes sense
that it wants to get up there at the

4340

4357
01:48:28,159 --> 01:48:34,870
it's super clean. Yesterday was the some

We bring this over.

4380
01:49:15,270 --> 01:49:15,280

 

4381
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:16,790

4387
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:30,229

Why is that dism?

4388
01:49:30,229 --> 01:49:30,239

 

4389
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:33,990

No.

4390
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:34,000

 

4391
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,629

They got stuck here. Look at that buying

4392
01:49:36,629 --> 01:49:36,639
They got stuck here. Look at that buying
 

4393
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:38,470
They got stuck here. Look at that buying
volume up there. That's aggressive

4394
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:38,480
volume up there. That's aggressive
 

4395
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,310
volume up there. That's aggressive
market buying. Did we move higher? No.

4396

So, they bought in supply. We close.

4398
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:43,360
So, they bought in supply. We close.
 

4399
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:46,070
So, they bought in supply. We close.
Next candle. Start seeing sell pressure.

4400
01:49:46,070 --> 01:49:46,080
Next candle. Start seeing sell pressure.
 

4401
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:47,910
Next candle. Start seeing sell pressure.
Opening range. You can also use they bid

4402
01:49:47,910 --> 01:49:47,920
Opening range. You can also use they bid
 

4403
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,430
Opening range. You can also use they bid
back up. they fail against these point

4404
01:49:49,430 --> 01:49:49,440
back up. they fail against these point
 

4405
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,709
back up. they fail against these point
of control and sellers and then we

4406
01:49:50,709 --> 01:49:50,719
of control and sellers and then we
 

4407
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:52,390
of control and sellers and then we
rotate away. So your selling opportunity

4408
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:52,400
rotate away. So your selling opportunity
 

4409
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:54,790
rotate away. So your selling opportunity
is that high and that breakdown and then

4410
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:54,800
is that high and that breakdown and then
 

4411
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:57,189
is that high and that breakdown and then
that's a trend all the way back down,

4412
01:49:57,189 --> 01:49:57,199
that's a trend all the way back down,
 

4413
01:49:57,199 --> 01:49:59,350
that's a trend all the way back down,
right? And all we do is fail and it

4414
01:49:59,350 --> 01:49:59,360
right? And all we do is fail and it
 

4415
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:00,629
right? And all we do is fail and it
gives you another opportunity if you

4416
01:50:00,629 --> 01:50:00,639
gives you another opportunity if you
 

4417
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:03,189
gives you another opportunity if you
missed all of this

4418
01:50:03,189 --> 01:50:03,199
missed all of this
 

4419
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:06,310
missed all of this
and that squeeze out here

4420
01:50:06,310 --> 01:50:06,320
and that squeeze out here
 

4421
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:08,629
and that squeeze out here
was into an old value area low and it

4422
01:50:08,629 --> 01:50:08,639
was into an old value area low and it
 

4423
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:10,149
was into an old value area low and it
was on current value area high and again

4424
01:50:10,149 --> 01:50:10,159
was on current value area high and again
 

4425
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:11,430
was on current value area high and again
buyers got stuck. There's your bare

4426
01:50:11,430 --> 01:50:11,440
buyers got stuck. There's your bare
 

4427
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,030
buyers got stuck. There's your bare
flag. There's a breakdown and retest of

4428
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:13,040
flag. There's a breakdown and retest of
 

4429
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:14,790

previous day low. It was cleanest action

4430
01:50:14,790 --> 01:50:14,800
previous day low. It was cleanest action
 

4431
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,709
previous day low. It was cleanest action
you've seen for a long time in my

4432
01:50:16,709 --> 01:50:16,719
you've seen for a long time in my
 

4433
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:19,189
you've seen for a long time in my
opinion.

4434
01:50:19,189 --> 01:50:19,199
opinion.
 

4435
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:21,750
opinion.
Yesterday was very clean. Okay, so there

4436
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:21,760
Yesterday was very clean. Okay, so there
 

4437
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:24,790
Yesterday was very clean. Okay, so there
you go into the 700s and uh previous day

4438
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:24,800
you go into the 700s and uh previous day
 

4439
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:27,109
you go into the 700s and uh previous day
value area high.

4440
01:50:27,109 --> 01:50:27,119
value area high.
 

4441
01:50:27,119 --> 01:50:30,629
value area high.
You know what the [\h__\h] do I know,

4442
01:50:30,629 --> 01:50:30,639
You know what the [\h__\h] do I know,
 

4443
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:32,070
You know what the [\h__\h] do I know,
right? There's a retest of that key

4444
01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:32,080
right? There's a retest of that key
 

4445
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,390
right? There's a retest of that key
level. There's been someone absorbing

4446
01:50:34,390 --> 01:50:34,400
level. There's been someone absorbing
 

4447
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:35,910
level. There's been someone absorbing
the book all morning like we talked

4448
01:50:35,910 --> 01:50:35,920
the book all morning like we talked
 

4449
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,669
the book all morning like we talked
about at 30s. He's now completed his

4450
01:50:37,669 --> 01:50:37,679
about at 30s. He's now completed his
 

4451
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:39,910
about at 30s. He's now completed his
rotation. Only thing left for them to do

4452
01:50:39,910 --> 01:50:39,920
rotation. Only thing left for them to do
 

4453
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:42,470
rotation. Only thing left for them to do
is to come up here into GlobeEx if they

4454
01:50:42,470 --> 01:50:42,480
is to come up here into GlobeEx if they
 

4455
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:44,149
is to come up here into GlobeEx if they
really really really are desperate to

4456
01:50:44,149 --> 01:50:44,159
really really really are desperate to
 

4457
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:47,510
really really really are desperate to
get up to that uh 729 sort of spot. But

4458
01:50:47,510 --> 01:50:47,520
get up to that uh 729 sort of spot. But
 

4459
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:57,830
get up to that uh 729 sort of spot. But
they've uh they've done the damage.

4460
01:50:57,830 --> 01:50:57,840

 

4461
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:00,310

Tesla into that 85. So remember that was

4462
01:51:00,310 --> 01:51:00,320
Tesla into that 85. So remember that was
 

4463
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,310
Tesla into that 85. So remember that was
a big level. If Tesla starts failing

4464
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:02,320
a big level. If Tesla starts failing
 

4465
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:05,189
a big level. If Tesla starts failing
here might help the market do something,

4466
01:51:05,189 --> 01:51:05,199
here might help the market do something,
 

4467
01:51:05,199 --> 01:51:08,790
here might help the market do something,
but we'll see.

4468
01:51:08,790 --> 01:51:08,800

 

4469
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,310

But you're through previous day value

4470
01:51:10,310 --> 01:51:10,320
But you're through previous day value
 

4471
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:11,990
But you're through previous day value
area high now. So if they fail here, you

4472
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:12,000
area high now. So if they fail here, you
 

4473
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,709
area high now. So if they fail here, you
probably get a rotation back into 84s.

4474
01:51:14,709 --> 01:51:14,719
probably get a rotation back into 84s.
 

4475
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:16,310
probably get a rotation back into 84s.
So I'd be interested here if you start

4476
01:51:16,310 --> 01:51:16,320
So I'd be interested here if you start
 

4477
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,390
So I'd be interested here if you start
to see failures. If we've peaked out, if

4478
01:51:18,390 --> 01:51:18,400
to see failures. If we've peaked out, if
 

4479
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:19,669
to see failures. If we've peaked out, if
we're just going to trade from one side

4480
01:51:19,669 --> 01:51:19,679
we're just going to trade from one side
 

4481
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:22,310
we're just going to trade from one side
of value today. All right. From one side

4482
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:22,320
of value today. All right. From one side
 

4483
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,950
of value today. All right. From one side
of value

4484
01:51:24,950 --> 01:51:24,960
of value
 

4485
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,590
of value
to the other side of value. Max move

4486
01:51:27,590 --> 01:51:27,600
to the other side of value. Max move
 

4487
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:29,510
to the other side of value. Max move
probably up into here. Very possible we

4488
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:29,520
probably up into here. Very possible we
 

4489
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:30,950
probably up into here. Very possible we
come straight back down into here at

4490
01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:30,960
come straight back down into here at
 

4491
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:34,790
come straight back down into here at
this point.

4492
01:51:34,790 --> 01:51:34,800

 

4493
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,070

They've gone from value to value.

4494
01:51:38,070 --> 01:51:38,080
They've gone from value to value.
 

4495
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:39,350
They've gone from value to value.
Let me have a look at this five minute

4496
01:51:39,350 --> 01:51:39,360
Let me have a look at this five minute
 

4497
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:41,350
Let me have a look at this five minute
bar. Did they catch anyone? Yes, they

4498
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:41,360
bar. Did they catch anyone? Yes, they
 

4499
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:45,589
bar. Did they catch anyone? Yes, they
did above 95s.

4500
01:51:45,589 --> 01:51:45,599
did above 95s.
 

4501
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:46,790
did above 95s.
All right. So, I'll be watching that

4502
01:51:46,790 --> 01:51:46,800
All right. So, I'll be watching that
 

4503
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,470
All right. So, I'll be watching that
this trade here for a move back down to

4504
01:51:48,470 --> 01:51:48,480
this trade here for a move back down to
 

4505
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:51,430
this trade here for a move back down to
value area high of 66s. If if they fail,

4506
01:51:51,430 --> 01:51:51,440
value area high of 66s. If if they fail,
 

4507
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:53,910
value area high of 66s. If if they fail,
if they're going to sell value, if they

4508
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:53,920
if they're going to sell value, if they
 

4509
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:55,910
if they're going to sell value, if they
fail, we might see a rotation back into

4510
01:51:55,910 --> 01:51:55,920
fail, we might see a rotation back into
 

4511
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:58,550
fail, we might see a rotation back into
66s. But right now, they're holding 84s,

4512
01:51:58,550 --> 01:51:58,560
66s. But right now, they're holding 84s,
 

4513
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:00,550
66s. But right now, they're holding 84s,
which is the old shelf right here,

4514
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:00,560
which is the old shelf right here,
 

4515
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:01,910
which is the old shelf right here,
right? But if they fail, there's

4516
01:52:01,910 --> 01:52:01,920
right? But if they fail, there's
 

4517
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:04,390
right? But if they fail, there's
probably a trade back in 66s and then

4518
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:04,400
probably a trade back in 66s and then
 

4519
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:07,030
probably a trade back in 66s and then
40s. So, I want to see if we can pop up

4520
01:52:07,030 --> 01:52:07,040
40s. So, I want to see if we can pop up
 

4521
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:12,470
40s. So, I want to see if we can pop up
here, trap some buys, and fail.

4522
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:12,480

 

4523
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:20,229

I want to be careful. Where's Tesla?

4524
01:52:20,229 --> 01:52:20,239

 

4525
01:52:20,239 --> 01:52:22,390

It's not at that 450. I thought it was

4526
01:52:22,390 --> 01:52:22,400
It's not at that 450. I thought it was
 

4527
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:27,109
It's not at that 450. I thought it was
just there. I missed that.

4528
01:52:27,109 --> 01:52:27,119

 

4529
01:52:27,119 --> 01:52:29,589

And I want to watch 85s on SPY. All

4530
01:52:29,589 --> 01:52:29,599
And I want to watch 85s on SPY. All
 

4531
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:31,030
And I want to watch 85s on SPY. All
right. So, watching this carefully now.

4532
01:52:31,030 --> 01:52:31,040
right. So, watching this carefully now.
 

4533
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:32,550
right. So, watching this carefully now.
If we track buyers up here, which we've

4534
01:52:32,550 --> 01:52:32,560
If we track buyers up here, which we've
 

4535
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:34,870
If we track buyers up here, which we've
just done on this one minute chart up to

4536
01:52:34,870 --> 01:52:34,880
just done on this one minute chart up to
 

4537
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:37,030
just done on this one minute chart up to
30. So I am interested if we start to

4538
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:37,040
30. So I am interested if we start to
 

4539
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:38,629
30. So I am interested if we start to
see a rotation away. Just want to give

4540
01:52:38,629 --> 01:52:38,639
see a rotation away. Just want to give
 

4541
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:40,229
see a rotation away. Just want to give
this some time. How much longer we got

4542
01:52:40,229 --> 01:52:40,239
this some time. How much longer we got
 

4543
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:44,629
this some time. How much longer we got
left on the 5m minute?

4544
01:52:44,629 --> 01:52:44,639

 

4545
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:48,310

One more minute. Let this close out.

4546
01:52:48,310 --> 01:52:48,320
One more minute. Let this close out.
 

4547
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:49,910
One more minute. Let this close out.

Are they adding above? Yeah, they're
adding into 30s,

which would be GlobeEx. So I want to be

4552
01:52:54,149 --> 01:52:54,159
which would be GlobeEx. So I want to be
 

4553
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:56,709
which would be GlobeEx. So I want to be
careful.

be careful because if they squeeze out,

4558
01:52:59,750 --> 01:52:59,760
be careful because if they squeeze out,
 

4559
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:01,510
be careful because if they squeeze out,
they're going 30s and they're adding up

they're going 30s and they're adding up
 

4561
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,109
they're going 30s and they're adding up
there as well. So, just wait to see if

4562
01:53:03,109 --> 01:53:03,119
there as well. So, just wait to see if
 

4563
01:53:03,119 --> 01:53:04,790

we get buyers caught here or not before

4566
01:53:06,790 --> 01:53:06,800
I think about doing anything else. They

01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:09,270
I think about doing anything else. They

If they reclaim it all, then I think we

4572
01:53:13,189 --> 01:53:13,199
If they reclaim it all, then I think we
 

4573
01:53:13,199 --> 01:53:16,870
If they reclaim it all, then I think we
go uh 30s. Not that much excess on the

go uh 30s. Not that much excess on the

4577
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:23,270

This is a 700 test. If they hold this,

4578
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:23,280
This is a 700 test. If they hold this,
 

4579
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:25,830
This is a 700 test. If they hold this,
we probably go 30. Spy not quite and ES

01:53:27,589 --> 01:53:27,599
not quite high day. So might have one
 

4583
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:41,430
not quite high day. So might have one
more push in this yet.

01:55:12,149 --> 01:55:12,159
aggressively at these lows. They don't
 

4639
01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:14,470
aggressively at these lows. They don't
get a snap, they're going to get caught.

4640
01:55:14,470 --> 01:55:14,480
get a snap, they're going to get caught.
 

4641
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:16,629
get a snap, they're going to get caught.
And I'll join if we start to break down.

4642
01:55:16,629 --> 01:55:16,639
And I'll join if we start to break down.

Being patient, scalping a bit out here

4648
01:55:24,470 --> 01:55:24,480
Being patient, scalping a bit out here
 

4649
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:25,990
Being patient, scalping a bit out here
because we are picking a high of day

4650
01:55:25,990 --> 01:55:26,000
because we are picking a high of day
 

4651
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,669
because we are picking a high of day
here for a rotation. Looking for a move

4652
01:55:27,669 --> 01:55:27,679
here for a rotation. Looking for a move
 

4653
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:30,470
here for a rotation. Looking for a move
into 6817 if we close under that.

4654
01:55:30,470 --> 01:55:30,480
into 6817 if we close under that.
 

4655
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:33,270
into 6817 if we close under that.
Looking for a move back to 43s.

4656
01:55:33,270 --> 01:55:33,280
Looking for a move back to 43s.
 

4657

Looking for a move back to 43s.
Already in the money. Want to protect

4658
01:55:35,430 --> 01:55:35,440
Already in the money. Want to protect
 

4659
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:37,510
Already in the money. Want to protect
this edge here at sort of 80s and 90s.

4660
01:55:37,510 --> 01:55:37,520
this edge here at sort of 80s and 90s.
 

4661
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:38,950
this edge here at sort of 80s and 90s.
Now don't really want it to come back

4662
01:55:38,950 --> 01:55:38,960
Now don't really want it to come back
 

4663
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:41,589
Now don't really want it to come back
above that level

4664
01:55:41,589 --> 01:55:41,599
above that level
 

4665
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:43,109
above that level
because this can be a fail breakdown and

4666
01:55:43,109 --> 01:55:43,119
because this can be a fail breakdown and
 

4667
01:55:43,119 --> 01:55:45,109
because this can be a fail breakdown and
then a rip back higher. They can still

4668
01:55:45,109 --> 01:55:45,119
then a rip back higher. They can still
 

4669
01:55:45,119 --> 01:55:48,629
then a rip back higher. They can still
move to 30s if they want. 730s that is.

4670
01:55:48,629 --> 01:55:48,639
move to 30s if they want. 730s that is.
 

4671
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:50,070
move to 30s if they want. 730s that is.
want to be careful if they reclaim this

4672
01:55:50,070 --> 01:55:50,080
want to be careful if they reclaim this
 

4673
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:52,229
want to be careful if they reclaim this
range. I'll just cut and leave it. It

4674
01:55:52,229 --> 01:55:52,239
range. I'll just cut and leave it. It
 

4675
01:55:52,239 --> 01:55:56,550
range. I'll just cut and leave it. It
would just be like a 10 20 point scalp.

4676
01:55:56,550 --> 01:55:56,560
would just be like a 10 20 point scalp.
 

4677
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:59,109
would just be like a 10 20 point scalp.
Holding P up here now on this last few

01:55:59,109 --> 01:55:59,119
Holding P up here now on this last few
 

4679
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:00,550
Holding P up here now on this last few
candles. They just tried to aggressively

4680
01:56:00,550 --> 01:56:00,560
candles. They just tried to aggressively
 

4681
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:02,550
candles. They just tried to aggressively
sell that. Haven't got their way. Want

4682
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:02,560
sell that. Haven't got their way. Want
 

4683
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:04,229
sell that. Haven't got their way. Want
to be careful of this edge at 80 which

4684
01:56:04,229 --> 01:56:04,239
to be careful of this edge at 80 which
 

4685
01:56:04,239 --> 01:56:08,950
to be careful of this edge at 80 which
they're bidding off so far.

4686
01:56:08,950 --> 01:56:08,960

 

4687
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:11,109

So any rehold of 80, I will just cut the

4688
01:56:11,109 --> 01:56:11,119
So any rehold of 80, I will just cut the
 

4689
01:56:11,119 --> 01:56:16,470
So any rehold of 80, I will just cut the
rest. They've got to sell through it.

4690
01:56:16,470 --> 01:56:16,480

 

4691
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,149

You can see it aggressively close under

4692
01:56:18,149 --> 01:56:18,159
You can see it aggressively close under
 

4693
01:56:18,159 --> 01:56:19,910
You can see it aggressively close under
80 at this point and just wash everyone

4694
01:56:19,910 --> 01:56:19,920
80 at this point and just wash everyone
 

4695
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:22,070
80 at this point and just wash everyone
out.

4696
01:56:22,070 --> 01:56:22,080
out.
 

4697
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:23,990
out.

There's a retest of 80 again. This is

4702
01:56:29,510 --> 01:56:29,520
There's a retest of 80 again. This is
 

4703
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:30,709
There's a retest of 80 again. This is
their chance. They got to sell through

4704
01:56:30,709 --> 01:56:30,719
their chance. They got to sell through
 

4705
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:33,030
their chance. They got to sell through
this otherwise I'm not interested.

4706
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:33,040
this otherwise I'm not interested.

Starting to see a bit soaking here at

01:56:39,990 --> 01:56:40,000
Yeah, they've soaked again at 80. Want
 

4713
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,430
Yeah, they've soaked again at 80. Want
to be very cautious now.

4714
01:56:43,430 --> 01:56:43,440
to be very cautious now.
 

4715
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:45,270
to be very cautious now.
Going to move my stop just above this

4716
01:56:45,270 --> 01:56:45,280
Going to move my stop just above this
 

4717
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:48,390
Going to move my stop just above this
delta at 87. So my stop's at 87 now for

4718
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:48,400
delta at 87. So my stop's at 87 now for
 

4719
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:49,910
delta at 87. So my stop's at 87 now for
the runner up. Try and let this work.

4720
01:56:49,910 --> 01:56:49,920
the runner up. Try and let this work.
 

4721
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:51,270
the runner up. Try and let this work.
See if we can get down to value area

4722
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:51,280
See if we can get down to value area
 

4723
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:53,990
See if we can get down to value area
high on the session and initial balance.

4724
01:56:53,990 --> 01:56:54,000
high on the session and initial balance.
 

4725
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,669
high on the session and initial balance.
So I'm just looking for this trade is

4726
01:56:57,669 --> 01:56:57,679
So I'm just looking for this trade is
 

4727
01:56:57,679 --> 01:56:59,030
So I'm just looking for this trade is
counter trend. But I'm looking for this

4728
01:56:59,030 --> 01:56:59,040
counter trend. But I'm looking for this
 

4729
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:01,109
counter trend. But I'm looking for this
to here. And if they fade this, great.

4730
01:57:01,109 --> 01:57:01,119
to here. And if they fade this, great.
 

4731
01:57:01,119 --> 01:57:02,629
to here. And if they fade this, great.
But I'm not really expecting the market

4732
01:57:02,629 --> 01:57:02,639
But I'm not really expecting the market
 

4733
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:04,149
But I'm not really expecting the market
to come below here. But this is the

4734
01:57:04,149 --> 01:57:04,159
to come below here. But this is the
 

4735
01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:06,070
to come below here. But this is the
rotation. The reason I'm short up here

4736
01:57:06,070 --> 01:57:06,080
rotation. The reason I'm short up here
 

4737
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:07,830
rotation. The reason I'm short up here
is because I know we're in a rotation.

4738
01:57:07,830 --> 01:57:07,840
is because I know we're in a rotation.
 

4739
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:09,830
is because I know we're in a rotation.
I'm trying to play the edge back to the

4740
01:57:09,830 --> 01:57:09,840
I'm trying to play the edge back to the
 

4741
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:11,990
I'm trying to play the edge back to the
mean at the moment. They need to get

4742
01:57:11,990 --> 01:57:12,000
mean at the moment. They need to get
 

4743
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,589
mean at the moment. They need to get
under 80 though. these sellers and they

4744
01:57:13,589 --> 01:57:13,599
under 80 though. these sellers and they
 

4745
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:15,030
under 80 though. these sellers and they
keep trying and the more that they try

4746
01:57:15,030 --> 01:57:15,040
keep trying and the more that they try
 

4747
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:16,470
keep trying and the more that they try
and don't get it, the more it means

4748
01:57:16,470 --> 01:57:16,480
and don't get it, the more it means
 

4749
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:18,470
and don't get it, the more it means
there's a passive buyer. They might get

4750
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:18,480
there's a passive buyer. They might get
 

4751
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:20,070
there's a passive buyer. They might get
stopped out here on the runner, which is

4752
01:57:20,070 --> 01:57:20,080
stopped out here on the runner, which is
 

4753
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:25,830
stopped out here on the runner, which is
fine if we do.

4754
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:25,840

 

4755
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:27,910

One thing I'm concerned about is 7:30 is

4756
01:57:27,910 --> 01:57:27,920
One thing I'm concerned about is 7:30 is
 

4757
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:29,430
One thing I'm concerned about is 7:30 is
still available and ES is still trying

4758
01:57:29,430 --> 01:57:29,440
still available and ES is still trying
 

4759
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:30,470
still available and ES is still trying
to break out. All right, stopped out

4760
01:57:30,470 --> 01:57:30,480
to break out. All right, stopped out
 

4761
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:32,790
to break out. All right, stopped out
here on my runner. ES is still trying to

4762
01:57:32,790 --> 01:57:32,800
here on my runner. ES is still trying to
 

4763
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,550
here on my runner. ES is still trying to
break out uh through initial balance

4764
01:57:34,550 --> 01:57:34,560
break out uh through initial balance
 

4765
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:37,109
break out uh through initial balance
high. So, it might have more juice.

4766
01:57:37,109 --> 01:57:37,119
high. So, it might have more juice.
 

4767
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:39,750
high. So, it might have more juice.
So, just a tiny scalp there. Market not

4768
01:57:39,750 --> 01:57:39,760
So, just a tiny scalp there. Market not
 

4769
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:43,270
So, just a tiny scalp there. Market not
ready. can always rejoin him. But

4770
01:57:43,270 --> 01:57:43,280
ready. can always rejoin him. But
 

4771
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:45,189
ready. can always rejoin him. But
selling came in aggressively at sort of

4772
01:57:45,189 --> 01:57:45,199
selling came in aggressively at sort of
 

4773
01:57:45,199 --> 01:57:47,750
selling came in aggressively at sort of
82 down to 77 and didn't get their way,

4774
01:57:47,750 --> 01:57:47,760
82 down to 77 and didn't get their way,
 

4775
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,750
82 down to 77 and didn't get their way,
which is why I wanted to be cautious. So

4776
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:49,760
which is why I wanted to be cautious. So
 

4777
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:51,189
which is why I wanted to be cautious. So
in this candle here, they sold

4778
01:57:51,189 --> 01:57:51,199
in this candle here, they sold
 

4779
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:52,390
in this candle here, they sold
aggressively down here, which means

4780
01:57:52,390 --> 01:57:52,400
aggressively down here, which means
 

4781
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:54,070
aggressively down here, which means
there's a passive buyer here. Probably

4782
01:57:54,070 --> 01:57:54,080
there's a passive buyer here. Probably
 

4783
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:55,350
there's a passive buyer here. Probably
the same guy that was here is trying to

4784
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:55,360
the same guy that was here is trying to
 

4785
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,430
the same guy that was here is trying to
soak this, trying to get this rotation.

4786
01:57:57,430 --> 01:57:57,440
soak this, trying to get this rotation.
 

4787
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:59,189
soak this, trying to get this rotation.

4826
01:59:18,149 --> 01:59:18,159

4827
01:59:18,159 --> 01:59:20,070

wrong side of it, I cut it. I cut it in

going to test this 85. So, we might well

02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:05,830
very well be the edge of the rotation,
which is why we were trying to time it,

4946
02:02:05,830 --> 02:02:05,840
which is why we were trying to time it,
 

4947
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:08,310
which is why we were trying to time it,
but need to wait. Let it develop a bit

4948
02:02:08,310 --> 02:02:08,320
but need to wait. Let it develop a bit
 

4949
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:18,149
but need to wait. Let it develop a bit
more now.

4950
02:02:18,149 --> 02:02:18,159

 

4951
02:02:18,159 --> 02:02:19,990

Definitely buyers caught at high day.

4952
02:02:19,990 --> 02:02:20,000
Definitely buyers caught at high day.
 

4953
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,390
Definitely buyers caught at high day.
Just wonder

4954
02:02:22,390 --> 02:02:22,400
Just wonder
 

4955
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:32,149
Just wonder
just wonder do they need one more shove

4956
02:02:32,149 --> 02:02:32,159

 

4957
02:02:32,159 --> 02:02:34,149

and see it's a sensitive area. Markets

4958
02:02:34,149 --> 02:02:34,159
and see it's a sensitive area. Markets
 

4959
02:02:34,159 --> 02:02:36,310
and see it's a sensitive area. Markets
like slowed down while they wait and see

4960
02:02:36,310 --> 02:02:36,320
like slowed down while they wait and see
 

4961
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:37,589
like slowed down while they wait and see
are they going they're think everyone's

4962
02:02:37,589 --> 02:02:37,599
are they going they're think everyone's
 

4963
02:02:37,599 --> 02:02:39,270
are they going they're think everyone's
thinking the same. Are we going through

4964
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:39,280
thinking the same. Are we going through
 

4965
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:41,189
thinking the same. Are we going through
here to 7:30 or are we about to collapse

4966
02:02:41,189 --> 02:02:41,199
here to 7:30 or are we about to collapse
 

4967
02:02:41,199 --> 02:02:42,870
here to 7:30 or are we about to collapse
and come right down to this volume down

4968
02:02:42,870 --> 02:02:42,880
and come right down to this volume down
 

4969
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:44,629
and come right down to this volume down
here?

4970
02:02:44,629 --> 02:02:44,639
here?
 

4971
02:02:44,639 --> 02:02:52,229
here?
Volume's down here.

4972
02:02:52,229 --> 02:02:52,239

 

4973
02:02:52,239 --> 02:02:54,229

There's a bit of excess on this, but not

4974
02:02:54,229 --> 02:02:54,239
There's a bit of excess on this, but not
 

4975
02:02:54,239 --> 02:02:56,310
There's a bit of excess on this, but not
that much. So, if SPY goes 85 and

4976
02:02:56,310 --> 02:02:56,320
that much. So, if SPY goes 85 and
 

4977
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:58,149
that much. So, if SPY goes 85 and
through, we're probably coming here.

4978
02:02:58,149 --> 02:02:58,159
through, we're probably coming here.
 

4979
02:02:58,159 --> 02:02:59,910
through, we're probably coming here.
Otherwise, if they look above and fail,

4980
02:02:59,910 --> 02:02:59,920
Otherwise, if they look above and fail,
 

4981
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:03,669
Otherwise, if they look above and fail,
this trade is available.

4982
02:03:03,669 --> 02:03:03,679

 

4983
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:06,390

What's Tesla doing?

4984
02:03:06,390 --> 02:03:06,400
What's Tesla doing?
 

4985
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:09,270
What's Tesla doing?
Did it actually get up to

4986
02:03:09,270 --> 02:03:09,280
Did it actually get up to
 

4987
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:11,189
Did it actually get up to
Okay, failed in front of this five day.

4988
02:03:11,189 --> 02:03:11,199
Okay, failed in front of this five day.
 

4989
02:03:11,199 --> 02:03:13,270
Okay, failed in front of this five day.
Tesla rolling a little bit, but still

02:03:13,270 --> 02:03:13,280
Tesla rolling a little bit, but still
 

4991

4994
02:03:16,629 --> 02:03:16,639
previous day high. It might still have
 

4995
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:21,430
previous day high. It might still have
more in it Tesla as well.

4996
02:03:21,430 --> 02:03:21,440

 

4997
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:23,990

Okay, here's 85s. Here we go. 685s now

4998
02:03:23,990 --> 02:03:24,000
Okay, here's 85s. Here we go. 685s now
 

4999
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,470
Okay, here's 85s. Here we go. 685s now
on spy. How do we act here? Do we get

5000
02:03:26,470 --> 02:03:26,480
on spy. How do we act here? Do we get
 

5001
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:29,030
on spy. How do we act here? Do we get
base above this or are we going to fail

5002
02:03:29,030 --> 02:03:29,040
base above this or are we going to fail
 

5003
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:37,589
base above this or are we going to fail
into this?

5004
02:03:37,589 --> 02:03:37,599

 

5005
02:03:37,599 --> 02:03:39,109

If we base above this, we can go

5006
02:03:39,109 --> 02:03:39,119
If we base above this, we can go
 

5007
02:03:39,119 --> 02:03:40,790
If we base above this, we can go
previous day high. If we fail into it,

5008
02:03:40,790 --> 02:03:40,800
previous day high. If we fail into it,
 

5009
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:47,030
previous day high. If we fail into it,
we're going to go rotation.

5010
02:03:47,030 --> 02:03:47,040

 

5011
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:48,709

Asia high swipe. Yeah, I mean very

5012
02:03:48,709 --> 02:03:48,719
Asia high swipe. Yeah, I mean very
 

5013

02:03:50,550 --> 02:03:50,560
possible it comes up to to here the 30s
 

5015
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:52,390
possible it comes up to to here the 30s
like we talked about and like you can't

5016
02:03:52,390 --> 02:03:52,400
like we talked about and like you can't
 

5017
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:54,310
like we talked about and like you can't
ignore if it wants to base above and

5018
02:03:54,310 --> 02:03:54,320

they want to start printing this higher

5020
02:03:56,149 --> 02:03:56,159
they want to start printing this higher
 

5021
02:03:56,159 --> 02:03:57,589
they want to start printing this higher
they can. Remember we've had a failed

5022
02:03:57,589 --> 02:03:57,599
they can. Remember we've had a failed
 

5023
02:03:57,599 --> 02:03:59,910
they can. Remember we've had a failed
breakdown this morning. Um if we think

5024
02:03:59,910 --> 02:03:59,920
breakdown this morning. Um if we think
 

5025
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:02,149
breakdown this morning. Um if we think
about in Discord,

5026
02:04:02,149 --> 02:04:02,159
about in Discord,
 

5027
02:04:02,159 --> 02:04:04,950
about in Discord,
those in Discord will know what what did

5028
02:04:04,950 --> 02:04:04,960
those in Discord will know what what did
 

5029
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:10,390
those in Discord will know what what did
I say this morning? Uh

5030
02:04:10,390 --> 02:04:10,400

 

5031
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:14,470

from

5032
02:04:14,470 --> 02:04:14,480

 

5033
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:17,109

these are the trades.

5034
02:04:17,109 --> 02:04:17,119
these are the trades.
 

5035
02:04:17,119 --> 02:04:18,629
these are the trades.
All right, that's what we're doing.

5036
02:04:18,629 --> 02:04:18,639
All right, that's what we're doing.
 

5037
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:21,350
All right, that's what we're doing.
Look, looking below right now. Uh, if

5038
02:04:21,350 --> 02:04:21,360
Look, looking below right now. Uh, if
 

5039
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:22,870
Look, looking below right now. Uh, if
you really want to short, just wait for

5040
02:04:22,870 --> 02:04:22,880
you really want to short, just wait for
 

5041
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:24,070
you really want to short, just wait for
the bat side to come in. It would be

5042
02:04:24,070 --> 02:04:24,080
the bat side to come in. It would be
 

5043
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:26,470
the bat side to come in. It would be
obvious on M30 on an M30. Just know

5044
02:04:26,470 --> 02:04:26,480
obvious on M30 on an M30. Just know
 

5045
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:28,870
obvious on M30 on an M30. Just know
every attempt for it since November 21st

5046
02:04:28,870 --> 02:04:28,880
every attempt for it since November 21st
 

5047
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:31,109
every attempt for it since November 21st
has failed so far. All right, every

5048
02:04:31,109 --> 02:04:31,119
has failed so far. All right, every
 

5049
02:04:31,119 --> 02:04:32,950
has failed so far. All right, every
attempt has failed so far. Today's

5050
02:04:32,950 --> 02:04:32,960
attempt has failed so far. Today's
 

5051
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:34,470
attempt has failed so far. Today's
another attempt of a breakdown which has

5052
02:04:34,470 --> 02:04:34,480
another attempt of a breakdown which has
 

5053
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:36,950
another attempt of a breakdown which has
failed from bears. You have to be aware

5054
02:04:36,950 --> 02:04:36,960
failed from bears. You have to be aware
 

5055
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:39,350
failed from bears. You have to be aware
of what the sentiment is. Bears are not

5056
02:04:39,350 --> 02:04:39,360
of what the sentiment is. Bears are not
 

5057
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:40,870
of what the sentiment is. Bears are not
seeing follow through underneath key

5058
02:04:40,870 --> 02:04:40,880
seeing follow through underneath key
 

5059
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:42,629
seeing follow through underneath key
pivots. They're just getting stuck. And

5060
02:04:42,629 --> 02:04:42,639
pivots. They're just getting stuck. And
 

5061
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:45,669
pivots. They're just getting stuck. And
it's the same thing today. Okay, so 30s

5062
02:04:45,669 --> 02:04:45,679
it's the same thing today. Okay, so 30s
 

5063
02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:47,910
it's the same thing today. Okay, so 30s
looks possible. SPY now well through the

5064
02:04:47,910 --> 02:04:47,920
looks possible. SPY now well through the
 

5065
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:49,830
looks possible. SPY now well through the
85 peaking above. If it wants to go

5066
02:04:49,830 --> 02:04:49,840
85 peaking above. If it wants to go
 

5067
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:52,310
85 peaking above. If it wants to go
previous day high, 8663 on the spiders,

5068
02:04:52,310 --> 02:04:52,320
previous day high, 8663 on the spiders,
 

5069
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:54,470
previous day high, 8663 on the spiders,
it can. So if it pulls back and holds 85

5070
02:04:54,470 --> 02:04:54,480
it can. So if it pulls back and holds 85
 

5071
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:56,310
it can. So if it pulls back and holds 85
now, it's probably a bid. If it pulls

5072
02:04:56,310 --> 02:04:56,320
now, it's probably a bid. If it pulls
 

5073
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:58,390
now, it's probably a bid. If it pulls
back and fails and slices through, it's

5074
02:04:58,390 --> 02:04:58,400
back and fails and slices through, it's
 

5075
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:00,070
back and fails and slices through, it's
probably of high day. We just had a big

5076
02:05:00,070 --> 02:05:00,080
probably of high day. We just had a big
 

5077
02:05:00,080 --> 02:05:01,910
probably of high day. We just had a big
buyer join in at hive day. And if he

5078
02:05:01,910 --> 02:05:01,920
buyer join in at hive day. And if he
 

5079
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:03,669
buyer join in at hive day. And if he
gets stuck, that might signal the hive

5080
02:05:03,669 --> 02:05:03,679
gets stuck, that might signal the hive
 

5081
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:05,910
gets stuck, that might signal the hive
day. We're finally seeing some excess,

5082
02:05:05,910 --> 02:05:05,920
day. We're finally seeing some excess,
 

5083
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:07,910
day. We're finally seeing some excess,
but I'd say 30s is not out the question,

5084
02:05:07,910 --> 02:05:07,920
but I'd say 30s is not out the question,
 

5085
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:10,950
but I'd say 30s is not out the question,
but there's definite excess here for the

5086
02:05:10,950 --> 02:05:10,960
but there's definite excess here for the
 

5087
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:13,990
but there's definite excess here for the
first time today. I think 30s is what

5088
02:05:13,990 --> 02:05:14,000
first time today. I think 30s is what
 

5089
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,030
first time today. I think 30s is what
they're looking for at the moment.

5090
02:05:15,030 --> 02:05:15,040
they're looking for at the moment.
 

5091
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:16,070
they're looking for at the moment.
They're trying to get back up to

5092
02:05:16,070 --> 02:05:16,080
They're trying to get back up to
 

5093
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:20,149
They're trying to get back up to
Globeex.

5094
02:05:20,149 --> 02:05:20,159

 

5095
02:05:20,159 --> 02:05:22,709

Who's at my door?

5096
02:05:22,709 --> 02:05:22,719
Who's at my door?
 

5097
02:05:22,719 --> 02:05:24,229
Who's at my door?
Yeah. Okay, hang on. Someone at the

5098
02:05:24,229 --> 02:05:24,239
Yeah. Okay, hang on. Someone at the
 

5099
02:05:24,239 --> 02:06:26,790
Yeah. Okay, hang on. Someone at the
door.

5100

5101
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:29,350

Amazon package delivery would be my

5102
02:06:29,350 --> 02:06:29,360
Amazon package delivery would be my
 

5103
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:32,470
Amazon package delivery would be my
wife. Okay.

5104
02:06:32,470 --> 02:06:32,480
wife. Okay.
 

5105
02:06:32,480 --> 02:06:35,270
wife. Okay.
Okay. Definitely excess. Where did that

5106
02:06:35,270 --> 02:06:35,280
Okay. Definitely excess. Where did that
 

5107
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:39,430
Okay. Definitely excess. Where did that
buyer come in? 707s. So definite excess

5108
02:06:39,430 --> 02:06:39,440
buyer come in? 707s. So definite excess
 

5109
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:41,589
buyer come in? 707s. So definite excess
707s, but you're still front side at the

5110
02:06:41,589 --> 02:06:41,599
707s, but you're still front side at the
 

5111
02:06:41,599 --> 02:06:43,589
707s, but you're still front side at the
moment. This is a squeeze out. This is

5112
02:06:43,589 --> 02:06:43,599
moment. This is a squeeze out. This is
 

5113
02:06:43,599 --> 02:06:45,350
moment. This is a squeeze out. This is
possible target. If you see a roll and

5114
02:06:45,350 --> 02:06:45,360
possible target. If you see a roll and
 

5115
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:47,109
possible target. If you see a roll and
they start letting go of here, then this

5116
02:06:47,109 --> 02:06:47,119
they start letting go of here, then this
 

5117
02:06:47,119 --> 02:06:49,750
they start letting go of here, then this
is available down to here. And that is

5118
02:06:49,750 --> 02:06:49,760
is available down to here. And that is
 

5119
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:51,350
is available down to here. And that is
the first time today I've seen excess at

5120
02:06:51,350 --> 02:06:51,360
the first time today I've seen excess at
 

5121
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:53,830
the first time today I've seen excess at

spy coming back to test 85. So we can

5124
02:06:56,229 --> 02:06:56,239
spy coming back to test 85. So we can
 

5125
02:06:56,239 --> 02:06:58,149
spy coming back to test 85. So we can
still bid up from here if they really

5126
02:06:58,149 --> 02:06:58,159
still bid up from here if they really
 

5127
02:06:58,159 --> 02:07:05,189
still bid up from here if they really
want to. [snorts]

We're back to previous day value area
 

5203
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:38,790
We're back to previous day value area
high. If they start failing this, we're

02:08:51,109 --> 02:08:51,119
to get back beneath 80s before I do
 

5215
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:53,830
to get back beneath 80s before I do
anything drastic.

5216
02:08:53,830 --> 02:08:53,840
anything drastic.
 

5217
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:56,390
anything drastic.
Can I get filled on this feeler? Am I

5218

Can I get filled on this feeler? Am I
 

5219
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:58,149

Come come up and then fail. Oh, don't

5224
02:09:08,229 --> 02:09:08,239
Come come up and then fail. Oh, don't

5226
02:09:21,270 --> 02:09:21,280

 

5227
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:24,709

Watch 685 on spy under over for

5228
02:09:24,709 --> 02:09:24,719
Watch 685 on spy under over for
 

5229
02:09:24,719 --> 02:09:29,669
Watch 685 on spy under over for
sentiment.

5230
02:09:29,669 --> 02:09:29,679

 

5231
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:31,830

Still holding. I was very very tempted

5232
02:09:31,830 --> 02:09:31,840
Still holding. I was very very tempted
 

5233
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:33,830
Still holding. I was very very tempted
to take a short here in front of 700.

5234
02:09:33,830 --> 02:09:33,840
to take a short here in front of 700.
 

5235
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:36,470
to take a short here in front of 700.
And I'm

5236
02:09:36,470 --> 02:09:36,480
And I'm
 

5237
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:38,870
And I'm
don't like what I just saw here. They

5238
02:09:38,870 --> 02:09:38,880
don't like what I just saw here. They
 

5239
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:41,510
don't like what I just saw here. They
just sold aggressively here.

5240
02:09:41,510 --> 02:09:41,520
just sold aggressively here.
 

5241
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:44,790
just sold aggressively here.
It's moving very very uh not fast in

5242
02:09:44,790 --> 02:09:44,800
It's moving very very uh not fast in
 

5243
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:46,470
It's moving very very uh not fast in
terms of range but between who's stuck.

5244
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:46,480
terms of range but between who's stuck.
 

5245
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:49,270
terms of range but between who's stuck.
So sellers are now stuck under 92s.

5246
02:09:49,270 --> 02:09:49,280
So sellers are now stuck under 92s.
 

5247
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:52,229
So sellers are now stuck under 92s.
Buyers are stuck over 704s. Sellers are

5248
02:09:52,229 --> 02:09:52,239
Buyers are stuck over 704s. Sellers are
 

5249
02:09:52,239 --> 02:09:56,310
Buyers are stuck over 704s. Sellers are
stuck at 92. So 12 points 12 points

5250
02:09:56,310 --> 02:09:56,320
stuck at 92. So 12 points 12 points
 

5251
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:58,550
stuck at 92. So 12 points 12 points
range. Yeah, interested in downside if

5252
02:09:58,550 --> 02:09:58,560
range. Yeah, interested in downside if
 

5253
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:00,149
range. Yeah, interested in downside if
enough buyers get stuck only because

5254
02:10:00,149 --> 02:10:00,159
enough buyers get stuck only because
 

5255
02:10:00,159 --> 02:10:01,669
enough buyers get stuck only because
we're playing the range but very

5256
02:10:01,669 --> 02:10:01,679
we're playing the range but very
 

5257
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:04,629
we're playing the range but very
concerned that we can move to 730. So

5258
02:10:04,629 --> 02:10:04,639
concerned that we can move to 730. So
 

5259
02:10:04,639 --> 02:10:07,830
concerned that we can move to 730. So
and uh spy is holding 685 on dips. All

5260
02:10:07,830 --> 02:10:07,840
and uh spy is holding 685 on dips. All
 

5261
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:12,550
and uh spy is holding 685 on dips. All
right. So

5262
02:10:12,550 --> 02:10:12,560

 

5263
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:14,470

yes, I know we're inside GlobeEx. That's

5264
02:10:14,470 --> 02:10:14,480
yes, I know we're inside GlobeEx. That's
 

5265
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:16,229
yes, I know we're inside GlobeEx. That's
why I'm saying we can trade up to 7:30

5266
02:10:16,229 --> 02:10:16,239
why I'm saying we can trade up to 7:30
 

5267
02:10:16,239 --> 02:10:24,629
why I'm saying we can trade up to 7:30
if they really really want to.

5268
02:10:24,629 --> 02:10:24,639

 

5269
02:10:24,639 --> 02:10:26,229

Let's trap balls up there again. That

5270
02:10:26,229 --> 02:10:26,239
Let's trap balls up there again. That
 

5271
02:10:26,239 --> 02:10:27,990
Let's trap balls up there again. That
last shove. They can't get over the

5272
02:10:27,990 --> 02:10:28,000
last shove. They can't get over the
 

5273
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,790
last shove. They can't get over the
704s. If they get over 704s, there's a

5274
02:10:30,790 --> 02:10:30,800
704s. If they get over 704s, there's a
 

5275
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:32,629
704s. If they get over 704s, there's a
squeeze available. But that is where

5276
02:10:32,629 --> 02:10:32,639
squeeze available. But that is where
 

5277
02:10:32,639 --> 02:10:34,069
squeeze available. But that is where
buyers are stuck at the moment. They're

5278
02:10:34,069 --> 02:10:34,079
buyers are stuck at the moment. They're
 

5279
02:10:34,079 --> 02:10:37,109
buyers are stuck at the moment. They're
stuck over 704s.

5280
02:10:37,109 --> 02:10:37,119
stuck over 704s.
 

5281
02:10:37,119 --> 02:10:38,550
stuck over 704s.
Oh, that was a level I was going to

5282
02:10:38,550 --> 02:10:38,560
Oh, that was a level I was going to
 

5283
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:42,310
Oh, that was a level I was going to
sell. You going to force me to chase now

5284
02:10:42,310 --> 02:10:42,320
sell. You going to force me to chase now
 

5285
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:48,629

5287
02:10:48,639 --> 02:10:52,950

It comes at 85. Test on spy.

It comes at 85. Test on spy.

I'd say 8493 really, but 85 gamma level,

balance. Look above and fail when we
 

5295
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:14,870

rotate.

Big selling down here. Are they going to

5312
02:12:14,870 --> 02:12:14,880
Big selling down here. Are they going to
 

5313
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:18,069
Big selling down here. Are they going to

still soak it?
There's that 89.

5316
02:12:21,510 --> 02:12:21,520
There's that 89.
 

5317
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:23,830
There's that 89.
Still soaking. Still passive buyer here.

can see on the last five minute they've

5320
02:12:25,430 --> 02:12:25,440
can see on the last five minute they've
 

5321
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:28,470
can see on the last five minute they've
sold 93 down to it's very very tight.

5322
02:12:28,470 --> 02:12:28,480
sold 93 down to it's very very tight.
 

5323
02:12:28,480 --> 02:12:30,149
sold 93 down to it's very very tight.
They've sold for a three-point range and

5324
02:12:30,149 --> 02:12:30,159
They've sold for a three-point range and
 

5325
02:12:30,159 --> 02:12:31,910
They've sold for a three-point range and
there's a there's a buyer there soaking

5326
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:31,920
there's a there's a buyer there soaking
 

5327
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:36,149
there's a there's a buyer there soaking
for sure there's a buyer there soaking

5328
02:12:36,149 --> 02:12:36,159

 

5329
02:12:36,159 --> 02:12:38,149

so

5330
02:12:38,149 --> 02:12:38,159
so
 

5331
02:12:38,159 --> 02:12:40,069
so
under 89

5332
02:12:40,069 --> 02:12:40,079
under 89
 

5333
02:12:40,079 --> 02:12:43,830
under 89
and then we've got seller stuck 82 to

5334
02:12:43,830 --> 02:12:43,840
and then we've got seller stuck 82 to
 

5335
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:47,270
and then we've got seller stuck 82 to
78. So really yeah under 80 it confirms

5336
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:47,280
78. So really yeah under 80 it confirms
 

5337
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:49,750
78. So really yeah under 80 it confirms
a bit more and it's dangerous. that blue

5338
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:49,760
a bit more and it's dangerous. that blue
 

5339
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:51,270
a bit more and it's dangerous. that blue
shelf that I just lined up. They're

5340
02:12:51,270 --> 02:12:51,280
shelf that I just lined up. They're
 

5341
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:53,350
shelf that I just lined up. They're
still soaking that shelf. Still a

5342
02:12:53,350 --> 02:12:53,360
still soaking that shelf. Still a
 

5343
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:56,790

Yeah, I'm not short. Like I said, like I

02:12:58,709 --> 02:12:58,719
Yeah, I'm not short. Like I said, like I
 

5347
02:12:58,719 --> 02:13:00,310
Yeah, I'm not short. Like I said, like I
was looking for it, but once I saw the

5348
02:13:00,310 --> 02:13:00,320
was looking for it, but once I saw the
 

5349
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:02,709
was looking for it, but once I saw the
sellers stuck here, I'll get short when

5350
02:13:02,709 --> 02:13:02,719
sellers stuck here, I'll get short when
 

5351
02:13:02,719 --> 02:13:04,229
sellers stuck here, I'll get short when
it when we start to leave volume

5352
02:13:04,229 --> 02:13:04,239
it when we start to leave volume
 

5353
02:13:04,239 --> 02:13:05,510
it when we start to leave volume
trapped. We're not leaving volume

5354
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:05,520
trapped. We're not leaving volume
 

5355

and they hadn't built lots of sellers

5360
02:13:13,510 --> 02:13:13,520
and they hadn't built lots of sellers
 

5361

02:13:15,270 --> 02:13:15,280
stuck here, that rotation might have
 

5363
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:16,790
stuck here, that rotation might have
happened. But there's a passive buyer in

happened. But there's a passive buyer in
 

5365
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:18,390
happened. But there's a passive buyer in
this blue box. That's why I put the blue

5366
02:13:18,390 --> 02:13:18,400
this blue box. That's why I put the blue
 

5367
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:20,310
this blue box. That's why I put the blue
box here for you. All right, if we move

5368
02:13:20,310 --> 02:13:20,320
box here for you. All right, if we move
 

5369
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:21,990
box here for you. All right, if we move
under this, that rotation to here is

5370
02:13:21,990 --> 02:13:22,000
under this, that rotation to here is
 

5371
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,510
under this, that rotation to here is
possible. Under that, that rotation

5372
02:13:23,510 --> 02:13:23,520
possible. Under that, that rotation
 

5373
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:25,510
possible. Under that, that rotation
here. From here, we can still soak and

5374
02:13:25,510 --> 02:13:25,520
here. From here, we can still soak and
 

5375
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:27,030
here. From here, we can still soak and
go up here. Anything is possible right

5376
02:13:27,030 --> 02:13:27,040
go up here. Anything is possible right
 

5377
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:29,830
go up here. Anything is possible right
now. Momentum is upside. Flow zones are

doubt about it. I'm just trying to

5384
02:13:34,310 --> 02:13:34,320
doubt about it. I'm just trying to
 

5385
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:35,589
doubt about it. I'm just trying to
respect that we're at previous day

something like this for a rotation. And
 

5395
02:13:43,119 --> 02:13:44,470
something like this for a rotation. And
I'm it's going to be a scalp because

02:13:44,470 --> 02:13:44,480
I'm it's going to be a scalp because
 

5397
02:13:44,480 --> 02:13:47,189
I'm it's going to be a scalp because

02:13:50,310 --> 02:13:50,320
previous day value area highs. Worst
 

5403
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:52,790

5412
02:14:12,950 --> 02:14:12,960
They're stuck. There's buyers up there
 

5413
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:15,109
They're stuck. There's buyers up there
are stuck, but the sellers here at 94

5414
02:14:15,109 --> 02:14:15,119
are stuck, but the sellers here at 94
 

5415
02:14:15,119 --> 02:14:16,870
are stuck, but the sellers here at 94
and under are stuck. So very tight

5416
02:14:16,870 --> 02:14:16,880
and under are stuck. So very tight
 

5417
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:18,950
and under are stuck. So very tight
10point range. Someone will lose. Once

5418
02:14:18,950 --> 02:14:18,960
10point range. Someone will lose. Once
 

5419
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:30,149
10point range. Someone will lose. Once
they lose, I can join in.

5420
02:14:30,149 --> 02:14:30,159

 

5421
02:14:30,159 --> 02:14:32,310

They lose value and we go rotation. We

5422
02:14:32,310 --> 02:14:32,320
They lose value and we go rotation. We
 

5423
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:33,830
They lose value and we go rotation. We
can might go down to point control. If

5424
02:14:33,830 --> 02:14:33,840
can might go down to point control. If
 

5425
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:38,390
can might go down to point control. If
they lose, we see follow through 85 here

5426
02:14:38,390 --> 02:14:38,400
they lose, we see follow through 85 here
 

5427
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:40,149
they lose, we see follow through 85 here
on spy. Like I talked about, here's your

5428
02:14:40,149 --> 02:14:40,159
on spy. Like I talked about, here's your
 

5429
02:14:40,159 --> 02:14:41,830
on spy. Like I talked about, here's your
back test of 85 for the first time

5430
02:14:41,830 --> 02:14:41,840
back test of 85 for the first time
 

5431
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:44,310
back test of 85 for the first time
today. If they lose 85 on SPY, don't be

5432
02:14:44,310 --> 02:14:44,320
today. If they lose 85 on SPY, don't be
 

5433
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:45,830
today. If they lose 85 on SPY, don't be
surprised if you see that move back down

5434
02:14:45,830 --> 02:14:45,840
surprised if you see that move back down
 

5435
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:49,270
surprised if you see that move back down
to 8450.

5436
02:14:49,270 --> 02:14:49,280

 

5437
02:14:49,280 --> 02:14:52,870

Starting to lose it.

5438
02:14:52,870 --> 02:14:52,880
Starting to lose it.
 

5439
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:54,229
Starting to lose it.
Watching this. This is where sellers

5440
02:14:54,229 --> 02:14:54,239
Watching this. This is where sellers
 

5441
02:14:54,239 --> 02:14:55,510
Watching this. This is where sellers
keep getting stuck where we are now.

5442
02:14:55,510 --> 02:14:55,520
keep getting stuck where we are now.
 

5443
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:57,589
keep getting stuck where we are now.
They need to see follow through here. If

5444
02:14:57,589 --> 02:14:57,599
They need to see follow through here. If
 

5445
02:14:57,599 --> 02:14:58,790
They need to see follow through here. If
they don't see follow through, there's

5446
02:14:58,790 --> 02:14:58,800
they don't see follow through, there's
 

5447
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:01,510
they don't see follow through, there's
no uh there's no move lower. It's just a

5448
02:15:01,510 --> 02:15:01,520
no uh there's no move lower. It's just a
 

5449
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:03,030
no uh there's no move lower. It's just a
passive buyer on a tape. Still seeing a

5450
02:15:03,030 --> 02:15:03,040
passive buyer on a tape. Still seeing a
 

5451
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:04,470
passive buyer on a tape. Still seeing a
passive buyer on a tape down there. So,

5452
02:15:04,470 --> 02:15:04,480
passive buyer on a tape down there. So,
 

5453
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:05,990
passive buyer on a tape down there. So,
this blue box, still a passive buyer,

5454
02:15:05,990 --> 02:15:06,000
this blue box, still a passive buyer,
 

5455
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:07,830
this blue box, still a passive buyer,
just sat there absorbing everything

5456
02:15:07,830 --> 02:15:07,840
just sat there absorbing everything
 

5457
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:12,629
just sat there absorbing everything
that's coming his way so far.

5458
02:15:12,629 --> 02:15:12,639

 

5459
02:15:12,639 --> 02:15:14,069

Probably the same guy that was down here

5460
02:15:14,069 --> 02:15:14,079
Probably the same guy that was down here
 

5461
02:15:14,079 --> 02:15:15,990
Probably the same guy that was down here
at 6:30, is now trying to absorb up

5462
02:15:15,990 --> 02:15:16,000
at 6:30, is now trying to absorb up
 

5463
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,830
at 6:30, is now trying to absorb up
here. Maybe if he's looking to absorb,

5464
02:15:17,830 --> 02:15:17,840
here. Maybe if he's looking to absorb,
 

5465
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:19,510
here. Maybe if he's looking to absorb,
he's looking for this. Once he leaves

5466
02:15:19,510 --> 02:15:19,520
he's looking for this. Once he leaves
 

5467
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:21,910
he's looking for this. Once he leaves
the tape, you probably see this rotation

5468
02:15:21,910 --> 02:15:21,920
the tape, you probably see this rotation
 

5469
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:24,390
the tape, you probably see this rotation
to here and then here.

5470
02:15:24,390 --> 02:15:24,400
to here and then here.
 

5471
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:25,830
to here and then here.
If he leaves the tape, might not leave

5472
02:15:25,830 --> 02:15:25,840
If he leaves the tape, might not leave
 

5473
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:31,270
If he leaves the tape, might not leave
the tape at all today.

5474
02:15:31,270 --> 02:15:31,280

 

5475
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:33,750

85 still holding so far on Spy. that

5476
02:15:33,750 --> 02:15:33,760
85 still holding so far on Spy. that
 

5477
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:35,510
85 still holding so far on Spy. that
initial balance high. Still holding,

5478
02:15:35,510 --> 02:15:35,520
initial balance high. Still holding,
 

5479
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:40,950
initial balance high. Still holding,
still a buyer on a tape.

5480
02:15:40,950 --> 02:15:40,960

 

5481
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:42,790

It's amazing. Bid, bid, bid, bid, bid

5482
02:15:42,790 --> 02:15:42,800
It's amazing. Bid, bid, bid, bid, bid
 

5483
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:44,390
It's amazing. Bid, bid, bid, bid, bid
this market. It's all they [\h__\h] do.

5484
02:15:44,390 --> 02:15:44,400
this market. It's all they [\h__\h] do.
 

5485
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:47,270
this market. It's all they [\h__\h] do.
It's absolute.

5486
02:15:47,270 --> 02:15:47,280
It's absolute.
 

5487
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:48,790
It's absolute.
All I can think is there's the biggest

5488
02:15:48,790 --> 02:15:48,800
All I can think is there's the biggest
 

5489
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:51,109
All I can think is there's the biggest
retail trap ever coming between now and

5490
02:15:51,109 --> 02:15:51,119
retail trap ever coming between now and
 

5491
02:15:51,119 --> 02:15:52,550
retail trap ever coming between now and
end of January. And I think there's a

5492
02:15:52,550 --> 02:15:52,560
end of January. And I think there's a
 

5493
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:53,990
end of January. And I think there's a
big sale coming between January and

5494
02:15:53,990 --> 02:15:54,000
big sale coming between January and
 

5495
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,589
big sale coming between January and
March. The fact that they didn't sell

5496
02:15:55,589 --> 02:15:55,599
March. The fact that they didn't sell
 

5497
02:15:55,599 --> 02:15:57,430
March. The fact that they didn't sell
this market in December, I think is very

5498
02:15:57,430 --> 02:15:57,440
this market in December, I think is very
 

5499
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:59,109
this market in December, I think is very
unhealthy. If anything, I don't think

5500
02:15:59,109 --> 02:15:59,119
unhealthy. If anything, I don't think
 

5501
02:15:59,119 --> 02:16:00,149
unhealthy. If anything, I don't think
it's good for market. I think it's

5502
02:16:00,149 --> 02:16:00,159
it's good for market. I think it's
 

5503
02:16:00,159 --> 02:16:01,669
it's good for market. I think it's
unhealthy.

5504
02:16:01,669 --> 02:16:01,679
unhealthy.
 

5505
02:16:01,679 --> 02:16:04,390
unhealthy.
Um, so whatever the next squeeze out is,

5506
02:16:04,390 --> 02:16:04,400
Um, so whatever the next squeeze out is,
 

5507
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:06,149
Um, so whatever the next squeeze out is,
I think becomes a retail trap. If this

5508
02:16:06,149 --> 02:16:06,159
I think becomes a retail trap. If this
 

5509
02:16:06,159 --> 02:16:08,069
I think becomes a retail trap. If this
is institutions holding bids to squeeze

5510
02:16:08,069 --> 02:16:08,079
is institutions holding bids to squeeze
 

5511
02:16:08,079 --> 02:16:10,950
is institutions holding bids to squeeze
out, I think retail piles in and then

5512
02:16:10,950 --> 02:16:10,960
out, I think retail piles in and then
 

5513
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:14,470
out, I think retail piles in and then
they sell it early next quarter. But

5514
02:16:14,470 --> 02:16:14,480
they sell it early next quarter. But
 

5515
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:16,629
they sell it early next quarter. But
that's just a thought. We will see what

5516
02:16:16,629 --> 02:16:16,639
that's just a thought. We will see what
 

5517
02:16:16,639 --> 02:16:18,950
that's just a thought. We will see what
happens. Like I said, December 13th, I

5518
02:16:18,950 --> 02:16:18,960
happens. Like I said, December 13th, I
 

5519
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:20,550
happens. Like I said, December 13th, I
think, is going to be key for this

5520
02:16:20,550 --> 02:16:20,560
think, is going to be key for this
 

5521
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:23,030
think, is going to be key for this
market. See what the bonds do. JPY carry

auction at 1:00 today as well. You want

5526
02:16:26,950 --> 02:16:26,960
auction at 1:00 today as well. You want
 

5527
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:28,310
auction at 1:00 today as well. You want
to be aware of that if you're in the

5528
02:16:28,310 --> 02:16:28,320
to be aware of that if you're in the
 

5529
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:37,190
to be aware of that if you're in the
market.

5530
02:16:37,190 --> 02:16:37,200

 

5531
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:38,950

that testing the same level. Is this guy

5532
02:16:38,950 --> 02:16:38,960
that testing the same level. Is this guy
 

5533
02:16:38,960 --> 02:16:40,709
that testing the same level. Is this guy
going to let them through? If he's Is he

5534
02:16:40,709 --> 02:16:40,719
going to let them through? If he's Is he
 

5535
02:16:40,719 --> 02:16:46,870
going to let them through? If he's Is he
still here or is he gone?

5536
02:16:46,870 --> 02:16:46,880

 

5537
02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:51,429

I'd say under 80 can get a little nasty.

5538
02:16:51,429 --> 02:16:51,439
I'd say under 80 can get a little nasty.
 

5539
02:16:51,439 --> 02:16:56,950
I'd say under 80 can get a little nasty.
Here we go. Under 85s now on Spy.

5540
02:16:56,950 --> 02:16:56,960

 

5541
02:16:56,960 --> 02:16:58,629

Aggressive selling coming in here. They

5542
02:16:58,629 --> 02:16:58,639
Aggressive selling coming in here. They
 

5543
02:16:58,639 --> 02:17:00,469
Aggressive selling coming in here. They
need to start forcing it under 80 though

5544
02:17:00,469 --> 02:17:00,479
need to start forcing it under 80 though
 

5545
02:17:00,479 --> 02:17:02,309
need to start forcing it under 80 though
because this is the blue box where the

5546
02:17:02,309 --> 02:17:02,319
because this is the blue box where the
 

5547
02:17:02,319 --> 02:17:03,830
because this is the blue box where the
buyers been. Once we get a snap under

5548
02:17:03,830 --> 02:17:03,840
buyers been. Once we get a snap under
 

5549
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:05,669
buyers been. Once we get a snap under
here, I think there's I mean it's not

5550
02:17:05,669 --> 02:17:05,679
here, I think there's I mean it's not
 

5551
02:17:05,679 --> 02:17:07,589
here, I think there's I mean it's not
very big, is it? 20 point rotation. And

5552
02:17:07,589 --> 02:17:07,599
very big, is it? 20 point rotation. And
 

5553
02:17:07,599 --> 02:17:09,589
very big, is it? 20 point rotation. And
if we get lucky down into here at the

5554
02:17:09,589 --> 02:17:09,599
if we get lucky down into here at the
 

5555
02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:23,830
if we get lucky down into here at the
moment, there's still a buyer on a date.

5556
02:17:23,830 --> 02:17:23,840

 

5557
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:25,830

Still can't get close. All the selling

5558
02:17:25,830 --> 02:17:25,840
Still can't get close. All the selling
 

5559
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:29,110
Still can't get close. All the selling
is happening at 93. to 90 and they

5560
02:17:29,110 --> 02:17:29,120
is happening at 93. to 90 and they
 

5561
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:33,349
is happening at 93. to 90 and they
cannot get a close under those levels.

5562
02:17:33,349 --> 02:17:33,359
cannot get a close under those levels.
 

5563
02:17:33,359 --> 02:17:34,870
cannot get a close under those levels.
Yeah. Well, VIX has actually found a

5564
02:17:34,870 --> 02:17:34,880
Yeah. Well, VIX has actually found a
 

5565
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:36,790
Yeah. Well, VIX has actually found a
bid. It's it's falling, but it's

5566
02:17:36,790 --> 02:17:36,800
bid. It's it's falling, but it's
 

5567
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:38,230
bid. It's it's falling, but it's
actually found a bid the last 15

5568
02:17:38,230 --> 02:17:38,240
actually found a bid the last 15
 

5569
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:39,750
actually found a bid the last 15
minutes. So, it's actually gone the

5570
02:17:39,750 --> 02:17:39,760
minutes. So, it's actually gone the
 

5571
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:42,150
minutes. So, it's actually gone the
other way. Okay, here we go. This is

5572
02:17:42,150 --> 02:17:42,160
other way. Okay, here we go. This is
 

5573
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:46,230
other way. Okay, here we go. This is
their chance now. Can we see the snap?

5574
02:17:46,230 --> 02:17:46,240
their chance now. Can we see the snap?
 

5575
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:47,750
their chance now. Can we see the snap?
Is there going to be momentum or is he

5576
02:17:47,750 --> 02:17:47,760
Is there going to be momentum or is he
 

5577
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:49,509
Is there going to be momentum or is he
still here hanging out? Still here

5578
02:17:49,509 --> 02:17:49,519

5581
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:54,790

got absorbed again?

5582
02:17:54,790 --> 02:17:54,800

5597
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,549

Oh, sellers, you're [\h__\h] useless. You

02:18:10,549 --> 02:18:10,559
Oh, sellers, you're [\h__\h] useless. You
 

5599
02:18:10,559 --> 02:18:13,349
Oh, sellers, you're [\h__\h] useless. You
are absolutely useless in this market. I

5600
02:18:13,349 --> 02:18:13,359
are absolutely useless in this market. I
 

5601
02:18:13,359 --> 02:18:15,190
are absolutely useless in this market. I
can't believe it's been May, June, July,

can't believe it's been May, June, July,

can't believe it's been May, June, July,
August, September, October, November to

August, September, October, November to
 

5605
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:19,270
August, September, October, November to
7th. Eight months of them being absolute

5606
02:18:19,270 --> 02:18:19,280
7th. Eight months of them being absolute
 

5607
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:21,589
7th. Eight months of them being absolute
[\h__\h] at seeing followthrough. They've

5608
02:18:21,589 --> 02:18:21,599
[\h__\h] at seeing followthrough. They've
 

5609
02:18:21,599 --> 02:18:24,629
[\h__\h] at seeing followthrough. They've
got an opportunity here to see a wash.

5610
02:18:24,629 --> 02:18:24,639
got an opportunity here to see a wash.
 

5611
02:18:24,639 --> 02:18:26,070
got an opportunity here to see a wash.
All right. This is the blue box. Once

5612
02:18:26,070 --> 02:18:26,080
All right. This is the blue box. Once
 

5613
02:18:26,080 --> 02:18:27,910
All right. This is the blue box. Once
this fails, the opportunity is down into

5614
02:18:27,910 --> 02:18:27,920
this fails, the opportunity is down into
 

5615
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:29,910
this fails, the opportunity is down into
here. The trap level will be 85. But if

5616
02:18:29,910 --> 02:18:29,920
here. The trap level will be 85. But if
 

5617
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:31,990
here. The trap level will be 85. But if
they fail that, there's 10 point snap,

5618
02:18:31,990 --> 02:18:32,000
they fail that, there's 10 point snap,
 

5619
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,309
they fail that, there's 10 point snap,
but they're still being absorbed, right?

5620
02:18:34,309 --> 02:18:34,319
but they're still being absorbed, right?
 

5621
02:18:34,319 --> 02:18:36,389
but they're still being absorbed, right?
You can see it here. Look at these guys

5622
02:18:36,389 --> 02:18:36,399
You can see it here. Look at these guys
 

5623
02:18:36,399 --> 02:18:37,669
You can see it here. Look at these guys
here. They keep selling, selling,

5627
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:40,549
selling, selling, selling, selling, and
they're being absorbed. This is where

5628
02:18:40,549 --> 02:18:40,559
they're being absorbed. This is where
 

5629
02:18:40,559 --> 02:18:43,349
they're being absorbed. This is where
the buyers are stuck up above. So,

5630
02:18:43,349 --> 02:18:43,359
the buyers are stuck up above. So,
 

5631
02:18:43,359 --> 02:18:52,389
the buyers are stuck up above. So,
waiting to see.

5632
02:18:52,389 --> 02:18:52,399

Just one. Just one. Do I'm waiting to
 

5635
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:57,990
Just one. Just one. Do I'm waiting to
sell this up here, but it's not ready.

5636
02:18:57,990 --> 02:18:58,000
sell this up here, but it's not ready.
 

5637
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:59,990
sell this up here, but it's not ready.
It's close.

5638
02:18:59,990 --> 02:19:00,000
It's close.
 

5639
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,830
It's close.
It feels close.

5640
02:19:03,830 --> 02:19:03,840

 

5641
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:05,750

Tesla's starting to pull back a bit.

5642
02:19:05,750 --> 02:19:05,760
Tesla's starting to pull back a bit.
 

5643
02:19:05,760 --> 02:19:08,870
Tesla's starting to pull back a bit.
This might be the sign. We need a close.

5644
02:19:08,870 --> 02:19:08,880
This might be the sign. We need a close.
 

5645
02:19:08,880 --> 02:19:10,469
This might be the sign. We need a close.
Is this going to snap now? Sellers's

5646
02:19:10,469 --> 02:19:10,479
Is this going to snap now? Sellers's
 

5647
02:19:10,479 --> 02:19:11,830
Is this going to snap now? Sellers's
trying again.

5648
02:19:11,830 --> 02:19:11,840
trying again.
 

5649
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:15,190
trying again.
Buyers just got stuck uh 94s now. So now

5650
02:19:15,190 --> 02:19:15,200
Buyers just got stuck uh 94s now. So now
 

5651
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:16,629
Buyers just got stuck uh 94s now. So now
we're starting to see buyers get stuck

5652
02:19:16,629 --> 02:19:16,639
we're starting to see buyers get stuck
 

5653
02:19:16,639 --> 02:19:18,230
we're starting to see buyers get stuck
lower and lower. We might get a rotation

5654
02:19:18,230 --> 02:19:18,240
lower and lower. We might get a rotation
 

5655
02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:22,709
lower and lower. We might get a rotation
here if they fail. 94s. Here we go.

5656
02:19:22,709 --> 02:19:22,719
here if they fail. 94s. Here we go.
 

5657
02:19:22,719 --> 02:19:24,469
here if they fail. 94s. Here we go.
90. Here we go, folks. Here we go. Here

5658
02:19:24,469 --> 02:19:24,479
90. Here we go, folks. Here we go. Here
 

5659
02:19:24,479 --> 02:19:26,230
90. Here we go, folks. Here we go. Here
we go. Okay, in now. Let's see if we can

5660
02:19:26,230 --> 02:19:26,240
we go. Okay, in now. Let's see if we can
 

5661
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:28,950
we go. Okay, in now. Let's see if we can
get a rotation. Stop. Let's see. Where's

5662
02:19:28,950 --> 02:19:28,960
get a rotation. Stop. Let's see. Where's
 

5663
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:31,349
get a rotation. Stop. Let's see. Where's
that value area high? 76es. I want to

5664
02:19:31,349 --> 02:19:31,359
that value area high? 76es. I want to
 

5665
02:19:31,359 --> 02:19:39,509
that value area high? 76es. I want to
get down into here if possible.

5666
02:19:39,509 --> 02:19:39,519

 

5667
02:19:39,519 --> 02:19:40,790

Don't want it to trap. Want to see at

5668
02:19:40,790 --> 02:19:40,800
Don't want it to trap. Want to see at
 

5669
02:19:40,800 --> 02:19:45,110
Don't want it to trap. Want to see at
least 76s and then see if we can wash.

5670
02:19:45,110 --> 02:19:45,120
least 76s and then see if we can wash.
 

5671
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:48,630
least 76s and then see if we can wash.
Don't want to see spy reclaim 85 either.

5672
02:19:48,630 --> 02:19:48,640
Don't want to see spy reclaim 85 either.
 

5673
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:50,950
Don't want to see spy reclaim 85 either.
Don't want to see it trap here. Sellers

5674
02:19:50,950 --> 02:19:50,960
Don't want to see it trap here. Sellers
 

5675
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:53,670
Don't want to see it trap here. Sellers
are stuck from here before from 83 down

5676
02:19:53,670 --> 02:19:53,680
are stuck from here before from 83 down
 

5677
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:55,670
are stuck from here before from 83 down
to 78. So if we start getting underneath

5678
02:19:55,670 --> 02:19:55,680
to 78. So if we start getting underneath
 

5679
02:19:55,680 --> 02:19:58,150
to 78. So if we start getting underneath
78, we're going to start seeing like a

5680
02:19:58,150 --> 02:19:58,160
78, we're going to start seeing like a
 

5681
02:19:58,160 --> 02:19:59,910
78, we're going to start seeing like a
bigger move lower. But you want to be

5682
02:19:59,910 --> 02:19:59,920
bigger move lower. But you want to be
 

5683
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:01,429
bigger move lower. But you want to be
proactive if you're in this with me. I'm

5684
02:20:01,429 --> 02:20:01,439
proactive if you're in this with me. I'm
 

5685
02:20:01,439 --> 02:20:03,030
proactive if you're in this with me. I'm
small size because it's counter trend.

5686
02:20:03,030 --> 02:20:03,040
small size because it's counter trend.
 

5687
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:04,950
small size because it's counter trend.
It's hard to pick. And like I said, if

5688
02:20:04,950 --> 02:20:04,960
It's hard to pick. And like I said, if
 

5689
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:07,429
It's hard to pick. And like I said, if
they trap here and reclaim, then so be

5690
02:20:07,429 --> 02:20:07,439
they trap here and reclaim, then so be
 

5691
02:20:07,439 --> 02:20:10,630
they trap here and reclaim, then so be
it.

5692
02:20:10,630 --> 02:20:10,640

 

5693
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:13,670

sellers got stuck there again at 85s.

5694
02:20:13,670 --> 02:20:13,680
sellers got stuck there again at 85s.
 

5695
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:15,910
sellers got stuck there again at 85s.
So it's the candle from 11:10 this

5696
02:20:15,910 --> 02:20:15,920
So it's the candle from 11:10 this
 

5697
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:17,349
So it's the candle from 11:10 this
morning causing a problem on a five

5698
02:20:17,349 --> 02:20:17,359
morning causing a problem on a five
 

5699
02:20:17,359 --> 02:20:19,590
morning causing a problem on a five
minute.

5700
02:20:19,590 --> 02:20:19,600
minute.
 

5701
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:26,309
minute.
That is the problem. 11:10 candle.

5702
02:20:26,309 --> 02:20:26,319

 

5703
02:20:26,319 --> 02:20:28,630

So it can't get through

5704
02:20:28,630 --> 02:20:28,640
So it can't get through
 

5705
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:30,790
So it can't get through
uh these guys from here. It's these guys

5706
02:20:30,790 --> 02:20:30,800
uh these guys from here. It's these guys
 

5707
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:33,510
uh these guys from here. It's these guys
here stuck. So once we get underneath

5708
02:20:33,510 --> 02:20:33,520
here stuck. So once we get underneath
 

5709
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:35,030
here stuck. So once we get underneath
that, you can see it protected it. Once

5710
02:20:35,030 --> 02:20:35,040
that, you can see it protected it. Once
 

5711
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:36,389
that, you can see it protected it. Once
we get underneath that, we can get to

5712
02:20:36,389 --> 02:20:36,399
we get underneath that, we can get to
 

5713
02:20:36,399 --> 02:20:38,150
we get underneath that, we can get to
value area high until that point. So

5714
02:20:38,150 --> 02:20:38,160
value area high until that point. So
 

5715
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:41,110
value area high until that point. So
buyers are now stuck in here at 95s.

5716
02:20:41,110 --> 02:20:41,120
buyers are now stuck in here at 95s.
 

5717
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:43,670
buyers are now stuck in here at 95s.
Sellers are stuck here at 82s. And

5718
02:20:43,670 --> 02:20:43,680
Sellers are stuck here at 82s. And
 

5719
02:20:43,680 --> 02:20:45,270
Sellers are stuck here at 82s. And
that's very tight range to be playing,

5720
02:20:45,270 --> 02:20:45,280
that's very tight range to be playing,
 

5721
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:48,389
that's very tight range to be playing,
but that's what we're playing.

5722
02:20:48,389 --> 02:20:48,399
but that's what we're playing.
 

5723
02:20:48,399 --> 02:20:50,550
but that's what we're playing.
Back to those 95s again. If they break

5724
02:20:50,550 --> 02:20:50,560
Back to those 95s again. If they break
 

5725
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:51,750
Back to those 95s again. If they break
out here, they're squeezed. So I don't

5726
02:20:51,750 --> 02:20:51,760
out here, they're squeezed. So I don't
 

5727
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:54,950
out here, they're squeezed. So I don't
want to hold it above this.

5728
02:20:54,950 --> 02:20:54,960
want to hold it above this.
 

5729
02:20:54,960 --> 02:20:59,190
want to hold it above this.
I'd say 700s, I guess.

5730
02:20:59,190 --> 02:20:59,200
I'd say 700s, I guess.
 

5731
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:03,190
I'd say 700s, I guess.
Yeah, 700s. 700s is the

5732
02:21:03,190 --> 02:21:03,200
Yeah, 700s. 700s is the
 

5733
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:05,270
Yeah, 700s. 700s is the
No, I'm not looking at M andQ. Sorry,

5734
02:21:05,270 --> 02:21:05,280
No, I'm not looking at M andQ. Sorry,
 

5735
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:07,110
No, I'm not looking at M andQ. Sorry,
I'm focused on MQ. I don't care about M

5736
02:21:07,110 --> 02:21:07,120
I'm focused on MQ. I don't care about M
 

5737
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:09,110
I'm focused on MQ. I don't care about M
andQ. Sorry if you got swiped or it did

5738
02:21:09,110 --> 02:21:09,120
andQ. Sorry if you got swiped or it did
 

5739
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:10,469
andQ. Sorry if you got swiped or it did
something, but I'm not taking my eyes

5740
02:21:10,469 --> 02:21:10,479
something, but I'm not taking my eyes
 

5741
02:21:10,479 --> 02:21:26,870
something, but I'm not taking my eyes
off this chart.

5742
02:21:26,870 --> 02:21:26,880

 

5743
02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:28,710

We get through 700s. They can squeeze

5744
02:21:28,710 --> 02:21:28,720
We get through 700s. They can squeeze
 

5745
02:21:28,720 --> 02:21:33,910
We get through 700s. They can squeeze
this

5746
02:21:33,910 --> 02:21:33,920

 

5747
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:40,950

reclaim of 85 here. possible

5748
02:21:40,950 --> 02:21:40,960

 

5749
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:43,110

reclaim 85 here on spy. Be careful if

5750
02:21:43,110 --> 02:21:43,120
reclaim 85 here on spy. Be careful if
 

5751
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:44,790
reclaim 85 here on spy. Be careful if
they squeeze through 700s. High days

5752
02:21:44,790 --> 02:21:44,800
they squeeze through 700s. High days
 

5753
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:46,950
they squeeze through 700s. High days
coming.

5754
02:21:46,950 --> 02:21:46,960
coming.
 

5755
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:48,630
coming.
I'm already out of this now. Can always

5756
02:21:48,630 --> 02:21:48,640
I'm already out of this now. Can always
 

5757
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:51,030
I'm already out of this now. Can always
read add in. That's annoying. They had

5758
02:21:51,030 --> 02:21:51,040
read add in. That's annoying. They had
 

5759
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:53,910
read add in. That's annoying. They had
the opportunity uh just just repeat of

5760
02:21:53,910 --> 02:21:53,920
the opportunity uh just just repeat of
 

5761
02:21:53,920 --> 02:21:55,429
the opportunity uh just just repeat of
everything. Drift higher. Probably

5762
02:21:55,429 --> 02:21:55,439
everything. Drift higher. Probably
 

5763
02:21:55,439 --> 02:21:56,870
everything. Drift higher. Probably
should probably won't have another go at

5764
02:21:56,870 --> 02:21:56,880
should probably won't have another go at
 

5765
02:21:56,880 --> 02:21:59,110
should probably won't have another go at
this now to be honest. If they had that

5766
02:21:59,110 --> 02:21:59,120
this now to be honest. If they had that
 

5767
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:00,950
this now to be honest. If they had that
opportunity then to take control of this

5768
02:22:00,950 --> 02:22:00,960
opportunity then to take control of this
 

5769
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:02,630
opportunity then to take control of this
market

5770
02:22:02,630 --> 02:22:02,640
market
 

5771
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:04,230
market
with the buyers stuck here, they had the

5772
02:22:04,230 --> 02:22:04,240
with the buyers stuck here, they had the
 

5773
02:22:04,240 --> 02:22:06,230
with the buyers stuck here, they had the
opportunity to rotate back to value.

5774
02:22:06,230 --> 02:22:06,240
opportunity to rotate back to value.
 

5775
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:07,910
opportunity to rotate back to value.
They failed that opportunity. There's

5776
02:22:07,910 --> 02:22:07,920
They failed that opportunity. There's
 

5777
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:09,990
They failed that opportunity. There's
still a passive buyer on the tape. And

5778
02:22:09,990 --> 02:22:10,000
still a passive buyer on the tape. And
 

5779
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,469
still a passive buyer on the tape. And
730 will probably be the target. And I

5780
02:22:12,469 --> 02:22:12,479
730 will probably be the target. And I
 

5781
02:22:12,479 --> 02:22:13,750
730 will probably be the target. And I
don't think I want to have another go at

5782
02:22:13,750 --> 02:22:13,760
don't think I want to have another go at
 

5783
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:16,150
don't think I want to have another go at
this. I've had uh

5784
02:22:16,150 --> 02:22:16,160
this. I've had uh
 

5785
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:17,670
this. I've had uh
that one attempt or two attempts up

5786
02:22:17,670 --> 02:22:17,680
that one attempt or two attempts up
 

5787
02:22:17,680 --> 02:22:18,710
that one attempt or two attempts up
here. I can't even remember. I think

5788
02:22:18,710 --> 02:22:18,720
here. I can't even remember. I think
 

5789
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:20,150
here. I can't even remember. I think
maybe there was one here and one here.

5790
02:22:20,150 --> 02:22:20,160
maybe there was one here and one here.
 

5791
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:28,309
maybe there was one here and one here.
Can't even remember now.

5792
02:22:28,309 --> 02:22:28,319

 

5793
02:22:28,319 --> 02:22:30,389

Yeah, for sure. I mean, it like we are

5794
02:22:30,389 --> 02:22:30,399
Yeah, for sure. I mean, it like we are
 

5795
02:22:30,399 --> 02:22:31,670
Yeah, for sure. I mean, it like we are
at higher day. It might be coming up

5796
02:22:31,670 --> 02:22:31,680
at higher day. It might be coming up
 

5797
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:33,590
at higher day. It might be coming up
here, but like I'm certainly not buying

5798
02:22:33,590 --> 02:22:33,600
here, but like I'm certainly not buying
 

5799
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:35,190
here, but like I'm certainly not buying
up here on a rotation. This is

5800
02:22:35,190 --> 02:22:35,200
up here on a rotation. This is
 

5801
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:37,510
up here on a rotation. This is
yesterday's value.

5802
02:22:37,510 --> 02:22:37,520
yesterday's value.
 

5803
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:40,950
yesterday's value.
The buying opportunity was the fake out

5804
02:22:40,950 --> 02:22:40,960
The buying opportunity was the fake out
 

5805
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:42,389
The buying opportunity was the fake out
here and then the reclaim. That was

5806
02:22:42,389 --> 02:22:42,399
here and then the reclaim. That was
 

5807
02:22:42,399 --> 02:22:44,950
here and then the reclaim. That was
probably your buy opportunity here. And

5808
02:22:44,950 --> 02:22:44,960
probably your buy opportunity here. And
 

5809
02:22:44,960 --> 02:22:47,270
probably your buy opportunity here. And
this is a slow grind. I've had a go. I I

5810
02:22:47,270 --> 02:22:47,280
this is a slow grind. I've had a go. I I
 

5811
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:50,230
this is a slow grind. I've had a go. I I
left all of this alone and I've had a go

5812
02:22:50,230 --> 02:22:50,240
left all of this alone and I've had a go
 

5813
02:22:50,240 --> 02:22:52,630
left all of this alone and I've had a go
at value. Had a go to see if value will

5814
02:22:52,630 --> 02:22:52,640
at value. Had a go to see if value will
 

5815
02:22:52,640 --> 02:22:54,630
at value. Had a go to see if value will
fail. It's not failing. So, I don't want

5816
02:22:54,630 --> 02:22:54,640
fail. It's not failing. So, I don't want
 

5817
02:22:54,640 --> 02:22:56,630
fail. It's not failing. So, I don't want
to fight it. If it's not going to fail,

5818
02:22:56,630 --> 02:22:56,640
to fight it. If it's not going to fail,
 

5819
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:57,990
to fight it. If it's not going to fail,
I don't want to fight it. I don't want

5820
02:22:57,990 --> 02:22:58,000
I don't want to fight it. I don't want
 

5821
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,230
I don't want to fight it. I don't want
to be in here fighting a market which is

5822
02:23:00,230 --> 02:23:00,240
to be in here fighting a market which is

5844
02:23:07,030 --> 02:23:07,040
in this range. But what I don't want to
 

5845
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:10,070
in this range. But what I don't want to
do is bid the top side of a range. It's

5846
02:23:10,070 --> 02:23:10,080
do is bid the top side of a range. It's
 

5847
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:11,349
do is bid the top side of a range. It's
easiest way to get hurt. I don't know

5848
02:23:11,349 --> 02:23:11,359
easiest way to get hurt. I don't know
 

5849
02:23:11,359 --> 02:23:12,790
easiest way to get hurt. I don't know
what their intentions are. Right now I'm

5850
02:23:12,790 --> 02:23:12,800
what their intentions are. Right now I'm
 

5851
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:14,070
what their intentions are. Right now I'm
out of this trade. Let's have a look at

5852
02:23:14,070 --> 02:23:14,080
out of this trade. Let's have a look at
 

5853
02:23:14,080 --> 02:23:16,469
out of this trade. Let's have a look at
M and Q. See what you guys were talking

5854
02:23:16,469 --> 02:23:16,479
M and Q. See what you guys were talking
 

5855
02:23:16,479 --> 02:23:18,790
M and Q. See what you guys were talking
about. Yes. Okay. Yeah. So little stop

5856
02:23:18,790 --> 02:23:18,800
about. Yes. Okay. Yeah. So little stop
 

5857
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:22,870
about. Yes. Okay. Yeah. So little stop
right down to initial balance. I mean,

5858
02:23:22,870 --> 02:23:22,880
right down to initial balance. I mean,
 

5859
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:25,110
right down to initial balance. I mean,
that's kind of what I was looking for on

5860
02:23:25,110 --> 02:23:25,120
that's kind of what I was looking for on
 

5861
02:23:25,120 --> 02:23:30,950
that's kind of what I was looking for on

02:28:17,120 --> 02:28:19,270
I need to see this.
It's It feels close, but it's felt close

6022
02:28:19,270 --> 02:28:19,280
It's It feels close, but it's felt close
 

6023
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:21,110
It's It feels close, but it's felt close
every time. And he's just gone, "Oh,

6024
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:21,120
every time. And he's just gone, "Oh,
 

6025
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:23,590
every time. And he's just gone, "Oh,
I'll gobble you up for that move." So, I

6026
02:28:23,590 --> 02:28:23,600
I'll gobble you up for that move." So, I
 

6027
02:28:23,600 --> 02:28:25,990
I'll gobble you up for that move." So, I
want to be careful.

6028
02:28:25,990 --> 02:28:26,000
want to be careful.
 

6029
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:27,750
want to be careful.
Right into where we sold on the previous

6035
02:28:32,160 --> 02:28:34,469
especially with spy at 685 and starting

6036
02:28:34,469 --> 02:28:34,479

6037
02:28:34,479 --> 02:28:36,870
to fail it. Do I have one more go here?
That's the question.

6038

That's the question.

they've got to reject this volume. This
blue level. We can actually move this up

blue level. We can actually move this up
 

6087
02:29:38,880 --> 02:29:40,870
blue level. We can actually move this up
a bit. It's more like this now. All

called it 94 above that. We We can't
 

6095
02:29:49,439 --> 02:29:50,870
called it 94 above that. We We can't
trade back above that. If we trade back

6096
02:29:50,870 --> 02:29:50,880
trade back above that. If we trade back
 

6097
02:29:50,880 --> 02:29:52,550

above that is going to be acceptance. We

above that is going to be acceptance. We
 

6099
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:53,910
above that is going to be acceptance. We
need this to reject. This is looking

need this to reject. This is looking
 

6101
02:29:53,920 --> 02:29:56,150
need this to reject. This is looking
good so far. What's delta light? Looks

6102

good so far. What's delta light? Looks
 

6103
02:29:56,160 --> 02:29:57,670
good so far. What's delta light? Looks
good actually. We just need follow

good actually. We just need follow
 

6105
02:29:57,680 --> 02:29:59,030
good actually. We just need follow
through. We need a snap here and a

flush. Uh if you feel uncomfortable,

6108
02:30:01,510 --> 02:30:01,520
flush. Uh if you feel uncomfortable,
 

6109
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:03,030
flush. Uh if you feel uncomfortable,
size down or take it off. You're trying

6110

size down or take it off. You're trying
 

6111
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:04,870
size down or take it off. You're trying
to pick the rotation. It's really hard

6112
02:30:04,870 --> 02:30:04,880
to pick the rotation. It's really hard
 

6113
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:06,469
to pick the rotation. It's really hard
trade. I hate rotation. You hear me say

6114
02:30:06,469 --> 02:30:06,479
trade. I hate rotation. You hear me say
 

6115
02:30:06,479 --> 02:30:08,230

it all the time. My least favorite
 

6117
02:30:08,240 --> 02:30:09,830
it all the time. My least favorite
trade. If we can get follow through

6118
02:30:09,830 --> 02:30:09,840
trade. If we can get follow through
 

6119
02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:12,550
trade. If we can get follow through
here, I think there is a trade down.

6120
02:30:12,550 --> 02:30:12,560
here, I think there is a trade down.
 

6121

Right. You've got a chance here, bears.

6148
02:30:51,270 --> 02:30:51,280
Right. You've got a chance here, bears.
 

6149
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:53,349
Right. You've got a chance here, bears.
You have a chance here to take control

6150
02:30:53,349 --> 02:30:53,359
You have a chance here to take control
 

6151
02:30:53,359 --> 02:30:55,030
You have a chance here to take control
of this market for a moment. Let's see

6152
02:30:55,030 --> 02:30:55,040
of this market for a moment. Let's see
 

6153
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:57,030
of this market for a moment. Let's see
this flush. Let's get this blue box as

6154
02:30:57,030 --> 02:30:57,040
this flush. Let's get this blue box as
 

6155
02:30:57,040 --> 02:30:58,790
this flush. Let's get this blue box as
your TP1 and initial balance. And then

6156
02:30:58,790 --> 02:30:58,800
your TP1 and initial balance. And then
 

6157
02:30:58,800 --> 02:30:59,910
your TP1 and initial balance. And then
if we can get under that, we get a

6158
02:30:59,910 --> 02:30:59,920
if we can get under that, we get a
 

6159
02:30:59,920 --> 02:31:08,309
if we can get under that, we get a
better rotation.

6160
02:31:08,309 --> 02:31:08,319

 

6161
02:31:08,319 --> 02:31:11,030

This becomes key. This is the edge of

6164
02:31:13,510 --> 02:31:13,520
This becomes key. This is the edge of
 

6165
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:15,670
This becomes key. This is the edge of
this range. Think about where we broke

6166
02:31:15,670 --> 02:31:15,680
this range. Think about where we broke
 

6167
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:17,510
this range. Think about where we broke
out from.

6168
02:31:17,510 --> 02:31:17,520
out from.
 

6169
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:20,070
out from.
It's like your RBS level. All right. So,

6170
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:20,080
It's like your RBS level. All right. So,
 

6171
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:21,990
It's like your RBS level. All right. So,
this is why it's a TP1 in here. And if

6172
02:31:21,990 --> 02:31:22,000
this is why it's a TP1 in here. And if
 

6173
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,389
this is why it's a TP1 in here. And if
we get back down into here, I think we

6174
02:31:24,389 --> 02:31:24,399
we get back down into here, I think we
 

6175
02:31:24,399 --> 02:31:25,670
we get back down into here, I think we
can let go and come all the way into

6176
02:31:25,670 --> 02:31:25,680
can let go and come all the way into
 

6177
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:27,830
can let go and come all the way into
650. It's possible. But your TP1 is

6178
02:31:27,830 --> 02:31:27,840
650. It's possible. But your TP1 is
 

6179
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:29,030
650. It's possible. But your TP1 is
right here right now. This is what I'm

6180
02:31:29,030 --> 02:31:29,040
right here right now. This is what I'm
 

6181
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:30,950
right here right now. This is what I'm
saying. It's a small trade from here to

6182
02:31:30,950 --> 02:31:30,960
saying. It's a small trade from here to
 

6183
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:32,150
saying. It's a small trade from here to
here. that you can see they're trying to

6184
02:31:32,150 --> 02:31:32,160
here. that you can see they're trying to
 

6185
02:31:32,160 --> 02:31:34,150
here. that you can see they're trying to
hold this little shelf. If we get under

6186
02:31:34,150 --> 02:31:34,160
hold this little shelf. If we get under
 

6187
02:31:34,160 --> 02:31:37,190
hold this little shelf. If we get under
this 650 as possible. If we get under

6188
02:31:37,190 --> 02:31:37,200
this 650 as possible. If we get under
 

6189
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:41,190
this 650 as possible. If we get under
that uh well then really technically

6190
02:31:41,190 --> 02:31:41,200
that uh well then really technically
 

6191
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:43,830
that uh well then really technically
we can come back into these lows at 600.

6192
02:31:43,830 --> 02:31:43,840
we can come back into these lows at 600.
 

6193
02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:45,750
we can come back into these lows at 600.
So it's available if they let it happen.

6194
02:31:45,750 --> 02:31:45,760
So it's available if they let it happen.
 

6195
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:47,349
So it's available if they let it happen.
But remember main sentiment today has

6196
02:31:47,349 --> 02:31:47,359
But remember main sentiment today has
 

6197
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:48,790
But remember main sentiment today has
been to drift higher. We've still left

6198
02:31:48,790 --> 02:31:48,800
been to drift higher. We've still left
 

6199
02:31:48,800 --> 02:31:50,870
been to drift higher. We've still left
Gloveex up there. We're now comfortable

6200
02:31:50,870 --> 02:31:50,880
Gloveex up there. We're now comfortable
 

6201
02:31:50,880 --> 02:31:52,790
Gloveex up there. We're now comfortable
in the short for the first time today.

in the short for the first time today.
 

6203
02:31:52,800 --> 02:31:56,150
in the short for the first time today.
Took a few attempts.

6204
02:31:56,150 --> 02:31:56,160
Took a few attempts.
 

6205
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:58,389
Took a few attempts.
Really nice. Here we go. So TP1 here,

folks. And let's see if we can get some
 

6209
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:06,309
folks. And let's see if we can get some
continuation for the first time today.

6210
02:32:06,309 --> 02:32:06,319

 

6211
02:32:06,319 --> 02:32:08,150

Just took a minute. It took a minute.

6217
02:32:12,479 --> 02:32:13,510
guy was just soaking these cells, but
now we're starting to see follow

6218
02:32:13,510 --> 02:32:13,520
now we're starting to see follow
 

6219
02:32:13,520 --> 02:32:16,230
now we're starting to see follow
through. Really good. Okay, there's your

02:32:23,030 --> 02:32:23,040
Let's see if we can get follow through.
 

6227
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:25,190
Let's see if we can get follow through.
Nice failure of 685. So, we poked above

6228
02:32:25,190 --> 02:32:25,200
Nice failure of 685. So, we poked above
 

6229
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:27,429
Nice failure of 685. So, we poked above
685 on Spy. are now starting to fail it.

6230
02:32:27,429 --> 02:32:27,439
685 on Spy. are now starting to fail it.
 

6231

685 on Spy. are now starting to fail it.
Back into this shelf here. Big big level

6232
02:32:29,830 --> 02:32:29,840
Back into this shelf here. Big big level
 

6233
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:32,710
Back into this shelf here. Big big level
here for spy. Uh 8450s. If they fail

6234
02:32:32,710 --> 02:32:32,720
here for spy. Uh 8450s. If they fail
 

6235
02:32:32,720 --> 02:32:34,469
here for spy. Uh 8450s. If they fail
that, we go VWOP and we can see

6236
02:32:34,469 --> 02:32:34,479
that, we go VWOP and we can see
 

6237
02:32:34,479 --> 02:32:35,990
that, we go VWOP and we can see
continuation. Come on. I want to get

6238
02:32:35,990 --> 02:32:36,000
continuation. Come on. I want to get
 

6239
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:40,790
continuation. Come on. I want to get
down into here now. Come on, baby.

6240
02:32:40,790 --> 02:32:40,800
down into here now. Come on, baby.
 

6241

down into here now. Come on, baby.
Don't be a little

6242
02:32:43,270 --> 02:32:43,280
Don't be a little
 

6243
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:46,630
Don't be a little
You know what?

6244
02:32:46,630 --> 02:32:46,640
You know what?
 

6245
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:51,750
You know what?
Give me a bit more.

6246
02:32:51,750 --> 02:32:51,760

 

6247
02:32:51,760 --> 02:32:53,190

Yeah, you should have paid yourself some

6248
02:32:53,190 --> 02:32:53,200
Yeah, you should have paid yourself some
 

6249
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:54,950
Yeah, you should have paid yourself some
already. I'm trying to hold to see if we

6250
02:32:54,950 --> 02:32:54,960
already. I'm trying to hold to see if we
 

6251
02:32:54,960 --> 02:33:01,590
already. I'm trying to hold to see if we
can get a deeper move here.

6252
02:33:01,590 --> 02:33:01,600

 

6253
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:03,429

43s would be nice. So that's current

6254
02:33:03,429 --> 02:33:03,439
43s would be nice. So that's current
 

6255
02:33:03,439 --> 02:33:05,670
43s would be nice. So that's current
volume point control down into here.

6256
02:33:05,670 --> 02:33:05,680
volume point control down into here.
 

6257
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:07,190
volume point control down into here.
Anywhere here would be really nice for

6258
02:33:07,190 --> 02:33:07,200
Anywhere here would be really nice for
 

6259
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:08,950
Anywhere here would be really nice for
my last TP. Don't want to see this

6260
02:33:08,950 --> 02:33:08,960
my last TP. Don't want to see this
 

6261
02:33:08,960 --> 02:33:10,550
my last TP. Don't want to see this
reclaim this shelf. This this remains

6262
02:33:10,550 --> 02:33:10,560
reclaim this shelf. This this remains
 

6263
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:13,429
reclaim this shelf. This this remains
the same, right? So maybe you don't want

6264
02:33:13,429 --> 02:33:13,439
the same, right? So maybe you don't want
 

6265
02:33:13,439 --> 02:33:14,790
the same, right? So maybe you don't want
to risk all the way up here. I'm risking

6266
02:33:14,790 --> 02:33:14,800
to risk all the way up here. I'm risking
 

6267
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:16,870
to risk all the way up here. I'm risking
this on my runner where I basically got

6268
02:33:16,870 --> 02:33:16,880
this on my runner where I basically got
 

6269
02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:20,550
this on my runner where I basically got
in. But if we reclaim that, no good.

6270
02:33:20,550 --> 02:33:20,560
in. But if we reclaim that, no good.
 

6271
02:33:20,560 --> 02:33:22,070
in. But if we reclaim that, no good.
But if we reject there or in front of

6272
02:33:22,070 --> 02:33:22,080
But if we reject there or in front of
 

6273
02:33:22,080 --> 02:33:36,150
But if we reject there or in front of
there then we might see more downside.

6274
02:33:36,150 --> 02:33:36,160

 

6275
02:33:36,160 --> 02:33:37,910

Just trapped a little bit of buying

6276
02:33:37,910 --> 02:33:37,920
Just trapped a little bit of buying
 

6277
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:40,790
Just trapped a little bit of buying
there into 80s which is good long as we

6278
02:33:40,790 --> 02:33:40,800
there into 80s which is good long as we
 

6279
02:33:40,800 --> 02:33:43,110
there into 80s which is good long as we
don't reclaim that.

6280
02:33:43,110 --> 02:33:43,120
don't reclaim that.
 

6281
02:33:43,120 --> 02:33:47,190
don't reclaim that.
Some buying caught into 80s there.

6282
02:33:47,190 --> 02:33:47,200
Some buying caught into 80s there.
 

6283
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:49,750
Some buying caught into 80s there.
And if spy rejects 85, it would be the

6284
02:33:49,750 --> 02:33:49,760
And if spy rejects 85, it would be the
 

6285
02:33:49,760 --> 02:33:56,309
And if spy rejects 85, it would be the
same kind of move.

6286
02:33:56,309 --> 02:33:56,319

 

6287
02:33:56,319 --> 02:33:57,830

Want to be cautious because we have held

6288
02:33:57,830 --> 02:33:57,840
Want to be cautious because we have held
 

6289
02:33:57,840 --> 02:34:00,309
Want to be cautious because we have held
initial balance. It's worth noting. Said

6290
02:34:00,309 --> 02:34:00,319
initial balance. It's worth noting. Said
 

6291
02:34:00,319 --> 02:34:02,389
initial balance. It's worth noting. Said
it's a scalp and if it doesn't want to

6292
02:34:02,389 --> 02:34:02,399
it's a scalp and if it doesn't want to
 

6293
02:34:02,399 --> 02:34:03,990
it's a scalp and if it doesn't want to
do anymore, it doesn't. Just caught

6294
02:34:03,990 --> 02:34:04,000
do anymore, it doesn't. Just caught
 

6295
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,270
do anymore, it doesn't. Just caught
buyers again there. This is looking

6296
02:34:05,270 --> 02:34:05,280
buyers again there. This is looking
 

6297
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:07,349
buyers again there. This is looking
better now.

6298
02:34:07,349 --> 02:34:07,359
better now.
 

6299
02:34:07,359 --> 02:34:08,710
better now.
It's giving me a bit more confidence

6300
02:34:08,710 --> 02:34:08,720
It's giving me a bit more confidence
 

6301
02:34:08,720 --> 02:34:10,469
It's giving me a bit more confidence
that we've just caught buyers twice. I

6302
02:34:10,469 --> 02:34:10,479
that we've just caught buyers twice. I
 

6303
02:34:10,479 --> 02:34:14,150
that we've just caught buyers twice. I
want to see a heavy close though.

6304
02:34:14,150 --> 02:34:14,160
want to see a heavy close though.
 

6305
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:15,590
want to see a heavy close though.
I'm going to close through this

I'm going to close through this
 

6307

I'm going to close through this
imbalance that we just had here at 78.

6308
02:34:17,670 --> 02:34:17,680
imbalance that we just had here at 78.
 

6309
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:19,750
imbalance that we just had here at 78.
So, need a big close here. Start

6359
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:09,590

6361
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:12,070

we can see a wash into 50s. If he stays

6362
02:35:12,070 --> 02:35:12,080
we can see a wash into 50s. If he stays
 

6363
02:35:12,080 --> 02:35:14,389
we can see a wash into 50s. If he stays
stuck, I want to be cautious.

02:35:14,389 --> 02:35:14,399
stuck, I want to be cautious.
 

6365

Buying buyers are stuck at 82. So, you

6378
02:35:32,070 --> 02:35:32,080
Buying buyers are stuck at 82. So, you
 

6379
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:33,349
Buying buyers are stuck at 82. So, you
got a 10-point range here. And they're

6380
02:35:33,349 --> 02:35:33,359
got a 10-point range here. And they're
 

6381
02:35:33,359 --> 02:35:35,349
got a 10-point range here. And they're
starting to see some relief here. SPY is

6382
02:35:35,349 --> 02:35:35,359
starting to see some relief here. SPY is
 

6383
02:35:35,359 --> 02:35:37,270
starting to see some relief here. SPY is
going to go and retest 85 here by the

6384
02:35:37,270 --> 02:35:37,280
going to go and retest 85 here by the
 

6385
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:39,990
going to go and retest 85 here by the
looks of it. And we might retest value

6386
02:35:39,990 --> 02:35:40,000
looks of it. And we might retest value
 

6387
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:41,910
looks of it. And we might retest value
area higher which be sort of 88. So we

6388
02:35:41,910 --> 02:35:41,920
area higher which be sort of 88. So we
 

6389
02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:44,790
area higher which be sort of 88. So we
have an imbalance just above that at 90.

6390
02:35:44,790 --> 02:35:44,800
have an imbalance just above that at 90.
 

6391
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:46,630
have an imbalance just above that at 90.

Still want to lean sellside on this all
 

6393
02:35:46,640 --> 02:35:48,070
Still want to lean sellside on this all
the time. We're leaving that volume

6394
02:35:48,070 --> 02:35:48,080
the time. We're leaving that volume
 

6395
02:35:48,080 --> 02:35:49,990

[\h__\h] his ideas up
can see how the market moves. Like one

6414
02:36:22,469 --> 02:36:22,479
can see how the market moves. Like one
 

6415
02:36:22,479 --> 02:36:23,590
can see how the market moves. Like one
of you's been calling like there's

6416
02:36:23,590 --> 02:36:23,600
of you's been calling like there's
 

6417
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:25,670
of you's been calling like there's
there's a seller at 62 or whatever. Like

6418

6419
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:27,590
there's a seller at 62 or whatever. Like
that that's the problem. That's not an

6420
02:36:27,590 --> 02:36:27,600
that that's the problem. That's not an
 

6421
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:29,429
that that's the problem. That's not an
attraction. That's what ruins the move

6422
02:36:29,429 --> 02:36:29,439
attraction. That's what ruins the move
 

6423
02:36:29,439 --> 02:36:31,670
attraction. That's what ruins the move
when they get caught the wrong side. So,

6424
02:36:31,670 --> 02:36:31,680
when they get caught the wrong side. So,
 

6425
02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:33,030
when they get caught the wrong side. So,
here we go. He got caught and we're

02:36:54,389 --> 02:36:54,399
caught. He allowed this to happen
 

6445
02:36:54,399 --> 02:36:56,309

6448
02:36:58,550 --> 02:36:58,560
drift higher. It's all because of that
 

6449
02:36:58,560 --> 02:37:01,510
drift higher. It's all because of that
player.

6450
02:37:01,510 --> 02:37:01,520

6459
02:37:12,560 --> 02:37:14,469

sell this aggressively or we are going

6460
02:37:14,469 --> 02:37:14,479

02:37:19,670 --> 02:37:19,680
to here by holding this blue box. So you
 

6465
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:22,230
to here by holding this blue box. So you
can see the rotation was from here to

6466
02:37:22,230 --> 02:37:22,240
can see the rotation was from here to
 

6467
02:37:22,240 --> 02:37:23,510
can see the rotation was from here to
here. So I said you have to pay

6469
02:37:23,520 --> 02:37:25,110

02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:26,950
yourself. And now we're starting to
reclaim this. And this is looking more

6472
02:37:26,950 --> 02:37:26,960
reclaim this. And this is looking more
 

6473
02:37:26,960 --> 02:37:29,190
reclaim this. And this is looking more
and more promising because some complete

6474
02:37:29,190 --> 02:37:29,200
and more promising because some complete
 

6475
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:31,349
and more promising because some complete
[\h__\h] decided he was going to sell

6476
02:37:31,349 --> 02:37:31,359
[\h__\h] decided he was going to sell
 

6477
02:37:31,359 --> 02:37:33,270
[\h__\h] decided he was going to sell
with size down here and he's just caused

6478
02:37:33,270 --> 02:37:33,280
with size down here and he's just caused
 

6479
02:37:33,280 --> 02:37:36,630
with size down here and he's just caused
this whole rally. So bears, what I'd say

6480
02:37:36,630 --> 02:37:36,640
this whole rally. So bears, what I'd say
 

6481
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:39,110
this whole rally. So bears, what I'd say
is bears are [\h__\h] They suck at doing

6482
02:37:39,110 --> 02:37:39,120
is bears are [\h__\h] They suck at doing
 

6483
02:37:39,120 --> 02:37:41,429
is bears are [\h__\h] They suck at doing
their job. They just absolutely suck at

6484
02:37:41,429 --> 02:37:41,439
their job. They just absolutely suck at
 

6485
02:37:41,439 --> 02:37:44,389
their job. They just absolutely suck at
doing their job at the moment.

6486
02:37:44,389 --> 02:37:44,399
doing their job at the moment.
 

6487
02:37:44,399 --> 02:37:46,309
doing their job at the moment.
Yeah, nice choice. Same same with me.

6488
02:37:46,309 --> 02:37:46,319
Yeah, nice choice. Same same with me.
 

6489
02:37:46,319 --> 02:37:48,150
Yeah, nice choice. Same same with me.
Same with me. It was a nice win. It was

6490
02:37:48,150 --> 02:37:48,160
Same with me. It was a nice win. It was
 

6491
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:51,349
Same with me. It was a nice win. It was
a small win, but it was a good win. We

6492
02:37:51,349 --> 02:37:51,359
a small win, but it was a good win. We
 

6493
02:37:51,359 --> 02:37:53,910
a small win, but it was a good win. We
just have to wait now.

6494
02:37:53,910 --> 02:37:53,920
just have to wait now.
 

6495
02:37:53,920 --> 02:37:57,270
just have to wait now.
SPY's

6496
02:37:57,270 --> 02:37:57,280

 

6497
02:37:57,280 --> 02:38:00,070

not got back through 685 yet. Just know

6498
02:38:00,070 --> 02:38:00,080
not got back through 685 yet. Just know
 

6499
02:38:00,080 --> 02:38:01,510
not got back through 685 yet. Just know
that it's not through it yet. It's

6500
02:38:01,510 --> 02:38:01,520
that it's not through it yet. It's
 

6501
02:38:01,520 --> 02:38:02,710
that it's not through it yet. It's
tested it. It's like there or

6502
02:38:02,710 --> 02:38:02,720
tested it. It's like there or
 

6503
02:38:02,720 --> 02:38:04,469
tested it. It's like there or
thereabouts.

6504
02:38:04,469 --> 02:38:04,479
thereabouts.
 

6505
02:38:04,479 --> 02:38:06,230
thereabouts.
That's just I would say like I'd use

6506
02:38:06,230 --> 02:38:06,240
That's just I would say like I'd use
 

6507
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:08,309
That's just I would say like I'd use
that as my sentiment for this market.

6508
02:38:08,309 --> 02:38:08,319
that as my sentiment for this market.
 

6509
02:38:08,319 --> 02:38:10,950
that as my sentiment for this market.
Above 85, maybe it wants to go to 88.

6510
02:38:10,950 --> 02:38:10,960
Above 85, maybe it wants to go to 88.
 

6511
02:38:10,960 --> 02:38:14,070
Above 85, maybe it wants to go to 88.
Below 85, maybe there's a rotation. We

6512
02:38:14,070 --> 02:38:14,080
Below 85, maybe there's a rotation. We
 

6513
02:38:14,080 --> 02:38:16,790
Below 85, maybe there's a rotation. We
did talk about that shelf on spy holding

6514
02:38:16,790 --> 02:38:16,800
did talk about that shelf on spy holding
 

6515
02:38:16,800 --> 02:38:19,510
did talk about that shelf on spy holding
into 8450. It's exactly where it held

6516
02:38:19,510 --> 02:38:19,520
into 8450. It's exactly where it held
 

6517
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:21,830
into 8450. It's exactly where it held
and it's starting to reclaim. So it's

6518
02:38:21,830 --> 02:38:21,840
and it's starting to reclaim. So it's
 

6519
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:23,510
and it's starting to reclaim. So it's
holding a higher low on like a 5minute

6520
02:38:23,510 --> 02:38:23,520
holding a higher low on like a 5minute
 

6521
02:38:23,520 --> 02:38:24,790
holding a higher low on like a 5minute
chart. SPY is looking more and more

6522
02:38:24,790 --> 02:38:24,800
chart. SPY is looking more and more
 

6523
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:26,389
chart. SPY is looking more and more
bullish. Two-leg pullback held a higher

6524
02:38:26,389 --> 02:38:26,399
bullish. Two-leg pullback held a higher
 

6525
02:38:26,399 --> 02:38:28,550
bullish. Two-leg pullback held a higher
low can possibly complete rotation. This

6526
02:38:28,550 --> 02:38:28,560
low can possibly complete rotation. This
 

6527
02:38:28,560 --> 02:38:32,630
low can possibly complete rotation. This
is probably going to go 7:30 now.

6528
02:38:32,630 --> 02:38:32,640
is probably going to go 7:30 now.
 

6529
02:38:32,640 --> 02:38:34,790
is probably going to go 7:30 now.
It's all because of like un like

6530
02:38:34,790 --> 02:38:34,800
It's all because of like un like
 

6531
02:38:34,800 --> 02:38:36,710
It's all because of like un like
understanding who's stuck. Like I called

6532
02:38:36,710 --> 02:38:36,720
understanding who's stuck. Like I called
 

6533
02:38:36,720 --> 02:38:38,389
understanding who's stuck. Like I called
it to you here like who's stuck? Why is

6534
02:38:38,389 --> 02:38:38,399
it to you here like who's stuck? Why is
 

6535
02:38:38,399 --> 02:38:39,990
it to you here like who's stuck? Why is
he stuck? What happens when someone's

6536
02:38:39,990 --> 02:38:40,000
he stuck? What happens when someone's
 

6537
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:47,910
he stuck? What happens when someone's
stuck? We go the other way.

6538
02:38:47,910 --> 02:38:47,920

 

6539
02:38:47,920 --> 02:38:50,230

Such a shame. Such a shame. Maybe I

6540
02:38:50,230 --> 02:38:50,240
Such a shame. Such a shame. Maybe I
 

6541
02:38:50,240 --> 02:38:52,230
Such a shame. Such a shame. Maybe I
should have just flipped to a bid there.

6542
02:38:52,230 --> 02:38:52,240
should have just flipped to a bid there.
 

6543
02:38:52,240 --> 02:38:55,429
should have just flipped to a bid there.
Hard to flip to a buy down here. But I

6544
02:38:55,429 --> 02:38:55,439
Hard to flip to a buy down here. But I
 

6545
02:38:55,439 --> 02:38:56,630
Hard to flip to a buy down here. But I
guess it's the same thing. You could buy

6546
02:38:56,630 --> 02:38:56,640
guess it's the same thing. You could buy
 

6547
02:38:56,640 --> 02:38:57,990
guess it's the same thing. You could buy
this and sell this and then hold the

6548
02:38:57,990 --> 02:38:58,000
this and sell this and then hold the
 

6549
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,150
this and sell this and then hold the
runner for this. Same as we sold this,

6550
02:39:00,150 --> 02:39:00,160
runner for this. Same as we sold this,
 

6551
02:39:00,160 --> 02:39:01,670
runner for this. Same as we sold this,
cover this, hold a runner for this. It's

6552
02:39:01,670 --> 02:39:01,680
cover this, hold a runner for this. It's
 

6553
02:39:01,680 --> 02:39:04,630
cover this, hold a runner for this. It's
the same kind of idea.

6554
02:39:04,630 --> 02:39:04,640
the same kind of idea.
 

6555
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:07,670
the same kind of idea.
Those deep pullbacks are holding.

6556
02:39:07,670 --> 02:39:07,680
Those deep pullbacks are holding.
 

6557
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:09,910
Those deep pullbacks are holding.
The question is now, do they hold value?

6558
02:39:09,910 --> 02:39:09,920
The question is now, do they hold value?
 

6559
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:11,590
The question is now, do they hold value?
Now we're above this. Do they hold this

6560
02:39:11,590 --> 02:39:11,600
Now we're above this. Do they hold this
 

6561
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:13,830
Now we're above this. Do they hold this
and complete that move? They should.

6562
02:39:13,830 --> 02:39:13,840
and complete that move? They should.
 

6563
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:15,110
and complete that move? They should.
They should. They've done all the hard

6564
02:39:15,110 --> 02:39:15,120
They should. They've done all the hard
 

6565
02:39:15,120 --> 02:39:16,710
They should. They've done all the hard
work. The hard work is to get back above

6566
02:39:16,710 --> 02:39:16,720
work. The hard work is to get back above
 

6567
02:39:16,720 --> 02:39:19,750
work. The hard work is to get back above
this. They should do this now. In

6568
02:39:19,750 --> 02:39:19,760
this. They should do this now. In
 

6569
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:21,270
this. They should do this now. In
theory, I'm not going to buy it, but

6570
02:39:21,270 --> 02:39:21,280
theory, I'm not going to buy it, but
 

6571
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:29,590
theory, I'm not going to buy it, but
they in theory they should do that.

6572
02:39:29,590 --> 02:39:29,600

 

6573
02:39:29,600 --> 02:39:32,790

It's not an uptrend though, Bit Culture.

6574
02:39:32,790 --> 02:39:32,800
It's not an uptrend though, Bit Culture.
 

6575
02:39:32,800 --> 02:39:36,790
It's not an uptrend though, Bit Culture.
It's a range.

6576
02:39:36,790 --> 02:39:36,800

 

6577
02:39:36,800 --> 02:39:40,309

What part of this

6578
02:39:40,309 --> 02:39:40,319
What part of this
 

6579
02:39:40,319 --> 02:39:47,349
What part of this
is an uptrend?

6580
02:39:47,349 --> 02:39:47,359

 

6581
02:39:47,359 --> 02:39:53,670

It's a range.

6582
02:39:53,670 --> 02:39:53,680

 

6583
02:39:53,680 --> 02:39:55,510

It's a range. It's all it is. What's the

6584
02:39:55,510 --> 02:39:55,520
It's a range. It's all it is. What's the
 

6585
02:39:55,520 --> 02:39:57,349
It's a range. It's all it is. What's the
range rejecting?

6586
02:39:57,349 --> 02:39:57,359
range rejecting?
 

6587
02:39:57,359 --> 02:39:59,030
range rejecting?
Supply,

6588
02:39:59,030 --> 02:39:59,040
Supply,
 

6589
02:39:59,040 --> 02:40:01,990
Supply,
right? It's a range. So, if you want to

6590
02:40:01,990 --> 02:40:02,000
right? It's a range. So, if you want to
 

6591
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:03,429
right? It's a range. So, if you want to
buy this here, you're likely to get

6592
02:40:03,429 --> 02:40:03,439
buy this here, you're likely to get
 

6593
02:40:03,439 --> 02:40:04,790
buy this here, you're likely to get
slapped. If you want to sell this here,

6594
02:40:04,790 --> 02:40:04,800
slapped. If you want to sell this here,
 

6595
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:06,230
slapped. If you want to sell this here,
you're going to get slapped. It's why

6596
02:40:06,230 --> 02:40:06,240
you're going to get slapped. It's why
 

6597
02:40:06,240 --> 02:40:08,070
you're going to get slapped. It's why
you play the edge of a range. It's not a

6598
02:40:08,070 --> 02:40:08,080
you play the edge of a range. It's not a
 

6599
02:40:08,080 --> 02:40:09,590
you play the edge of a range. It's not a
trending market right now. It's a

6600
02:40:09,590 --> 02:40:09,600
trending market right now. It's a
 

6601
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:19,750
trending market right now. It's a
rotational market.

6602
02:40:19,750 --> 02:40:19,760

 

6603
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:22,070

Yeah. Okay. So, you're going to buy this

6604
02:40:22,070 --> 02:40:22,080
Yeah. Okay. So, you're going to buy this
 

6605
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:23,590
Yeah. Okay. So, you're going to buy this
here, are you? Cuz we talked about the

6606
02:40:23,590 --> 02:40:23,600
here, are you? Cuz we talked about the
 

6607
02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:27,030
here, are you? Cuz we talked about the
buys down here. So, Mr. Smart Bollocks,

6608
02:40:27,030 --> 02:40:27,040
buys down here. So, Mr. Smart Bollocks,
 

6609
02:40:27,040 --> 02:40:28,710
buys down here. So, Mr. Smart Bollocks,
you're just you're buying this up here,

6610
02:40:28,710 --> 02:40:28,720
you're just you're buying this up here,
 

6611
02:40:28,720 --> 02:40:30,150
you're just you're buying this up here,
are you? You're buying previous days

6612
02:40:30,150 --> 02:40:30,160
are you? You're buying previous days
 

6613
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:32,950
are you? You're buying previous days
value area high, are you? In supply in

6614
02:40:32,950 --> 02:40:32,960
value area high, are you? In supply in
 

6615
02:40:32,960 --> 02:40:35,110
value area high, are you? In supply in
confirmed supply. Even though I've said

6616
02:40:35,110 --> 02:40:35,120
confirmed supply. Even though I've said
 

6617
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:36,309
confirmed supply. Even though I've said
it's possible it's going to go here.

6618
02:40:36,309 --> 02:40:36,319
it's possible it's going to go here.
 

6619
02:40:36,319 --> 02:40:37,429
it's possible it's going to go here.
Even though you might have just joined

6620
02:40:37,429 --> 02:40:37,439
Even though you might have just joined
 

6621
02:40:37,439 --> 02:40:39,510
Even though you might have just joined
and we talked about the 600 to 700

6622
02:40:39,510 --> 02:40:39,520
and we talked about the 600 to 700
 

6623
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:41,270
and we talked about the 600 to 700
trade, but you're here saying we're

6624
02:40:41,270 --> 02:40:41,280
trade, but you're here saying we're
 

6625
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:48,309
trade, but you're here saying we're
[\h__\h] idiots.

6626
02:40:48,309 --> 02:40:48,319

 

6627
02:40:48,319 --> 02:40:52,230

All right. Good for you, mate.

6628

6629
02:40:52,240 --> 02:40:53,590

I honestly don't know why I bother.

6630
02:40:53,590 --> 02:40:53,600
I honestly don't know why I bother.
 

6631

Yeah, it can be Chris. Absolutely it can

Yeah, it can be Chris. Absolutely it can
be. But we have divergence,

6637
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:14,309

right? Like I've said, I People come in

6638
02:42:14,309 --> 02:42:14,319
right? Like I've said, I People come in
 

6639
02:42:14,319 --> 02:42:15,590
right? Like I've said, I People come in
here at the last minute and then they

6640
02:42:15,590 --> 02:42:15,600
here at the last minute and then they
 

6641
02:42:15,600 --> 02:42:17,429
here at the last minute and then they
want to run their [\h__\h] mouths. I've

6642
02:42:17,429 --> 02:42:17,439
want to run their [\h__\h] mouths. I've
 

6643
02:42:17,439 --> 02:42:20,230
want to run their [\h__\h] mouths. I've
given you the levels since all morning.

6644
02:42:20,230 --> 02:42:20,240

I've talked about the failed breakdown

6646
02:42:22,469 --> 02:42:22,479
I've talked about the failed breakdown
 

6647
02:42:22,479 --> 02:42:24,389
I've talked about the failed breakdown
and not wanting to be short down here

6648
02:42:24,389 --> 02:42:24,399
and not wanting to be short down here
 

6649
02:42:24,399 --> 02:42:28,070
and not wanting to be short down here
and the likelihood of if we fail to hold

It's a range rotation. If you buy here

6662
02:42:39,030 --> 02:42:39,040
It's a range rotation. If you buy here
 

6663

It's a range rotation. If you buy here
to look for that, by all means, do it.

6664
02:42:41,429 --> 02:42:41,439
to look for that, by all means, do it.
 

6665
02:42:41,439 --> 02:42:43,190
to look for that, by all means, do it.
I'm not doing that. That's not what I

6666
02:42:43,190 --> 02:42:43,200
I'm not doing that. That's not what I
 

6667
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:44,870
I'm not doing that. That's not what I
would look for in a range rotational

would look for in a range rotational
 

6669

02:42:47,110 --> 02:42:47,120
market. It's way too risky to do that
 

6671
02:42:47,120 --> 02:42:48,950

for me. But if you want to do that, by
