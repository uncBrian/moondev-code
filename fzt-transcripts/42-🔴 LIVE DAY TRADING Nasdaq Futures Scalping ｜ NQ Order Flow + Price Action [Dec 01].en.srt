great Thanksgiving.
Some nice time off the charts

8
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
Some nice time off the charts
 

9
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,630
Some nice time off the charts
and are relaxed and comfortable feeling

10
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
and are relaxed and comfortable feeling
 

11
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,509
and are relaxed and comfortable feeling
good back on the charts. We got one

12
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
good back on the charts. We got one
 

13
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,790
good back on the charts. We got one
month left to close out this year

14
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
month left to close out this year
 

15
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,670
month left to close out this year
strong. We've had a great year and uh

16
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
strong. We've had a great year and uh
 

17
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,830
strong. We've had a great year and uh
let's just make sure we stick to the

18
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
let's just make sure we stick to the
 

19
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,830
let's just make sure we stick to the
same rules as always. close this week

00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
same rules as always. close this week
 

21
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,869
same rules as always. close this week
out and close this uh year out really

22
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879
out and close this uh year out really
 

23
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,110
out and close this uh year out really
strong. All right, let's have a look at

24
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
strong. All right, let's have a look at
 

25
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,630
strong. All right, let's have a look at
the charts then because uh I haven't

26
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
the charts then because uh I haven't
 

27
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,470
the charts then because uh I haven't
been here for a little bit of time since

28
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
been here for a little bit of time since
 

29
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,149
been here for a little bit of time since
being off with COVID. As you can see

30
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
being off with COVID. As you can see
 

31
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,790
being off with COVID. As you can see
last week, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,

32
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800
last week, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
 

33
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,790
last week, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Friday or Wednesday, Friday I should

34
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:24,800
Friday or Wednesday, Friday I should
 

35
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,350
Friday or Wednesday, Friday I should
say, just a low volume drift up. You can

36
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
say, just a low volume drift up. You can
 

37
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,710
say, just a low volume drift up. You can
see it down here at the bottom of the

38
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
see it down here at the bottom of the
 

39
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,910
see it down here at the bottom of the
screen. Make sure you can see all that.

40
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
screen. Make sure you can see all that.
 

41
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,949
screen. Make sure you can see all that.
All right, very low volume drift higher.

42
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
All right, very low volume drift higher.
 

43
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,869
All right, very low volume drift higher.
All right, one thing to be aware about,

44
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
All right, one thing to be aware about,
 

45
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,550
All right, one thing to be aware about,
there were no bears coming in, but there

46
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
there were no bears coming in, but there
 

47
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,430
there were no bears coming in, but there
was in fact no one joining in at all

48
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
was in fact no one joining in at all
 

49
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,430
was in fact no one joining in at all
really last week, which is why you had

50
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
really last week, which is why you had
 

51
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,430
really last week, which is why you had
decent range. And we've taken out some

52
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
decent range. And we've taken out some
 

53
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,030
decent range. And we've taken out some
of the pivots, filling in some of this

54
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
of the pivots, filling in some of this
 

55
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,589
of the pivots, filling in some of this
imbalance, and this was the area that

56
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:47,599
imbalance, and this was the area that
 

57
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,509
imbalance, and this was the area that
we've been getting stuck in. Right over

58
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
we've been getting stuck in. Right over
 

59
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,910
we've been getting stuck in. Right over
the 500s is the key level. you will see

60
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
the 500s is the key level. you will see
 

61
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,190
the 500s is the key level. you will see
last night is the first time we tapped

62
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
last night is the first time we tapped
 

63
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,710
last night is the first time we tapped
into over those 500s into the 61 or

64
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
into over those 500s into the 61 or
 

65
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,990
into over those 500s into the 61 or
golden zone fib and uh well there were

66
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
golden zone fib and uh well there were
 

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,670
golden zone fib and uh well there were
some sellers waiting up there passively

68
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,680
some sellers waiting up there passively
 

69
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,670
some sellers waiting up there passively
quite clearly on top of that you had the

70
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
quite clearly on top of that you had the
 

71
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,030
quite clearly on top of that you had the
uh JPY bonds breaking out which I've

72
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
uh JPY bonds breaking out which I've
 

73
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,670
uh JPY bonds breaking out which I've
talked extensively about on here. Um I'm

74
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
talked extensively about on here. Um I'm
 

75
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,830
talked extensively about on here. Um I'm
really looking for that trade to come if

76
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:13,840
really looking for that trade to come if
 

77
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,270
really looking for that trade to come if
it's going to come to fruition over the

78
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
it's going to come to fruition over the
 

79
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,069
it's going to come to fruition over the
next two weeks. So, but definitely

80
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
next two weeks. So, but definitely
 

81
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,150
next two weeks. So, but definitely
as it was breaking out last night, you

82
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
as it was breaking out last night, you
 

83
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,230
as it was breaking out last night, you
saw uh a little bit of fear enter the

84
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
saw uh a little bit of fear enter the
 

85
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,950
saw uh a little bit of fear enter the
tape and um off the low volume pulling

86
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
tape and um off the low volume pulling
 

87
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,310
tape and um off the low volume pulling
back. Where are we pulling back to?

88
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
back. Where are we pulling back to?
 

89
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,550
back. Where are we pulling back to?
Well, you can see this cluster here. All

90
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
Well, you can see this cluster here. All
 

91
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,629
Well, you can see this cluster here. All
right, this is uh very interesting here.

92
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
right, this is uh very interesting here.
 

93
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,110
right, this is uh very interesting here.
You have the 5day, 20-day, and 50-day

94
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
You have the 5day, 20-day, and 50-day
 

95
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,430
You have the 5day, 20-day, and 50-day
all at exactly the same point. And guess

96
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
all at exactly the same point. And guess
 

97
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,189
all at exactly the same point. And guess
what? We bottomed off it. All right. So,

98
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
what? We bottomed off it. All right. So,
 

99
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,350
what? We bottomed off it. All right. So,
this is a very interesting area to watch

100
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
this is a very interesting area to watch
 

101
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,749
this is a very interesting area to watch
as an overunder as this week develops. I

102
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
as an overunder as this week develops. I
 

103
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,430
as an overunder as this week develops. I
don't want to be too aggressive on a

104
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
don't want to be too aggressive on a
 

105
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,909
don't want to be too aggressive on a
Monday after a low volume week. There's

106
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
Monday after a low volume week. There's
 

107
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,350
Monday after a low volume week. There's
nothing to say they don't shove it all

108
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
nothing to say they don't shove it all
 

109
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,629
nothing to say they don't shove it all
the way down here. There's nothing that

110
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
the way down here. There's nothing that
 

111
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,310
the way down here. There's nothing that
to say that they don't find a bid to

112
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
to say that they don't find a bid to
 

113
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,270
to say that they don't find a bid to
take it higher. All right, so we just

114
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
take it higher. All right, so we just
 

115
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,870
take it higher. All right, so we just
have to wait and see. What we can say is

116
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
have to wait and see. What we can say is
 

117
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,390
have to wait and see. What we can say is
there were no bears there last week. But

118
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
there were no bears there last week. But
 

119
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,150
there were no bears there last week. But
I'd say this week I'd be looking for

120
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
I'd say this week I'd be looking for
 

121
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,070
I'd say this week I'd be looking for
dips to hold either where we've held or

122
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
dips to hold either where we've held or
 

123
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,790
dips to hold either where we've held or
sort of down into these 975s. All right,

124
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
sort of down into these 975s. All right,
 

125
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,430
sort of down into these 975s. All right,
if we come down into here and we can

126
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
if we come down into here and we can
 

127
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,189
if we come down into here and we can
produce a daily higher low because we

128
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
produce a daily higher low because we
 

129
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,629
produce a daily higher low because we
haven't done that yet because we haven't

130
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
haven't done that yet because we haven't
 

131
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,830
haven't done that yet because we haven't
pulled back. If it is a big if if we can

132
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
pulled back. If it is a big if if we can
 

133
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,830
pulled back. If it is a big if if we can
do that, I'd consider a bullish rotation

134
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
do that, I'd consider a bullish rotation
 

135
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,430
do that, I'd consider a bullish rotation
up to current high of week. And if we

136
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
up to current high of week. And if we
 

137
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,430
up to current high of week. And if we
really get going all the way back up

138
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
really get going all the way back up
 

139
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,710
really get going all the way back up
here, remember we've got relative

140
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720
here, remember we've got relative
 

141
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,350
here, remember we've got relative
strength in the uh spy or the ES versus

142
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
strength in the uh spy or the ES versus
 

143
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,950
strength in the uh spy or the ES versus
this because we've been rotating into

144
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:28,960
this because we've been rotating into
 

145
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,629
this because we've been rotating into
some more defensive sectors which are

146
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
some more defensive sectors which are
 

147
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,390
some more defensive sectors which are
playing catch-up. So the breadth is

148
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
playing catch-up. So the breadth is
 

149
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,310
playing catch-up. So the breadth is
actually getting a little bit bigger

150
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
actually getting a little bit bigger
 

151
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,310
actually getting a little bit bigger
which can be positive for the market. If

152
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
which can be positive for the market. If
 

153
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,990
which can be positive for the market. If
this market just wants to keep slamming

154
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
this market just wants to keep slamming
 

155
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,710
this market just wants to keep slamming
down, then you know this is just nothing

156
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
down, then you know this is just nothing
 

157
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,710
down, then you know this is just nothing
more than a wave up to be slammed back

158
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
more than a wave up to be slammed back
 

159
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,070
more than a wave up to be slammed back
down. But this is what I'm saying. We're

160
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
down. But this is what I'm saying. We're
 

161
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,350
down. But this is what I'm saying. We're
going to have to be somewhat cautious

162
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
going to have to be somewhat cautious
 

163
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,790
going to have to be somewhat cautious
this week. So, I'm watching these areas

164
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
this week. So, I'm watching these areas
 

165
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,469
this week. So, I'm watching these areas
here.

166
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
here.
 

167
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,629
here.
And uh I'm watching those 500s. All

168
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
And uh I'm watching those 500s. All
 

169
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,150
And uh I'm watching those 500s. All
right, let's get into the hourlys. We

170
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
right, let's get into the hourlys. We
 

171
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,550
right, let's get into the hourlys. We
can see a bit more in detail.

172
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560

 

173
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,990

There was actually a very nice trade

174
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
There was actually a very nice trade
 

175
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,430
There was actually a very nice trade
just set up then while I was talking,

176
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
just set up then while I was talking,
 

177
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,070
just set up then while I was talking,
unfortunately. But there we go. Okay.

178
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
unfortunately. But there we go. Okay.
 

179
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,830
unfortunately. But there we go. Okay.
So, in the hourlys down here, this is

180
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
So, in the hourlys down here, this is
 

181
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,550
So, in the hourlys down here, this is
previous week's profile.

182
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
previous week's profile.
 

183
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,469
previous week's profile.
All right. You can see we're currently

184
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
All right. You can see we're currently
 

185
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,270
All right. You can see we're currently
and we just now rejected previous week

186
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
and we just now rejected previous week
 

187
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,350
and we just now rejected previous week
value area high. All right. So, I'd be

188
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
value area high. All right. So, I'd be
 

189
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,990
value area high. All right. So, I'd be
watching this developed profile as well,

190
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
watching this developed profile as well,
 

191
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,790
watching this developed profile as well,
but basically 300. You can see we

192
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
but basically 300. You can see we
 

193
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,950
but basically 300. You can see we
created some liquidity here at 300. This

194
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
created some liquidity here at 300. This
 

195
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,550
created some liquidity here at 300. This
would be on Friday last week, I guess,

196
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
would be on Friday last week, I guess,
 

197
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,110
would be on Friday last week, I guess,
before breaking out. Failing. This is

198
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
before breaking out. Failing. This is
 

199
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,189
before breaking out. Failing. This is
the big supply zone coming back under.

200
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
the big supply zone coming back under.
 

201
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,510
the big supply zone coming back under.
We just failed to reclaim this level

202
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
We just failed to reclaim this level
 

203
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,909
We just failed to reclaim this level
here. This is a level of interest. This

204
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
here. This is a level of interest. This
 

205
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,469
here. This is a level of interest. This
is your probably your overunder

206
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
is your probably your overunder
 

207
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,070
is your probably your overunder
this morning. All right. We can draw it

208
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
this morning. All right. We can draw it
 

209
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,029
this morning. All right. We can draw it
in something like this,

210
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
in something like this,
 

211
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,270
in something like this,
right?

212
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280

 

213
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,189

One more time we're under it.

214
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
One more time we're under it.
 

215
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,950
One more time we're under it.
Potentially fade back down into this

216
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
Potentially fade back down into this
 

217
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,110
Potentially fade back down into this
rotation into the 200s. If we let go of

218
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
rotation into the 200s. If we let go of
 

219
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,270
rotation into the 200s. If we let go of
200, you can see we get very, very thin

220
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
200, you can see we get very, very thin
 

221
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,749
200, you can see we get very, very thin
on the previous week profile. Right.

222
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
on the previous week profile. Right.
 

223
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,469
on the previous week profile. Right.
Make sure you can see this. Yeah. All

224
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
Make sure you can see this. Yeah. All
 

225
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,150
Make sure you can see this. Yeah. All
right. So, we're currently rejecting

226
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
right. So, we're currently rejecting
 

227
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,830
right. So, we're currently rejecting
this. How we act here is going to be

228
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:01,840
this. How we act here is going to be
 

229
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,589
this. How we act here is going to be
key. Is it going to be a look below and

230
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
key. Is it going to be a look below and
 

231
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,309
key. Is it going to be a look below and
fail or are we going to come under, look

232
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
fail or are we going to come under, look
 

233
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,309
fail or are we going to come under, look
below, stay heavy, and complete a

234
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
below, stay heavy, and complete a
 

235
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,110
below, stay heavy, and complete a
rotation down into this sort of 930. And

236
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
rotation down into this sort of 930. And
 

237
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,189
rotation down into this sort of 930. And
from there, I'd be potentially looking

238
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
from there, I'd be potentially looking
 

239
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,189
from there, I'd be potentially looking
for longs, but again, it would need to

240
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
for longs, but again, it would need to
 

241
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,029
for longs, but again, it would need to
put in some structure to come back up.

242
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
put in some structure to come back up.
 

243
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,029
put in some structure to come back up.
I'm less interested in longs all the way

244
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
I'm less interested in longs all the way
 

245
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,430
I'm less interested in longs all the way
down here this week. Um, but would not

246
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
down here this week. Um, but would not
 

247
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,350
down here this week. Um, but would not
surprise me. But if we're going to do

248
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
surprise me. But if we're going to do
 

249
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,950
surprise me. But if we're going to do
some kind of break and come down here,

250
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
some kind of break and come down here,
 

251
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,189
some kind of break and come down here,
that's very heavy momentum. Yes, bulls

252
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:27,199
that's very heavy momentum. Yes, bulls
 

253
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,510
that's very heavy momentum. Yes, bulls
stepped in there last week. But really,

254
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
stepped in there last week. But really,
 

255
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,469
stepped in there last week. But really,
you'd want this or this to hold for

256
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
you'd want this or this to hold for
 

257
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,390
you'd want this or this to hold for
bullish structure to come back up. All

258
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
bullish structure to come back up. All
 

259
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,070
bullish structure to come back up. All
right. I wouldn't really want it to see

260
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
right. I wouldn't really want it to see
 

261
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,550
right. I wouldn't really want it to see
it visit previous week value area low if

262
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
it visit previous week value area low if
 

263
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,510
it visit previous week value area low if
I was a bull, which I'm not really, but

264
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,520
I was a bull, which I'm not really, but
 

265
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,350
I was a bull, which I'm not really, but
we will see. I'm happy to join in on the

266
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
we will see. I'm happy to join in on the
 

267
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,150
we will see. I'm happy to join in on the
bullish side as we set up. All right, so

268
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,160
bullish side as we set up. All right, so
 

269
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,430
bullish side as we set up. All right, so
those are your levels. Make sure you're

270
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
those are your levels. Make sure you're
 

271
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,029
those are your levels. Make sure you're
taking note of all these previous week

272
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:49,039
taking note of all these previous week
 

273
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,469
taking note of all these previous week
and previous day levels. They will

274
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
and previous day levels. They will
 

275
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,150
and previous day levels. They will
become key, especially as we start

276
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
become key, especially as we start
 

277
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,350
become key, especially as we start
getting through this session. But you

278
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,360
getting through this session. But you
 

279
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,029
getting through this session. But you
can see the volume that we created last

280
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
can see the volume that we created last
 

281
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,550
can see the volume that we created last
week. That's what I'm watching as my

282
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
week. That's what I'm watching as my
 

283
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,670
week. That's what I'm watching as my
overunders this morning.

284
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
overunders this morning.
 

285
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,589
overunders this morning.
And let's get into the lower time frame

286
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:01,599
And let's get into the lower time frame
 

287
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,110
And let's get into the lower time frame
and start looking at everything else. So

288
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120
and start looking at everything else. So
 

289
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,230
and start looking at everything else. So
you can see really this is your

290
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
you can see really this is your
 

291
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,990
you can see really this is your
rotation.

292
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
rotation.
 

293
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,350
rotation.
All right. This is based on the previous

294
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
All right. This is based on the previous
 

295
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,909
All right. This is based on the previous
week's profile. Here's your rotation.

296
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
week's profile. Here's your rotation.
 

297
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,670
week's profile. Here's your rotation.
All right. So look above and fail. Look

298
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680
All right. So look above and fail. Look
 

299
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,909
All right. So look above and fail. Look
below and fail. Look above and hold.

300
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:13,919
below and fail. Look above and hold.
 

301
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,589
below and fail. Look above and hold.
Look below and hold. All right. Look

302
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
Look below and hold. All right. Look
 

303
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,469
Look below and hold. All right. Look
above and fail. Look below and fail.

304
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
above and fail. Look below and fail.
 

305
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,150
above and fail. Look below and fail.
Those are the moves. And in here you've

306
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160
Those are the moves. And in here you've
 

307
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,390
Those are the moves. And in here you've
got a 250 point rotation. All right.

308
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
got a 250 point rotation. All right.
 

309
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,790
got a 250 point rotation. All right.
You're pinned in here. Fade the tops.

310
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
You're pinned in here. Fade the tops.
 

311
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,309
You're pinned in here. Fade the tops.
Fade the bottoms. Fade the tops. Fade

312
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
Fade the bottoms. Fade the tops. Fade
 

313
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,749
Fade the bottoms. Fade the tops. Fade
the bottoms until it proves otherwise.

314
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759
the bottoms until it proves otherwise.
 

315
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,869
the bottoms until it proves otherwise.
All right. That's what you're seeing at

316
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879
All right. That's what you're seeing at
 

317
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,670
All right. That's what you're seeing at
the moment. But we are gapping down off

318
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
the moment. But we are gapping down off
 

319
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,909
the moment. But we are gapping down off
that JPY

320
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:33,919
that JPY
 

321
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,269
that JPY
bond trade. All right, that's why see

322
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
bond trade. All right, that's why see
 

323
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,829
bond trade. All right, that's why see
all sorts of traders talking about why

324
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839
all sorts of traders talking about why
 

325
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,550
all sorts of traders talking about why
cryptos gapping down. That's why that's

326
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
cryptos gapping down. That's why that's
 

327
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,389
cryptos gapping down. That's why that's
where the pressure came from. It's not

328
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
where the pressure came from. It's not
 

329
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,230
where the pressure came from. It's not
from some news article or something like

330
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
from some news article or something like
 

331
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,030
from some news article or something like
that. It's genuine sell pressure.

332
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040
that. It's genuine sell pressure.
 

333
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,710
that. It's genuine sell pressure.
Okay, let's have a look at some of the

334
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
Okay, let's have a look at some of the
 

335
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,750
Okay, let's have a look at some of the
other indexes a second. Yes, right.

336
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:53,760
other indexes a second. Yes, right.
 

337
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,990
other indexes a second. Yes, right.
Remember we had relative strength here

338
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000
Remember we had relative strength here
 

339
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,110
Remember we had relative strength here
to five minute. Same kind of story. You

340
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
to five minute. Same kind of story. You
 

341
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,230
to five minute. Same kind of story. You
can see we're finding some bid support

342
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
can see we're finding some bid support
 

343
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,710
can see we're finding some bid support
off here for now. Um, but that's most

344
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
off here for now. Um, but that's most
 

345
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,829
off here for now. Um, but that's most
certainly a failed look above again. So

346
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:07,839
certainly a failed look above again. So
 

347
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,790
certainly a failed look above again. So
860s, no acceptance above previous day

348
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
860s, no acceptance above previous day
 

349
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,430
860s, no acceptance above previous day
high, previous day close. That was a big

350
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
high, previous day close. That was a big
 

351
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,750
high, previous day close. That was a big
wash. You've had one bounce, two bounce.

352
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
wash. You've had one bounce, two bounce.
 

353
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,190
wash. You've had one bounce, two bounce.
Here's now your range. All right. So

354
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
Here's now your range. All right. So
 

355
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,190
Here's now your range. All right. So
very, very similar. So your range you're

356
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
very, very similar. So your range you're
 

357
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,790
very, very similar. So your range you're
looking at, you might as well just call

358
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
looking at, you might as well just call
 

359
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,310
looking at, you might as well just call
it 30 down to 800. So 30 point range

360
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,320
it 30 down to 800. So 30 point range
 

361
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,190
it 30 down to 800. So 30 point range
here. All right. Look below and fail.

362
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
here. All right. Look below and fail.
 

363
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,870
here. All right. Look below and fail.
look above and fail. Those are probably

364
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:28,880
look above and fail. Those are probably
 

365
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,190
look above and fail. Those are probably
going to be the easy trades. Otherwise,

366
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
going to be the easy trades. Otherwise,
 

367
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,269
going to be the easy trades. Otherwise,
if we stay heavy, know you've got

368
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
if we stay heavy, know you've got
 

369
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,470
if we stay heavy, know you've got
liquidity to aim for. 88s.

370
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
liquidity to aim for. 88s.
 

371
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,230
liquidity to aim for. 88s.
That probably needs developing a bit.

372
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
That probably needs developing a bit.
 

373
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,070
That probably needs developing a bit.
Hang on. Let's clean this up a little

374
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
Hang on. Let's clean this up a little
 

375
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,389
Hang on. Let's clean this up a little
bit.

376
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399

 

377
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,870

Yeah, you're way too big, my friend.

378
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880

 

379
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,590

Right.

380
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600

 

381
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,310

That's what I'd be looking at at ES. And

382
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
That's what I'd be looking at at ES. And
 

383
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,269
That's what I'd be looking at at ES. And
we can put a block in up here as well.

384
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
we can put a block in up here as well.
 

385
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,750
we can put a block in up here as well.
900s.

386
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760

 

387
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,509

So, the same thing, exactly the same

388
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
So, the same thing, exactly the same
 

389
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,870
So, the same thing, exactly the same
thing.

390
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880

 

391
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,230

Uh, let's have a quick look at the

392
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
Uh, let's have a quick look at the
 

393
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,910
Uh, let's have a quick look at the
spiders. Very, very clean on the

394
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
spiders. Very, very clean on the
 

395
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,230
spiders. Very, very clean on the
spiders. Big gap down.

396
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
spiders. Big gap down.
 

397
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,550
spiders. Big gap down.
I'd be watching to see how we act at

398
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
I'd be watching to see how we act at
 

399
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,110
I'd be watching to see how we act at
this level here on the spiders. If we're

400
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
this level here on the spiders. If we're
 

401
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,870
this level here on the spiders. If we're
going to stay heavy, think about how

402
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:24,880
going to stay heavy, think about how
 

403
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,030
going to stay heavy, think about how
much you squeezed last week without

404
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
much you squeezed last week without
 

405
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,550
much you squeezed last week without
really putting in much structure. All

406
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,560
really putting in much structure. All
 

407
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,710
really putting in much structure. All
right, this was Friday last week, but as

408
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
right, this was Friday last week, but as
 

409
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,190
right, this was Friday last week, but as
we came into Monday, there's that first

410
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,200
we came into Monday, there's that first
 

411
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,670
we came into Monday, there's that first
dip and grind and grind and grind and

412
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,680
dip and grind and grind and grind and
 

413
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,910
dip and grind and grind and grind and
grind and grind and grind and grind and

414
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
grind and grind and grind and grind and
 

415
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,190
grind and grind and grind and grind and
if we're going to see a failure to

416
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
if we're going to see a failure to
 

417
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,949
if we're going to see a failure to
reclaim, we're probably at least going

418
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
reclaim, we're probably at least going
 

419
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,110
reclaim, we're probably at least going
to come to here. All right, so that's

420
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
to come to here. All right, so that's
 

421
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,949
to come to here. All right, so that's
what I'd be watching. And if they fail

422
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:44,959
what I'd be watching. And if they fail
 

423
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,750
what I'd be watching. And if they fail
there, we'll come deeper.

424
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
there, we'll come deeper.
 

425
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,870
there, we'll come deeper.
Okay, but once we uh come to here, it's

426
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
Okay, but once we uh come to here, it's
 

427
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,110
Okay, but once we uh come to here, it's
possible that we continue this trend. If

428
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
possible that we continue this trend. If
 

429
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,190
possible that we continue this trend. If
they let go, maybe down here, it's still

430
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,200
they let go, maybe down here, it's still
 

431
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,550
they let go, maybe down here, it's still
possible that they continue the trend

432
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
possible that they continue the trend
 

433
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,069
possible that they continue the trend
up, but this some of this needs to be

434
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079
up, but this some of this needs to be
 

435
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,069
up, but this some of this needs to be
washed out. That's a strong buying

436
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
washed out. That's a strong buying
 

437
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,310
washed out. That's a strong buying
channel of no volume like we've talked

438
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
channel of no volume like we've talked
 

439
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,150
channel of no volume like we've talked
about.

440
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
about.
 

441
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,670
about.
Q's exactly the same like we talked

442
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
Q's exactly the same like we talked
 

443
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,949
Q's exactly the same like we talked
about. You can see they're back testing

444
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
about. You can see they're back testing
 

445
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,949
about. You can see they're back testing
that RBS zone. Let's have a quick look

446
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
that RBS zone. Let's have a quick look
 

447
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,550
that RBS zone. Let's have a quick look
at the Dixie. O

448
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560

 

449
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,990

crushed a little bit there as gold

450
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
crushed a little bit there as gold
 

451
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,750
crushed a little bit there as gold
popping them. Yeah, that's a nice

452
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
popping them. Yeah, that's a nice
 

453
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,069
popping them. Yeah, that's a nice
recovery on gold.

454
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:20,079
recovery on gold.
 

455
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,470
recovery on gold.
VIX back into these teens.

456
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
VIX back into these teens.
 

457
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,110
VIX back into these teens.
VIX is due a bid. All right, it is due a

458
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,120
VIX is due a bid. All right, it is due a
 

459
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,949
VIX is due a bid. All right, it is due a
bid just because once we come up to

460
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:28,959
bid just because once we come up to
 

461
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,870
bid just because once we come up to
these 30s and we just go straight down,

462
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
these 30s and we just go straight down,
 

463
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,389
these 30s and we just go straight down,
this is not really normal. Normally,

464
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
this is not really normal. Normally,
 

465
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,230
this is not really normal. Normally,
you'd see like a retest like that. So

466
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
you'd see like a retest like that. So
 

467
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,389
you'd see like a retest like that. So
maybe today we might get something like

468
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
maybe today we might get something like
 

469
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,590
maybe today we might get something like
that. Doesn't have to be the whole way

470
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
that. Doesn't have to be the whole way
 

471
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,350
that. Doesn't have to be the whole way
up, but I'd be watching VIX for a hold

472
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,360
up, but I'd be watching VIX for a hold
 

473
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,110
up, but I'd be watching VIX for a hold
of 17s.

474
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120

 

475
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,870

It's down. Yeah, I'll be watching. Yeah,

476
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
It's down. Yeah, I'll be watching. Yeah,
 

477
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,509
It's down. Yeah, I'll be watching. Yeah,
1740, 1750 is a hold of that. A break

478
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
1740, 1750 is a hold of that. A break
 

479
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,670
1740, 1750 is a hold of that. A break
over 1875 is where we're going to see

480
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
over 1875 is where we're going to see
 

481
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,750
over 1875 is where we're going to see
strength come in. Make sure these are

482
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:53,760
strength come in. Make sure these are
 

483
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,509
strength come in. Make sure these are
all correct.

484
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519
all correct.
 

485
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,878
all correct.
This up a bit.

486
00:11:57,878 --> 00:11:57,888
This up a bit.
 

487
00:11:57,888 --> 00:11:59,350
This up a bit.
[cough] But starting to see that sort of

488
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
[cough] But starting to see that sort of
 

489
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,750
[cough] But starting to see that sort of
turn around on the VIX at least for now.

490
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
turn around on the VIX at least for now.
 

491
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,110
turn around on the VIX at least for now.
At least for now. But I have to see if

492
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
At least for now. But I have to see if
 

493
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,230
At least for now. But I have to see if
it can hold pull back into 1740s. All

494
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
it can hold pull back into 1740s. All
 

495
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,350
it can hold pull back into 1740s. All
right, let's have a look at the mag

496
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360

 

497
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,949

range here at the highs in Apple.

498
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959
range here at the highs in Apple.
 

499
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,509
range here at the highs in Apple.
Looks pretty good. It looks pretty good.

500
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
Looks pretty good. It looks pretty good.
 

501
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,629
Looks pretty good. It looks pretty good.
Obviously, there's a gap down. There's a

502
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
Obviously, there's a gap down. There's a
 

503
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,990
Obviously, there's a gap down. There's a
gap down in the whole market, but we're

504
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
gap down in the whole market, but we're
 

505
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,590
gap down in the whole market, but we're
just in a range here on Apple. Nothing

506
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
just in a range here on Apple. Nothing
 

507
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,990
just in a range here on Apple. Nothing
else,

508
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
else,
 

509
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,629
else,
right? Seeing as a bit of a safe haven

510
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:26,639
right? Seeing as a bit of a safe haven
 

511
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,389
right? Seeing as a bit of a safe haven
in the Mag 7 at the moment because it

512
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:28,399
in the Mag 7 at the moment because it
 

513
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,190
in the Mag 7 at the moment because it
doesn't have too much exposure

514
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
doesn't have too much exposure
 

515
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,750
doesn't have too much exposure
to AI. All right. So where they've

516
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
to AI. All right. So where they've
 

517
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,350
to AI. All right. So where they've
lacked the growth this year, it also

518
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
lacked the growth this year, it also
 

519
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,790
lacked the growth this year, it also
means they lack the exposure. So just

520
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:36,800
means they lack the exposure. So just
 

521
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,629
means they lack the exposure. So just
some consolidation at the highs at the

522
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:38,639
some consolidation at the highs at the
 

523
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,230
some consolidation at the highs at the
moment.

524
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
moment.
 

525
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,069
moment.
Amazon

526
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
Amazon
 

527
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,150
Amazon
pretty much flat. Slight gap down.

528
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
pretty much flat. Slight gap down.
 

529
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,150
pretty much flat. Slight gap down.
That's looking strong. And just zoom

530
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,160
That's looking strong. And just zoom
 

531
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,310
That's looking strong. And just zoom
out.

532
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,320
out.
 

533
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,670
out.
All right. Amazon's got to get back

534
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
All right. Amazon's got to get back
 

535
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,629
All right. Amazon's got to get back
above this level here, 38. All right.

536
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
above this level here, 38. All right.
 

537
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,069
above this level here, 38. All right.
That's where the real strength will come

538
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
That's where the real strength will come
 

539
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,590
That's where the real strength will come
in.

540
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
in.
 

541
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,870
in.
All right. It needs to get back above

542
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880
All right. It needs to get back above
 

543
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,710
All right. It needs to get back above
this and prove itself if it wants to

544
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
this and prove itself if it wants to
 

545
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,629
this and prove itself if it wants to
move higher. Otherwise, this is just a

546
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
move higher. Otherwise, this is just a
 

547
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,629
move higher. Otherwise, this is just a
retracement which can be sold back into.

548
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
retracement which can be sold back into.
 

549
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,550
retracement which can be sold back into.
So, I'd be very cautious about where

550
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
So, I'd be very cautious about where
 

551
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,150
So, I'd be very cautious about where
you're trading Amazon. I don't think

552
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160
you're trading Amazon. I don't think
 

553
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,230
you're trading Amazon. I don't think
it's opening up in a particular great

554
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,240
it's opening up in a particular great
 

555
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,069
it's opening up in a particular great
area right now based on higher time

556
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
area right now based on higher time
 

557
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,230
area right now based on higher time
frame. Possible sell from here to retest

558
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
frame. Possible sell from here to retest
 

559
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,910
frame. Possible sell from here to retest
uh 28s to 25s probably. All right,

560
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920
uh 28s to 25s probably. All right,
 

561
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,629
uh 28s to 25s probably. All right,
Google

562
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
Google
 

563
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,949
Google
consolidating at highs. Yes, lower highs

564
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
consolidating at highs. Yes, lower highs
 

565
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,389
consolidating at highs. Yes, lower highs
and lower lows, but we all know what

566
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
and lower lows, but we all know what
 

567
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,030
and lower lows, but we all know what
this can be. All right. If it wants to

568
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
this can be. All right. If it wants to
 

569
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,670
this can be. All right. If it wants to
keep going, that's alltime highs, is it

570
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
keep going, that's alltime highs, is it
 

571
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,110
keep going, that's alltime highs, is it
for good? Just want to double check.

572
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,120
for good? Just want to double check.
 

573
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,590
for good? Just want to double check.
Yes, it is. All right. So, it's got some

574
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
Yes, it is. All right. So, it's got some
 

575
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,949
Yes, it is. All right. So, it's got some
back fill if it really wants to

576
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
back fill if it really wants to
 

577
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,350
back fill if it really wants to
come back into the 300s. Have we looked

578
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
come back into the 300s. Have we looked
 

579
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,110
come back into the 300s. Have we looked
back there since we broke out? And when

580
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
back there since we broke out? And when
 

581
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,670
back there since we broke out? And when
did we break out? Monday last week. Same

582
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
did we break out? Monday last week. Same
 

583
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,230
did we break out? Monday last week. Same
story. Hasn't looked back. So, we would

584
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
story. Hasn't looked back. So, we would
 

585
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,230
story. Hasn't looked back. So, we would
consider a back fill here. Yeah, we

586
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
consider a back fill here. Yeah, we
 

587
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,750
consider a back fill here. Yeah, we
would absolutely consider a back fill

588
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
would absolutely consider a back fill
 

589
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,590
would absolutely consider a back fill
here on Google. So, again, I wouldn't be

590
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
here on Google. So, again, I wouldn't be
 

591
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,509
here on Google. So, again, I wouldn't be
putting risk on on that right now.

592
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:55,519
putting risk on on that right now.
 

593
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,590
putting risk on on that right now.
It's done the move. Let's see if it can

594
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:57,600
It's done the move. Let's see if it can
 

595
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,829
It's done the move. Let's see if it can
back fill and offer a better setup. But

596
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
back fill and offer a better setup. But
 

597
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,710
back fill and offer a better setup. But
a slight gap down on Goo Meta O. That's

598
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
a slight gap down on Goo Meta O. That's
 

599
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,350
a slight gap down on Goo Meta O. That's
a nastier gap down. All right. You can

600
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
a nastier gap down. All right. You can
 

601
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,110
a nastier gap down. All right. You can
see up here it's left balls trapped at

602
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,120
see up here it's left balls trapped at
 

603
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,910
see up here it's left balls trapped at
highs.

604
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
highs.
 

605
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,230
highs.
Already faded underneath that next pivot

606
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,240
Already faded underneath that next pivot
 

607
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,550
Already faded underneath that next pivot
and it's getting stuck at it. So if Meta

608
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,560
and it's getting stuck at it. So if Meta
 

609
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,350
and it's getting stuck at it. So if Meta
keeps failing 640, there's probably a

610
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
keeps failing 640, there's probably a
 

611
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,110
keeps failing 640, there's probably a
deeper wash. I am long on this. I think

612
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
deeper wash. I am long on this. I think
 

613
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,590
deeper wash. I am long on this. I think
it's from 580 something. I'm small size.

614
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:23,600
it's from 580 something. I'm small size.
 

615
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,590
it's from 580 something. I'm small size.
I bought it all the way down here. Yeah,

616
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
I bought it all the way down here. Yeah,
 

617
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,310
I bought it all the way down here. Yeah,
580 something only small size. Just got

618
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:28,320
580 something only small size. Just got
 

619
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,350
580 something only small size. Just got
a feeler on it, guys. So, about 60 $60

620
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360
a feeler on it, guys. So, about 60 $60
 

621
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,150
a feeler on it, guys. So, about 60 $60
up on that, which is nice. Um,

622
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
up on that, which is nice. Um,
 

623
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,910
up on that, which is nice. Um,
same story here on Microsoft, right?

624
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
same story here on Microsoft, right?
 

625
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,030
same story here on Microsoft, right?
Trapping bulls at these highs right now,

626
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,040
Trapping bulls at these highs right now,
 

627
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,030
Trapping bulls at these highs right now,
coming back down into a level where it

628
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,040
coming back down into a level where it
 

629
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,790
coming back down into a level where it
can find consolidation. Remember, tops

630
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
can find consolidation. Remember, tops
 

631
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,030
can find consolidation. Remember, tops
can take time to develop, right? This

632
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
can take time to develop, right? This
 

633
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,269
can take time to develop, right? This
can take time to build out this week if

634
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:49,279
can take time to build out this week if
 

635
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,949
can take time to build out this week if
it is going to need a deeper wash. They

636
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:50,959
it is going to need a deeper wash. They
 

637
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,269
it is going to need a deeper wash. They
don't all have to do it. the, you know,

638
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:53,279
don't all have to do it. the, you know,
 

639
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,710
don't all have to do it. the, you know,
the sound of the bell on a Monday

640
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
the sound of the bell on a Monday
 

641
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,150
the sound of the bell on a Monday
morning. It can take time for some of

642
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,160
morning. It can take time for some of
 

643
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,710
morning. It can take time for some of
this to develop. Nvidia, that doesn't

644
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
this to develop. Nvidia, that doesn't
 

645
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,030
this to develop. Nvidia, that doesn't
look too good.

646
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040
look too good.
 

647
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,870
look too good.
That does not look too good. Let me zoom

648
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:02,880
That does not look too good. Let me zoom
 

649
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,230
That does not look too good. Let me zoom
out. All right, everyone looking for

650
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,240
out. All right, everyone looking for
 

651
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,230
out. All right, everyone looking for
that Nvidia recovery. Jensen trying to

652
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
that Nvidia recovery. Jensen trying to
 

653
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,509
that Nvidia recovery. Jensen trying to
hold everything up, but uh

654
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519

 

655
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,590

we keep failing reattempts here. So,

656
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
we keep failing reattempts here. So,
 

657
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,590
we keep failing reattempts here. So,
where was last week? Monday.

658
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
where was last week? Monday.
 

659
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,550
where was last week? Monday.
Yeah,

660
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:20,560
Yeah,
 

661
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,550
Yeah,
I'm not too convinced on Nvidia right

662
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
I'm not too convinced on Nvidia right
 

663
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,389
I'm not too convinced on Nvidia right
now.

664
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:24,399
now.
 

665
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,790
now.
That is getting sold into on every push

666
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
That is getting sold into on every push
 

667
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,870
That is getting sold into on every push
still. Yes, it's basing out a little

668
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:28,880
still. Yes, it's basing out a little
 

669
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,590
still. Yes, it's basing out a little
bit, but uh it's probably quite a long

670
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
bit, but uh it's probably quite a long
 

671
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,750
bit, but uh it's probably quite a long
way down.

672
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:33,760
way down.
 

673
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:40,310
way down.
Just zoom out here. Give this a second.

674
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320

 

675
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,949

Yeah, you want to be careful there. You

676
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:42,959
Yeah, you want to be careful there. You
 

677
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,030
Yeah, you want to be careful there. You
want to be careful. There's your top.

678
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,040
want to be careful. There's your top.
 

679
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,110
want to be careful. There's your top.
And every attempt to get back into that

680
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,120
And every attempt to get back into that
 

681
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,269
And every attempt to get back into that
range is being sold into so far. If we

682
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
range is being sold into so far. If we
 

683
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,550
range is being sold into so far. If we
start losing 64s, uh, we can come and

684
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
start losing 64s, uh, we can come and
 

685
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,269
start losing 64s, uh, we can come and
back fill some of this. Right. So, every

686
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
back fill some of this. Right. So, every
 

687
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,749
back fill some of this. Right. So, every
time we've come down into 60s, 70s and

688
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:57,759
time we've come down into 60s, 70s and
 

689
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,590
time we've come down into 60s, 70s and
60s, it's found a bid so far. But the

690
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,600
60s, it's found a bid so far. But the
 

691
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,910
60s, it's found a bid so far. But the
fact that we're not reclaiming 95s is

692
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
fact that we're not reclaiming 95s is
 

693
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,670
fact that we're not reclaiming 95s is
saying a lot right now. It's attempted

694
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680
saying a lot right now. It's attempted
 

695
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,189
saying a lot right now. It's attempted
one, two, three times doesn't look too

696
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:07,199
one, two, three times doesn't look too
 

697
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,030
one, two, three times doesn't look too
great to me. Tesla

698
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
great to me. Tesla
 

699
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,629
great to me. Tesla
just trying to build out liquidity here,

700
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
just trying to build out liquidity here,
 

701
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,150
just trying to build out liquidity here,
isn't it? Very simple. trying to build

702
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
isn't it? Very simple. trying to build
 

703
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,030
isn't it? Very simple. trying to build
out liquidity back up here to go and

704
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,040
out liquidity back up here to go and
 

705
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,870
out liquidity back up here to go and
break these highs. And that's what it's

706
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880
break these highs. And that's what it's
 

707
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,949
break these highs. And that's what it's
looking to do.

708
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:20,959
looking to do.
 

709
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,189
looking to do.
Is that an old gap? Has it filled it?

710
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
Is that an old gap? Has it filled it?
 

711
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,870
Is that an old gap? Has it filled it?
Yeah, filled an old gap. Consolidation

712
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:26,880
Yeah, filled an old gap. Consolidation
 

713
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,790
Yeah, filled an old gap. Consolidation
looks okay.

714
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:32,800

 

715
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,629

Definitely a failed attempt on Friday.

716
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:34,639
Definitely a failed attempt on Friday.
 

717
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,509
Definitely a failed attempt on Friday.
So maybe pull back into 420, which has

718
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:37,519
So maybe pull back into 420, which has
 

719
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,189
So maybe pull back into 420, which has
been the level for as long as I can

720
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
been the level for as long as I can
 

721
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,590
been the level for as long as I can
remember now. As you're over under.

722
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
remember now. As you're over under.
 

723
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,189
remember now. As you're over under.
Let's have a look at Oracle. Just give

724
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199
Let's have a look at Oracle. Just give
 

725
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,389
Let's have a look at Oracle. Just give
me an idea of Gordon name as

726
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399

 

727
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,310

AMD.

728
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:52,320

 

729
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,550

Big gap down on AMD.

730
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:58,560

 

731
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,629

Still holding range there. It's tricky

732
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
Still holding range there. It's tricky
 

733
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,389
Still holding range there. It's tricky
out there, folks. It's definitely

734
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:02,399
out there, folks. It's definitely
 

735
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:08,630
out there, folks. It's definitely
tricky.

736
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640

 

737
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,549

I think for me, I just want to let this

738
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
I think for me, I just want to let this
 

739
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,549
I think for me, I just want to let this
develop this morning. You've got the

740
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
develop this morning. You've got the
 

741
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,750
develop this morning. You've got the
levels in here. Like we said, that

742
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
levels in here. Like we said, that
 

743
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,029
levels in here. Like we said, that
previous week value area high was

744
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039
previous week value area high was
 

745
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,309
previous week value area high was
probably a short while I was talking.

746
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:16,319
probably a short while I was talking.
 

747
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,230
probably a short while I was talking.
There you go. So, it's rejecting value

748
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,240
There you go. So, it's rejecting value
 

749
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,189
There you go. So, it's rejecting value
from last week so far. [snorts]

750
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:23,199

 

751
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,189

So, we're inside previous week's value,

752
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:25,199
So, we're inside previous week's value,
 

753
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,750
So, we're inside previous week's value,
rejecting the highs from last week. We

754
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
rejecting the highs from last week. We
 

755
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,950
rejecting the highs from last week. We
are outside previous days value. So, we

756
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
are outside previous days value. So, we
 

757
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,350
are outside previous days value. So, we
might see some further weakness to start

758
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360
might see some further weakness to start
 

759
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,110
might see some further weakness to start
the day, but we will have to just see

760
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,120
the day, but we will have to just see
 

761
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,909
the day, but we will have to just see
how we act because we're in these ranges

762
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:37,919
how we act because we're in these ranges
 

763
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,990
how we act because we're in these ranges
from the previous sessions. All right.

764
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,000
from the previous sessions. All right.
 

765
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,990
from the previous sessions. All right.
right here.

766
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
right here.
 

767
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,909
right here.
And I kind of just want to let it open

768
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919
And I kind of just want to let it open
 

769
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,310
And I kind of just want to let it open
and make its decision. Let's say

770
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
and make its decision. Let's say
 

771
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,150
and make its decision. Let's say
we can decide what's next. Oh, I forgot

772
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
we can decide what's next. Oh, I forgot
 

773
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,070
we can decide what's next. Oh, I forgot
my uh

774
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,080
my uh
 

775
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,590
my uh
forgot my water. Good morning. Not going

776
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:53,600
forgot my water. Good morning. Not going
 

777
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,470
forgot my water. Good morning. Not going
to get a chance to go through all the

778
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
to get a chance to go through all the
 

779
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,390
to get a chance to go through all the
good mornings. Market's now open. Let's

780
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
good mornings. Market's now open. Let's
 

781
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,710
good mornings. Market's now open. Let's

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,390
were here for the pre-market show, what
did we talk about? Look above and fail.

1104
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:30,400
did we talk about? Look above and fail.
 

1105
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,390
did we talk about? Look above and fail.
Look below and fail. Look above and

1106
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:32,400
Look below and fail. Look above and
 

1107
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,350
Look below and fail. Look above and
fail. Look below and fail for that turn

1108
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:35,360
fail. Look below and fail for that turn
 

1109
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,909
fail. Look below and fail for that turn
in. Those are my sort of first thoughts

1110
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:37,919
in. Those are my sort of first thoughts
 

1111
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,149
in. Those are my sort of first thoughts
at the moment.

1112
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:40,159
at the moment.
 

1113
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,750
at the moment.
We didn't quite get up to where I wanted

1114
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:41,760
We didn't quite get up to where I wanted
 

1115
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,029
We didn't quite get up to where I wanted
and you're starting to see them slam

1116
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:43,039
and you're starting to see them slam
 

1117
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,870
and you're starting to see them slam
that door a little bit early. So maybe

1118
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:44,880
that door a little bit early. So maybe
 

1119
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,630
that door a little bit early. So maybe
the sign was there this morning. Same

1120
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:46,640
the sign was there this morning. Same
 

1121
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,990
the sign was there this morning. Same
kind of thing. But here you go. So

1122
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,000
kind of thing. But here you go. So
 

1123
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,149
kind of thing. But here you go. So
that's why I said 300's your over under

1124
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:50,159
that's why I said 300's your over under
 

1125
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,669
that's why I said 300's your over under
your previous week value area high.

1126
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:51,679
your previous week value area high.
 

1127
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,590
your previous week value area high.
We've just gone back above it, failed,

1128
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:53,600
We've just gone back above it, failed,
 

1129
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,350
We've just gone back above it, failed,
come back below, back to the New York

1130
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:55,360
come back below, back to the New York
 

1131
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,630
come back below, back to the New York
open. You can see all we're doing here

1132
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:56,640
open. You can see all we're doing here
 

1133
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,149
open. You can see all we're doing here
is building out a range. We're not

1134
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:58,159
is building out a range. We're not
 

1135
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,909
is building out a range. We're not
getting above previous week value area

1136
00:27:59,909 --> 00:27:59,919
getting above previous week value area
 

1137
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,630
getting above previous week value area
high. We've not come back below the New

1138
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:02,640
high. We've not come back below the New
 

1139
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,310
high. We've not come back below the New
York open. Right? This is the range. If

1140
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,320
York open. Right? This is the range. If
 

1141
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,830
York open. Right? This is the range. If
they keep selling this, we're going to

1142
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:05,840
they keep selling this, we're going to
 

1143
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,269
they keep selling this, we're going to
rotate into here. So there might be a

1144
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:07,279
rotate into here. So there might be a
 

1145
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,350
rotate into here. So there might be a
short coming soon, but just think about

1146
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,360
short coming soon, but just think about
 

1147
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,950
short coming soon, but just think about
what we've done. This is all we've done

1148
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:10,960
what we've done. This is all we've done
 

1149
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,029
what we've done. This is all we've done
this morning. All right? There's no real

1150
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:13,039
this morning. All right? There's no real
 

1151
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,630
this morning. All right? There's no real
trade in there for me. There's not that

1152
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:14,640
trade in there for me. There's not that
 

1153
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,029
trade in there for me. There's not that
much edge. I want to fade up here to the

1154
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:17,039
much edge. I want to fade up here to the
 

1155
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,070
much edge. I want to fade up here to the
blue box. But once we came here, I

1156
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,080
blue box. But once we came here, I
 

1157
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,430
blue box. But once we came here, I
really just wanted them to take that

1158
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:21,440
really just wanted them to take that
 

1159
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,110
really just wanted them to take that
out.

1160
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,120
out.
 

1161
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,710
out.
I probably just missed a trigger there

1162
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:24,720
I probably just missed a trigger there
 

1163
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:33,830
I probably just missed a trigger there
to be honest. That downside

1164
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:33,840

 

1165
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,830

probably missed a trigger there. It's

1166
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:35,840
probably missed a trigger there. It's
 

1167
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:43,430
probably missed a trigger there. It's
okay.

1168
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,440

 

1169
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,590

Yeah, 10 o'clock

1170
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:45,600
Yeah, 10 o'clock
 

1171
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,669
Yeah, 10 o'clock
uh 9 9:45 and 10 o'clock, isn't it? I

1172
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:47,679
uh 9 9:45 and 10 o'clock, isn't it? I
 

1173
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,350
uh 9 9:45 and 10 o'clock, isn't it? I
put it in Discord this morning. Let's

1174
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:49,360
put it in Discord this morning. Let's
 

1175
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,990
put it in Discord this morning. Let's
have a look. [snorts]

1176
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,000
have a look. [snorts]
 

1177
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,590
have a look. [snorts]
Yes. Uh PMI 9:45 and 10:00 and then PAL

1178
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:55,600
Yes. Uh PMI 9:45 and 10:00 and then PAL
 

1179
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,470
Yes. Uh PMI 9:45 and 10:00 and then PAL
tonight at 8:00 8:00 p.m. There's your

1180
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:58,480
tonight at 8:00 8:00 p.m. There's your
 

1181
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,070
tonight at 8:00 8:00 p.m. There's your
weakness. I probably just missed that

1182
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,080
weakness. I probably just missed that
 

1183
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,310
weakness. I probably just missed that
while I was talking.

1184
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:02,320
while I was talking.
 

1185
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,750
while I was talking.
That was it. All right. There's the

1186
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:03,760
That was it. All right. There's the
 

1187
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,750
That was it. All right. There's the
grind up. That's the look into supply.

1188
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:05,760
grind up. That's the look into supply.
 

1189
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,269
grind up. That's the look into supply.
There's the failure. There's the failed

1190
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:07,279
There's the failure. There's the failed
 

1191
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,269
There's the failure. There's the failed
to reclaim previous week value. And back

1192
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:09,279
to reclaim previous week value. And back
 

1193
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,070
to reclaim previous week value. And back
down we go to blue box.

1194
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,080
down we go to blue box.
 

1195
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,950
down we go to blue box.
I probably just missed.

1196
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:14,960
I probably just missed.
 

1197
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,310
I probably just missed.
It's a good trade actually. It's about

1198
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:16,320
It's a good trade actually. It's about
 

1199
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,870
It's a good trade actually. It's about
60 points in that.

1200
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:18,880
60 points in that.
 

1201
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,549
60 points in that.
Oh, but Matt, why why are we playing

1202
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:20,559
Oh, but Matt, why why are we playing
 

1203
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:30,149
Oh, but Matt, why why are we playing
these games and not catching up again?

1204
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:30,159

 

1205
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,909

Yeah, just in balance right now. I would

1206
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:31,919
Yeah, just in balance right now. I would
 

1207
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,669
Yeah, just in balance right now. I would
say if you zoom out you will see that we

1208
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:35,679
say if you zoom out you will see that we
 

1209
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,510
say if you zoom out you will see that we
will get further moves if we get

1210
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:37,520
will get further moves if we get
 

1211
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,070
will get further moves if we get
sustained auctions underneath the blue

1212
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
sustained auctions underneath the blue
 

1213
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,070
sustained auctions underneath the blue
box for a rotation back down or

1214
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,080
box for a rotation back down or
 

1215
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,430
box for a rotation back down or
sustained auctions above here. All right

1216
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:45,440
sustained auctions above here. All right
 

1217
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,590
sustained auctions above here. All right
for a move back up towards those 500s.

1218
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:47,600
for a move back up towards those 500s.
 

1219
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,110
for a move back up towards those 500s.
But right now we're just trading between

1220
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,120
But right now we're just trading between
 

1221
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,870
But right now we're just trading between
red box and blue box. That's all you've

1222
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:50,880
red box and blue box. That's all you've
 

1223
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,310
red box and blue box. That's all you've
got right now. That's all that's

1224
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,320
got right now. That's all that's
 

1225
00:29:52,320 --> 00:30:00,470
got right now. That's all that's
available.

1226
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:00,480

 

1227
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,990

How am I feeling? Not too bad. I'm I'm

1228
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,000
How am I feeling? Not too bad. I'm I'm
 

1229
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,549
How am I feeling? Not too bad. I'm I'm
very weak still, but uh pretty pretty

1230
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:04,559
very weak still, but uh pretty pretty
 

1231
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,789
very weak still, but uh pretty pretty
much better, but just not not full of

1232
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:06,799
much better, but just not not full of
 

1233
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,470
much better, but just not not full of
energy yet.

1234
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:10,480

 

1235
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,710

A little bit of COVID left, I guess. But

1236
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:12,720
A little bit of COVID left, I guess. But
 

1237
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,590
A little bit of COVID left, I guess. But
uh just the weakness, nothing else.

1238
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:15,600
uh just the weakness, nothing else.
 

1239
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:22,230
uh just the weakness, nothing else.
Other than that, I feel all right.

1240
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:22,240

 

1241
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,870

Just trading around that New York open.

1242
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:26,880

 

1243
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,909

Should have, would have, could have on

1244
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:27,919
Should have, would have, could have on
 

1245
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,350
Should have, would have, could have on
the fade for that. But look, all the

1246
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,360
the fade for that. But look, all the
 

1247
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,990
the fade for that. But look, all the
flow zones flat. New York flat. New York

1248
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,000
flow zones flat. New York flat. New York
 

1249
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,510
flow zones flat. New York flat. New York
view up flat. We're in 95 points of

1250
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:35,520
view up flat. We're in 95 points of
 

1251
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,510
view up flat. We're in 95 points of
range so far. Not too bad. Back down

1252
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:37,520
range so far. Not too bad. Back down
 

1253
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,269
range so far. Not too bad. Back down
towards this blue box. So, red box to

1254
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:39,279
towards this blue box. So, red box to
 

1255
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,310
towards this blue box. So, red box to
blue box like we talked about

1256
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,320
blue box like we talked about
 

1257
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,630
blue box like we talked about
pre-market. I'd say the best move was

1258
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:42,640
pre-market. I'd say the best move was
 

1259
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,389
pre-market. I'd say the best move was
this. We should have paid this. All

1260
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:44,399
this. We should have paid this. All
 

1261
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,789
this. We should have paid this. All
right, let that come in. That's the only

1262
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:46,799
right, let that come in. That's the only
 

1263
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,190
right, let that come in. That's the only
time today we've had decent RR for this

1264
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,200
time today we've had decent RR for this
 

1265
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,310
time today we've had decent RR for this
move down into here. They might very

1266
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,320
move down into here. They might very
 

1267
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,389
move down into here. They might very
well bid back off this and reclaim this

1268
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:54,399
well bid back off this and reclaim this
 

1269
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,070
well bid back off this and reclaim this
and go back that side if they want.

1270
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,080
and go back that side if they want.
 

1271
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,310
and go back that side if they want.
Tesla back red again and selling harder

1272
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:00,320
Tesla back red again and selling harder
 

1273
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,070
Tesla back red again and selling harder
now. So three quarters of a percent

1274
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,080
now. So three quarters of a percent
 

1275
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,149
now. So three quarters of a percent
down. So that went red to green and they

1276
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:04,159
down. So that went red to green and they
 

1277
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,909
down. So that went red to green and they
shut the door on it. So worth noting

1278
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:05,919
shut the door on it. So worth noting
 

1279
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,430
shut the door on it. So worth noting
that Amazon pulling back now as well.

1280
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:07,440
that Amazon pulling back now as well.
 

1281
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,029
that Amazon pulling back now as well.

00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:11,039
We've got couple minutes left in news.
 

1283

We've got couple minutes left in news.
Here's low of day expanding low of day

1284
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:13,039
Here's low of day expanding low of day
 

1285
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,710
Here's low of day expanding low of day
now. And if they want to come down into

1286
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:14,720
now. And if they want to come down into
 

1287
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,470
now. And if they want to come down into
190s, they will. That's your uh GlobeEx

1288
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:18,480
190s, they will. That's your uh GlobeEx
 

1289
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,950
190s, they will. That's your uh GlobeEx
low.

1290
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:24,960

 

1291
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,269

So 200s here like we said 190s would be

1292
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:27,279
So 200s here like we said 190s would be
 

1293
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,430
So 200s here like we said 190s would be
that GloEx low. I'm kicking myself for

1294
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:29,440
that GloEx low. I'm kicking myself for
 

1295
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:37,190
that GloEx low. I'm kicking myself for
not taking that trade.

1296
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,200

 

1297
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,029

They keep rejecting New York open

1298
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
They keep rejecting New York open
 

1299
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,870
They keep rejecting New York open
without taking Gloex and I think you'll

1300
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:40,880
without taking Gloex and I think you'll
 

1301
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,750
without taking Gloex and I think you'll
probably get down into it.

1302
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:43,760
probably get down into it.
 

1303
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,669
probably get down into it.
So we missed GlobeEx high failed the

1304
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:45,679
So we missed GlobeEx high failed the
 

1305
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,070
So we missed GlobeEx high failed the
rotation for GloEx high. Got buyers got

1306
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,080
rotation for GloEx high. Got buyers got
 

1307
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,590
rotation for GloEx high. Got buyers got
stuck up there coming for GlobeEx low

1308
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:49,600
stuck up there coming for GlobeEx low
 

1309
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,990
stuck up there coming for GlobeEx low
which is the orange line on your screen.

1310
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,000
which is the orange line on your screen.
 

1311
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,990
which is the orange line on your screen.
So, if the next push fails the New York

1312
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,000
So, if the next push fails the New York
 

1313
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,630
So, if the next push fails the New York
open, the blue line, and I would imagine

1314
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:56,640
open, the blue line, and I would imagine
 

1315
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,389
open, the blue line, and I would imagine
they would go for Globeex low, but yeah,

1316
00:31:58,389 --> 00:31:58,399
they would go for Globeex low, but yeah,
 

1317
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,990
they would go for Globeex low, but yeah,
you've got news coming out here in 50

1318
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,000
you've got news coming out here in 50
 

1319
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,470
you've got news coming out here in 50
seconds. Just be aware.

1320
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:04,480

 

1321
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,950

We did leave some delta stuck above

1322
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:06,960
We did leave some delta stuck above
 

1323
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,350
We did leave some delta stuck above
315s. So, there are buyers stuck up

1324
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:09,360
315s. So, there are buyers stuck up
 

1325
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,509
315s. So, there are buyers stuck up
there.

1326
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:11,519
there.
 

1327
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,070
there.
And again,

1328
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,080
And again,
 

1329
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,029
And again,
they tried to join in 260s to 280s and

1330
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:17,039
they tried to join in 260s to 280s and
 

1331
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,110
they tried to join in 260s to 280s and
got sold into.

1332
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,120
got sold into.
 

1333
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,430
got sold into.
And I'll say there are sellers stuck at

1334
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:21,440
And I'll say there are sellers stuck at
 

1335
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,230
And I'll say there are sellers stuck at
the lows right now into 214. So just

1336
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,240
the lows right now into 214. So just
 

1337
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,110
the lows right now into 214. So just
that rotation that rotational market

1338
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,120
that rotation that rotational market
 

1339
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,630
that rotation that rotational market
very very present this morning. Probably

1340
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:28,640
very very present this morning. Probably
 

1341
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,310
very very present this morning. Probably
a lot of people like me just waiting to

1342
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:30,320
a lot of people like me just waiting to
 

1343
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,149
a lot of people like me just waiting to
see how we develop this week before we

1344
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:32,159
see how we develop this week before we
 

1345
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,230
see how we develop this week before we
go risk on

1346
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,240

 

1347
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,870

especially after a thin volume week.

1348
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:40,880
especially after a thin volume week.
 

1349
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,549
especially after a thin volume week.
Yeah. If you just zoom out remember the

1350
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:42,559
Yeah. If you just zoom out remember the
 

1351
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,710
Yeah. If you just zoom out remember the
high time frame

1352
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:44,720
high time frame
 

1353
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,870
high time frame
why we're looking at this. We just think

1354
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:46,880
why we're looking at this. We just think
 

1355
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,470
why we're looking at this. We just think
about what we did in the previous week,

1356
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:48,480
about what we did in the previous week,
 

1357
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,470
about what we did in the previous week,
right? You got a node here and a node

1358
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:50,480
right? You got a node here and a node
 

1359
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,230
right? You got a node here and a node
here and here's the low vault. And we're

1360
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:52,240
here and here's the low vault. And we're
 

1361
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,950
here and here's the low vault. And we're
just trading between these until we get

1362
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:54,960
just trading between these until we get
 

1363
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,110
just trading between these until we get
a look below and fail or look above and

1364
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,120
a look below and fail or look above and
 

1365
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,269
a look below and fail or look above and
fail or look below and a wash or a look

1366
00:32:59,269 --> 00:32:59,279
fail or look below and a wash or a look
 

1367
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,190
fail or look below and a wash or a look
above and a squeeze. Then we're just

1368
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,200
above and a squeeze. Then we're just
 

1369
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,630
above and a squeeze. Then we're just
going to keep building liquidity in this

1370
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:02,640
going to keep building liquidity in this
 

1371
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,029
going to keep building liquidity in this
sort of 150 odd point range. Right?

1372
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:05,039
sort of 150 odd point range. Right?
 

1373
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,029
sort of 150 odd point range. Right?
That's all we're doing right now is

1374
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:07,039
That's all we're doing right now is
 

1375
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,110
That's all we're doing right now is
creating liquidity

1376
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,120
creating liquidity
 

1377
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,509
creating liquidity
that test this New York open. So if they

1378
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:11,519
that test this New York open. So if they
 

1379
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,269
that test this New York open. So if they
fail this, there is potentially a trade

1380
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:13,279
fail this, there is potentially a trade
 

1381
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,430
fail this, there is potentially a trade
down to here. But got this news should

1382
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:15,440
down to here. But got this news should
 

1383
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,430
down to here. But got this news should
be dropping right now. So, who knows?

1384
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:19,440
be dropping right now. So, who knows?
 

1385
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:27,110
be dropping right now. So, who knows?
Get that up.

1386
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,120

 

1387
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,830

Came in pretty much in line. 52.2 versus

1388
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:29,840
Came in pretty much in line. 52.2 versus
 

1389
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,470
Came in pretty much in line. 52.2 versus
51.9. That's pretty much in line for the

1390
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:32,480
51.9. That's pretty much in line for the
 

1391
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,630
51.9. That's pretty much in line for the
manufacturing.

1392
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:34,640
manufacturing.
 

1393
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,909
manufacturing.
Let's squeeze all the way back up. Now,

1394
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:37,919
Let's squeeze all the way back up. Now,
 

1395
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,750
Let's squeeze all the way back up. Now,
we come and test this wick high here at

1396
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:39,760
we come and test this wick high here at
 

1397
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,830
we come and test this wick high here at
85. Like we said, the buyers did try 65

1398
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:43,840
85. Like we said, the buyers did try 65
 

1399
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,230
85. Like we said, the buyers did try 65
to 80s. And if we get through 80s,

1400
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:46,240
to 80s. And if we get through 80s,
 

1401
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,830
to 80s. And if we get through 80s,
potentially squeeze back up towards a

1402
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:47,840
potentially squeeze back up towards a
 

1403
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,830
potentially squeeze back up towards a
higher day as we just go from one side

1404
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:49,840
higher day as we just go from one side
 

1405
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,750
higher day as we just go from one side
to the other side. Neither side

1406
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:51,760
to the other side. Neither side
 

1407
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,909
to the other side. Neither side
completing a rotation. So, no rejection

1408
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:53,919
completing a rotation. So, no rejection
 

1409
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,190
completing a rotation. So, no rejection

So if they want to complete this

So if they want to complete this
 

1457

right. Can it complete rotation now into
here? 350. If it takes out 350 and

here? 350. If it takes out 350 and
 

1475
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,470
here? 350. If it takes out 350 and
squeezes, I will watch previous day

1476
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:00,480
squeezes, I will watch previous day
 

1477

1556
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:45,200
exchange like the CME. There should
 

1557
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,510
exchange like the CME. There should
never be a difference, but there we go.

1558
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:47,520
never be a difference, but there we go.

rotation now and take out this 44s here,

1562
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:51,680
rotation now and take out this 44s here,
 

1563
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,190
rotation now and take out this 44s here,
basically the 50s. And then I'll be

1564
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,200
basically the 50s. And then I'll be
 

1565
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,550
basically the 50s. And then I'll be
watching to see if they fade these

1566
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:54,560
watching to see if they fade these
 

1567
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:01,990
watching to see if they fade these
levels from Friday.

1568
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,000

 

1569
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,150

cumulative delta. Um, yeah, you can use

1570
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,160
cumulative delta. Um, yeah, you can use
 

1571
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,230
cumulative delta. Um, yeah, you can use
it. I don't really use it too much.

1572
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:08,240
it. I don't really use it too much.
 

1573
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,069
it. I don't really use it too much.
It's good for trending environments, but

1574
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:10,079
It's good for trending environments, but
 

1575
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,790
It's good for trending environments, but
I'm not too interested outside of that.

1576
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:12,800
I'm not too interested outside of that.
 

1577
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,349
I'm not too interested outside of that.
I'm more interested in delta getting

1578
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:15,359
I'm more interested in delta getting
 

1579
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,190
I'm more interested in delta getting
stuck in between each candles, but you

1580
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:17,200
stuck in between each candles, but you
 

1581
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,550
stuck in between each candles, but you
can use it. Sometimes it will give you

1582
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:18,560
can use it. Sometimes it will give you
 

1583
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,230
can use it. Sometimes it will give you
divergence, like if we're making higher

1584
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,240
divergence, like if we're making higher
 

1585
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,910
divergence, like if we're making higher
highs here and delta isn't, which is

1586
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:21,920
highs here and delta isn't, which is
 

1587
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,589
highs here and delta isn't, which is
what I am seeing on a fiveminute chart

1588
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:23,599
what I am seeing on a fiveminute chart
 

1589
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,510
what I am seeing on a fiveminute chart
for now. Shows a bit of weakness in the

1590
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,520
for now. Shows a bit of weakness in the
 

1591
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:46,390
for now. Shows a bit of weakness in the
tape.

1592
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:46,400

 

1593
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,390

Unbelievable that they still have not

1594
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:48,400
Unbelievable that they still have not
 

1595
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:57,510
Unbelievable that they still have not
taken out.

1596
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:57,520

 

1597
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:04,230

Come on people.

1598
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:04,240

 

1599
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,430

They're going to wait for 10, aren't

1600
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:05,440
They're going to wait for 10, aren't
 

1601
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,150
They're going to wait for 10, aren't
they? at the moment. Wait for that new

1602
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,160
they? at the moment. Wait for that new
 

1603
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,910
they? at the moment. Wait for that new
hourly and 4hour bar.

1604
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:11,920
hourly and 4hour bar.
 

1605
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,510
hourly and 4hour bar.
Uh if we find a squeeze above Gloex,

1606
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:17,520

 

1607
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,829

then yeah, I'd be looking at 76s, 400s,

1608
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:21,839
then yeah, I'd be looking at 76s, 400s,
 

1609
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,430
then yeah, I'd be looking at 76s, 400s,
what's the top level up here? And 40s.

1610
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:25,440
what's the top level up here? And 40s.
 

1611
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,710
what's the top level up here? And 40s.
If you get a squeeze, if there's

1612
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:26,720
If you get a squeeze, if there's
 

1613
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,069
If you get a squeeze, if there's
acceptance above here, you'd be looking

1614
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:28,079
acceptance above here, you'd be looking
 

1615
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,750
acceptance above here, you'd be looking
for a drive into these. If they want to

1616
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:29,760
for a drive into these. If they want to
 

1617
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,109
for a drive into these. If they want to
close the gap, the gap fill will be

1618
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:31,119
close the gap, the gap fill will be
 

1619
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,190
close the gap, the gap fill will be
480s. It's quite a big ask, but

1620
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:35,200
480s. It's quite a big ask, but
 

1621
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,470
480s. It's quite a big ask, but
it's not out the question. And uh we can

1622
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:38,480
it's not out the question. And uh we can
 

1623
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,390
it's not out the question. And uh we can
still sell that based on an hourly

1624
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:42,400
still sell that based on an hourly
 

1625
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,470
still sell that based on an hourly
possible that bears still come in versus

1626
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:44,480
possible that bears still come in versus
 

1627
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,430
possible that bears still come in versus
440. So, anything possible right now in

1628
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:47,440
440. So, anything possible right now in
 

1629
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,829
440. So, anything possible right now in
this market. Quite a intricate part. TPT

1639
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,950

Come on, market. You got to go and take

1640
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:08,960
Come on, market. You got to go and take
 

1641
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,390
Come on, market. You got to go and take
Globeex out. We can't do anything

1642
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:10,400
Globeex out. We can't do anything
 

1643
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:17,670
Globeex out. We can't do anything
otherwise.

1644
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:17,680

 

1645
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,790

Vick's coming into these uh 1740s like

1646
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:20,800
Vick's coming into these uh 1740s like
 

1647
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,750
Vick's coming into these uh 1740s like
we talked about.

1648
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:25,760

 

1649
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,430

Let's see if it finds a bid here on the

1650
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:27,440
Let's see if it finds a bid here on the
 

1651
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,430
Let's see if it finds a bid here on the
VIX or not. If not and it goes for gap

1652
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:29,440
VIX or not. If not and it goes for gap
 

1653
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,750
VIX or not. If not and it goes for gap
fill, this market can start squeezing.

1654
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:31,760
fill, this market can start squeezing.
 

1655
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,230
fill, this market can start squeezing.
Like we said, the red box is key. Look

1656
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,240
Like we said, the red box is key. Look
 

1657
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,109
Like we said, the red box is key. Look
above and fail or, you know, base above

1658
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:37,119
above and fail or, you know, base above
 

1659
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,750
above and fail or, you know, base above
for a squeeze. Yeah, sorry about that.

1660
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:39,760
for a squeeze. Yeah, sorry about that.
 

1661
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,390
for a squeeze. Yeah, sorry about that.
Yeah, code flow zone.

1662
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:42,400
Yeah, code flow zone.
 

1663
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,670
Yeah, code flow zone.
It won't change it. I might ask for the

1664
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:45,680
It won't change it. I might ask for the
 

1665
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,150
It won't change it. I might ask for the
fifth millionth time this week.

1666
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,160
fifth millionth time this week.
 

1667
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,950
fifth millionth time this week.
Okay, Globe's coming up. So, if you did

1668
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:52,960
Okay, Globe's coming up. So, if you did
 

1669
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,430
Okay, Globe's coming up. So, if you did
take the long, hopefully it gets there

1670
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:55,440
take the long, hopefully it gets there
 

1671
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,430
take the long, hopefully it gets there
for you. If you got long off VWAP, this

1672
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:57,440
for you. If you got long off VWAP, this
 

1673
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,630
for you. If you got long off VWAP, this
higher low, your location's not ideal,

1674
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:00,640
higher low, your location's not ideal,
 

1675
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,510
higher low, your location's not ideal,
but if you took this, you're looking for

1676
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:03,520
but if you took this, you're looking for
 

1677
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,589
but if you took this, you're looking for
this and a squeeze out into here. So, if

1678
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:05,599
this and a squeeze out into here. So, if
 

1679
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,430
this and a squeeze out into here. So, if
you get this, that would be TP1, TP2,

1680
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:07,440
you get this, that would be TP1, TP2,
 

1681
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,390
you get this, that would be TP1, TP2,
TP3, TP4, TB5 would be gap fill. If you

1682
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:10,400
TP3, TP4, TB5 would be gap fill. If you
 

1683
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,510
TP3, TP4, TB5 would be gap fill. If you
got all the way up there, which would be

1684
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:11,520
got all the way up there, which would be
 

1685
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,950
got all the way up there, which would be
the yellow line above you, all the way

1686
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:12,960
the yellow line above you, all the way
 

1687
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,510
the yellow line above you, all the way
up here, I'd be very cautious as we get

1688
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:15,520
up here, I'd be very cautious as we get
 

1689
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,109
up here, I'd be very cautious as we get
into here that it doesn't do a look

1690
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:17,119
into here that it doesn't do a look
 

1691
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:28,150
into here that it doesn't do a look
above and fail.

1692
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,160

 

1693
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,550

Still not taking out. Incredible.

1694
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:32,560

 

1695
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,990

Are they actually going to wait for the

1696
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:34,000
Are they actually going to wait for the
 

1697
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,150
Are they actually going to wait for the
new 4hour candle? 5 minutes left. Surely

1698
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:36,160
new 4hour candle? 5 minutes left. Surely
 

1699
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,670
new 4hour candle? 5 minutes left. Surely
they just take that out.

1700
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:39,680
they just take that out.
 

1701
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,069
they just take that out.
Would I recommend Lucid? Yeah, their new

1702
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:42,079
Would I recommend Lucid? Yeah, their new
 

1703
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,870
Would I recommend Lucid? Yeah, their new
their new one looks good. Lucid Flex. I

1704
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:44,880
their new one looks good. Lucid Flex. I
 

1705
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,630
their new one looks good. Lucid Flex. I
did actually buy one to test it out.

1706
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:50,640

 

1707
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,870

very much like funded next code FCT will

1708
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:52,880
very much like funded next code FCT will
 

1709
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,750
very much like funded next code FCT will
work there for you as well. Okay, GloEx

1710
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:55,760
work there for you as well. Okay, GloEx
 

1711
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,270
work there for you as well. Okay, GloEx
now taken. All right, so if you're in

1712
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:57,280
now taken. All right, so if you're in
 

1713
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,270
now taken. All right, so if you're in
this long, you're just runners all these

1714
00:42:59,270 --> 00:42:59,280
this long, you're just runners all these
 

1715
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,950
this long, you're just runners all these
squeeze out. So these blue and red lines

1716
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:00,960
squeeze out. So these blue and red lines
 

1717
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,309
squeeze out. So these blue and red lines
and yellow and yellow line is your

1718
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:02,319
and yellow and yellow line is your
 

1719
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,750
and yellow and yellow line is your
ultimate target if it really wanted to

1720
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:03,760
ultimate target if it really wanted to
 

1721
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,069
ultimate target if it really wanted to
get going. If we base above here, we can

1722
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:06,079
get going. If we base above here, we can
 

1723
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,510
get going. If we base above here, we can
think about that long. But I've been

1724
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:07,520
think about that long. But I've been
 

1725
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,670
think about that long. But I've been
very very cautious about something that

1726
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:09,680
very very cautious about something that
 

1727
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,870
very very cautious about something that
shoves up, right, and then fails back in

1728
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:12,880
shoves up, right, and then fails back in
 

1729
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,150
shoves up, right, and then fails back in
this range here. So ba basically 320s,

1730
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:16,160
this range here. So ba basically 320s,
 

1731
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,710
this range here. So ba basically 320s,
right? Balls need to defend 320s.

1732
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:18,720
right? Balls need to defend 320s.
 

1733
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,309
right? Balls need to defend 320s.
Anything that's a look above fails under

1734
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:20,319
Anything that's a look above fails under
 

1735
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,750
Anything that's a look above fails under
320, rejects it, it's going to come

1736
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:21,760
320, rejects it, it's going to come
 

1737
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:30,069
320, rejects it, it's going to come
right back down to the other side again.

1738
00:43:30,069 --> 00:43:30,079

 

1739
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,390

Why is energy pumping? Well, energy

1740
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:32,400
Why is energy pumping? Well, energy
 

1741
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,870
Why is energy pumping? Well, energy
always pumps this time of year anyway.

1742
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:34,880
always pumps this time of year anyway.
 

1743
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,230
always pumps this time of year anyway.
So, you've got uh rotations

1744
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:38,240
So, you've got uh rotations
 

1745
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,150
So, you've got uh rotations
plus what's what's energy going to be

1746
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,160
plus what's what's energy going to be
 

1747
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,910
plus what's what's energy going to be
used for?

1748
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:41,920
used for?
 

1749
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,430
used for?
Think about all the data centers.

1750
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:43,440
Think about all the data centers.
 

1751
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,190
Think about all the data centers.
everything we're doing with AI, it all

1752
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,200
everything we're doing with AI, it all
 

1753
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,069
everything we're doing with AI, it all
is going to require energy.

1754
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:50,079

 

1755
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,230

It's probably a bit of a safer bet than

1756
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:52,240
It's probably a bit of a safer bet than
 

1757
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,829
It's probably a bit of a safer bet than
a lot of other stuff right now because

1758
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:53,839
a lot of other stuff right now because
 

1759
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,109
a lot of other stuff right now because
guarantee the grid is not ready and they

1760
00:43:57,109 --> 00:43:57,119
guarantee the grid is not ready and they
 

1761
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,630
guarantee the grid is not ready and they
are going to require a lot of energy.

1762
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:58,640
are going to require a lot of energy.
 

1763
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,069
are going to require a lot of energy.
Whether that be traditional types,

1764
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:00,079
Whether that be traditional types,
 

1765
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,150
Whether that be traditional types,
nuclear based, especially for all these

1766
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:02,160
nuclear based, especially for all these
 

1767
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,670
nuclear based, especially for all these
data centers that they're building out,

1768
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:03,680
data centers that they're building out,
 

1769
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,589
data centers that they're building out,
they all going to require energy. So if

1770
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:05,599
they all going to require energy. So if
 

1771
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:06,630
they all going to require energy. So if
you don't want to put money in the

you don't want to put money in the
 

1773
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,309
you don't want to put money in the
builder, don't want to put money in the

1774
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:08,319
builder, don't want to put money in the
 

1775
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,470
builder, don't want to put money in the
chips and you can put money money in the

1776
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:10,480
chips and you can put money money in the
 

1777
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,030
chips and you can put money money in the
energy sector. And plus, as we get as it

1778
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:13,040
energy sector. And plus, as we get as it
 

1779
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,710
energy sector. And plus, as we get as it
gets colder into winter, we use more

1780
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:14,720
gets colder into winter, we use more
 

1781
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,829
gets colder into winter, we use more
energy anyway, which means historically

1782
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:17,839
energy anyway, which means historically
 

1783
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:22,630
energy anyway, which means historically
Q4 and Q1 are better better times to buy

1784

Q4 and Q1 are better better times to buy
 

1785
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:30,550
Q4 and Q1 are better better times to buy
energy, to trade energy.

needs to find a bid here. If it doesn't,
 

1791
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,190

Okay. into or testing previous day value

1796
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:44,560
Okay. into or testing previous day value
 

1797
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,230
Okay. into or testing previous day value
area lows. This is the previous this is

1798
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:46,240
area lows. This is the previous this is
 

1799
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,470
area lows. This is the previous this is
Friday's value area. All right. So, so

1800
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:48,480
Friday's value area. All right. So, so
 

1801
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,109
Friday's value area. All right. So, so
far this is Friday's value area. If we

1802
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:51,119
far this is Friday's value area. If we
 

1803
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,589
far this is Friday's value area. If we
reject this and we reject 320s, we will

1804
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:53,599
reject this and we reject 320s, we will
 

1805
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,910
reject this and we reject 320s, we will
move lower. Balls will need to hold 320.

1806
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:55,920
move lower. Balls will need to hold 320.
 

1807
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,390
move lower. Balls will need to hold 320.
Now

1808
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:58,400
Now
 

1809
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,230
Now

Advertising above right now. There's

1814
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:05,599
Advertising above right now. There's
 

1815
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,270
Advertising above right now. There's
there's a spoofer on the tape today,

1816
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:07,280
there's a spoofer on the tape today,
 

1817
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,550
there's a spoofer on the tape today,
folks.

1818
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:08,560
folks.
 

1819
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:14,790
folks.
There is a spoofer on the tape again.

1820
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:14,800

 

1821
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:31,510

They're walking this up right now.

1822
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:31,520

 

1823
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,550

Can we get acceptance into the previous

1824
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:34,560
Can we get acceptance into the previous
 

1825
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,309
Can we get acceptance into the previous
day's value? At the moment, the answer

1826
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:36,319
day's value? At the moment, the answer
 

1827
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,230
day's value? At the moment, the answer
is no. There's no acceptance inside

1828
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:38,240
is no. There's no acceptance inside
 

1829
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,710
is no. There's no acceptance inside
Friday's value area. Dips this morning

1830
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:40,720
Friday's value area. Dips this morning
 

1831
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,309
Friday's value area. Dips this morning
have been bought, but we didn't take out

1832
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:42,319
have been bought, but we didn't take out
 

1833
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,230
have been bought, but we didn't take out
GlobeEx, but there was a higher low

1834
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:44,240
GlobeEx, but there was a higher low
 

1835
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,710
GlobeEx, but there was a higher low
there. Dips have been bought. We are now

1836
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:46,720
there. Dips have been bought. We are now
 

1837
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,630
there. Dips have been bought. We are now
drifting higher. I would expect bears to

1838
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:48,640
drifting higher. I would expect bears to
 

1839
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,990
drifting higher. I would expect bears to
come in soon somewhere in here if they

1840
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:52,000
come in soon somewhere in here if they
 

1841
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,430
come in soon somewhere in here if they
don't already. And uh then we have to

1842
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:55,440
don't already. And uh then we have to
 

1843
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,589
don't already. And uh then we have to
see how we

1844
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:57,599
see how we
 

1845
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,030
see how we
will then be the battle. The wherever

1846
00:45:59,030 --> 00:45:59,040
will then be the battle. The wherever
 

1847
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,870
will then be the battle. The wherever
the bear is coming down to 320 will be

1848
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:00,880
the bear is coming down to 320 will be
 

1849
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:10,710
the bear is coming down to 320 will be
the battle.

1850
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:10,720

 

1851
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,510

We're going to test these 320s. It seems

1852
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:13,520
We're going to test these 320s. It seems
 

1853
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,550
We're going to test these 320s. It seems
sample back towards it. How long? For 90

1854
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:16,560
sample back towards it. How long? For 90
 

1855
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,230
sample back towards it. How long? For 90
seconds. I'm just going to let this hour

1856
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:18,240
seconds. I'm just going to let this hour
 

1857
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,910
seconds. I'm just going to let this hour
and 4 hour play out.

1858
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:21,920
and 4 hour play out.
 

1859
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,069
and 4 hour play out.
And that kill candle that we had at 8:00

1860
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:24,079
And that kill candle that we had at 8:00
 

1861
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:26,710
And that kill candle that we had at 8:00
p.m. last night. All right. The

1862
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:26,720
p.m. last night. All right. The
 

1863
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,309
p.m. last night. All right. The
transition of that will be that previous

1864
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:28,319
transition of that will be that previous
 

1865
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,030
transition of that will be that previous
day value area high. I am interested

1866
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:31,040
day value area high. I am interested
 

1867
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:42,630
day value area high. I am interested
what happens when we come up here.

1868
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:42,640

 

1869
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,870

Range still good. Even with the VIX

1870
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:44,880
Range still good. Even with the VIX
 

1871
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,870
Range still good. Even with the VIX
dropping down, the range is still good.

1872
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:46,880
dropping down, the range is still good.
 

1873
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,550
dropping down, the range is still good.

minutes this morning. It's not bad at

1876
00:46:50,069 --> 00:46:50,079
minutes this morning. It's not bad at
 

1877
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,870
minutes this morning. It's not bad at

all. Still money to be made both sides
 

1879
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,270

here. Right. They are trying to hold

1880
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:55,280
here. Right. They are trying to hold
 

1881
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:24,950
here. Right. They are trying to hold
these sort of 320s, 340s.

1882
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:24,960

 

1883
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,109

Does Fridays hold much weight after

1884
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:27,119
Does Fridays hold much weight after
 

1885
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,630
Does Fridays hold much weight after
being a half day? I think it was a whole

1886
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:28,640
being a half day? I think it was a whole
 

1887
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,190
being a half day? I think it was a whole
day. Um, but it was very, very light in

1888
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:31,200
day. Um, but it was very, very light in
 

1889
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,069
day. Um, but it was very, very light in
volume. I mean, I'd say none of last

1890
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:34,079
volume. I mean, I'd say none of last
 

1891
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,829
volume. I mean, I'd say none of last
week holds as much weight as normal

1892
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:35,839
week holds as much weight as normal
 

1893
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,150
week holds as much weight as normal
because the volume was so light, which

1894
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:38,160
because the volume was so light, which
 

1895
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,309
because the volume was so light, which
is why there's some caution trading this

1896
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:40,319

how we test out each levels and do we
 

1901
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,829
how we test out each levels and do we
cut through like a hot knife through

1902
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:45,839
cut through like a hot knife through
 

1903
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,870
cut through like a hot knife through
butter or do we find bids, right? So,

come in somewhere here. If they're going
 

1917
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,230
come in somewhere here. If they're going
to come in at all, if they're going to

1923
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,670

The range isn't bad, but it feels slow.

We are holding bids now above this. So
 

1949

back down to these 40s to 20s. Now, if
they fail this, you can see the edge

1978
00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:55,599
they fail this, you can see the edge
 

1979
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,910

2053
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:51,349
standard distribution. And we didn't
take out the lows, though. It's worth

2054
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:51,359
take out the lows, though. It's worth
 

2055
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,589
take out the lows, though. It's worth
being aware of. So, here's the flush

2354
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:06,480
follow through, we'll probably come back
 

2355
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:10,870
follow through, we'll probably come back
down into here.

2356
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:10,880

 

2357
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,109

Yeah, thanks Adam. Great to see that. I

2358
01:03:13,109 --> 01:03:13,119
Yeah, thanks Adam. Great to see that. I
 

2359
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:15,510
Yeah, thanks Adam. Great to see that. I
was very happy with that

2360
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:15,520
was very happy with that
 

2361
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,950
was very happy with that
10k subs.

2362
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:18,960
10k subs.
 

2363
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,870
10k subs.
Still protecting this low volume node so

01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:20,880
Still protecting this low volume node so
 

2365
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,230
Still protecting this low volume node so

2370
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:28,880
Not in the New York session anyway.
 

2371

2372
01:03:30,789 --> 01:03:30,799
I did take a trade last night, folks.
 

2373
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:32,470
I did take a trade last night, folks.
So,

2374
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:32,480
So,
 

2375
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,390
So,
wasn't wasn't the biggest, but I did

2376
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:34,400
wasn't wasn't the biggest, but I did
 

2377
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:48,950
wasn't wasn't the biggest, but I did
trade last night.

2378
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:48,960

 

2379
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,549

They're trying to get to these 20s at

2380
01:03:50,549 --> 01:03:50,559
They're trying to get to these 20s at
 

2381
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:52,950
They're trying to get to these 20s at
the moment. They want to test these 20s

2382
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:52,960
the moment. They want to test these 20s
 

2383
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,710
the moment. They want to test these 20s
out. They're into this low volume node.

2384
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:54,720
out. They're into this low volume node.
 

2385
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,150
out. They're into this low volume node.
They want to just do a little flush at

2386
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:56,160
They want to just do a little flush at
 

2387
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,990
They want to just do a little flush at
the moment is what they're trying. But

2388
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:58,000
the moment is what they're trying. But
 

2389
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,510
the moment is what they're trying. But
really how we act in here is going to be

2390
01:03:59,510 --> 01:03:59,520
really how we act in here is going to be
 

2391
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,630
really how we act in here is going to be
key now. 60 now and say 60 to 70 we

2392
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:02,640
key now. 60 now and say 60 to 70 we
 

2393
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,630
key now. 60 now and say 60 to 70 we
check the delta.

2394
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:04,640
check the delta.
 

2395
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,109
check the delta.
No buyers trapped above. Yeah, above 70.

2396
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:07,119
No buyers trapped above. Yeah, above 70.
 

2397
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:09,670
No buyers trapped above. Yeah, above 70.
70 is still the level. Buyers are

2398
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:09,680
70 is still the level. Buyers are
 

2399
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,150
70 is still the level. Buyers are
trapped over 70s have been all morning.

2400
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:12,160
trapped over 70s have been all morning.
 

2401
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:27,670
trapped over 70s have been all morning.
Every push over there

2402
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:27,680

 

2403
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,150

50s again. Do they come and do retest

2404
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:30,160
50s again. Do they come and do retest
 

2405
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,829
50s again. Do they come and do retest
70s?

2406
01:04:31,829 --> 01:04:31,839
70s?
 

2407
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:34,710
70s?
This is where the sellers came in.

2408
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:34,720
This is where the sellers came in.
 

2409
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,150
This is where the sellers came in.
They're going to come back up towards

2410
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:36,160
They're going to come back up towards
 

2411
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,630
They're going to come back up towards
E70s and test it again back inside this

2412
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:38,640
E70s and test it again back inside this
 

2413
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,789
E70s and test it again back inside this
volume node. Now sellers will want to

2414
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:40,799
volume node. Now sellers will want to
 

2415
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:42,390
volume node. Now sellers will want to
reject this. If they don't reject in

2416
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:42,400
reject this. If they don't reject in
 

2417
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,230
reject this. If they don't reject in
front of 70s, then buyers can take

2418
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:44,240
front of 70s, then buyers can take
 

2419
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,750
front of 70s, then buyers can take
control and we can just start creating

2420
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:45,760
control and we can just start creating
 

2421
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,069
control and we can just start creating
volume inside of yesterday's profile.

2422
01:04:48,069 --> 01:04:48,079
volume inside of yesterday's profile.
 

2423
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:49,750
volume inside of yesterday's profile.
So, this is the chance. If they're going

2424
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:49,760
So, this is the chance. If they're going
 

2425
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,109
So, this is the chance. If they're going
to defend, they need to defend now.

2426
01:04:51,109 --> 01:04:51,119
to defend, they need to defend now.
 

2427
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:51,910
to defend, they need to defend now.
Otherwise, they're going to get

2428
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:51,920
Otherwise, they're going to get
 

2429
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,270
Otherwise, they're going to get
themselves caught.

2430
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:55,280
themselves caught.
 

2431
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,910
themselves caught.
Right towards the 70s we go.

2432
01:04:59,910 --> 01:04:59,920

 

2433
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,390

Alco still digesting excess from food

2434
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:02,400
Alco still digesting excess from food
 

2435
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,670
Alco still digesting excess from food
from Friday. Yes, probably.

2436
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:05,680
from Friday. Yes, probably.
 

2437
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,670
from Friday. Yes, probably.
Traders too sluggish this morning for

2438
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:07,680
Traders too sluggish this morning for
 

2439
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:15,589
Traders too sluggish this morning for
sure.

2440
01:05:15,589 --> 01:05:15,599

 

2441
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,710

We're just not leaving an area, you

2442
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:18,720
We're just not leaving an area, you
 

2443
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,190
We're just not leaving an area, you
know. It's big move up, tapped into

2444
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:21,200
know. It's big move up, tapped into
 

2445
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,549
know. It's big move up, tapped into
blue, didn't wash wash Asia, straight up

2446
01:05:24,549 --> 01:05:24,559
blue, didn't wash wash Asia, straight up
 

2447
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:26,950
blue, didn't wash wash Asia, straight up
and then just sideways.

2448
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:26,960
and then just sideways.
 

2449
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,549
and then just sideways.
Just is what it is. Like I said, I

2450
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:28,559
Just is what it is. Like I said, I
 

2451
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,549
Just is what it is. Like I said, I
didn't expect much today. I expect the

2452
01:05:30,549 --> 01:05:30,559
didn't expect much today. I expect the
 

2453
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,549
didn't expect much today. I expect the
moves to come back end of the week.

2454
01:05:32,549 --> 01:05:32,559
moves to come back end of the week.
 

2455
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,789
moves to come back end of the week.
Today, we'll just be feeling out each

2456
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:34,799
Today, we'll just be feeling out each
 

2457
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:39,990
Today, we'll just be feeling out each
edge.

2458
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:40,000

 

2459
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,430

And if we want to come all the way up

2460
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:41,440
And if we want to come all the way up
 

2461
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,950
And if we want to come all the way up
for previous day value area higher, we

2462
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:42,960
for previous day value area higher, we
 

2463
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,710
for previous day value area higher, we
can. That will fill the H1 imbalance. We

2464
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:44,720
can. That will fill the H1 imbalance. We
 

2465
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,870
can. That will fill the H1 imbalance. We
very might well sell from that point.

2466
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:48,880
very might well sell from that point.
 

2467
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,870
very might well sell from that point.
We're into sort of thin structure as we

2468
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:50,880
We're into sort of thin structure as we
 

2469
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,990
We're into sort of thin structure as we
get up up and over here. Anything above

2470
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:54,000
get up up and over here. Anything above
 

2471
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,870
get up up and over here. Anything above
yeah 350s anything above 350s gets much

2472
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:56,880
yeah 350s anything above 350s gets much
 

2473
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,430
yeah 350s anything above 350s gets much
thinner from Friday's profile and from

2474
01:05:59,430 --> 01:05:59,440
thinner from Friday's profile and from
 

2475
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,130
thinner from Friday's profile and from
the weekly profile.

2476
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:02,140
the weekly profile.
 

2477
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:06,630
the weekly profile.

2497
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:34,230

Just building liquidity. I'm somewhat

2498
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:34,240
Just building liquidity. I'm somewhat
 

2499
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,390
Just building liquidity. I'm somewhat
surprised we didn't wash this first, but

2500
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:36,400
surprised we didn't wash this first, but
 

2501
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,390
surprised we didn't wash this first, but
uh I mean to come that close and not

2502
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:38,400
uh I mean to come that close and not
 

2503
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,190
uh I mean to come that close and not
take it.

2504
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:41,200
take it.
 

2505
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:46,150
take it.
Buggers. Did we do it on Yes.

2506
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:46,160

 

2507
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,390

Yes.

2508
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:48,400
Yes.
 

2509
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,630
Yes.
We did not. We tapped it, but we didn't

2510
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:50,640
We did not. We tapped it, but we didn't
 

2511
01:06:50,640 --> 01:07:10,906
We did not. We tapped it, but we didn't
actually wash below. That's nasty.

2512
01:07:10,906 --> 01:07:10,916

2525
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:34,230

we're going to do, folks.
Very, very slow.

2528
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:45,280

 

2529
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:56,789

Thank you.

2530

2531
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:01,670

Oh, don't even get me started.

2532
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:01,680

 

2533
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:05,190

What a joke.

2534
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:05,200

 

2535
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,270

What a joke. I'm so pissed off with Zack

2536
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:07,280
What a joke. I'm so pissed off with Zack
 

2537
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,857
What a joke. I'm so pissed off with Zack
Brown. It's unbelievable.

01:08:09,857 --> 01:08:09,867
Brown. It's unbelievable.
 

2539
01:08:09,867 --> 01:08:12,870

[snorts] F1 was an absolute joke. never
seen such complete

2542
01:08:17,269 --> 01:08:17,279
seen such complete
 

2543
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:23,110
seen such complete
stupid stupid decisions or lack of

2544
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:23,120
stupid stupid decisions or lack of
 

2545
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,950
stupid stupid decisions or lack of
like I've never seen it. Complete

2546
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:24,960
like I've never seen it. Complete
 

2547
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,430
like I've never seen it. Complete
incompetence. Like I said on my socials,

2548
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:27,440
incompetence. Like I said on my socials,
 

2549
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,349
incompetence. Like I said on my socials,
you know, it's like they're trying to

2550
01:08:29,349 --> 01:08:29,359
you know, it's like they're trying to
 

2551
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,430
you know, it's like they're trying to
get jobs at Ferrari. That's how bad they

2552
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:31,440
get jobs at Ferrari. That's how bad they
 

2553
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,510
get jobs at Ferrari. That's how bad they
were at the weekend. I cannot believe

2554
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:33,520
were at the weekend. I cannot believe
 

2555
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,910
were at the weekend. I cannot believe
it. Every decision was terrible.

2556
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:37,920
it. Every decision was terrible.
 

2557
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,510
it. Every decision was terrible.
You didn't bring them in. You left them

2558
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:39,520
You didn't bring them in. You left them
 

2559
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,349
You didn't bring them in. You left them
both out. [\h__\h] stupid. So stupid to

2560
01:08:43,349 --> 01:08:43,359
both out. [\h__\h] stupid. So stupid to
 

2561
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:46,149
both out. [\h__\h] stupid. So stupid to
do that. Number one. Number two, once

2562
01:08:46,149 --> 01:08:46,159
do that. Number one. Number two, once
 

2563
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:47,910
do that. Number one. Number two, once
you realize you made the wrong decision,

2564
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:47,920
you realize you made the wrong decision,
 

2565
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,550
you realize you made the wrong decision,
you didn't rectify it.

2566
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:50,560
you didn't rectify it.
 

2567
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,789
you didn't rectify it.
You left them out far too long on both

2568
01:08:52,789 --> 01:08:52,799
You left them out far too long on both
 

2569
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:54,709
You left them out far too long on both
stints, especially the second stint. And

2570
01:08:54,709 --> 01:08:54,719
stints, especially the second stint. And
 

2571
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:56,470
stints, especially the second stint. And
then you put them on the [\h__\h] hards.

2572
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:56,480
then you put them on the [\h__\h] hards.
 

2573
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,510
then you put them on the [\h__\h] hards.
Like, put them on the softs.

2574
01:08:59,510 --> 01:08:59,520
Like, put them on the softs.
 

2575
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,630
Like, put them on the softs.
So dumb. So dumb. And after they've

2576
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:02,640
So dumb. So dumb. And after they've
 

2577
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,630
So dumb. So dumb. And after they've
screwed Lando's race last weekend, well,

2578
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:04,640
screwed Lando's race last weekend, well,
 

2579
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,990
screwed Lando's race last weekend, well,
both of their races, but Lando is the

2580
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:06,000
both of their races, but Lando is the
 

2581
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,990
both of their races, but Lando is the
one that suffered. You know, if they if

2582
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:08,000
one that suffered. You know, if they if
 

2583
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,550
one that suffered. You know, if they if
he doesn't win,

2584
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:10,560
he doesn't win,
 

2585
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,470
he doesn't win,
then all they can only blame you could

2586
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:12,480
then all they can only blame you could
 

2587
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,390
then all they can only blame you could
like you got to take his head, Zack

2588
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:14,400
like you got to take his head, Zack
 

2589
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,910
like you got to take his head, Zack
Brown. You got to take his head. Like

2590
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:15,920
Brown. You got to take his head. Like
 

2591
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,829
Brown. You got to take his head. Like
it's it's on you, mate. It's on you.

2592
01:09:19,829 --> 01:09:19,839
it's it's on you, mate. It's on you.
 

2593
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:22,390
it's it's on you, mate. It's on you.
Ultimately, the buck stops with you.

2594
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:22,400
Ultimately, the buck stops with you.
 

2595
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,229
Ultimately, the buck stops with you.
Okay, here you go. So, failing 70s

2596
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:24,239
Okay, here you go. So, failing 70s
 

2597
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:25,269
Okay, here you go. So, failing 70s
again. They're going to come back down

2598
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:25,279
again. They're going to come back down
 

2599
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,669
again. They're going to come back down
to test these 20s like we talked about.

2600
01:09:27,669 --> 01:09:27,679
to test these 20s like we talked about.
 

2601
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,669
to test these 20s like we talked about.
So, no acceptance over 70s. That's the

2602
01:09:29,669 --> 01:09:29,679
So, no acceptance over 70s. That's the
 

2603
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:32,070
So, no acceptance over 70s. That's the
key thing up here. Now, we haven't built

2604
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:32,080
key thing up here. Now, we haven't built
 

2605
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,749
key thing up here. Now, we haven't built
a whole lot of profile down here, a

2606
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:33,759
a whole lot of profile down here, a
 

2607
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:35,510
a whole lot of profile down here, a
whole lot of volume. So, you'll be

2608
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:35,520
whole lot of volume. So, you'll be
 

2609
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,990
whole lot of volume. So, you'll be
watching to see if they hold these 20s

2610
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:38,000
watching to see if they hold these 20s
 

2611
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,309
watching to see if they hold these 20s
for a rescoop and go or if there's

2612
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:40,319
for a rescoop and go or if there's
 

2613
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:44,390
for a rescoop and go or if there's
sustained follow through.

2614
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:44,400

 

2615
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,229

I saw someone say Max was stappen. I

2616
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:46,239
I saw someone say Max was stappen. I
 

2617
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:49,669
I saw someone say Max was stappen. I
mean, yeah, Max, he's doing pretty good

2618
01:09:49,669 --> 01:09:49,679
mean, yeah, Max, he's doing pretty good
 

2619
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:53,030
mean, yeah, Max, he's doing pretty good
in a uh terrible car, but you know, that

2620
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:53,040
in a uh terrible car, but you know, that
 

2621
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,310
in a uh terrible car, but you know, that
was not about him. Um, McLaren have

2622
01:09:56,310 --> 01:09:56,320
was not about him. Um, McLaren have
 

2623
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,790
was not about him. Um, McLaren have
literally gifted him the chance to have

2624
01:09:58,790 --> 01:09:58,800
literally gifted him the chance to have
 

2625
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,550
literally gifted him the chance to have
to have the chance to win. McLaren have

2626
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:00,560
to have the chance to win. McLaren have
 

2627
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:07,750
to have the chance to win. McLaren have
gifted it to him.

2628
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:07,760

 

2629
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,350

Terrible.

2630
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:09,360
Terrible.
 

2631
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,870
Terrible.
What did you all think?

2632
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:12,880
What did you all think?
 

2633
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,070
What did you all think?
That's what I thought.

2634
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:16,080
That's what I thought.
 

2635
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,510
That's what I thought.
Arsenal didn't look at the races

2636
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:17,520
Arsenal didn't look at the races
 

2637
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,270
Arsenal didn't look at the races
yesterday against Chelsea either, but we

2638
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:19,280
yesterday against Chelsea either, but we
 

2639
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,910
yesterday against Chelsea either, but we
were sluggish, but not surprising gi

2640
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:21,920
were sluggish, but not surprising gi
 

2641
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,270
were sluggish, but not surprising gi
given the amount of games that we played

2642
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:23,280
given the amount of games that we played
 

2643
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,110
given the amount of games that we played
and big games that we played recently as

2644
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:25,120
and big games that we played recently as
 

2645
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,630
and big games that we played recently as
well.

2646
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:26,640
well.
 

2647
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,590
well.
Missing uh

2648
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:29,600
Missing uh
 

2649
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:36,950
Missing uh
our center backs didn't help.

2650
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:36,960

 

2651
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:43,350

Oh, market.

2652
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:43,360

 

2653
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,350

Yeah, it probably would have like it

2654
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:45,360
Yeah, it probably would have like it
 

2655
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,870
Yeah, it probably would have like it
probably would have been over a long

2656
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:46,880
probably would have been over a long
 

2657
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,709
probably would have been over a long
time ago in fairness to him because also

2658
01:10:48,709 --> 01:10:48,719
time ago in fairness to him because also
 

2659
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:50,470
time ago in fairness to him because also
he wouldn't listen to bad decisions. He

2660
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:50,480
he wouldn't listen to bad decisions. He
 

2661
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,990
he wouldn't listen to bad decisions. He
would do what he wants because he's got

2662
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:52,000
would do what he wants because he's got
 

2663
01:10:52,000 --> 01:11:01,430
would do what he wants because he's got
the experience and confidence to do it.

2664
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:01,440

 

2665
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,550

Tesla back green to red. This market

2666
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:04,560
Tesla back green to red. This market
 

2667
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,229
Tesla back green to red. This market
literally does not know what to do with

2668
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:06,239
literally does not know what to do with
 

2669
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,070
literally does not know what to do with
itself. We're just dancing around

2670
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:08,080

2675
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:16,550

2677
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:21,350

We are completely stuck right now.

2678
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:21,360

 

2679
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,229

Big buyer coming in here.

Big buyer coming in here.

01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:28,000
just absolutely slapped it.
 

2683
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:43,510
just absolutely slapped it.
We actually move up off that though.

2684
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:43,520

 

2685
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,430

Big buyer came in right where we are now

2686
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:45,440
Big buyer came in right where we are now
 

2687
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:49,590
Big buyer came in right where we are now
and we've not moved higher. Worth noting

2688
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:49,600
and we've not moved higher. Worth noting
 

2689
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,149
and we've not moved higher. Worth noting
for now. It will need to accumulate here

2690
01:11:52,149 --> 01:11:52,159
for now. It will need to accumulate here
 

2691
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:54,229
for now. It will need to accumulate here
at 40 or around there because he came in

2692
01:11:54,229 --> 01:11:54,239
at 40 or around there because he came in
 

2693
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:57,750
at 40 or around there because he came in
with size hit the market and we haven't

2694
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:57,760
with size hit the market and we haven't
 

2695
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,470
with size hit the market and we haven't
moved higher.

2696
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:00,480
moved higher.
 

2697
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,110
moved higher.
Maybe we come back down to VWAP just to

2698
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:03,120
Maybe we come back down to VWAP just to
 

2699
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:18,950
Maybe we come back down to VWAP just to
punish him for doing that. I don't know.

2700
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:18,960

 

2701
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,870

God, I don't remember it being this slow

2702
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:20,880
God, I don't remember it being this slow
 

2703
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,950
God, I don't remember it being this slow
for a while.

2704
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:24,960

 

2705
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,030

Starting to see these lower highs form.

2706
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:27,040
Starting to see these lower highs form.
 

2707
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,550
Starting to see these lower highs form.
Maybe they come back down to be what

2708
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:28,560
Maybe they come back down to be what
 

2709
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,870
Maybe they come back down to be what
now.

2710
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:30,880
now.
 

2711
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,390
now.
I don't have a whole lot of confidence

2712
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:32,400
I don't have a whole lot of confidence
 

2713
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,070
I don't have a whole lot of confidence
with how we've moved this morning. I'm

2714
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:34,080
with how we've moved this morning. I'm
 

2715
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:38,870
with how we've moved this morning. I'm
going to be honest with you.

2716
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:38,880

 

2717
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,709

Not seeing follow through. Just seeing

2718
01:12:40,709 --> 01:12:40,719
Not seeing follow through. Just seeing
 

2719
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:42,229
Not seeing follow through. Just seeing
uh

2720
01:12:42,229 --> 01:12:42,239
uh
 

2721
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,149
uh
little ranges be created. If we start

2722
01:12:44,149 --> 01:12:44,159
little ranges be created. If we start
 

2723
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:45,990
little ranges be created. If we start
leaving this range violently from above,

2724
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:46,000
leaving this range violently from above,
 

2725
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,350
leaving this range violently from above,
then we're going to see some downside

2726
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:47,360
then we're going to see some downside
 

2727
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:51,590
then we're going to see some downside
action. But we're not doing that yet.

2728
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:51,600
action. But we're not doing that yet.
 

2729
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,310
action. But we're not doing that yet.
VIX has found a bid at those 1720s to

2730
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:54,320
VIX has found a bid at those 1720s to
 

2731
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,590
VIX has found a bid at those 1720s to
1740s though.

2732
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:57,600
1740s though.
 

2733
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,110
1740s though.
Just like that, we're at VWAP. Will that

2734
01:12:59,110 --> 01:12:59,120
Just like that, we're at VWAP. Will that
 

2735
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:03,189
Just like that, we're at VWAP. Will that
happen quick?

2736
01:13:03,189 --> 01:13:03,199

 

2737
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:05,189

Did they bid off this or are we going to

2738
01:13:05,189 --> 01:13:05,199
Did they bid off this or are we going to
 

2739
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,990
Did they bid off this or are we going to
see downside pressure now?

2740
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:08,000
see downside pressure now?
 

2741
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,669
see downside pressure now?
That buyer who marketed in, he got

2742
01:13:09,669 --> 01:13:09,679
That buyer who marketed in, he got
 

2743
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:15,270
That buyer who marketed in, he got
himself caught there. He came in at 40s.

2744
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:15,280
himself caught there. He came in at 40s.
 

2745
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:24,550
himself caught there. He came in at 40s.
They're

2746
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:24,560

 

2747
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,950

bidding off you up buy came in at 40. So

2748
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:26,960
bidding off you up buy came in at 40. So
 

2749
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,470
bidding off you up buy came in at 40. So
I'm watching that level. That's his pain

2750
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:28,480
I'm watching that level. That's his pain
 

2751
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:33,990
I'm watching that level. That's his pain
point. That's where he came in.

2752
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:34,000

 

2753
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,510

Are they going to reclaim this range

2754
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:35,520
Are they going to reclaim this range
 

2755
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:41,270
Are they going to reclaim this range
that we've created up here?

2756
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:41,280

 

2757
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,709

Or are they going to reject it and

2758
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:42,719
Or are they going to reject it and
 

2759
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:44,310
Or are they going to reject it and
actually rotate all the way back down to

actually rotate all the way back down to
 

2761
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:52,790
actually rotate all the way back down to
lower day?

2762
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:52,800

If we reject this volume above, maybe

If we reject this volume above, maybe
 

2785
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,870
If we reject this volume above, maybe
just maybe there's a rotation. But if

just maybe there's a rotation. But if

right, if we reject this, maybe there's
 

2795
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,830
right, if we reject this, maybe there's
a rotation you need to get through TP1,

01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:35,840
a rotation you need to get through TP1,
 

2797
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,270
a rotation you need to get through TP1,
TP2, TP3, and then maybe we get that.

new volume node here, and they can do
 

2805

new volume node here, and they can do
this for a bit, this for a bit. I don't

01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:40,480

 

2831
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,110

We are starting to see that 840 become a

2832
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:43,120
We are starting to see that 840 become a
 

2833
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,990
We are starting to see that 840 become a
uh key level here where that buyer got

2834
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:46,000
uh key level here where that buyer got
 

2835
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,709
uh key level here where that buyer got
stuck.

2836
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:48,719
stuck.
 

2837
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:50,390
stuck.
Uh, I would say sellers just came in

2838
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:50,400
Uh, I would say sellers just came in
 

2839
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,630
Uh, I would say sellers just came in
here and didn't get their way. Really

2840
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:52,640
here and didn't get their way. Really
 

2841
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,310
here and didn't get their way. Really
lots of stops just got popped on that

2842
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:54,320
lots of stops just got popped on that
 

2843
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,532
lots of stops just got popped on that
last wash.

2844
01:15:57,532 --> 01:15:57,542
last wash.
 

2845
01:15:57,542 --> 01:16:02,790
last wash.
[cough]

2846
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:02,800

 

2847
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,790

It's just it's just SL like it's just

2848
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:04,800
It's just it's just SL like it's just
 

2849
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,830
It's just it's just SL like it's just
you remember it's end of the end of or

2850
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:07,840
you remember it's end of the end of or
 

2851
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,590
you remember it's end of the end of or
first day of the new month after a

2852
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:09,600
first day of the new month after a
 

2853
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,350
first day of the new month after a
holiday week on low volume. Everyone's

2854
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:11,360
holiday week on low volume. Everyone's
 

2855
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,790
holiday week on low volume. Everyone's
just feeling out what they want to do.

2856
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:12,800
just feeling out what they want to do.
 

2857
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,630
just feeling out what they want to do.
Like I wouldn't really want to be a

2858
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:14,640
Like I wouldn't really want to be a
 

2859
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:19,350
Like I wouldn't really want to be a
long-term buyer here, but

2860
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:19,360
long-term buyer here, but
 

2861
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,790
long-term buyer here, but
you know, if we are going to build out

2862
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:20,800
you know, if we are going to build out
 

2863
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,630
you know, if we are going to build out
enough liquidity, you can argue

2864
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:24,640
enough liquidity, you can argue
 

2865
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,270
enough liquidity, you can argue
for that buy,

2866
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:27,280
for that buy,
 

2867
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,870
for that buy,
right? If they can build this, I'd feel

2868
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:28,880
right? If they can build this, I'd feel
 

2869
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,149
right? If they can build this, I'd feel
much more comfortable. If we're going to

2870
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:30,159
much more comfortable. If we're going to
 

2871
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:31,990
much more comfortable. If we're going to
do complete a Santa Claus rally, I'd

2872
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:32,000
do complete a Santa Claus rally, I'd
 

2873
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,590
do complete a Santa Claus rally, I'd
want to see a wash and a go. Um, and

2874
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:35,600
want to see a wash and a go. Um, and
 

2875
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,910
want to see a wash and a go. Um, and
that's why I think you're building this

2876
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:37,920
that's why I think you're building this
 

2877
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,750
that's why I think you're building this
out. It's going to, if it offers one of

2878
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:39,760
out. It's going to, if it offers one of
 

2879
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,830
out. It's going to, if it offers one of
these later in the week, might be good.

2880
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:41,840
these later in the week, might be good.
 

2881
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,350
these later in the week, might be good.
Um, but you have to be careful that they

2882
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:43,360
Um, but you have to be careful that they
 

2883
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:47,110
Um, but you have to be careful that they
don't just roll it.

2884
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:47,120

 

2885
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,910

It's just these are really the legs,

2886
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:49,920
It's just these are really the legs,
 

2887
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,070
It's just these are really the legs,
right? So, it's just a question of can

2888
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:52,080
right? So, it's just a question of can
 

2889
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,790
right? So, it's just a question of can
it hold over that or not. It's we're

2890
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:54,800
it hold over that or not. It's we're
 

2891
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,790
it hold over that or not. It's we're
we're kind of in no man's land. That's

2892
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:56,800
we're kind of in no man's land. That's
 

2893
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,950
we're kind of in no man's land. That's
kind of the whole problem at the moment

2894
01:16:58,950 --> 01:16:58,960
kind of the whole problem at the moment
 

2895
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,350
kind of the whole problem at the moment
where we're opening up. I mean, the

2896
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:01,360
where we're opening up. I mean, the
 

2897
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:05,350
where we're opening up. I mean, the
obvious sell straight out the newsletter

2898
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:05,360
obvious sell straight out the newsletter
 

2899
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,030
obvious sell straight out the newsletter
was here, wasn't it? These levels

2900
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:07,040
was here, wasn't it? These levels
 

2901
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,149
was here, wasn't it? These levels
haven't changed. These are out the

2902
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:08,159
haven't changed. These are out the
 

2903
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:10,070
haven't changed. These are out the
newsletter. That was the cell. There's

2904
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:10,080
newsletter. That was the cell. There's
 

2905
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:13,189
newsletter. That was the cell. There's
your look into supply fail back on the

2906
01:17:13,189 --> 01:17:13,199
your look into supply fail back on the
 

2907
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,270
your look into supply fail back on the
previous day closed. There's your sell

2908
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:15,280
previous day closed. There's your sell
 

2909
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:18,229
previous day closed. There's your sell
that happened last night, right? So 500

2910
01:17:18,229 --> 01:17:18,239
that happened last night, right? So 500
 

2911
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:19,830
that happened last night, right? So 500
failed last night. That's that's the

2912
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:19,840
failed last night. That's that's the
 

2913
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,149
failed last night. That's that's the
level you want to be selling at. Now

2914
01:17:22,149 --> 01:17:22,159
level you want to be selling at. Now
 

2915
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:39,270
level you want to be selling at. Now
we're uh sort of 50/50 between the two

2916
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:39,280

 

2917
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,550

Totally

2918
01:17:42,550 --> 01:17:42,560

 

2919
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,310

nice, Troy. Yeah, I didn't see it until

2920
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:44,320
nice, Troy. Yeah, I didn't see it until
 

2921
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,630
nice, Troy. Yeah, I didn't see it until
we absolutely dumped a load already. So,

2922
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:46,640
we absolutely dumped a load already. So,
 

2923
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,350
we absolutely dumped a load already. So,
I caught a small amount of it. Um, up

2924
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:49,360
I caught a small amount of it. Um, up
 

2925
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:53,189
I caught a small amount of it. Um, up
about 4 450 bucks per account. That's

2926
01:17:53,189 --> 01:17:53,199
about 4 450 bucks per account. That's
 

2927
01:17:53,199 --> 01:18:08,870
about 4 450 bucks per account. That's
all I got with micros.

2928
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:08,880

 

2929
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,630

We know that there's a buyer stuck at

2930
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:10,640
We know that there's a buyer stuck at
 

2931
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,310
We know that there's a buyer stuck at
40s right now. That's one thing I would

2932
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:12,320
40s right now. That's one thing I would
 

2933
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:23,990
40s right now. That's one thing I would
say.

2934
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:24,000

 

2935
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,910

It's just so slow to do anything.

2936
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:27,920
It's just so slow to do anything.
 

2937
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,430
It's just so slow to do anything.
Right. Sellers have the chance here to

2938
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:29,440
Right. Sellers have the chance here to
 

2939
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,830
Right. Sellers have the chance here to
take control of this session versus 50s

2940
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:31,840
take control of this session versus 50s
 

2941
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,590
take control of this session versus 50s
and really start dumping it. And you

2942
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:33,600
and really start dumping it. And you
 

2943
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,910
and really start dumping it. And you
just you're not seeing like the

2944
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:35,920
just you're not seeing like the
 

2945
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:39,030
just you're not seeing like the
aggression from them. Like maybe it

2946
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:39,040
aggression from them. Like maybe it
 

2947
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,870
aggression from them. Like maybe it
comes but at the moment we're not seeing

2948
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:40,880
comes but at the moment we're not seeing
 

2949
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:51,830
comes but at the moment we're not seeing
it.

2950
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:51,840

 

2951
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,270

I see some stronger selling there.

2952
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:53,280
I see some stronger selling there.
 

2953
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,910
I see some stronger selling there.
They're trying into this 300. There's a

2954
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:55,920
They're trying into this 300. There's a
 

2955
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,229
They're trying into this 300. There's a
bid at 300.

2956
01:18:58,229 --> 01:18:58,239
bid at 300.
 

2957
01:18:58,239 --> 01:18:59,910
bid at 300.
I'd say all the time now it stays heavy

2958
01:18:59,910 --> 01:18:59,920
I'd say all the time now it stays heavy
 

2959
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,709
I'd say all the time now it stays heavy
versus that gray box above.

2960
01:19:02,709 --> 01:19:02,719
versus that gray box above.
 

2961
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:04,310
versus that gray box above.
you know, potential shorts back down,

2962
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:04,320
you know, potential shorts back down,
 

2963
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,390
you know, potential shorts back down,
but

2964
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:06,400
but
 

2965
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,390
but
midpoint of the range on a session. It's

2966
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:08,400
midpoint of the range on a session. It's
 

2967
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,110
midpoint of the range on a session. It's
kind of ugly. Look how we've developed

2968
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:11,120
kind of ugly. Look how we've developed
 

2969
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:17,750
kind of ugly. Look how we've developed
current profile.

2970
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:17,760

 

2971
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,590

Like, is that 90 odd points or

2972
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:19,600
Like, is that 90 odd points or
 

2973
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,390
Like, is that 90 odd points or
something? 80 odd points.

2974
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:22,400
something? 80 odd points.
 

2975
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,350
something? 80 odd points.
The way it's left it is so slow. They

2976
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:25,360
The way it's left it is so slow. They
 

2977
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,110
The way it's left it is so slow. They
might just bid back up and test this.

2978
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:27,120
might just bid back up and test this.
 

2979
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,149
might just bid back up and test this.
It's It's just not a great looking kind

2980
01:19:30,149 --> 01:19:30,159
It's It's just not a great looking kind
 

2981
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:32,070
It's It's just not a great looking kind
of thing.

2982
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:32,080
of thing.
 

2983
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:36,390
of thing.
Think about this. VWOPS, flow zones,

2984
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:36,400
Think about this. VWOPS, flow zones,
 

2985
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,470
Think about this. VWOPS, flow zones,
deep pullback,

2986
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:38,480
deep pullback,
 

2987
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,390
deep pullback,

01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,070
day value area low, New York.
Everything's fairly condensed here. We

2992
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:44,080
Everything's fairly condensed here. We
 

2993
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,229
Everything's fairly condensed here. We
haven't left it. We haven't left it and

2994
01:19:46,229 --> 01:19:46,239
haven't left it. We haven't left it and
 

2995
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:49,430
haven't left it. We haven't left it and
trapped enough for me. Like this. I like

2996
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:49,440
trapped enough for me. Like this. I like
 

2997
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,630
trapped enough for me. Like this. I like
these when we're violent, when we, you

2998
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:52,640
these when we're violent, when we, you
 

2999
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,510
these when we're violent, when we, you
know, aggressive. Leave a nice wick.

3000
01:19:55,510 --> 01:19:55,520
know, aggressive. Leave a nice wick.
 

3001
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,669
know, aggressive. Leave a nice wick.
Trap lots of buyers. Give me something

3002
01:19:57,669 --> 01:19:57,679
Trap lots of buyers. Give me something
 

3003
01:19:57,679 --> 01:19:59,430
Trap lots of buyers. Give me something
to fade for that move back down. I'm

3004
01:19:59,430 --> 01:19:59,440
to fade for that move back down. I'm
 

3005
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:02,149
to fade for that move back down. I'm
just not seeing that. This just feels

3006
01:20:02,149 --> 01:20:02,159
just not seeing that. This just feels
 

3007
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:16,790
just not seeing that. This just feels
very controlled both ways at the moment.

3008
01:20:16,790 --> 01:20:16,800

 

3009
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,470

The tape just feels slow. Like if we

3010
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:18,480
The tape just feels slow. Like if we
 

3011
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,470
The tape just feels slow. Like if we
look at map, it's not like an aggressive

3012
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:20,480
look at map, it's not like an aggressive
 

3013
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:24,790
look at map, it's not like an aggressive
tape. I can show you that can change.

3014
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:24,800
tape. I can show you that can change.
 

3015
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,470
tape. I can show you that can change.
It's just very slow. Like look how

3016
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:26,480
It's just very slow. Like look how
 

3017
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,950
It's just very slow. Like look how
controlled this is both sides. very

3018
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:28,960
controlled this is both sides. very
 

3019
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,630
controlled this is both sides. very
controlled like we saw some sellers get

3020
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:30,640
controlled like we saw some sellers get
 

3021
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,590
controlled like we saw some sellers get
stuck down here. Where's the guy at 40?

3022
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:33,600
stuck down here. Where's the guy at 40?
 

3023
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,070
stuck down here. Where's the guy at 40?
Was this him? Feel like it was before

3024
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:36,080
Was this him? Feel like it was before
 

3025
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,390
Was this him? Feel like it was before
that. Maybe it was here.

3026
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:38,400
that. Maybe it was here.
 

3027
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,790
that. Maybe it was here.
Yeah, 47. So, this is the this is the

3028
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:40,800
Yeah, 47. So, this is the this is the
 

3029
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,790
Yeah, 47. So, this is the this is the
buy the buyers that got stuck here. But

3030
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:42,800
buy the buyers that got stuck here. But
 

3031
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,950
buy the buyers that got stuck here. But
like we flushed down and we instantly

3032
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:44,960
like we flushed down and we instantly
 

3033
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,870
like we flushed down and we instantly
reclaimed and we're still going sideways

3034
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:46,880
reclaimed and we're still going sideways
 

3035
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,870
reclaimed and we're still going sideways
at those same kind of levels. Slowly

3036
01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:48,880
at those same kind of levels. Slowly
 

3037
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,430
at those same kind of levels. Slowly
walking it down. But

3038
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:51,440
walking it down. But
 

3039
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,830
walking it down. But
I don't like this down here. This looks

3040
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:53,840
I don't like this down here. This looks
 

3041
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:57,189
I don't like this down here. This looks
like an end of auction down here.

3042
01:20:57,189 --> 01:20:57,199
like an end of auction down here.
 

3043
01:20:57,199 --> 01:21:00,709
like an end of auction down here.
just it's just not A+ folks. It's just

01:21:00,709 --> 01:21:00,719
just it's just not A+ folks. It's just
 

3045
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:04,390
just it's just not A+ folks. It's just
not A+ here. It's just a range. It's a C

3046
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:04,400
not A+ here. It's just a range. It's a C
 

3047
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:08,550
not A+ here. It's just a range. It's a C
money take money kind of day.

3048
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:08,560

 

3049
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:09,910

Did any of you get anything good in

3050
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:09,920
Did any of you get anything good in
 

3051
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,750
Did any of you get anything good in
Black Friday?

3052
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:11,760
Black Friday?
 

3053
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,350
Black Friday?
I did buy this chair. I'm very happy

3054
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:13,360
I did buy this chair. I'm very happy
 

3055
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:18,709
I did buy this chair. I'm very happy
with this chair. Very comfortable.

3056
01:21:18,709 --> 01:21:18,719

 

3057
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:21,350

It was like I don't know 100 bucks off

3058
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:21,360
It was like I don't know 100 bucks off
 

3059
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,790
It was like I don't know 100 bucks off
or something. Maybe a bit more.

3060
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:24,800
or something. Maybe a bit more.
 

3061
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:29,189
or something. Maybe a bit more.
Move down to point of control. What?

3062
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:29,199
Move down to point of control. What?
 

3063
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:35,189
Move down to point of control. What?
PC's up here, mate.

3064
01:21:35,189 --> 01:21:35,199

 

3065
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:37,110

You got some monitors. Nice, nice, nice,

3066
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:37,120
You got some monitors. Nice, nice, nice,
 

3067
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:47,510
You got some monitors. Nice, nice, nice,
nice. [snorts]

3068
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:47,520

 

3069
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,070

There's a 300 test

3070
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:50,080
There's a 300 test
 

3071
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,510
There's a 300 test
now. Starting to see more aggression

3072
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:51,520
now. Starting to see more aggression
 

3073
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,590
now. Starting to see more aggression
from these sellers. Might complete this

3074
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:53,600
from these sellers. Might complete this
 

3075
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,709
from these sellers. Might complete this
move now if they can get going.

3076
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:56,719
move now if they can get going.
 

3077
01:21:56,719 --> 01:21:58,149
move now if they can get going.
I said it's possible they want to come

3078
01:21:58,149 --> 01:21:58,159
I said it's possible they want to come
 

3079
01:21:58,159 --> 01:21:59,669
I said it's possible they want to come
back down the lower day because we have

3080
01:21:59,669 --> 01:21:59,679
back down the lower day because we have
 

3081
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:01,270
back down the lower day because we have
unfinished business down there. It's

3082
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:01,280
unfinished business down there. It's
 

3083
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,110
unfinished business down there. It's
taking so long that they put me off

3084
01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:03,120
taking so long that they put me off
 

3085
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:15,990
taking so long that they put me off
taking it

3086
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:16,000

 

3087
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,229

value low of the session so far. Doesn't

3088
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:18,239
value low of the session so far. Doesn't
 

3089
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:19,669
value low of the session so far. Doesn't
mean we can't expand it. That's just

3090
01:22:19,669 --> 01:22:19,679
mean we can't expand it. That's just
 

3091
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:27,590
mean we can't expand it. That's just
where we're trading at so far.

3092
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:27,600

 

3093
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,550

Starting to see some aggression here.

3094
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:30,560
Starting to see some aggression here.
 

3095
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,669
Starting to see some aggression here.
Probably going to try and complete

3096
01:22:31,669 --> 01:22:31,679
Probably going to try and complete
 

3097
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:33,110
Probably going to try and complete
towards here. It's where buyers came in

3098
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:33,120
towards here. It's where buyers came in
 

3099
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:39,030
towards here. It's where buyers came in
earlier towards 50s. This New York open

3100
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:39,040

 

3101
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:42,550

has taken out that low. Not yet.

3102
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:42,560
has taken out that low. Not yet.
 

3103
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:56,550
has taken out that low. Not yet.
Went to his New York open as well.

3104
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:56,560

 

3105
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,910

I don't know what they want to do, Troy.

3106
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:57,920
I don't know what they want to do, Troy.
 

3107
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,950
I don't know what they want to do, Troy.
It doesn't seem like they're going to

3108
01:22:58,950 --> 01:22:58,960
It doesn't seem like they're going to
 

3109
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,070
It doesn't seem like they're going to
have the power to do that right now.

3110
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:02,080
have the power to do that right now.
 

3111
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:04,149
have the power to do that right now.
All we've done really is wash uh the

3112
01:23:04,149 --> 01:23:04,159
All we've done really is wash uh the
 

3113
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:06,790
All we've done really is wash uh the
London level and turn back inside. So,

3114
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:06,800
London level and turn back inside. So,
 

3115
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,310
London level and turn back inside. So,
we're coming back down to test this

3116
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:08,320
we're coming back down to test this
 

3117
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:11,830
we're coming back down to test this
lower lower band now. I just hate how we

3118
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:11,840
lower lower band now. I just hate how we
 

3119
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,590
lower lower band now. I just hate how we
formed that there was so slow. This was

3120
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:13,600
formed that there was so slow. This was
 

3121
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,189
formed that there was so slow. This was
probably the cell here,

3122
01:23:17,189 --> 01:23:17,199
probably the cell here,
 

3123
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:22,550
probably the cell here,
but the tape was so slow at that point.

3124
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:22,560

 

3125
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,229

It's not bad. If any of you took that,

3126
01:23:24,229 --> 01:23:24,239
It's not bad. If any of you took that,
 

3127
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:27,350
It's not bad. If any of you took that,
it's pretty decent. Even the flow zones

3128
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:27,360
it's pretty decent. Even the flow zones
 

3129
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,990
it's pretty decent. Even the flow zones
pretty decent.

3130
01:23:29,990 --> 01:23:30,000
pretty decent.
 

3131
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,430
pretty decent.
So, let's see if they squeeze this back

3132
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:31,440
So, let's see if they squeeze this back
 

3133
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:36,550
So, let's see if they squeeze this back
up and then resell it.

3134
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:36,560

 

3135
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:37,990

And this is where we found a bid this

3136
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:38,000
And this is where we found a bid this
 

3137
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,270
And this is where we found a bid this
morning. So, they've almost done the

3138
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:39,280
morning. So, they've almost done the
 

3139
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:42,790
morning. So, they've almost done the
rotation already.

3140
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:42,800
rotation already.
 

3141
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,110
rotation already.
They're not going to make this easy.

3142
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:45,120
They're not going to make this easy.
 

3143
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:49,792
They're not going to make this easy.
They're not going to make this easy.

3144
01:23:49,792 --> 01:23:49,802

 

3145
01:23:49,802 --> 01:23:52,070

[snorts]

3146
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:52,080

 

3147
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,990

Back towards the 300. I would say that

3148
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:54,000
Back towards the 300. I would say that
 

3149
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,149
Back towards the 300. I would say that
sort of 350 becomes key again. 320 and

3150
01:23:58,149 --> 01:23:58,159
sort of 350 becomes key again. 320 and
 

3151
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:02,709
sort of 350 becomes key again. 320 and
350.

3152
01:24:02,709 --> 01:24:02,719

 

3153
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:04,229

So, buyers who didn't get filled in the

3154
01:24:04,229 --> 01:24:04,239
So, buyers who didn't get filled in the
 

3155
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,990
So, buyers who didn't get filled in the
morning's shove up. They just got filled

3156
01:24:05,990 --> 01:24:06,000
morning's shove up. They just got filled
 

3157
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:12,310
morning's shove up. They just got filled
there in this imbalance right here.

3158
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:12,320

 

3159
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,110

That's 340s. 350s look big overunders

3160
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:15,120
That's 340s. 350s look big overunders
 

3161
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:29,350
That's 340s. 350s look big overunders
right now.

3162
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:29,360

 

3163
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,750

Straight up then.

3164
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:31,760
Straight up then.
 

3165
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,669
Straight up then.
This is fun.

3166
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:33,679
This is fun.
 

3167
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:34,870
This is fun.
All

3168
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:34,880
All
 

3169
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,149
All
right, let's see what happens when we

3170
01:24:36,149 --> 01:24:36,159
right, let's see what happens when we
 

3171
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:38,070
right, let's see what happens when we
get up here. There's good power in this

3172
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:38,080
get up here. There's good power in this
 

3173
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,390
get up here. There's good power in this
move. This is back to that level again.

3174
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:40,400
move. This is back to that level again.
 

3175
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:43,350
move. This is back to that level again.
This sort of 340, 350.

3176
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:43,360
This sort of 340, 350.
 

3177
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,030
This sort of 340, 350.
Not too far away from it. What do we hit

3178
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:45,040
Not too far away from it. What do we hit
 

3179
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:48,950
Not too far away from it. What do we hit
there? 32s.

3180
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:48,960

 

3181
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,629

Back to the view up again. Are they

3182
01:24:50,629 --> 01:24:50,639
Back to the view up again. Are they
 

3183
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:52,229
Back to the view up again. Are they
going to go up to 40s and 50s and test

3184
01:24:52,229 --> 01:24:52,239
going to go up to 40s and 50s and test
 

3185
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:53,430
going to go up to 40s and 50s and test
it? If they get through that, they're

3186
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:53,440
it? If they get through that, they're
 

3187
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,870
it? If they get through that, they're
going to test the 70s. And if they get

3188
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:54,880
going to test the 70s. And if they get
 

3189
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:58,390
going to test the 70s. And if they get
through that, they can start squeezing.

3190
01:24:58,390 --> 01:24:58,400
through that, they can start squeezing.
 

3191
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,750
through that, they can start squeezing.
Yeah, I just don't think it's very

3192
01:24:59,750 --> 01:24:59,760
Yeah, I just don't think it's very
 

3193
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:04,390
Yeah, I just don't think it's very
pretty out here.

3194
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:04,400

 

3195
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,030

If you chased a short, you got hurt. If

3196
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:07,040
If you chased a short, you got hurt. If
 

3197
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,470
If you chased a short, you got hurt. If
you bought above 70 today, you got hurt.

3198
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:10,480
you bought above 70 today, you got hurt.
 

3199
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,750
you bought above 70 today, you got hurt.
That's kind of the story. There's

3200
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:11,760
That's kind of the story. There's
 

3201
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:27,030
That's kind of the story. There's
nothing else really going on.

3202
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:27,040

 

3203
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,390

All they did was fill that old

3204
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:28,400
All they did was fill that old
 

3205
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:36,070
All they did was fill that old
imbalance. That was it.

3206
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:36,080

 

3207
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,350

Are they going to come all the way back

3208
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:37,360
Are they going to come all the way back
 

3209
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:52,390
Are they going to come all the way back
down now?

3210
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:52,400

 

3211
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:57,590

Just feels a bit thin. The book

3212
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:57,600

 

3213
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:18,550

a little bit thin.

3214
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:18,560

 

3215
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,669

Sorry.

3216
01:26:23,669 --> 01:26:23,679

 

3217
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:26,550

So, this imbalance from here

3218
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:26,560
So, this imbalance from here
 

3219
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,590
So, this imbalance from here
got filled. We found a bid. We pull

3220
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:29,600
got filled. We found a bid. We pull
 

3221
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,430
got filled. We found a bid. We pull
back. We're going to try and do this

3222
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:31,440
back. We're going to try and do this
 

3223
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:32,790
back. We're going to try and do this
now. That's what he's trying to do. I

3224
01:26:32,790 --> 01:26:32,800
now. That's what he's trying to do. I
 

3225
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,950
now. That's what he's trying to do. I
just don't I don't love Look where we're

3226
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:34,960
just don't I don't love Look where we're
 

3227
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,629
just don't I don't love Look where we're
trading. It's just there's no edge here

3228
01:26:36,629 --> 01:26:36,639
trading. It's just there's no edge here
 

3229
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:38,950
trading. It's just there's no edge here
at the moment.

3230
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:38,960
at the moment.
 

3231
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,070
at the moment.
I'm happy sitting still honestly

3232
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:42,080
I'm happy sitting still honestly
 

3233
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,510
I'm happy sitting still honestly
especially on first day of the month on

3234
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:43,520
especially on first day of the month on
 

3235
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:46,310
especially on first day of the month on
a Monday and like recovering from COVID.

3236
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:46,320
a Monday and like recovering from COVID.
 

3237
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:53,510
a Monday and like recovering from COVID.
I'm h happy sitting still.

3238
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:53,520

 

3239
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,310

What strategy do I use? Um well depends

3240
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:56,320
What strategy do I use? Um well depends
 

3241
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:59,350
What strategy do I use? Um well depends
on the setup. People get so focused on

3242
01:26:59,350 --> 01:26:59,360
on the setup. People get so focused on
 

3243
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,870
on the setup. People get so focused on
that. It all depends on the setup.

3244
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:00,880
that. It all depends on the setup.
 

3245
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,990
that. It all depends on the setup.
Basically, I look to find a participants

3246
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:04,000
Basically, I look to find a participants
 

3247
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,830
Basically, I look to find a participants
who are offside where I can trade

3248
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:05,840
who are offside where I can trade
 

3249
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,709
who are offside where I can trade
ideally in a protrend direction, which I

3250
01:27:08,709 --> 01:27:08,719
ideally in a protrend direction, which I
 

3251
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:10,629
ideally in a protrend direction, which I
don't think we're in at all right now. I

3252
01:27:10,629 --> 01:27:10,639
don't think we're in at all right now. I
 

3253
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:12,470
don't think we're in at all right now. I
think the market needs to make up its

3254
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:12,480
think the market needs to make up its
 

3255
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,310
think the market needs to make up its
mind. So, if we're going to be tra

3256
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:14,320
mind. So, if we're going to be tra
 

3257
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,149
mind. So, if we're going to be tra
protrend bullish, we need to set a daily

3258
01:27:16,149 --> 01:27:16,159
protrend bullish, we need to set a daily
 

3259
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:17,750
protrend bullish, we need to set a daily
higher low, which we haven't done yet.

3260
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:17,760
higher low, which we haven't done yet.
 

3261
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,149
higher low, which we haven't done yet.
Could be that today does that. Then we

3262
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:20,159
Could be that today does that. Then we
 

3263
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:22,229
Could be that today does that. Then we
look for

3264
01:27:22,229 --> 01:27:22,239
look for
 

3265
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:24,310
look for
that kind of trade upside. If we are

3266
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:24,320
that kind of trade upside. If we are
 

3267
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,470
that kind of trade upside. If we are
going to fail, then I'm looking for fail

3268
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:26,480
going to fail, then I'm looking for fail
 

3269
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,870
going to fail, then I'm looking for fail
breakouts. So all I'm ever looking for

3270
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:28,880
breakouts. So all I'm ever looking for
 

3271
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:32,149
breakouts. So all I'm ever looking for
is trap traders for rotations from one

3272
01:27:32,149 --> 01:27:32,159
is trap traders for rotations from one
 

3273
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:33,750
is trap traders for rotations from one
level to the next to go and search for

3274
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:33,760
level to the next to go and search for
 

3275
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,350
level to the next to go and search for
liquidity. So create liquidity, search

3276
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:35,360
liquidity. So create liquidity, search
 

3277
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,030
liquidity. So create liquidity, search
for liquidity. Today is a creation of

3278
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:37,040
for liquidity. Today is a creation of
 

3279
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,270
for liquidity. Today is a creation of
liquidity day by the looks of it, which

3280
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:39,280
liquidity day by the looks of it, which
 

3281
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:42,149
liquidity day by the looks of it, which
is why I'm kind of sat here waiting. So

3282
01:27:42,149 --> 01:27:42,159
is why I'm kind of sat here waiting. So
 

3283
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:44,070
is why I'm kind of sat here waiting. So
here's the move back to 40s and then

3284
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:44,080
here's the move back to 40s and then
 

3285
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:47,110
here's the move back to 40s and then
50s. Squeeze will happen above 70s. If

3286
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:47,120
50s. Squeeze will happen above 70s. If
 

3287
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,189
50s. Squeeze will happen above 70s. If
they let the bulls out above 70s, that's

3288
01:27:49,189 --> 01:27:49,199
they let the bulls out above 70s, that's
 

3289
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:51,350
they let the bulls out above 70s, that's
where a squeeze can happen. Nvidia has

3290
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:51,360
where a squeeze can happen. Nvidia has
 

3291
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,189
where a squeeze can happen. Nvidia has
caught a bid here. None of the rest of

3292
01:27:53,189 --> 01:27:53,199
caught a bid here. None of the rest of
 

3293
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:55,910
caught a bid here. None of the rest of
the market still caught a bid.

3294
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:55,920
the market still caught a bid.
 

3295
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,750
the market still caught a bid.
So this is the shelf where we failed

3296
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:57,760
So this is the shelf where we failed
 

3297
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:58,950
So this is the shelf where we failed
from. All right, this is the volume

3298
01:27:58,950 --> 01:27:58,960
from. All right, this is the volume
 

3299
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,709
from. All right, this is the volume
where we failed from. If we get back

3300
01:28:00,709 --> 01:28:00,719
where we failed from. If we get back
 

3301
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:02,950
where we failed from. If we get back
through this shelf, all right, then this

3302
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:02,960
through this shelf, all right, then this
 

3303
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,270
through this shelf, all right, then this
will be a look below that fails and we

3304
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:05,280
will be a look below that fails and we
 

3305
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,350
will be a look below that fails and we
can use this liquidity at this point to

3306
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:07,360
can use this liquidity at this point to
 

3307
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:10,310
can use this liquidity at this point to
go higher. Very, very nasty how they've

3308
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:10,320
go higher. Very, very nasty how they've
 

3309
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:19,590
go higher. Very, very nasty how they've
done that. It's very, very quick.

3310
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:19,600

 

3311
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,310

Number 70 is the level that buyers were

3312
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:22,320
Number 70 is the level that buyers were
 

3313
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,229
Number 70 is the level that buyers were
stuck above. There's the look back to

3314
01:28:24,229 --> 01:28:24,239
stuck above. There's the look back to
 

3315
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:26,070
stuck above. There's the look back to
PC. So, I'd say buyers now will want to

3316
01:28:26,070 --> 01:28:26,080
PC. So, I'd say buyers now will want to
 

3317
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,709
PC. So, I'd say buyers now will want to
hold 20s. This shelf here, buyers will

3318
01:28:28,709 --> 01:28:28,719
hold 20s. This shelf here, buyers will
 

3319
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:30,070
hold 20s. This shelf here, buyers will
not want it below that. They will want

3320
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:30,080
not want it below that. They will want
 

3321
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,310
not want it below that. They will want
to do this to complete the rotation. If

3322
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:32,320
to do this to complete the rotation. If
 

3323
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,990
to do this to complete the rotation. If
sellers start getting their way, they

3324
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:34,000
sellers start getting their way, they
 

3325
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,189
sellers start getting their way, they
can still complete. We still have

3326
01:28:35,189 --> 01:28:35,199
can still complete. We still have
 

3327
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:36,870
can still complete. We still have
unfinished business down here. We did

3328
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:36,880
unfinished business down here. We did
 

3329
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,790
unfinished business down here. We did
not take out GlobeEx lows on any market

3330
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:38,800
not take out GlobeEx lows on any market
 

3331
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:43,910
not take out GlobeEx lows on any market
yet.

3332
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:43,920

 

3333
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,750

This is just ranging. This is why the

3334
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:45,760
This is just ranging. This is why the
 

3335
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,270
This is just ranging. This is why the
flow zones are kind of stuck here.

3336
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:47,280
flow zones are kind of stuck here.
 

3337
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,110
flow zones are kind of stuck here.

finding a bid off his New open. We're

3350
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:21,280
finding a bid off his New open. We're
 

3351
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:24,310
finding a bid off his New open. We're
just literally in no man's land.

3352
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:24,320
just literally in no man's land.
 

3353
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,229
just literally in no man's land.
I think this is also an old gap on the

3354
01:29:26,229 --> 01:29:26,239
I think this is also an old gap on the
 

3355
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:28,070
I think this is also an old gap on the
spy, not just a new gap. We're actually

3356
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:28,080
spy, not just a new gap. We're actually
 

3357
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,070
spy, not just a new gap. We're actually
trading into into an old gap again as

3358
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:30,080
trading into into an old gap again as
 

3359
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,361
trading into into an old gap again as
well.

3360
01:29:32,361 --> 01:29:32,371
well.
 

3361
01:29:32,371 --> 01:29:37,270
well.
[cough and laughter]

3362
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:37,280

 

3363
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,149

Yeah, Nvidia higher day right now. I

3364
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:40,159
Yeah, Nvidia higher day right now. I
 

3365
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:41,910
Yeah, Nvidia higher day right now. I
reckon that 180 is probably quite a big

3366
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:41,920
reckon that 180 is probably quite a big
 

3367
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:44,950
reckon that 180 is probably quite a big
level on Nvidia. Probably on the options

3368
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:44,960
level on Nvidia. Probably on the options
 

3369
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,669
level on Nvidia. Probably on the options
which we've just traded into. I reckon

3370
01:29:47,669 --> 01:29:47,679
which we've just traded into. I reckon
 

3371
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:55,110
which we've just traded into. I reckon
it's a big old level.

3372
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:55,120

 

3373
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:58,709

We got above that

3374
01:29:58,709 --> 01:29:58,719
We got above that
 

3375
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:03,430
We got above that
80.27 liquidity at 81's

3376
01:30:03,430 --> 01:30:03,440
80.27 liquidity at 81's

on the video.

3380

3381
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:25,110

London Asia suite.

3382
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:25,120
London Asia suite.
 

3383
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:26,870
London Asia suite.
Uh

3384
01:30:26,870 --> 01:30:26,880
Uh
 

3385
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,030
Uh
well, [sighs and gasps] depends on your

3386
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:29,040
well, [sighs and gasps] depends on your
 

3387
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,830
well, [sighs and gasps] depends on your
timings, but I wouldn't consider it

3388
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:31,840
timings, but I wouldn't consider it
 

3389
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,870
timings, but I wouldn't consider it
because that I don't like that.

3390
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:34,880
because that I don't like that.
 

3391
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:39,669
because that I don't like that.
Uh

3392
01:30:39,669 --> 01:30:39,679

 

3393
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:47,750

what was that? 0030 low.

3394
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:47,760

 

3395
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,510

And we haven't done it. Have we done it

3396
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:49,520
And we haven't done it. Have we done it
 

3397
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,430
And we haven't done it. Have we done it
in We haven't done it in New York hours

3398
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:51,440
in We haven't done it in New York hours
 

3399
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:55,030
in We haven't done it in New York hours
to the downside.

3400
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:55,040

 

3401
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,910

This low down here.

3402
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:57,920
This low down here.
 

3403
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,310
This low down here.
This low. We've protected this low

3404
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:00,320
This low. We've protected this low
 

3405
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:07,510
This low. We've protected this low
twice. One, two, protection.

3406
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:07,520

 

3407
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,350

We've left lots of liquidity down here.

3408
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:09,360
We've left lots of liquidity down here.
 

3409
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,709
We've left lots of liquidity down here.
Now, if you think about this

3410
01:31:12,709 --> 01:31:12,719
Now, if you think about this
 

3411
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:15,350
Now, if you think about this
and this,

3412
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:15,360
and this,
 

3413
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,030
and this,
I'm not convinced by that in a range

3414
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:17,040
I'm not convinced by that in a range
 

3415
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,870
I'm not convinced by that in a range
leaving liquidity like that. Not

3416
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:18,880
leaving liquidity like that. Not
 

3417
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:21,030
leaving liquidity like that. Not
convinced by it.

3418
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:21,040
convinced by it.
 

3419
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,790
convinced by it.
Okay, here's the test of these 20s. Like

3420
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:22,800
Okay, here's the test of these 20s. Like
 

3421
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,070
Okay, here's the test of these 20s. Like
we just talked about, bulls will need to

3422
01:31:24,070 --> 01:31:24,080
we just talked about, bulls will need to
 

3423
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,510
we just talked about, bulls will need to
hold this. If they fail to hold this,

3424
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:25,520
hold this. If they fail to hold this,
 

3425
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,510
hold this. If they fail to hold this,
there is more rotation downside

3426
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:27,520
there is more rotation downside
 

3427
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:33,270
there is more rotation downside
possible.

3428
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:33,280

 

3429
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,990

I' say 20s down to 05s need to hold for

3430
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:36,000
I' say 20s down to 05s need to hold for
 

3431
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:44,070
I' say 20s down to 05s need to hold for
bulls.

3432
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:44,080

 

3433
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,470

Everything's flat though.

3434
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:46,480
Everything's flat though.
 

3435
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:48,629
Everything's flat though.
Every single sort of indicator is flat

3436
01:31:48,629 --> 01:31:48,639
Every single sort of indicator is flat
 

3437
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:50,310
Every single sort of indicator is flat
on the screen right now. No trend

3441
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:22,550

For me, this is just creation of

3442
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:22,560
For me, this is just creation of
 

3443
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:24,229
For me, this is just creation of
liquidity. That's all we're doing right

3444
01:32:24,229 --> 01:32:24,239
liquidity. That's all we're doing right
 

3445
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:26,709
liquidity. That's all we're doing right
now.

3446
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:26,719
now.
 

3447
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:32,790
now.
Best prop firm for beginners. Um

3448
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:32,800

probably the new Lucid accounts pretty

3456
01:32:43,669 --> 01:32:43,679
probably the new Lucid accounts pretty
 

3457
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:48,149
probably the new Lucid accounts pretty
good. They're on sale right now.

3459
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:51,910

Um, if you just want cheaper accounts

01:32:51,910 --> 01:32:51,920
Um, if you just want cheaper accounts
 

3461
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,669
Um, if you just want cheaper accounts
because it's your first time trying, you

3462
01:32:53,669 --> 01:32:53,679
because it's your first time trying, you
 

3463
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:55,030
because it's your first time trying, you
can look at Apex, but you just need to

3464
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:55,040
can look at Apex, but you just need to
 

3465
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:58,229
can look at Apex, but you just need to
be aware of the rules

3466
01:32:58,229 --> 01:32:58,239
be aware of the rules
 

3467
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:00,870
be aware of the rules
and size down if you're going to trade

3468
01:33:00,870 --> 01:33:00,880
and size down if you're going to trade
 

3469
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:06,709
and size down if you're going to trade
with them.

3470
01:33:06,709 --> 01:33:06,719

 

3471
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:08,550

We're just totally stuck. Can't reclaim

3472
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:08,560
We're just totally stuck. Can't reclaim
 

3473
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,070
We're just totally stuck. Can't reclaim
this gray box. Right, this is where

3474
01:33:10,070 --> 01:33:10,080
this gray box. Right, this is where
 

3475
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,790
this gray box. Right, this is where
volume's stuck and we're holding 20s.

3476
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:12,800
volume's stuck and we're holding 20s.
 

3477
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,709
volume's stuck and we're holding 20s.
So, the rotation now happening between

3478
01:33:14,709 --> 01:33:14,719
So, the rotation now happening between
 

3479
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:16,870
So, the rotation now happening between
here.

3480
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:16,880
here.
 

3481
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:19,750
here.
Bulls take control above this. Bears can

3482
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:19,760
Bulls take control above this. Bears can
 

3483
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:22,390
Bulls take control above this. Bears can
take potentially control below this. We

3484
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:22,400
take potentially control below this. We
 

3485
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:25,270
take potentially control below this. We
do have excess down here.

3486
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:25,280
do have excess down here.
 

3487
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:30,310
do have excess down here.
Sellers were caught down there

3488
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:30,320

 

3489
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:31,990

and buyers were caught on this high as

3490
01:33:31,990 --> 01:33:32,000
and buyers were caught on this high as
 

3491
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,510
and buyers were caught on this high as
well. So that's what I mean. We're just

3492
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:33,520
well. So that's what I mean. We're just
 

3493
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,350
well. So that's what I mean. We're just
in a range rotation. You might be like,

3494
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:35,360
in a range rotation. You might be like,
 

3495
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,550
in a range rotation. You might be like,
why is he sitting still? He's not

3496
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:36,560
why is he sitting still? He's not
 

3497
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:37,910
why is he sitting still? He's not
calling anything. So there's just

3498
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:37,920
calling anything. So there's just
 

3499
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,229
calling anything. So there's just
nothing. I really am seeing that. I'm

3500
01:33:40,229 --> 01:33:40,239
nothing. I really am seeing that. I'm
 

3501
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:42,790
nothing. I really am seeing that. I'm
like, yeah, this feels like a shift in

3502
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:42,800
like, yeah, this feels like a shift in
 

3503
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,470
like, yeah, this feels like a shift in
momentum. This feels like someone wants

3504
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:44,480
momentum. This feels like someone wants
 

3505
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,990
momentum. This feels like someone wants
to take control. I'm just not seeing

3506
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:46,000
to take control. I'm just not seeing
 

3507
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,149
to take control. I'm just not seeing
that right now. Doesn't mean things

3508
01:33:48,149 --> 01:33:48,159
that right now. Doesn't mean things
 

3509
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:49,910
that right now. Doesn't mean things
can't develop for you, but right now

3510
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:49,920
can't develop for you, but right now
 

3511
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,149
can't develop for you, but right now
what I'm seeing is not making me think

3512
01:33:52,149 --> 01:33:52,159
what I'm seeing is not making me think
 

3513
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:54,629
what I'm seeing is not making me think
there's a big move coming.

3514
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:54,639
there's a big move coming.
 

3515
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:56,870
there's a big move coming.

and maybe the new
Lucid accounts, although I'd need to

3546
01:34:36,709 --> 01:34:36,719
Lucid accounts, although I'd need to
 

3547
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:38,709
Lucid accounts, although I'd need to
check, is they don't have consistency

3548
01:34:38,709 --> 01:34:38,719
check, is they don't have consistency
 

3549
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:41,510
check, is they don't have consistency
rules, whereas uh, Tradeify does. One

3550
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:41,520
rules, whereas uh, Tradeify does. One
 

3551
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,390

thing to be aware of,
 

3553
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,870
thing to be aware of,
always think not having consistency

3554
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:46,880
always think not having consistency
 

3555
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:50,709
always think not having consistency
rules can be very, very useful.

3556
01:34:50,709 --> 01:34:50,719
rules can be very, very useful.
 

3557
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:52,070

sell this back down to the 20s. Do they
get acceptance through it? This is where

3567
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,750

just nothing. I'm just I'm watching the

tape in the book. I'm trying to see if
 

3573
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:09,110
tape in the book. I'm trying to see if
someone wants to take control. We're not

3574
01:35:09,110 --> 01:35:09,120
someone wants to take control. We're not
 

3575
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:12,310
someone wants to take control. We're not
seeing it.

3576
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:12,320
seeing it.
 

3577
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:19,030
seeing it.
Not seeing it right now in the market.

3578
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:19,040

 

3579
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,470

Like I said, that's I took that trade

3580
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:20,480
Like I said, that's I took that trade
 

3581
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,390
Like I said, that's I took that trade
overnight, so I'm not too fast either.

3582
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:22,400
overnight, so I'm not too fast either.
 

3583
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:37,590
overnight, so I'm not too fast either.
It's okay.

3584
01:35:37,590 --> 01:35:37,600

 

3585
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:40,149

Probably a good day for me to um do my

3586
01:35:40,149 --> 01:35:40,159
Probably a good day for me to um do my
 

3587
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:42,550
Probably a good day for me to um do my
course with a section on bookmap is

3588
01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:42,560
course with a section on bookmap is
 

3589
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,470
course with a section on bookmap is
moving so slow it's very easy to explain

3590
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:44,480
moving so slow it's very easy to explain
 

3591
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:49,350
moving so slow it's very easy to explain
what's happening.

3592
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:49,360

 

3593
01:35:49,360 --> 01:36:05,669

Yeah, nice for Black Friday sale. Nice.

3594
01:36:05,669 --> 01:36:05,679

 

3595
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:07,030

All right, I'm going to use the bathroom

3596
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:07,040
All right, I'm going to use the bathroom
 

3597
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,110
All right, I'm going to use the bathroom
here while it makes its mind up. So,

3598
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:09,120
here while it makes its mind up. So,
 

3599
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:11,270
here while it makes its mind up. So,
remember 320s.

3600
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:11,280
remember 320s.
 

3601
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:13,510
remember 320s.
Bulls are trying to hold the 320s.

3602
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:13,520
Bulls are trying to hold the 320s.
 

3603
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,870
Bulls are trying to hold the 320s.
Acceptance over 360. I'd say 370 is the

3604
01:36:16,870 --> 01:36:16,880
Acceptance over 360. I'd say 370 is the
 

3605
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:20,149
Acceptance over 360. I'd say 370 is the
big one. But any acceptance over here,

3606
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:20,159
big one. But any acceptance over here,
 

3607
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:22,470
big one. But any acceptance over here,
right, bulls can maybe take control.

3608
01:36:22,470 --> 01:36:22,480
right, bulls can maybe take control.
 

3609
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,070
right, bulls can maybe take control.
Remember, every look so far this

3610
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:24,080
Remember, every look so far this
 

3611
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,270
Remember, every look so far this
morning, every look above has been

3612
01:36:25,270 --> 01:36:25,280
morning, every look above has been
 

3613
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,950
morning, every look above has been
failed. But we have unfinished business

3614
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:26,960
failed. But we have unfinished business
 

3615
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,669
failed. But we have unfinished business
if they want to rotate. And bulls have

3616
01:36:29,669 --> 01:36:29,679
if they want to rotate. And bulls have
 

3617
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:31,590
if they want to rotate. And bulls have
got to hold that 320 level. All right.

3618
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:31,600
got to hold that 320 level. All right.
 

3619
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,430
got to hold that 320 level. All right.
If you hold that 320 level, they'll be

3620
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:33,440
If you hold that 320 level, they'll be
 

3621
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:34,950
If you hold that 320 level, they'll be
looking to complete the rotation. I'll

3622
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:34,960
looking to complete the rotation. I'll
 

3623
01:36:34,960 --> 01:39:08,113
looking to complete the rotation. I'll
be back shortly.

3624
01:39:08,113 --> 01:39:08,123

 

3625
01:39:08,123 --> 01:39:08,950

>> [sighs]

3626
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:08,960
>> [sighs]
 

3627
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:11,669
>> [sighs]
>> All right. It's trying. It's trying. If

3628
01:39:11,669 --> 01:39:11,679
>> All right. It's trying. It's trying. If
 

3629
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:13,669
>> All right. It's trying. It's trying. If
you're bullish, you held the 320s.

3630
01:39:13,669 --> 01:39:13,679
you're bullish, you held the 320s.
 

3631
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:15,350
you're bullish, you held the 320s.
There's your flag or inverse head and

3632
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:15,360
There's your flag or inverse head and
 

3633
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,750
There's your flag or inverse head and
shoulders kind of look. And it's trying.

3634
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:17,760
shoulders kind of look. And it's trying.
 

3635
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,189
shoulders kind of look. And it's trying.
All right. So, we're going to try and

3636
01:39:19,189 --> 01:39:19,199
All right. So, we're going to try and
 

3637
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:21,910
All right. So, we're going to try and
squeeze now. Your targets are here. So

3638
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:21,920
squeeze now. Your targets are here. So
 

3639
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:25,669
squeeze now. Your targets are here. So
higher day, previous day PC 403,

3640
01:39:25,669 --> 01:39:25,679
higher day, previous day PC 403,
 

3641
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:28,070
higher day, previous day PC 403,
previous day value area high and then up

3642
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:28,080
previous day value area high and then up
 

3643
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,990
previous day value area high and then up
here. All right. So there's your higher

3644
01:39:29,990 --> 01:39:30,000
here. All right. So there's your higher
 

3645
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,910
here. All right. So there's your higher
low. There's the hold of 320 that we

3646
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:31,920
low. There's the hold of 320 that we
 

3647
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:34,229
low. There's the hold of 320 that we
talked about.

3648
01:39:34,229 --> 01:39:34,239
talked about.
 

3649
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:35,510
talked about.
All right. And it's going to try and

3650
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:35,520
All right. And it's going to try and
 

3651
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:38,149
All right. And it's going to try and
complete this squeeze now. So you got

3652
01:39:38,149 --> 01:39:38,159
complete this squeeze now. So you got
 

3653
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:39,910
complete this squeeze now. So you got
your TPS above. All those horizontal

3654
01:39:39,910 --> 01:39:39,920
your TPS above. All those horizontal
 

3655
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:44,709
your TPS above. All those horizontal
lines are your TPS if you took it.

3656
01:39:44,709 --> 01:39:44,719

 

3657

out

3668
01:39:57,430 --> 01:39:57,440

01:40:14,629 --> 01:40:14,639
Now just hold on and see if they can
 

3677
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:15,910
Now just hold on and see if they can
squeeze it for you. If you took that

3678
01:40:15,910 --> 01:40:15,920
squeeze it for you. If you took that
 

3679
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,870
squeeze it for you. If you took that
long from 320 or if you joined for this

long from 320 or if you joined for this
 

3681

all the time bulls held this like we
talked about that's possible. They're

3686
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:24,880
talked about that's possible. They're
 

3687
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,350
talked about that's possible. They're
going to use this liquidity now to fire

3688
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:27,360
going to use this liquidity now to fire
 

3689
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:30,629
going to use this liquidity now to fire
this up. But you must not be joining

selling into these drives because we're
 

3695
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,990
selling into these drives because we're
still in rotation. You don't know that

3696
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:38,000
still in rotation. You don't know that
 

3697
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,750
still in rotation. You don't know that
they don't do a look above and fail

3698
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:39,760
they don't do a look above and fail

We are starting to potentially develop a
 

4087
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:25,189
We are starting to potentially develop a
trend if it can hold pullbacks above

4088
01:51:25,189 --> 01:51:25,199
trend if it can hold pullbacks above
 

4089
01:51:25,199 --> 01:51:28,070
trend if it can hold pullbacks above
initial initial balance. But uh you see

4090
01:51:28,070 --> 01:51:28,080
initial initial balance. But uh you see
 

4091
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,750
initial initial balance. But uh you see
now finally the flow zones have started

4092
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:29,760
now finally the flow zones have started
 

4093
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:33,109
now finally the flow zones have started
opening up. I' still given the lack of

4094
01:51:33,109 --> 01:51:33,119
opening up. I' still given the lack of
 

4095
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:35,990
opening up. I' still given the lack of
volume we've had today. I'm still not

4096
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:36,000
volume we've had today. I'm still not
 

4097
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,709
volume we've had today. I'm still not
convinced by anything I am seeing right

4098
01:51:38,709 --> 01:51:38,719
convinced by anything I am seeing right
 

4099
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:40,390
convinced by anything I am seeing right
now. I don't think it would take a lot

4100
01:51:40,390 --> 01:51:40,400
now. I don't think it would take a lot
 

4101
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:49,750
now. I don't think it would take a lot
to move this market in either direction.

4102
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:49,760

 

4103
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:51,109

No, I think it was probably just

4104
01:51:51,109 --> 01:51:51,119
No, I think it was probably just
 

4105
01:51:51,119 --> 01:52:02,070
No, I think it was probably just
technical problems, Rosco.

4106
01:52:02,070 --> 01:52:02,080

 

4107
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,669

But who knows? We'll never find out

4108
01:52:03,669 --> 01:52:03,679
But who knows? We'll never find out
 

4109
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:05,189
But who knows? We'll never find out
anyway.

4110
01:52:05,189 --> 01:52:05,199
anyway.
 

4111
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:07,189
anyway.
That will never be released because if

4112
01:52:07,189 --> 01:52:07,199
That will never be released because if
 

4113
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:09,030
That will never be released because if
it was true that it was manipulation,

4114
01:52:09,030 --> 01:52:09,040
it was true that it was manipulation,
 

4115
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:10,470
it was true that it was manipulation,
the amount of people would go to jail

4116
01:52:10,470 --> 01:52:10,480
the amount of people would go to jail
 

4117
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:13,510
the amount of people would go to jail
would be insane.

4118
01:52:13,510 --> 01:52:13,520
would be insane.
 

4119
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:15,030
would be insane.
They'd all start snitching on each

4120
01:52:15,030 --> 01:52:15,040
They'd all start snitching on each
 

4121
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:18,149
They'd all start snitching on each
other.

4122
01:52:18,149 --> 01:52:18,159

 

4123
01:52:18,159 --> 01:52:19,990

It was down for quite a while, wasn't

4124
01:52:19,990 --> 01:52:20,000
It was down for quite a while, wasn't
 

4125
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:24,310
It was down for quite a while, wasn't
it?

4126
01:52:24,310 --> 01:52:24,320

 

4127
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,709

So, if you're still long from these uh

4128
01:52:26,709 --> 01:52:26,719
So, if you're still long from these uh
 

4129
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:28,149
So, if you're still long from these uh
down here, you should have taken

4130
01:52:28,149 --> 01:52:28,159
down here, you should have taken
 

4131
01:52:28,159 --> 01:52:30,390
down here, you should have taken
partials into this and this. Your next

4132
01:52:30,390 --> 01:52:30,400
partials into this and this. Your next
 

4133
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:32,149
partials into this and this. Your next
level is previous day value area high

4134
01:52:32,149 --> 01:52:32,159
level is previous day value area high
 

4135
01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:34,790
level is previous day value area high
and then uh previous day close. But make

4136
01:52:34,790 --> 01:52:34,800
and then uh previous day close. But make
 

4137
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,390
and then uh previous day close. But make
sure you paid yourself because it will

4138
01:52:36,390 --> 01:52:36,400
sure you paid yourself because it will
 

4139
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:39,109
sure you paid yourself because it will
not take much to wash this out. And I'd

4140
01:52:39,109 --> 01:52:39,119
not take much to wash this out. And I'd
 

4141
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:42,149
not take much to wash this out. And I'd
say stops here at a 94s will probably

4142
01:52:42,149 --> 01:52:42,159
say stops here at a 94s will probably
 

4143
01:52:42,159 --> 01:52:46,217
say stops here at a 94s will probably
get popped at some point.

4144
01:52:46,217 --> 01:52:46,227

 

4145
01:52:46,227 --> 01:52:56,310

[cough]

4146
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:56,320

 

4147
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:57,589

Here they come. They're probably going

4148
01:52:57,589 --> 01:52:57,599
Here they come. They're probably going
 

4149
01:52:57,599 --> 01:52:59,189
Here they come. They're probably going
to company stops now. Like we talked

4150
01:52:59,189 --> 01:52:59,199
to company stops now. Like we talked
 

4151
01:52:59,199 --> 01:53:01,270
to company stops now. Like we talked
about, it won't take lots to move this

4152
01:53:01,270 --> 01:53:01,280
about, it won't take lots to move this
 

4153
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:02,790
about, it won't take lots to move this
market. Honestly, it's not trading with

4154
01:53:02,790 --> 01:53:02,800
market. Honestly, it's not trading with
 

4155
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:05,270
market. Honestly, it's not trading with
a lot of volume. All depends what they

4156
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:05,280
a lot of volume. All depends what they
 

4157
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,709
a lot of volume. All depends what they
want to do, what their intentions are.

4158
01:53:06,709 --> 01:53:06,719
want to do, what their intentions are.
 

4159
01:53:06,719 --> 01:53:08,310
want to do, what their intentions are.
They still haven't taken these stops

4160
01:53:08,310 --> 01:53:08,320
They still haven't taken these stops
 

4161
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:17,030
They still haven't taken these stops
out.

4162
01:53:17,030 --> 01:53:17,040

 

4163
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,550

Can't imagine that they defend these

4164
01:53:18,550 --> 01:53:18,560
Can't imagine that they defend these
 

4165
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:20,470
Can't imagine that they defend these
stops. Honestly, I think we probably

4166
01:53:20,470 --> 01:53:20,480
stops. Honestly, I think we probably
 

4167
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:23,109
stops. Honestly, I think we probably
take them.

4168
01:53:23,109 --> 01:53:23,119
take them.
 

4169
01:53:23,119 --> 01:53:24,550
take them.
Here we come. So, we're coming for these

4170
01:53:24,550 --> 01:53:24,560
Here we come. So, we're coming for these
 

4171
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:25,990
Here we come. So, we're coming for these
stops now. And then how we act here

4172
01:53:25,990 --> 01:53:26,000
stops now. And then how we act here
 

4173
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,510
stops now. And then how we act here
becomes important. Do they sweep and

4174
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:27,520
becomes important. Do they sweep and
 

4175
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:29,030
becomes important. Do they sweep and
want to move higher or are we just going

4176
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:29,040
want to move higher or are we just going
 

4177
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,510
want to move higher or are we just going
to give back this whole low volume move?

4178
01:53:31,510 --> 01:53:31,520
to give back this whole low volume move?
 

4179
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,669
to give back this whole low volume move?
So, same as we had here, this shelf

4180
01:53:33,669 --> 01:53:33,679
So, same as we had here, this shelf
 

4181
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:35,510
So, same as we had here, this shelf
here, we can draw a new one up here.

4182
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:35,520
here, we can draw a new one up here.
 

4183
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:37,430
here, we can draw a new one up here.
very exactly the same play. They're

4184
01:53:37,430 --> 01:53:37,440
very exactly the same play. They're
 

4185
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:39,350
very exactly the same play. They're
doing the same [\h__\h] and they might

4186
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:39,360
doing the same [\h__\h] and they might
 

4187
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:40,790
doing the same [\h__\h] and they might
want to come back and back test this

4188
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:40,800
want to come back and back test this
 

4189
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:43,030
want to come back and back test this
now. And if they don't, then this will

4190
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:43,040
now. And if they don't, then this will
 

4191
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:45,189
now. And if they don't, then this will
be your support. They'll wick into here

4192
01:53:45,189 --> 01:53:45,199
be your support. They'll wick into here
 

4193
01:53:45,199 --> 01:53:46,950
be your support. They'll wick into here
and try and reclaim to go higher. But

4194
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:46,960
and try and reclaim to go higher. But
 

4195
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,790
and try and reclaim to go higher. But
remember, we are in a range rotation.

4196
01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:48,800
remember, we are in a range rotation.
 

4197
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,390
remember, we are in a range rotation.
I'd be very, very cautious about

4198
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:50,400
I'd be very, very cautious about
 

4199
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:51,910
I'd be very, very cautious about
thinking longs up here. Your long

4200
01:53:51,910 --> 01:53:51,920
thinking longs up here. Your long
 

4201
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:55,189
thinking longs up here. Your long
trigger was down here for this move. And

4202
01:53:55,189 --> 01:53:55,199
trigger was down here for this move. And
 

4203
01:53:55,199 --> 01:53:56,709
trigger was down here for this move. And
I'm not convinced about anything that

4204
01:53:56,709 --> 01:53:56,719
I'm not convinced about anything that
 

4205
01:53:56,719 --> 01:53:59,589
I'm not convinced about anything that
I'm seeing on the tape.

4206
01:53:59,589 --> 01:53:59,599
I'm seeing on the tape.
 

4207
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:01,109
I'm seeing on the tape.
I don't think it would take much to move

4208
01:54:01,109 --> 01:54:01,119
I don't think it would take much to move
 

4209
01:54:01,119 --> 01:54:02,629
I don't think it would take much to move
this. Like I said, one big player can

4210
01:54:02,629 --> 01:54:02,639
this. Like I said, one big player can
 

4211
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:04,470
this. Like I said, one big player can
come in and change everything. You can

4212
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:04,480
come in and change everything. You can
 

4213
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:05,990
come in and change everything. You can
change absolutely everything very very

4214
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:06,000
change absolutely everything very very
 

4215
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:13,334
change absolutely everything very very
quickly.

So if you want the short here, you will

4226
01:54:26,070 --> 01:54:26,080
So if you want the short here, you will
 

4227
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:28,229
So if you want the short here, you will
need to see it reject 400s and you'll

4228
01:54:28,229 --> 01:54:28,239
need to see it reject 400s and you'll
 

4229
01:54:28,239 --> 01:54:29,750
need to see it reject 400s and you'll
really want this to start collapsing and

4230
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:29,760
really want this to start collapsing and
 

4231
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:33,750
really want this to start collapsing and
rolling over, right? But really

01:54:33,750 --> 01:54:33,760
rolling over, right? But really
 

4233
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:36,790
rolling over, right? But really
all the time we're holding this

4234

all the time we're holding this
 

4235
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,550
all the time we're holding this
we can complete more bullish moves. But

01:54:38,550 --> 01:54:38,560
we can complete more bullish moves. But
 

4237
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:39,990
we can complete more bullish moves. But
obviously if we come down here and get

4238
01:54:39,990 --> 01:54:40,000
obviously if we come down here and get
 

4239
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,830
obviously if we come down here and get

01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:48,470
We have just taken these stops now.
Right. So if we reject this I think we

4246
01:54:48,470 --> 01:54:48,480
Right. So if we reject this I think we
 

4247
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:50,709
Right. So if we reject this I think we
should move lower.

4248
01:54:50,709 --> 01:54:50,719
should move lower.
 

4249
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:52,709
should move lower.
See how it just does it in one straight

4250
01:54:52,709 --> 01:54:52,719
See how it just does it in one straight
 

4251
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:58,870
See how it just does it in one straight
move.

4252
01:54:58,870 --> 01:54:58,880

 

4253
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:00,390

So you got those levels above for the

4254
01:55:00,390 --> 01:55:00,400
So you got those levels above for the
 

4255
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:02,790
So you got those levels above for the
reaction. Now, how we act into that gray

4256
01:55:02,790 --> 01:55:02,800
reaction. Now, how we act into that gray
 

4257
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,550
reaction. Now, how we act into that gray
box above becomes key. How we act into

4258
01:55:04,550 --> 01:55:04,560
box above becomes key. How we act into
 

4259
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:07,589
box above becomes key. How we act into
this gray box below becomes key.

4260
01:55:07,589 --> 01:55:07,599
this gray box below becomes key.
 

4261
01:55:07,599 --> 01:55:09,270
this gray box below becomes key.
Hopefully, it retests instead of just

4262
01:55:09,270 --> 01:55:09,280
Hopefully, it retests instead of just
 

4263
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:11,510
Hopefully, it retests instead of just
doing straight moves. Like I said, I

4264
01:55:11,510 --> 01:55:11,520
doing straight moves. Like I said, I
 

4265
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:13,109
doing straight moves. Like I said, I
don't trust the tape today. It's very,

4266
01:55:13,109 --> 01:55:13,119
don't trust the tape today. It's very,
 

4267
01:55:13,119 --> 01:55:14,950
don't trust the tape today. It's very,
very low on volume. It does not take a

4268
01:55:14,950 --> 01:55:14,960
very low on volume. It does not take a
 

4269
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:17,830
very low on volume. It does not take a
lot to move this. [snorts] Really does

4270
01:55:17,830 --> 01:55:17,840
lot to move this. [snorts] Really does
 

4271
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:20,550
lot to move this. [snorts] Really does
not take a lot to move it.

4272
01:55:20,550 --> 01:55:20,560
not take a lot to move it.
 

4273
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:22,550
not take a lot to move it.
Just left this volume without retesting

4274
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:22,560
Just left this volume without retesting
 

4275
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:25,750
Just left this volume without retesting
it to get shorters.

4276
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:25,760
it to get shorters.
 

4277
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:35,270
it to get shorters.
My French

4278
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:35,280

 

4279
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:38,070

Okay. So, box to box again. [sighs]

4280
01:55:38,070 --> 01:55:38,080
Okay. So, box to box again. [sighs]
 

4281
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:41,189
Okay. So, box to box again. [sighs]
Box to box again. Ideally, they retest

4282
01:55:41,189 --> 01:55:41,199
Box to box again. Ideally, they retest
 

4283
01:55:41,199 --> 01:55:42,629
Box to box again. Ideally, they retest
this and we see if that stays heavy.

4284
01:55:42,629 --> 01:55:42,639
this and we see if that stays heavy.
 

4285
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:45,030
this and we see if that stays heavy.
It's a fade back in. If they reclaim it,

4286
01:55:45,030 --> 01:55:45,040
It's a fade back in. If they reclaim it,
 

4287
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:46,310
It's a fade back in. If they reclaim it,
I'm not going to touch it, but it's a

4288
01:55:46,310 --> 01:55:46,320
I'm not going to touch it, but it's a
 

4289
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:49,109
I'm not going to touch it, but it's a
new squeeze out.

4290
01:55:49,109 --> 01:55:49,119
new squeeze out.
 

4291
01:55:49,119 --> 01:55:51,589
new squeeze out.
Please retest. Come on. You can't just

4292
01:55:51,589 --> 01:55:51,599
Please retest. Come on. You can't just
 

4293
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:57,189
Please retest. Come on. You can't just
do this single direction moves. Come on.

4294
01:55:57,189 --> 01:55:57,199
do this single direction moves. Come on.
 

4295
01:55:57,199 --> 01:55:59,030
do this single direction moves. Come on.
Yeah, video failed that 180 like I

4296
01:55:59,030 --> 01:55:59,040
Yeah, video failed that 180 like I
 

4297
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:07,189
Yeah, video failed that 180 like I
talked about.

4298
01:56:07,189 --> 01:56:07,199

 

4299
01:56:07,199 --> 01:56:09,350

Please get up for a retest. Come on,

4300
01:56:09,350 --> 01:56:09,360
Please get up for a retest. Come on,
 

4301
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:18,550
Please get up for a retest. Come on,
market.

4302
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:18,560

 

4303
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,070

They're trying to bid these lows at the

4304
01:56:20,070 --> 01:56:20,080
They're trying to bid these lows at the
 

4305
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:28,790
They're trying to bid these lows at the
moment.

4306
01:56:28,790 --> 01:56:28,800

 

4307
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,550

It's literally single direction back

4308
01:56:30,550 --> 01:56:30,560
It's literally single direction back
 

4309
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:32,790
It's literally single direction back
down to point control.

4310
01:56:32,790 --> 01:56:32,800
down to point control.
 

4311
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:35,830
down to point control.
Mother cluckers.

4312
01:56:35,830 --> 01:56:35,840
Mother cluckers.
 

4313
01:56:35,840 --> 01:57:05,669
Mother cluckers.
Mother cluckers.

4314

4315
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:07,270

Well, still unfinished business down

4316
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:07,280
Well, still unfinished business down
 

4317
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:10,470
Well, still unfinished business down
here. If they do want to let this go,

4318
01:57:10,470 --> 01:57:10,480
here. If they do want to let this go,
 

4319
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:12,790
here. If they do want to let this go,
you need a retest though, so that you've

4320
01:57:12,790 --> 01:57:12,800
you need a retest though, so that you've
 

4321
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:18,229
you need a retest though, so that you've
got a nice price to fail.

4322
01:57:18,229 --> 01:57:18,239

 

4323
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:19,750

This can still be a pullback that holds.

4324
01:57:19,750 --> 01:57:19,760
This can still be a pullback that holds.
 

4325
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:21,510
This can still be a pullback that holds.
So, I'd be interested how we act once we

4326
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:21,520
So, I'd be interested how we act once we
 

4327
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:23,910
So, I'd be interested how we act once we
get up here.

4328
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:23,920
get up here.
 

4329
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:26,470
get up here.
How we act when we get up there becomes

4330
01:57:26,470 --> 01:57:26,480
How we act when we get up there becomes
 

4331
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:47,830
How we act when we get up there becomes
important.

4332
01:57:47,830 --> 01:57:47,840

 

4333
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:49,589

Audi still looks good. So feel part of

4334
01:57:49,589 --> 01:57:49,599
Audi still looks good. So feel part of
 

4335
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:52,070
Audi still looks good. So feel part of
that imbalance from 8:00 p.m. last night

4336
01:57:52,070 --> 01:57:52,080
that imbalance from 8:00 p.m. last night
 

4337
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:55,189
that imbalance from 8:00 p.m. last night
like we talked about.

4338
01:57:55,189 --> 01:57:55,199
like we talked about.
 

4339
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:57,270
like we talked about.
This is the problem at the moment. This

4340
01:57:57,270 --> 01:57:57,280
This is the problem at the moment. This
 

4341
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:00,629
This is the problem at the moment. This
is what I mean. This is the problem.

4342
01:58:00,629 --> 01:58:00,639
is what I mean. This is the problem.
 

4343
01:58:00,639 --> 01:58:03,189
is what I mean. This is the problem.
Here's your imbalance. Here's we expect

4344
01:58:03,189 --> 01:58:03,199
Here's your imbalance. Here's we expect
 

4345
01:58:03,199 --> 01:58:05,030
Here's your imbalance. Here's we expect
shorts to come in. Here's the structure

4346
01:58:05,030 --> 01:58:05,040
shorts to come in. Here's the structure
 

4347
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:07,350
shorts to come in. Here's the structure
that bulls want to hold. This in here

4348
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:07,360
that bulls want to hold. This in here
 

4349
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,350
that bulls want to hold. This in here
can build liquidity out. All right?

4350
01:58:09,350 --> 01:58:09,360
can build liquidity out. All right?
 

4351
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:11,270
can build liquidity out. All right?
Because bulls want to defend this.

4352
01:58:11,270 --> 01:58:11,280
Because bulls want to defend this.
 

4353
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:13,270
Because bulls want to defend this.
shorts want to defend this. This is the

4354
01:58:13,270 --> 01:58:13,280
shorts want to defend this. This is the
 

4355
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:15,830
shorts want to defend this. This is the
rotation. This is the issue right now.

4356
01:58:15,830 --> 01:58:15,840
rotation. This is the issue right now.
 

4357
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:18,229
rotation. This is the issue right now.
It's not protrend because we haven't got

4358
01:58:18,229 --> 01:58:18,239
It's not protrend because we haven't got
 

4359
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:21,430
It's not protrend because we haven't got
everyone on this side and we don't have

4360
01:58:21,430 --> 01:58:21,440
everyone on this side and we don't have
 

4361
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:24,070
everyone on this side and we don't have
everyone on this side yet. It's

4362
01:58:24,070 --> 01:58:24,080
everyone on this side yet. It's
 

4363
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:28,790
everyone on this side yet. It's
developing liquidity in these areas.

4364
01:58:28,790 --> 01:58:28,800
developing liquidity in these areas.
 

4365
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:30,229
developing liquidity in these areas.
It might just be that we have to wait

4366
01:58:30,229 --> 01:58:30,239
It might just be that we have to wait
 

4367
01:58:30,239 --> 01:58:33,910
It might just be that we have to wait
for tomorrow to get a protrend move.

4368
01:58:33,910 --> 01:58:33,920
for tomorrow to get a protrend move.
 

4369
01:58:33,920 --> 01:59:03,430
for tomorrow to get a protrend move.
Very, very possible.

4370
01:59:03,430 --> 01:59:03,440

 

4371
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:05,750

Yeah. And under 80s. Those buyers are

4372
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:05,760
Yeah. And under 80s. Those buyers are
 

4373
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:10,229
Yeah. And under 80s. Those buyers are
stuck on that big imbalance candle.

4374
01:59:10,229 --> 01:59:10,239
stuck on that big imbalance candle.
 

4375
01:59:10,239 --> 01:59:12,470
stuck on that big imbalance candle.
Definitely stuck. They're under 80s. Is

4376
01:59:12,470 --> 01:59:12,480
Definitely stuck. They're under 80s. Is
 

4377
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:13,830
Definitely stuck. They're under 80s. Is
there going to be follow through is the

4378
01:59:13,830 --> 01:59:13,840
there going to be follow through is the
 

4379
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:16,790
there going to be follow through is the
question.

4380
01:59:16,790 --> 01:59:16,800
question.
 

4381
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:18,310
question.
Yeah, it's just not protrend yet on the

4382
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:18,320
Yeah, it's just not protrend yet on the
 

4383
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:19,910
Yeah, it's just not protrend yet on the
H1. It's just going to need time to

4384
01:59:19,910 --> 01:59:19,920
H1. It's just going to need time to
 

4385
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:21,669
H1. It's just going to need time to
develop. And you know, H1 can start

4386
01:59:21,669 --> 01:59:21,679
develop. And you know, H1 can start
 

4387
01:59:21,679 --> 01:59:25,589
develop. And you know, H1 can start
bidding from 44 down to 14s. And like

4388
01:59:25,589 --> 01:59:25,599
bidding from 44 down to 14s. And like
 

4389
01:59:25,599 --> 01:59:27,589
bidding from 44 down to 14s. And like
really until we take out today's low, we

4390
01:59:27,589 --> 01:59:27,599
really until we take out today's low, we
 

4391
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:39,350
really until we take out today's low, we
don't see weakness.

4392
01:59:39,350 --> 01:59:39,360

 

4393
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:41,910

It's just one of those days like we're

4394
01:59:41,910 --> 01:59:41,920
It's just one of those days like we're
 

4395
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:43,910
It's just one of those days like we're
not going to get protren every day. Like

4396
01:59:43,910 --> 01:59:43,920
not going to get protren every day. Like
 

4397
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:46,310
not going to get protren every day. Like
we talked about,

4398
01:59:46,310 --> 01:59:46,320
we talked about,
 

4399
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:48,950
we talked about,
shorts are likely to come in up here.

4400
01:59:48,950 --> 01:59:48,960
shorts are likely to come in up here.
 

4401
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:51,910
shorts are likely to come in up here.
That's what we're now starting to see up

4402
01:59:51,910 --> 01:59:51,920
That's what we're now starting to see up
 

4403
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:53,990
That's what we're now starting to see up
here.

4404
01:59:53,990 --> 01:59:54,000
here.
 

4405
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,070
here.
The problem is

4406
01:59:56,070 --> 01:59:56,080
The problem is
 

4407
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:57,510
The problem is
you would have had to grab that on the

4408
01:59:57,510 --> 01:59:57,520
you would have had to grab that on the
 

4409
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:00,470
you would have had to grab that on the
breakout trade.

4410
02:00:00,470 --> 02:00:00,480
breakout trade.
 

4411
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:02,229
breakout trade.
I don't think I'm fully engaged in this

4412
02:00:02,229 --> 02:00:02,239
I don't think I'm fully engaged in this
 

4413
02:00:02,239 --> 02:00:12,550
I don't think I'm fully engaged in this
market yet either. like mentally

4414
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:12,560

 

4415
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:17,030

way developing is kind of

4416
02:00:17,030 --> 02:00:17,040
way developing is kind of
 

4417
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:36,070
way developing is kind of
a shelf here. So, let's see.

4418
02:00:36,070 --> 02:00:36,080

 

4419
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:44,709

These are really the levels right now.

4420
02:00:44,709 --> 02:00:44,719

 

4421
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:47,109

Does scalping with copy tra? Does

4422
02:00:47,109 --> 02:00:47,119
Does scalping with copy tra? Does
 

4423
02:00:47,119 --> 02:00:49,030
Does scalping with copy tra? Does
scalping work with copy trading? I've

4424
02:00:49,030 --> 02:00:49,040
scalping work with copy trading? I've
 

4425
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:51,109
scalping work with copy trading? I've
tried a couple times, but my followers

4426
02:00:51,109 --> 02:00:51,119
tried a couple times, but my followers
 

4427
02:00:51,119 --> 02:00:53,430
tried a couple times, but my followers
seem to not pick it up. Yeah, it works.

4428
02:00:53,430 --> 02:00:53,440
seem to not pick it up. Yeah, it works.
 

4429
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:56,950
seem to not pick it up. Yeah, it works.
Maybe you've got a slow connection or

4430
02:00:56,950 --> 02:00:56,960
Maybe you've got a slow connection or
 

4431
02:00:56,960 --> 02:00:58,790
Maybe you've got a slow connection or
not a good copy trader, but it

4432
02:00:58,790 --> 02:00:58,800
not a good copy trader, but it
 

4433
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:03,669
not a good copy trader, but it
definitely works.

4434
02:01:03,669 --> 02:01:03,679

 

4435
02:01:03,679 --> 02:01:06,310

I trade on Ninja Trader, but it's just

4436
02:01:06,310 --> 02:01:06,320
I trade on Ninja Trader, but it's just
 

4437
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:08,550
I trade on Ninja Trader, but it's just
me personally. I use the trade of eight

4438
02:01:08,550 --> 02:01:08,560
me personally. I use the trade of eight
 

4439
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:21,350
me personally. I use the trade of eight
connection. I trade on Ninja Trader.

4440
02:01:21,350 --> 02:01:21,360

 

4441
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:25,750

What a slow day.

4442
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:25,760

 

4443
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,830

failing to reclaim previous day value

4444
02:01:27,830 --> 02:01:27,840
failing to reclaim previous day value
 

4445
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:36,550
failing to reclaim previous day value
area low there.

4446
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:36,560

 

4447
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:39,030

Bears will want to defend 80 to let's

4448
02:01:39,030 --> 02:01:39,040
Bears will want to defend 80 to let's
 

4449
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:42,470
Bears will want to defend 80 to let's
call it 400 80 to 95. If bears defend 80

4450
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:42,480
call it 400 80 to 95. If bears defend 80
 

4451
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:45,830
call it 400 80 to 95. If bears defend 80
to 95, there's possible rotation back

4452
02:01:45,830 --> 02:01:45,840
to 95, there's possible rotation back
 

4453
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:48,070
to 95, there's possible rotation back
down here. That's the level that bears

4454
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:48,080
down here. That's the level that bears
 

4455
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:50,709
down here. That's the level that bears
want to defend 80 to well basically

4456
02:01:50,709 --> 02:01:50,719
want to defend 80 to well basically
 

4457
02:01:50,719 --> 02:01:53,510
want to defend 80 to well basically
here. bears want to defend this or this

4458
02:01:53,510 --> 02:01:53,520
here. bears want to defend this or this
 

4459
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:55,270
here. bears want to defend this or this
move down here to come and clean out

4460
02:01:55,270 --> 02:01:55,280
move down here to come and clean out
 

4461
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:56,790
move down here to come and clean out
some of these liquidity. These would be

4462
02:01:56,790 --> 02:01:56,800
some of these liquidity. These would be
 

4463
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:59,350
some of these liquidity. These would be
the areas where buyers will want to step

4464
02:01:59,350 --> 02:01:59,360
the areas where buyers will want to step
 

4465
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:03,589
the areas where buyers will want to step
in where the volume is.

4466
02:02:03,589 --> 02:02:03,599

 

4467
02:02:03,599 --> 02:02:05,109

There's just nothing really going on

4468
02:02:05,109 --> 02:02:05,119
There's just nothing really going on
 

4469
02:02:05,119 --> 02:02:07,109
There's just nothing really going on
here, folks.

4470
02:02:07,109 --> 02:02:07,119
here, folks.
 

4471
02:02:07,119 --> 02:02:09,350
here, folks.
So, possible short here if they fail

4472
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:09,360
So, possible short here if they fail
 

4473
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:11,830
So, possible short here if they fail
that this push up. And now bears will

4474
02:02:11,830 --> 02:02:11,840
that this push up. And now bears will
 

4475
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,189
that this push up. And now bears will
want to see a breakdown. So, we're

4476
02:02:13,189 --> 02:02:13,199
want to see a breakdown. So, we're
 

4477
02:02:13,199 --> 02:02:15,510
want to see a breakdown. So, we're
defending 80

4478
02:02:15,510 --> 02:02:15,520
defending 80
 

4479
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:17,189
defending 80
and they want a new low and they'll want

4480
02:02:17,189 --> 02:02:17,199
and they want a new low and they'll want
 

4481
02:02:17,199 --> 02:02:19,990
and they want a new low and they'll want
to wash out the VWAPs here. And you

4482
02:02:19,990 --> 02:02:20,000
to wash out the VWAPs here. And you
 

4483
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,430
to wash out the VWAPs here. And you
know, if they get very very heavy, you

4484
02:02:21,430 --> 02:02:21,440
know, if they get very very heavy, you
 

4485
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:22,870
know, if they get very very heavy, you
can't rule out low of day because I

4486
02:02:22,870 --> 02:02:22,880
can't rule out low of day because I
 

4487
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:24,229
can't rule out low of day because I
think there's lots of liquidity left

4488
02:02:24,229 --> 02:02:24,239
think there's lots of liquidity left
 

4489
02:02:24,239 --> 02:02:28,790
think there's lots of liquidity left
down there.

4490
02:02:28,790 --> 02:02:28,800

 

4491
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:30,229

Amazon's not really doing much right

4492
02:02:30,229 --> 02:02:30,239
Amazon's not really doing much right
 

4493
02:02:30,239 --> 02:02:31,910
Amazon's not really doing much right
now. The rest of the market's still red

4494
02:02:31,910 --> 02:02:31,920
now. The rest of the market's still red
 

4495
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:38,149
now. The rest of the market's still red
other than Nvidia

4496
02:02:38,149 --> 02:02:38,159

 

4497
02:02:38,159 --> 02:02:40,229

starting to try and see some aggression

4498
02:02:40,229 --> 02:02:40,239
starting to try and see some aggression
 

4499
02:02:40,239 --> 02:02:41,589
starting to try and see some aggression
here. Are they going to get the

4500
02:02:41,589 --> 02:02:41,599
here. Are they going to get the
 

4501
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:47,589
here. Are they going to get the
breakdown to be up?

4502
02:02:47,589 --> 02:02:47,599

 

4503
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:52,790

Here we go

4504
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:52,800

 

4505
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:54,390

into this gray box. If they fail this

4506
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:54,400
into this gray box. If they fail this
 

4507
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:55,990
into this gray box. If they fail this
gray box, we've got view up here and the

4508
02:02:55,990 --> 02:02:56,000
gray box, we've got view up here and the
 

4509
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,510
gray box, we've got view up here and the
next gray box. So, the next move will be

4510
02:02:57,510 --> 02:02:57,520
next gray box. So, the next move will be
 

4511
02:02:57,520 --> 02:02:59,669
next gray box. So, the next move will be
into like the 30s down to 20s. These

4512
02:02:59,669 --> 02:02:59,679
into like the 30s down to 20s. These
 

4513
02:02:59,679 --> 02:03:02,310
into like the 30s down to 20s. These
were the key levels earlier. We can get

4514
02:03:02,310 --> 02:03:02,320
were the key levels earlier. We can get
 

4515
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:04,229
were the key levels earlier. We can get
down to 30s to 20s. That'll be a cover

4516
02:03:04,229 --> 02:03:04,239
down to 30s to 20s. That'll be a cover
 

4517
02:03:04,239 --> 02:03:08,709
down to 30s to 20s. That'll be a cover
point. Here we go. Finally,

4518
02:03:08,709 --> 02:03:08,719

 

4519
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:10,390

and then hold some for low of day just

4520
02:03:10,390 --> 02:03:10,400
and then hold some for low of day just
 

4521
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:13,030
and then hold some for low of day just
in case it's 40s. Watching this cover

4522
02:03:13,030 --> 02:03:13,040
in case it's 40s. Watching this cover
 

4523
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:15,510
in case it's 40s. Watching this cover
into 30s here. Just want one more flush

4524
02:03:15,510 --> 02:03:15,520
into 30s here. Just want one more flush
 

4525
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:18,310
into 30s here. Just want one more flush
here.

4526
02:03:18,310 --> 02:03:18,320
here.
 

4527
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:21,030
here.
And then hold one below day if I can

4528
02:03:21,030 --> 02:03:21,040
And then hold one below day if I can
 

4529
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:24,390
And then hold one below day if I can
just in case. Just in case. Here we go.

4530
02:03:24,390 --> 02:03:24,400
just in case. Just in case. Here we go.
 

4531
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:26,550
just in case. Just in case. Here we go.
Tag tag tag. Tag me. Tag me. Tag me. Tag

Tag tag tag. Tag me. Tag me. Tag me. Tag
 

4533

4535
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:31,910
me. One out here. [sighs]
And just one left. And we just let it

4536
02:03:31,910 --> 02:03:31,920
And just one left. And we just let it
 

4537
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:35,189
And just one left. And we just let it
ride now.

4538
02:03:35,189 --> 02:03:35,199
ride now.
 

4539
02:03:35,199 --> 02:03:39,270
ride now.
So here's your next TP. These gray boxes

4540
02:03:39,270 --> 02:03:39,280
So here's your next TP. These gray boxes
 

4541
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:41,270
So here's your next TP. These gray boxes
we talked about. If we bail this into

4542
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:41,280
we talked about. If we bail this into
 

4543
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:43,350
we talked about. If we bail this into
here and then holding one for load day

4544
02:03:43,350 --> 02:03:43,360
here and then holding one for load day
 

4545
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:44,870
here and then holding one for load day
just in case. I don't expect it to get

4546
02:03:44,870 --> 02:03:44,880
just in case. I don't expect it to get
 

4547
02:03:44,880 --> 02:04:14,070
just in case. I don't expect it to get
there, but just in case

4548
02:04:14,070 --> 02:04:14,080

 

4549
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:15,750

using bookmap. You can see it above you.

4550
02:04:15,750 --> 02:04:15,760
using bookmap. You can see it above you.
 

4551
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:25,030
using bookmap. You can see it above you.
I'm also using footprints.

4552
02:04:25,030 --> 02:04:25,040

 

4553
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:26,870

Nice.

4554
02:04:26,870 --> 02:04:26,880
Nice.
 

4555
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:28,629
Nice.
Want to see us take out this next view

4556
02:04:28,629 --> 02:04:28,639
Want to see us take out this next view
 

4557
02:04:28,639 --> 02:04:30,229
Want to see us take out this next view
up here. If we take this out then I feel

4558
02:04:30,229 --> 02:04:30,239
up here. If we take this out then I feel
 

4559
02:04:30,239 --> 02:04:31,990
up here. If we take this out then I feel
better about potentially getting down

4560
02:04:31,990 --> 02:04:32,000
better about potentially getting down
 

4561
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,669
better about potentially getting down
towards low of day. But right now just

4562
02:04:33,669 --> 02:04:33,679
towards low of day. But right now just
 

4563
02:04:33,679 --> 02:04:35,910
towards low of day. But right now just
got one left now.

4564
02:04:35,910 --> 02:04:35,920
got one left now.
 

4565
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:37,510
got one left now.
Don't want to see a rebid. Don't want to

4566
02:04:37,510 --> 02:04:37,520
Don't want to see a rebid. Don't want to
 

4567
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:45,830
Don't want to see a rebid. Don't want to
see this hold anything.

4568
02:04:45,830 --> 02:04:45,840

 

4569
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:47,430

Just want to see weakness come into the

4570
02:04:47,430 --> 02:04:47,440
Just want to see weakness come into the
 

4571
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:50,950
Just want to see weakness come into the
tape here and start washing.

4572
02:04:50,950 --> 02:04:50,960
tape here and start washing.
 

4573
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:54,070
tape here and start washing.
Nice. Thank you. Come on. Get this 20

4574
02:04:54,070 --> 02:04:54,080
Nice. Thank you. Come on. Get this 20
 

4575
02:04:54,080 --> 02:05:00,149
Nice. Thank you. Come on. Get this 20
out the way, please.

4576
02:05:00,149 --> 02:05:00,159

 

4577
02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:02,470

got an imbalance down into sort of 308

4578
02:05:02,470 --> 02:05:02,480
got an imbalance down into sort of 308
 

4579
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:14,310
got an imbalance down into sort of 308
309 that they can fill.

4580
02:05:14,310 --> 02:05:14,320

 

4581
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:18,550

Come on.

4582
02:05:18,550 --> 02:05:18,560

 

4583
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:19,990

Not seeing follow through there. Don't

4584
02:05:19,990 --> 02:05:20,000
Not seeing follow through there. Don't
 

4585
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,750
Not seeing follow through there. Don't
like that.

4586
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:21,760
like that.
 

4587
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:24,070
like that.
Taking this out.

4588
02:05:24,070 --> 02:05:24,080
Taking this out.
 

4589
02:05:24,080 --> 02:05:27,430
Taking this out.
Always add back in.

4590
02:05:27,430 --> 02:05:27,440
Always add back in.
 

4591
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:29,510
Always add back in.
That gray box holding that shelf holding

4592
02:05:29,510 --> 02:05:29,520
That gray box holding that shelf holding
 

4593
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:31,830
That gray box holding that shelf holding
there is the reaction of it. Didn't like

4594
02:05:31,830 --> 02:05:31,840
there is the reaction of it. Didn't like
 

4595
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:33,030
there is the reaction of it. Didn't like
what I saw on the tape there. They had

4596
02:05:33,030 --> 02:05:33,040
what I saw on the tape there. They had
 

4597
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:35,350
what I saw on the tape there. They had
the chance to take over there. So, still

4598
02:05:35,350 --> 02:05:35,360
the chance to take over there. So, still
 

4599
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,910
the chance to take over there. So, still
the same thing applies. Uh bears are in

4600
02:05:37,910 --> 02:05:37,920
the same thing applies. Uh bears are in
 

4601
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:39,430
the same thing applies. Uh bears are in
control all the time. They are

4602
02:05:39,430 --> 02:05:39,440
control all the time. They are
 

4603
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:40,790
control all the time. They are
protecting these levels up here. All

4604
02:05:40,790 --> 02:05:40,800
protecting these levels up here. All
 

4605
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:42,390
protecting these levels up here. All
right. All the time this is protected.

4606
02:05:42,390 --> 02:05:42,400
right. All the time this is protected.
 

4607
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:44,229
right. All the time this is protected.
This is possible. This shelf here, if

4608
02:05:44,229 --> 02:05:44,239
This is possible. This shelf here, if
 

4609
02:05:44,239 --> 02:05:45,990
This is possible. This shelf here, if
this is protected, this is possible

4610
02:05:45,990 --> 02:05:46,000
this is protected, this is possible
 

4611
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,870
this is protected, this is possible
today. Not probable, it's possible. So,

4612
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:48,880
today. Not probable, it's possible. So,
 

4613
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:51,109
today. Not probable, it's possible. So,
any pop up here which gets sold into can

4614
02:05:51,109 --> 02:05:51,119
any pop up here which gets sold into can
 

4615
02:05:51,119 --> 02:05:53,270
any pop up here which gets sold into can
allow this rotation. But I don't like

4616
02:05:53,270 --> 02:05:53,280
allow this rotation. But I don't like
 

4617
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,750
allow this rotation. But I don't like
what I saw down here. Right, we saw

4618
02:05:55,750 --> 02:05:55,760
what I saw down here. Right, we saw
 

4619
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:57,189
what I saw down here. Right, we saw
aggressive selling and it didn't move

4620
02:05:57,189 --> 02:05:57,199
aggressive selling and it didn't move
 

4621
02:05:57,199 --> 02:05:59,030
aggressive selling and it didn't move
lower. There's a passive buyer trying to

4622
02:05:59,030 --> 02:05:59,040
lower. There's a passive buyer trying to
 

4623
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:01,589
lower. There's a passive buyer trying to
absorb this level here for now. So, I

4624
02:06:01,589 --> 02:06:01,599
absorb this level here for now. So, I
 

4625
02:06:01,599 --> 02:06:02,950
absorb this level here for now. So, I
cut the trade. I'm now flat on the

4626
02:06:02,950 --> 02:06:02,960
cut the trade. I'm now flat on the
 

4627
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:05,910
cut the trade. I'm now flat on the
trade.

4628
02:06:05,910 --> 02:06:05,920
trade.
 

4629
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:07,189
trade.
Starting to see them try and squeeze

4630
02:06:07,189 --> 02:06:07,199
Starting to see them try and squeeze
 

4631
02:06:07,199 --> 02:06:11,030
Starting to see them try and squeeze
this back up at this point. There we go.

4632
02:06:11,030 --> 02:06:11,040
this back up at this point. There we go.
 

4633
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:12,470
this back up at this point. There we go.
So, yeah, they had two attempts there.

4634
02:06:12,470 --> 02:06:12,480
So, yeah, they had two attempts there.
 

4635
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:15,189
So, yeah, they had two attempts there.
They tried to aggressive sell it

4636
02:06:15,189 --> 02:06:15,199
They tried to aggressive sell it
 

4637
02:06:15,199 --> 02:06:17,830
They tried to aggressive sell it
at sort of the 30s, the 30 breaks, and

4638
02:06:17,830 --> 02:06:17,840
at sort of the 30s, the 30 breaks, and
 

4639
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:19,189
at sort of the 30s, the 30 breaks, and
then they tried again. They stepped in

4640
02:06:19,189 --> 02:06:19,199
then they tried again. They stepped in
 

4641
02:06:19,199 --> 02:06:20,950
then they tried again. They stepped in
at the 20s and they got absorbed, which

4642
02:06:20,950 --> 02:06:20,960
at the 20s and they got absorbed, which
 

4643
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:22,310
at the 20s and they got absorbed, which
is why I cut it. There we go. So,

4644
02:06:22,310 --> 02:06:22,320
is why I cut it. There we go. So,
 

4645
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:24,390
is why I cut it. There we go. So,
there's the squeeze back out. So they

4646
02:06:24,390 --> 02:06:24,400
there's the squeeze back out. So they
 

4647
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:26,310
there's the squeeze back out. So they
got absorbed right into this gray box.

4648
02:06:26,310 --> 02:06:26,320
got absorbed right into this gray box.
 

4649
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:28,629
got absorbed right into this gray box.
This why these are points to cover. And

4650
02:06:28,629 --> 02:06:28,639
This why these are points to cover. And
 

4651
02:06:28,639 --> 02:06:30,709
This why these are points to cover. And
then how we act up here will be key. All

4652
02:06:30,709 --> 02:06:30,719
then how we act up here will be key. All
 

4653
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:32,390
then how we act up here will be key. All
right. Because if they reclaim all of

4654
02:06:32,390 --> 02:06:32,400
right. Because if they reclaim all of
 

4655
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:35,750
right. Because if they reclaim all of
this, this node here needs to be

4656
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:35,760
this, this node here needs to be
 

4657
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:38,390
this, this node here needs to be
protected by the sellers. All right.

4658
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:38,400
protected by the sellers. All right.
 

4659
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:40,069
protected by the sellers. All right.
Definitely this volume up here. If this

4660
02:06:40,069 --> 02:06:40,079
Definitely this volume up here. If this
 

4661
02:06:40,079 --> 02:06:41,270
Definitely this volume up here. If this
gets sliced through, then this is

4662
02:06:41,270 --> 02:06:41,280
gets sliced through, then this is
 

4663
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:43,430
gets sliced through, then this is
bullish again, right? Sellers will want

4664
02:06:43,430 --> 02:06:43,440
bullish again, right? Sellers will want
 

4665
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:45,270
bullish again, right? Sellers will want
to protect this to complete the

4666
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:45,280
to protect this to complete the
 

4667
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:47,030
to protect this to complete the
rotation. I'm not convinced we get a

4668
02:06:47,030 --> 02:06:47,040
rotation. I'm not convinced we get a
 

4669
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:49,990
rotation. I'm not convinced we get a
full rotation today because it just

4670
02:06:49,990 --> 02:06:50,000
full rotation today because it just
 

4671
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,669
full rotation today because it just
doesn't feel like one of those days at

4672
02:06:51,669 --> 02:06:51,679
doesn't feel like one of those days at
 

4673
02:06:51,679 --> 02:06:53,270
doesn't feel like one of those days at
the moment. It feels like see money take

4674
02:06:53,270 --> 02:06:53,280
the moment. It feels like see money take
 

4675
02:06:53,280 --> 02:07:08,870
the moment. It feels like see money take
money.

4676
02:07:08,870 --> 02:07:08,880

 

4677
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:10,709

Don't mind jumping back in if it sets

4678
02:07:10,709 --> 02:07:10,719
Don't mind jumping back in if it sets
 

4679
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:14,310
Don't mind jumping back in if it sets
up. I see it squeeze higher, not higher

4680
02:07:14,310 --> 02:07:14,320
up. I see it squeeze higher, not higher
 

4681
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:15,990
up. I see it squeeze higher, not higher
day, but back up here at this point and

4682
02:07:15,990 --> 02:07:16,000
day, but back up here at this point and
 

4683
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,589
day, but back up here at this point and
see if there's a passive seller just sat

4684
02:07:17,589 --> 02:07:17,599
see if there's a passive seller just sat
 

4685
02:07:17,599 --> 02:07:19,910
see if there's a passive seller just sat
there waiting

4686
02:07:19,910 --> 02:07:19,920
there waiting
 

4687
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:33,669
there waiting
and we'll see.

4688
02:07:33,669 --> 02:07:33,679

 

4689
02:07:33,679 --> 02:07:36,229

So 70s again same as same as earlier

4690
02:07:36,229 --> 02:07:36,239
So 70s again same as same as earlier
 

4691
02:07:36,239 --> 02:07:37,990
So 70s again same as same as earlier
today. Remember these 70s there was

4692
02:07:37,990 --> 02:07:38,000
today. Remember these 70s there was
 

4693
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,910
today. Remember these 70s there was
passive seller here eventually we got

4694
02:07:39,910 --> 02:07:39,920
passive seller here eventually we got
 

4695
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:41,430
passive seller here eventually we got
through it squeezed out and then they've

4696
02:07:41,430 --> 02:07:41,440
through it squeezed out and then they've
 

4697
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:42,950
through it squeezed out and then they've
sold back through it. It's the same kind

4698
02:07:42,950 --> 02:07:42,960
sold back through it. It's the same kind
 

4699
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:58,643
sold back through it. It's the same kind
of level.

4700
02:07:58,643 --> 02:07:58,653

 

4701
02:07:58,653 --> 02:07:59,270

[cough and clears throat]

4702
02:07:59,270 --> 02:07:59,280
[cough and clears throat]
 

4703
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:01,030
[cough and clears throat]
Maybe Jack, I'm just not like I don't

4704
02:08:01,030 --> 02:08:01,040
Maybe Jack, I'm just not like I don't
 

4705
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:02,550
Maybe Jack, I'm just not like I don't
have too much bias because we're trading

4706
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:02,560
have too much bias because we're trading
 

4707
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:05,270
have too much bias because we're trading
inside range, right?

4708
02:08:05,270 --> 02:08:05,280
inside range, right?
 

4709
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:06,629
inside range, right?
Look at your daily. We're just we're

4710
02:08:06,629 --> 02:08:06,639
Look at your daily. We're just we're
 

4711
02:08:06,639 --> 02:08:08,550
Look at your daily. We're just we're
trading inside of the previous day's

4712
02:08:08,550 --> 02:08:08,560
trading inside of the previous day's
 

4713
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:11,510
trading inside of the previous day's
range, right? So, we look below it

4714
02:08:11,510 --> 02:08:11,520
range, right? So, we look below it
 

4715
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:13,669
range, right? So, we look below it
overnight, found a bid. We're trading

4716
02:08:13,669 --> 02:08:13,679
overnight, found a bid. We're trading
 

4717
02:08:13,679 --> 02:08:15,430
overnight, found a bid. We're trading
inside of Friday's range now. So, I

4718
02:08:15,430 --> 02:08:15,440
inside of Friday's range now. So, I
 

4719
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:17,189
inside of Friday's range now. So, I
don't I'm not trying to carry too much

4720
02:08:17,189 --> 02:08:17,199
don't I'm not trying to carry too much
 

4721
02:08:17,199 --> 02:08:19,510
don't I'm not trying to carry too much
bias right now

4722
02:08:19,510 --> 02:08:19,520
bias right now
 

4723
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:21,270
bias right now
because if they're going to put a daily

4724
02:08:21,270 --> 02:08:21,280
because if they're going to put a daily
 

4725
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:24,229
because if they're going to put a daily
higher low in this market, they've done

4726
02:08:24,229 --> 02:08:24,239
higher low in this market, they've done
 

4727
02:08:24,239 --> 02:08:27,669
higher low in this market, they've done
it today. So, any breakout above current

4728
02:08:27,669 --> 02:08:27,679
it today. So, any breakout above current
 

4729
02:08:27,679 --> 02:08:29,589
it today. So, any breakout above current
day's high tomorrow, I don't want to

4730
02:08:29,589 --> 02:08:29,599
day's high tomorrow, I don't want to
 

4731
02:08:29,599 --> 02:08:31,430
day's high tomorrow, I don't want to
include it today. Tomorrow and onwards,

4732
02:08:31,430 --> 02:08:31,440
include it today. Tomorrow and onwards,
 

4733
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:33,030
include it today. Tomorrow and onwards,
potential squeeze, right? Because then

4734
02:08:33,030 --> 02:08:33,040
potential squeeze, right? Because then
 

4735
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:35,030
potential squeeze, right? Because then
we put the daily high low in, then we go

4736
02:08:35,030 --> 02:08:35,040
we put the daily high low in, then we go
 

4737
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:36,470
we put the daily high low in, then we go
into a higher high and we can squeeze

4738
02:08:36,470 --> 02:08:36,480
into a higher high and we can squeeze
 

4739
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:38,310
into a higher high and we can squeeze
back out. So I'm not carrying too much

4740
02:08:38,310 --> 02:08:38,320
back out. So I'm not carrying too much
 

4741
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:40,950
back out. So I'm not carrying too much
bias on the Monday while we set up the

4742
02:08:40,950 --> 02:08:40,960
bias on the Monday while we set up the
 

4743
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:42,310
bias on the Monday while we set up the
liquidity for the rest of the week.

4744
02:08:42,310 --> 02:08:42,320
liquidity for the rest of the week.
 

4745
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:44,310
liquidity for the rest of the week.
Okay. So how we act up here now becomes

4746
02:08:44,310 --> 02:08:44,320
Okay. So how we act up here now becomes
 

4747
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:46,470
Okay. So how we act up here now becomes
key like we talked about. So I want to

4748
02:08:46,470 --> 02:08:46,480
key like we talked about. So I want to
 

4749
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:49,030
key like we talked about. So I want to
see strong sellers come in and defend

4750
02:08:49,030 --> 02:08:49,040
see strong sellers come in and defend
 

4751
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:50,550
see strong sellers come in and defend
these levels. All right. If they don't

4752
02:08:50,550 --> 02:08:50,560
these levels. All right. If they don't
 

4753
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:51,910
these levels. All right. If they don't
do that then obviously I'm not going to

4754
02:08:51,910 --> 02:08:51,920
do that then obviously I'm not going to
 

4755
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:53,189
do that then obviously I'm not going to
sell it back down because we can

4756
02:08:53,189 --> 02:08:53,199
sell it back down because we can
 

4757
02:08:53,199 --> 02:09:01,589
sell it back down because we can
resqueeze higher.

4758
02:09:01,589 --> 02:09:01,599

 

4759
02:09:01,599 --> 02:09:04,069

Yeah. Exactly. That's all we've got so

4760
02:09:04,069 --> 02:09:04,079
Yeah. Exactly. That's all we've got so
 

4761
02:09:04,079 --> 02:09:05,589
Yeah. Exactly. That's all we've got so
far.

4762
02:09:05,589 --> 02:09:05,599
far.
 

4763
02:09:05,599 --> 02:09:07,030
far.
But we're back inside of the initial

4764
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:07,040
But we're back inside of the initial
 

4765
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:08,870
But we're back inside of the initial
balance. We're starting to like look

4766
02:09:08,870 --> 02:09:08,880
balance. We're starting to like look
 

4767
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:10,790
balance. We're starting to like look
into these areas. If sellers get met

4768
02:09:10,790 --> 02:09:10,800
into these areas. If sellers get met
 

4769
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:12,229
into these areas. If sellers get met
here, if we meet sellers here, then

4770
02:09:12,229 --> 02:09:12,239
here, if we meet sellers here, then
 

4771
02:09:12,239 --> 02:09:13,270
here, if we meet sellers here, then
we're going to look for that rotation.

4772
02:09:13,270 --> 02:09:13,280
we're going to look for that rotation.
 

4773
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:15,510
we're going to look for that rotation.
But again, we've got a big node here.

4774
02:09:15,510 --> 02:09:15,520
But again, we've got a big node here.
 

4775
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:17,270
But again, we've got a big node here.
And this is now point of control, which

4776
02:09:17,270 --> 02:09:17,280
And this is now point of control, which
 

4777
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:20,470
And this is now point of control, which
is a pain that they've moved it down. It

4778
02:09:20,470 --> 02:09:20,480
is a pain that they've moved it down. It
 

4779
02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:22,709
is a pain that they've moved it down. It
would have been nice to have PC up here

4780
02:09:22,709 --> 02:09:22,719
would have been nice to have PC up here
 

4781
02:09:22,719 --> 02:09:24,390
would have been nice to have PC up here
and move away from it. So, we have to

4782
02:09:24,390 --> 02:09:24,400
and move away from it. So, we have to
 

4783
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:27,990
and move away from it. So, we have to
respect this here. Now,

4784
02:09:27,990 --> 02:09:28,000
respect this here. Now,
 

4785
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:31,030
respect this here. Now,
this node here,

4786
02:09:31,030 --> 02:09:31,040
this node here,
 

4787
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:33,270
this node here,
if they sell into this and sell through

4788
02:09:33,270 --> 02:09:33,280
if they sell into this and sell through
 

4789
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:35,830
if they sell into this and sell through
this, then we can move lower. But really

4790
02:09:35,830 --> 02:09:35,840
this, then we can move lower. But really
 

4791
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:37,589
this, then we can move lower. But really
it's just think about the structure.

4792
02:09:37,589 --> 02:09:37,599
it's just think about the structure.
 

4793
02:09:37,599 --> 02:09:40,229
it's just think about the structure.
This is all we're doing right now,

4794
02:09:40,229 --> 02:09:40,239
This is all we're doing right now,
 

4795
02:09:40,239 --> 02:09:52,550
This is all we're doing right now,
right? How we acting here becomes key.

4796
02:09:52,550 --> 02:09:52,560

 

4797
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:54,149

You want this little squeeze up to be

4798
02:09:54,149 --> 02:09:54,159
You want this little squeeze up to be
 

4799
02:09:54,159 --> 02:09:55,830
You want this little squeeze up to be
met with sellers. That's what you want

4800
02:09:55,830 --> 02:09:55,840
met with sellers. That's what you want
 

4801
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:57,189
met with sellers. That's what you want
to see if you're looking for downside

4802
02:09:57,189 --> 02:09:57,199
to see if you're looking for downside
 

4803
02:09:57,199 --> 02:09:58,149
to see if you're looking for downside
action. And then you're going to have to

4804
02:09:58,149 --> 02:09:58,159
action. And then you're going to have to
 

4805
02:09:58,159 --> 02:09:59,510
action. And then you're going to have to
respect the volume below you. I'm

4806
02:09:59,510 --> 02:09:59,520
respect the volume below you. I'm
 

4807
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:02,069
respect the volume below you. I'm
starting to see that move now.

4808
02:10:02,069 --> 02:10:02,079
starting to see that move now.
 

4809
02:10:02,079 --> 02:10:04,790
starting to see that move now.
Starting to see it.

4810
02:10:04,790 --> 02:10:04,800
Starting to see it.
 

4811
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:06,870
Starting to see it.
Really nice that move into back into the

4812
02:10:06,870 --> 02:10:06,880
Really nice that move into back into the
 

4813
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:09,910
Really nice that move into back into the
70s and 80s just got sold into for now.

4814
02:10:09,910 --> 02:10:09,920
70s and 80s just got sold into for now.
 

4815
02:10:09,920 --> 02:10:12,310
70s and 80s just got sold into for now.
Still very early.

4816
02:10:12,310 --> 02:10:12,320
Still very early.
 

4817
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:17,189
Still very early.
Watching the tape there.

4819
02:10:17,199 --> 02:10:18,950

Don't have a lot of conviction either

4820
02:10:18,950 --> 02:10:18,960
Don't have a lot of conviction either
 

4821
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:34,149
Don't have a lot of conviction either
way today.

Definitely sellers up there. Not
 

4825

Definitely sellers up there. Not
convinced we've swiped up enough to see

02:10:38,790 --> 02:10:38,800
convinced we've swiped up enough to see
 

4827
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:41,350
convinced we've swiped up enough to see
how big they are yet. Is there any delta

4828
02:10:41,350 --> 02:10:41,360
how big they are yet. Is there any delta
 

4829
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:45,669
how big they are yet. Is there any delta
outside?

4830

4831
02:10:45,679 --> 02:10:47,589

Any big outlier prints? Not really

Any big outlier prints? Not really

can't do it, then you have to just

4856

can't do it, then you have to just
 

4857
02:11:36,239 --> 02:11:37,589
can't do it, then you have to just
understand it means there's buyers on

down there, it can. And let's see if

down there, it can. And let's see if
 

4869

there's a buyer down there or not.

02:12:07,669 --> 02:12:07,679
at, Raph. I mean, it is the same area,
 

4875
02:12:07,679 --> 02:12:09,350
at, Raph. I mean, it is the same area,
but you know, it means that we're not,

4876
02:12:09,350 --> 02:12:09,360
but you know, it means that we're not,
 

4877
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:11,109
but you know, it means that we're not,
it's more like a quasi. We don't get a

4878
02:12:11,109 --> 02:12:11,119
it's more like a quasi. We don't get a
 

4879
02:12:11,119 --> 02:12:13,750
it's more like a quasi. We don't get a
break until we trade under here, right?

4880
02:12:13,750 --> 02:12:13,760
break until we trade under here, right?
 

4881
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:15,270
break until we trade under here, right?
So, I mean, there's nothing to say that

4882
02:12:15,270 --> 02:12:15,280
So, I mean, there's nothing to say that
 

4883
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:16,790
So, I mean, there's nothing to say that
this doesn't do this still as well,

4884
02:12:16,790 --> 02:12:16,800
this doesn't do this still as well,
 

4885
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:18,550
this doesn't do this still as well,
right? So, we have to just observe

4886
02:12:18,550 --> 02:12:18,560
right? So, we have to just observe
 

4887
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:21,350
right? So, we have to just observe
because if we're thinking about swings,

4888
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:21,360
because if we're thinking about swings,
 

4889
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:23,109
because if we're thinking about swings,
this can still be a higher low, right?

4890
02:12:23,109 --> 02:12:23,119
this can still be a higher low, right?
 

4891
02:12:23,119 --> 02:12:25,030
this can still be a higher low, right?
There's your low, higher low, higher low

4892
02:12:25,030 --> 02:12:25,040
There's your low, higher low, higher low
 

4893
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:26,870
There's your low, higher low, higher low
until we get a breakdown under here. But

4894
02:12:26,870 --> 02:12:26,880
until we get a breakdown under here. But
 

4895
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:28,629
until we get a breakdown under here. But
if sellers are going to come in, this is

4896
02:12:28,629 --> 02:12:28,639
if sellers are going to come in, this is
 

4897
02:12:28,639 --> 02:12:29,910
if sellers are going to come in, this is
the area that they're going to need to

4898
02:12:29,910 --> 02:12:29,920
the area that they're going to need to
 

4899
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:31,430
the area that they're going to need to
come in. This is the look above and fail

come in. This is the look above and fail
 

4901
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:33,510
come in. This is the look above and fail
above initial balance failing to

02:12:33,510 --> 02:12:33,520
above initial balance failing to
 

4903
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:36,149
above initial balance failing to
reclaim. The hard thing is is how much

4904
02:12:36,149 --> 02:12:36,159
reclaim. The hard thing is is how much
 

4905
02:12:36,159 --> 02:12:38,550
reclaim. The hard thing is is how much
volume we've built out. Right? Look how

4906
02:12:38,550 --> 02:12:38,560
volume we've built out. Right? Look how
 

4907
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:40,950
volume we've built out. Right? Look how
thick we are. If we get under this, we

4908
02:12:40,950 --> 02:12:40,960
thick we are. If we get under this, we
 

4909
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:42,470
thick we are. If we get under this, we
get thinner and there can be a bigger

4910
02:12:42,470 --> 02:12:42,480
get thinner and there can be a bigger
 

4911
02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:44,550
get thinner and there can be a bigger
drop and that will time out well with

4912
02:12:44,550 --> 02:12:44,560
drop and that will time out well with
 

4913
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:46,629
drop and that will time out well with
that. But until that point, I'd be see

02:12:46,629 --> 02:12:46,639
that. But until that point, I'd be see
 

4915
02:12:46,639 --> 02:12:49,466
that. But until that point, I'd be see
money take money.

do it. I'd say a good close under 60s

clos under 60s and then you see might
 

4995
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:23,510

5007
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,429
going to come for these 60s like we just
talked about. Now, can they get strong

5008
02:16:35,429 --> 02:16:35,439
talked about. Now, can they get strong
 

5009
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:38,150
talked about. Now, can they get strong
clothes underneath?

5010

clothes underneath?
 

5011
02:16:38,160 --> 02:16:40,870

5015
02:16:42,399 --> 02:16:44,709
And really, if they can get under 50s
and then you might get a bit more of a a

5016
02:16:44,709 --> 02:16:44,719
and then you might get a bit more of a a
 

5017
02:16:44,719 --> 02:16:50,790
and then you might get a bit more of a a
violent wash.

5195
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:15,429

I just can't see anything happening in

5196
02:21:15,429 --> 02:21:15,439
I just can't see anything happening in
 

5197
02:21:15,439 --> 02:21:18,950
I just can't see anything happening in
this market.

5198
02:21:18,950 --> 02:21:18,960

 

5199
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:24,950

What's here? Let me check the daily

5200
02:21:24,950 --> 02:21:24,960

 

5201
02:21:24,960 --> 02:21:27,910

mainly say sell volume and still very

5202
02:21:27,910 --> 02:21:27,920
mainly say sell volume and still very
 

5203
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:31,750
mainly say sell volume and still very
very low.

5204
02:21:31,750 --> 02:21:31,760

 

5205
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:39,030

Yeah, I'm not convinced.

5206
02:21:39,030 --> 02:21:39,040

 

5207
02:21:39,040 --> 02:21:40,950

Well, everyone talks about a Santa rally

5208
02:21:40,950 --> 02:21:40,960
Well, everyone talks about a Santa rally
 

5209
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:43,270
Well, everyone talks about a Santa rally
before Christmas, but reality is most

5210
02:21:43,270 --> 02:21:43,280
before Christmas, but reality is most
 

5211
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:46,070
before Christmas, but reality is most
times Santa rallies happen in January to

5212
02:21:46,070 --> 02:21:46,080
times Santa rallies happen in January to
 

5213
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:49,750
times Santa rallies happen in January to
be honest. But this is not a normal year

5214
02:21:49,750 --> 02:21:49,760
be honest. But this is not a normal year
 

5215
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:51,510
be honest. But this is not a normal year
though. Everyone keeps talking about

5216
02:21:51,510 --> 02:21:51,520
though. Everyone keeps talking about
 

5217
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:53,990
though. Everyone keeps talking about
they're referencing previous years.

5218
02:21:53,990 --> 02:21:54,000
they're referencing previous years.
 

5219
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,950
they're referencing previous years.
[\h__\h] tell. show me a previous year

5220
02:21:56,950 --> 02:21:56,960
[\h__\h] tell. show me a previous year
 

5221
02:21:56,960 --> 02:21:59,349
[\h__\h] tell. show me a previous year
which has traded straight upside since

5222
02:21:59,349 --> 02:21:59,359
which has traded straight upside since
 

5223
02:21:59,359 --> 02:22:02,710
which has traded straight upside since
April of the amount of size and percent

5224
02:22:02,710 --> 02:22:02,720
April of the amount of size and percent
 

5225
02:22:02,720 --> 02:22:05,750
April of the amount of size and percent
that we have. So I'm very like inclined

5226
02:22:05,750 --> 02:22:05,760
that we have. So I'm very like inclined
 

5227
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:08,309
that we have. So I'm very like inclined
to be very cautious thinking about oh

5228
02:22:08,309 --> 02:22:08,319
to be very cautious thinking about oh
 

5229
02:22:08,319 --> 02:22:09,670
to be very cautious thinking about oh
this is what we've done on previous

5230
02:22:09,670 --> 02:22:09,680
this is what we've done on previous
 

5231
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:12,230
this is what we've done on previous
years. All right. Well this isn't

5232
02:22:12,230 --> 02:22:12,240
years. All right. Well this isn't
 

5233
02:22:12,240 --> 02:22:14,230
years. All right. Well this isn't
previous years is it? This is tariff

5234
02:22:14,230 --> 02:22:14,240
previous years is it? This is tariff
 

5235
02:22:14,240 --> 02:22:17,110
previous years is it? This is tariff
year. So

5236
02:22:17,110 --> 02:22:17,120
year. So
 

5237
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:18,950
year. So
I don't know. All I know is hedge funds

5238
02:22:18,950 --> 02:22:18,960
I don't know. All I know is hedge funds
 

5239
02:22:18,960 --> 02:22:20,230
I don't know. All I know is hedge funds
I don't think have made the money that

5240
02:22:20,230 --> 02:22:20,240
I don't think have made the money that
 

5241
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:21,990
I don't think have made the money that
they need to make. So it really depends

5242
02:22:21,990 --> 02:22:22,000
they need to make. So it really depends
 

5243
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,429
they need to make. So it really depends
what their intents are.

5244
02:22:25,429 --> 02:22:25,439
what their intents are.
 

5245
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:27,110
what their intents are.
Are are the Fed going to pivot and

5246

5248
02:22:29,030 --> 02:22:29,040
probably do a cut next month? Probably
 

5249
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:31,510
probably do a cut next month? Probably
by the looks of it. And power will be

5250
02:22:31,510 --> 02:22:31,520
by the looks of it. And power will be
 

5251
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:34,230
by the looks of it. And power will be
gone next year anyway. And then uh

5252
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:34,240
gone next year anyway. And then uh
 

5253
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:37,030
gone next year anyway. And then uh
Republicans will take full control and

5254
02:22:37,030 --> 02:22:37,040
Republicans will take full control and
 

5255
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:38,550
Republicans will take full control and
no doubt Trump will have a puppet in

5256
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:38,560
no doubt Trump will have a puppet in
 

5257
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:41,429
no doubt Trump will have a puppet in
there and they just do cut cut cut. And

5258
02:22:41,429 --> 02:22:41,439
there and they just do cut cut cut. And
 

5259
02:22:41,439 --> 02:22:42,790
there and they just do cut cut cut. And
it all depends if we're going to pump

5260
02:22:42,790 --> 02:22:42,800
it all depends if we're going to pump
 

5261
02:22:42,800 --> 02:22:44,950
it all depends if we're going to pump
that cut. And also you need to watch the

5262
02:22:44,950 --> 02:22:44,960
that cut. And also you need to watch the
 

5263
02:22:44,960 --> 02:22:48,550
that cut. And also you need to watch the
[\h__\h] the Japanese uh trade carry trade

They're being forced to sell US indices

right now. that will cause a liquidity
issue on the market.

02:22:56,870 --> 02:22:56,880
issue on the market.
 

5273
02:22:56,880 --> 02:23:00,630
issue on the market.

5277
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:10,950

Well, I would say bears right now failed

5278
02:23:10,950 --> 02:23:10,960
Well, I would say bears right now failed
 

5279

here for a failed rotation, but there is

5284
02:23:16,950 --> 02:23:16,960
here for a failed rotation, but there is
 

5285
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:18,710
here for a failed rotation, but there is
no volume coming in here. They have not

5286
02:23:18,710 --> 02:23:18,720
no volume coming in here. They have not
 

5287
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:20,230
no volume coming in here. They have not
come in aggressively and slapped this

02:23:20,230 --> 02:23:20,240
come in aggressively and slapped this
 

5289
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:25,349
come in aggressively and slapped this
down.

5290

pro probably alos, but I I couldn't tell

5294
02:23:29,910 --> 02:23:29,920
pro probably alos, but I I couldn't tell
 

5295
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:33,990
pro probably alos, but I I couldn't tell
you with absolute certainty

5296
02:23:33,990 --> 02:23:34,000

 

5297
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,190

because [snorts] I'm not them. And

5298
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:35,200
because [snorts] I'm not them. And
 

5299
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:37,510
because [snorts] I'm not them. And
anyone who says this is what it is is a

02:23:37,510 --> 02:23:37,520
anyone who says this is what it is is a
 

5301
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:39,429
anyone who says this is what it is is a
liar. Unless you're that person, you

5302
02:23:39,429 --> 02:23:39,439
liar. Unless you're that person, you
 

5303
02:23:39,439 --> 02:23:42,550
liar. Unless you're that person, you
don't actually know.

5304
02:23:42,550 --> 02:23:42,560
don't actually know.
 

5305
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:44,469
don't actually know.
Okay. Failing previous day point of

5306
02:23:44,469 --> 02:23:44,479
Okay. Failing previous day point of
 

5307
02:23:44,479 --> 02:23:46,309
Okay. Failing previous day point of
control again. But you know, this is

5308
02:23:46,309 --> 02:23:46,319
control again. But you know, this is
 

5309
02:23:46,319 --> 02:23:48,950
control again. But you know, this is
just slowly just grinding all the way

5310
02:23:48,950 --> 02:23:48,960
just slowly just grinding all the way
 

5311
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:50,870
just slowly just grinding all the way
back up to where we just failed from.

5312
02:23:50,870 --> 02:23:50,880
back up to where we just failed from.
 

5313
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:52,070
back up to where we just failed from.
And if they want to complete the

5314
02:23:52,070 --> 02:23:52,080
And if they want to complete the
 

5315
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:55,190
And if they want to complete the
rotation today and fill this gap, they

5316
02:23:55,190 --> 02:23:55,200
rotation today and fill this gap, they
 

5317
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:56,870
rotation today and fill this gap, they
absolutely can. Bears will need to

5318
02:23:56,870 --> 02:23:56,880
absolutely can. Bears will need to
 

5319
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:58,150
absolutely can. Bears will need to
defend this. They really should have

5320
02:23:58,150 --> 02:23:58,160
defend this. They really should have
 

5321
02:23:58,160 --> 02:23:59,670
defend this. They really should have
defended this low volume node. They

5322
02:23:59,670 --> 02:23:59,680
defended this low volume node. They
 

5323
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:03,590
defended this low volume node. They
didn't. I'd say buyers are in way more

5324
02:24:03,590 --> 02:24:03,600
didn't. I'd say buyers are in way more
 

5325
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:05,349
didn't. I'd say buyers are in way more
control here than bears in this market.

5326
02:24:05,349 --> 02:24:05,359
control here than bears in this market.
 

5327
02:24:05,359 --> 02:24:07,030
control here than bears in this market.
And it just feels like a low volume

5328
02:24:07,030 --> 02:24:07,040
And it just feels like a low volume
 

5329
02:24:07,040 --> 02:24:19,990
And it just feels like a low volume
grind. I would not be buying up here.

5330
02:24:19,990 --> 02:24:20,000

 

5331
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:26,070

Yeah.

5332
02:24:26,070 --> 02:24:26,080

 

5333
02:24:26,080 --> 02:24:33,750

Jeez.

5334
02:24:33,750 --> 02:24:33,760

 

5335
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:36,230

Look at that. This is what I've been

5336
02:24:36,230 --> 02:24:36,240
Look at that. This is what I've been
 

5337
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:37,590
Look at that. This is what I've been
worried about the whole time. I think

5338
02:24:37,590 --> 02:24:37,600
worried about the whole time. I think
 

5339
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:39,190
worried about the whole time. I think
this is going to break out and cause

5340
02:24:39,190 --> 02:24:39,200
this is going to break out and cause
 

5341
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:41,750
this is going to break out and cause
issues in this market.

5342
02:24:41,750 --> 02:24:41,760
issues in this market.
 

5343
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:43,349
issues in this market.
I've said it. I've said it for months

5344
02:24:43,349 --> 02:24:43,359
I've said it. I've said it for months
 

5345
02:24:43,359 --> 02:24:47,590
I've said it. I've said it for months
and months and months. This this

5346
02:24:47,590 --> 02:24:47,600
and months and months. This this
 

5347
02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:49,510
and months and months. This this
is the big issue and question mark for

5348
02:24:49,510 --> 02:24:49,520
is the big issue and question mark for
 

5349
02:24:49,520 --> 02:24:52,230
is the big issue and question mark for
me.

5350
02:24:52,230 --> 02:24:52,240
me.
 

5351
02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:54,389
me.
I think it underneath the hood of this

5352
02:24:54,389 --> 02:24:54,399
I think it underneath the hood of this
 

5353
02:24:54,399 --> 02:24:57,830
I think it underneath the hood of this
market, it does not look very good. But

5354
02:24:57,830 --> 02:24:57,840
market, it does not look very good. But
 

5355
02:24:57,840 --> 02:25:00,389
market, it does not look very good. But
it's been that way for a long time and

5356
02:25:00,389 --> 02:25:00,399
it's been that way for a long time and
 

5357
02:25:00,399 --> 02:25:02,230
it's been that way for a long time and
uh

5358
02:25:02,230 --> 02:25:02,240
uh
 

5359
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:15,429
uh
doesn't mean it has to do anything.

5360
02:25:15,429 --> 02:25:15,439

 

5361
02:25:15,439 --> 02:25:17,429

It's just like 08.08 should have

5362
02:25:17,429 --> 02:25:17,439
It's just like 08.08 should have
 

5363
02:25:17,439 --> 02:25:21,190
It's just like 08.08 should have
happened in 07 and 06. It didn't.

5364
02:25:21,190 --> 02:25:21,200
happened in 07 and 06. It didn't.
 

5365

Tops take an awful long time to develop

5366
02:25:24,309 --> 02:25:24,319
Tops take an awful long time to develop
 

5367
02:25:24,319 --> 02:25:25,910
Tops take an awful long time to develop
in markets if there's going to be a top

5368
02:25:25,910 --> 02:25:25,920
in markets if there's going to be a top
 

5369
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:27,429
in markets if there's going to be a top
at all. It doesn't have to happen when

5370
02:25:27,429 --> 02:25:27,439
at all. It doesn't have to happen when
 

5371
02:25:27,439 --> 02:25:28,710
at all. It doesn't have to happen when
people are calling for it. It can keep

5372
02:25:28,710 --> 02:25:28,720
people are calling for it. It can keep
 

5373
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:31,270
people are calling for it. It can keep
going and going and going. We might see

5374
02:25:31,270 --> 02:25:31,280
going and going and going. We might see
 

5375
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:33,110
going and going and going. We might see
another two years of squeeze out. And

5376
02:25:33,110 --> 02:25:33,120
another two years of squeeze out. And
 

5377
02:25:33,120 --> 02:25:34,790
another two years of squeeze out. And
I'm not joking. I'm being deadly

5378
02:25:34,790 --> 02:25:34,800
I'm not joking. I'm being deadly
 

5379
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:36,480
I'm not joking. I'm being deadly
serious.

5380
02:25:36,480 --> 02:25:36,490
serious.

We just got to trade what's in front of

bears have done
 

5393
02:25:56,720 --> 02:25:59,110
bears have done
an awful job

5394
02:25:59,110 --> 02:25:59,120
an awful job
 

5395
02:25:59,120 --> 02:26:02,309
an awful job
of defending any key level here.

5396
02:26:02,309 --> 02:26:02,319
of defending any key level here.
 

5397
02:26:02,319 --> 02:26:08,309
of defending any key level here.
Awful.

5398
02:26:08,309 --> 02:26:08,319

 

5399
02:26:08,319 --> 02:26:09,670

How long till lunch? I don't think

5400
02:26:09,670 --> 02:26:09,680
How long till lunch? I don't think
 

5401
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:11,510
How long till lunch? I don't think
anything's going to change. This is a

5402
02:26:11,510 --> 02:26:11,520
anything's going to change. This is a
 

5403
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:14,309
anything's going to change. This is a
slow drift range rotating market.

5404
02:26:14,309 --> 02:26:14,319
slow drift range rotating market.
 

5405
02:26:14,319 --> 02:26:16,790
slow drift range rotating market.
There's nothing to do in here.

There's nothing to do in here.
 

5407
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:19,750
There's nothing to do in here.
There's literally nothing to do in this

5408
02:26:19,750 --> 02:26:19,760
There's literally nothing to do in this
 

5409

There's literally nothing to do in this

02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:24,790

I just got to wait for it to come to a

02:26:24,790 --> 02:26:24,800
I just got to wait for it to come to a
 

5413
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:35,270
I just got to wait for it to come to a
level of actual interest.

5414
02:26:35,270 --> 02:26:35,280

 

5415
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:46,469

Have a look at the bread.

5416
02:26:46,469 --> 02:26:46,479

 

5417
02:26:46,479 --> 02:26:52,230

Yeah, energy is the only green sector.

5418
02:26:52,230 --> 02:26:52,240

 

5419
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:53,990

Some consumers aren't too bad to be

5420
02:26:53,990 --> 02:26:54,000
Some consumers aren't too bad to be
 

5421
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:57,429
Some consumers aren't too bad to be
fair.

5422
02:26:57,429 --> 02:26:57,439

 

5423
02:26:57,439 --> 02:26:59,990

Walmart. Okay, we talked about that,

5424
02:26:59,990 --> 02:27:00,000
Walmart. Okay, we talked about that,
 

5425
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:03,510
Walmart. Okay, we talked about that,
didn't we? See a rotation into cheap

5426
02:27:03,510 --> 02:27:03,520
didn't we? See a rotation into cheap
 

5427
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:05,990
didn't we? See a rotation into cheap
cheap goods in preparation for uh

5428
02:27:05,990 --> 02:27:06,000
cheap goods in preparation for uh
 

5429
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:16,790
cheap goods in preparation for uh
recessionary pressure.

5430
02:27:16,790 --> 02:27:16,800

 

5431
02:27:16,800 --> 02:27:37,990

Hold up. Yeah.

5432
02:27:37,990 --> 02:27:38,000

 

5433
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:41,670

Okay, so tested that supply.

5434
02:27:41,670 --> 02:27:41,680
Okay, so tested that supply.
 

5435
02:27:41,680 --> 02:27:43,750
Okay, so tested that supply.
That gray box

5436
02:27:43,750 --> 02:27:43,760
That gray box
 

5437
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:45,349
That gray box
probably comes for a rotation back down

5438
02:27:45,349 --> 02:27:45,359
probably comes for a rotation back down
 

5439
02:27:45,359 --> 02:27:47,670
probably comes for a rotation back down
to this edge here. And for me, bears

5440
02:27:47,670 --> 02:27:47,680
to this edge here. And for me, bears
 

5441
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:49,030
to this edge here. And for me, bears
don't take control now until we move

5442
02:27:49,030 --> 02:27:49,040
don't take control now until we move
 

5443
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:50,950
don't take control now until we move
under 50. All right. So, this is the

5444
02:27:50,950 --> 02:27:50,960
under 50. All right. So, this is the
 

5445
02:27:50,960 --> 02:27:52,870
under 50. All right. So, this is the
edge that they're trying to defend.

5446
02:27:52,870 --> 02:27:52,880
edge that they're trying to defend.
 

5447
02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:54,630
edge that they're trying to defend.
They've done a woeful job that if I was

5448
02:27:54,630 --> 02:27:54,640
They've done a woeful job that if I was
 

5449
02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:55,750
They've done a woeful job that if I was
them, I wouldn't have let it get that

5450
02:27:55,750 --> 02:27:55,760
them, I wouldn't have let it get that
 

5451
02:27:55,760 --> 02:27:58,550
them, I wouldn't have let it get that
high, but uh I'm not them. They're

5452
02:27:58,550 --> 02:27:58,560
high, but uh I'm not them. They're
 

5453
02:27:58,560 --> 02:28:00,389
high, but uh I'm not them. They're
trying to defend this. If bulls step in

5454
02:28:00,389 --> 02:28:00,399
trying to defend this. If bulls step in
 

5455
02:28:00,399 --> 02:28:03,349
trying to defend this. If bulls step in
here and hold 70s, they can complete a

5456
02:28:03,349 --> 02:28:03,359
here and hold 70s, they can complete a
 

5457
02:28:03,359 --> 02:28:07,830
here and hold 70s, they can complete a
rotation higher.

5458
02:28:07,830 --> 02:28:07,840

 

5459
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:09,830

Yeah, big wick. But this is what we

5460
02:28:09,830 --> 02:28:09,840
Yeah, big wick. But this is what we
 

5461
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:11,190
Yeah, big wick. But this is what we
talked about on the hourly, isn't it?

5462
02:28:11,190 --> 02:28:11,200
talked about on the hourly, isn't it?
 

5463
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:12,950
talked about on the hourly, isn't it?
It's exactly what we talked about. We're

5464
02:28:12,950 --> 02:28:12,960
It's exactly what we talked about. We're
 

5465
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:15,110
It's exactly what we talked about. We're
not in a prot. So, you're seeing that

5466
02:28:15,110 --> 02:28:15,120
not in a prot. So, you're seeing that
 

5467
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:16,790
not in a prot. So, you're seeing that
big wick on the hourly, but all the time

5468
02:28:16,790 --> 02:28:16,800
big wick on the hourly, but all the time
 

5469
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:20,150
big wick on the hourly, but all the time
we were under 440, we're in a range.

5470
02:28:20,150 --> 02:28:20,160
we were under 440, we're in a range.
 

5471
02:28:20,160 --> 02:28:23,508
we were under 440, we're in a range.
We're just in a range.

5472
02:28:23,508 --> 02:28:23,518
We're just in a range.
 

5473

We're just in a range.

There you go. So, they just supported in
front. They didn't even get there. Bears

5480

front. They didn't even get there. Bears
 

5481
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:52,150
front. They didn't even get there. Bears
didn't even get the rotation to 770.

400s now. I'd say you're overunders all
 

5669
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:30,389
400s now. I'd say you're overunders all
the time. They're protected.

5670
02:33:30,389 --> 02:33:30,399
the time. They're protected.
 

5671
02:33:30,399 --> 02:33:56,070
the time. They're protected.
Order in control.

5672
02:33:56,070 --> 02:33:56,080

 

5673
02:33:56,080 --> 02:33:59,030

I cannot believe

5674
02:33:59,030 --> 02:33:59,040
I cannot believe
 

5675
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,950
I cannot believe
on a new Monday and a new month, we're

5676
02:34:00,950 --> 02:34:00,960
on a new Monday and a new month, we're
 

5677
02:34:00,960 --> 02:34:03,270
on a new Monday and a new month, we're
just trading inside

5678
02:34:03,270 --> 02:34:03,280
just trading inside
 

5679
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:06,469
just trading inside
of the least volume we've ever seen on a

5680
02:34:06,469 --> 02:34:06,479
of the least volume we've ever seen on a
 

5681
02:34:06,479 --> 02:34:08,950
of the least volume we've ever seen on a
Friday. We're just trading inside of

5682
02:34:08,950 --> 02:34:08,960
Friday. We're just trading inside of
 

5683
02:34:08,960 --> 02:34:12,790
Friday. We're just trading inside of
that tiny amount of volume for a Friday.

5684
02:34:12,790 --> 02:34:12,800
that tiny amount of volume for a Friday.
 

5685
02:34:12,800 --> 02:34:14,469
that tiny amount of volume for a Friday.
Absolutely

5686
02:34:14,469 --> 02:34:14,479
Absolutely
 

5687
02:34:14,479 --> 02:34:18,389
Absolutely
pathetic.

5688
02:34:18,389 --> 02:34:18,399

 

5689
02:34:18,399 --> 02:34:21,510

We just need to get PAL tonight and see

5690
02:34:21,510 --> 02:34:21,520
We just need to get PAL tonight and see
 

5691
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:26,550
We just need to get PAL tonight and see
see what we do.

5692
02:34:26,550 --> 02:34:26,560

 

5693
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:27,830

Okay, they're going to try and get to

5694
02:34:27,830 --> 02:34:27,840
Okay, they're going to try and get to
 

5695
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:29,990
Okay, they're going to try and get to
these 450s.

5696
02:34:29,990 --> 02:34:30,000
these 450s.
 

5697
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,070
these 450s.
There's a 300 lot up here advertising.

5698
02:34:32,070 --> 02:34:32,080
There's a 300 lot up here advertising.
 

5699
02:34:32,080 --> 02:34:33,429
There's a 300 lot up here advertising.
What's the bet he pulls once we get

5700
02:34:33,429 --> 02:34:33,439
What's the bet he pulls once we get
 

5701
02:34:33,439 --> 02:34:35,030
What's the bet he pulls once we get
there? Probably quite strong, I'd say.

5702
02:34:35,030 --> 02:34:35,040
there? Probably quite strong, I'd say.
 

5703
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:39,910
there? Probably quite strong, I'd say.
Probably just pulls his order.

5704
02:34:39,910 --> 02:34:39,920

 

5705
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:41,429

That's where they're trying to get up to

5706
02:34:41,429 --> 02:34:41,439
That's where they're trying to get up to
 

5707
02:34:41,439 --> 02:34:43,830
That's where they're trying to get up to
at the moment. 450s, but I'd say really

5708
02:34:43,830 --> 02:34:43,840
at the moment. 450s, but I'd say really
 

5709
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:45,910
at the moment. 450s, but I'd say really
470s

5710
02:34:45,910 --> 02:34:45,920
470s
 

5711
02:34:45,920 --> 02:35:02,150
470s
and 480s are the job.

5712
02:35:02,150 --> 02:35:02,160

 

5713
02:35:02,160 --> 02:35:04,389

I cannot tell you how low this volume is

5714
02:35:04,389 --> 02:35:04,399
I cannot tell you how low this volume is
 

5715
02:35:04,399 --> 02:35:16,389
I cannot tell you how low this volume is
that we're moving in.

5716
02:35:16,389 --> 02:35:16,399

 

5717
02:35:16,399 --> 02:35:20,150

It's so slow.

5718
02:35:20,150 --> 02:35:20,160
It's so slow.
 

5719
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:21,990
It's so slow.
Like we're trading these tiny little

5720
02:35:21,990 --> 02:35:22,000
Like we're trading these tiny little
 

5721
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:25,110
Like we're trading these tiny little
like 10 lots, two lots, two lots on the

5722
02:35:25,110 --> 02:35:25,120
like 10 lots, two lots, two lots on the
 

5723
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:29,270
like 10 lots, two lots, two lots on the
market. Like seriously, guys,

5724
02:35:29,270 --> 02:35:29,280
market. Like seriously, guys,
 

5725
02:35:29,280 --> 02:35:31,227
market. Like seriously, guys,
just squeeze it out for [\h__\h] sake.

5726
02:35:31,227 --> 02:35:31,237
just squeeze it out for [\h__\h] sake.
 

5727
02:35:31,237 --> 02:35:33,110
just squeeze it out for [\h__\h] sake.
[snorts] Finish the rotation for once

5728
02:35:33,110 --> 02:35:33,120
[snorts] Finish the rotation for once
 

5729
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:35,510
[snorts] Finish the rotation for once
today. Maybe set something up for

5730
02:35:35,510 --> 02:35:35,520
today. Maybe set something up for
 

5731
02:35:35,520 --> 02:35:36,950
today. Maybe set something up for
tomorrow because if you don't finish

5732
02:35:36,950 --> 02:35:36,960
tomorrow because if you don't finish
 

5733
02:35:36,960 --> 02:35:38,309
tomorrow because if you don't finish
this today, there's going to be nothing

5734
02:35:38,309 --> 02:35:38,319
this today, there's going to be nothing
 

5735
02:35:38,319 --> 02:35:43,830
this today, there's going to be nothing
to do tomorrow either.

5736
02:35:43,830 --> 02:35:43,840

 

5737
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:47,990

You're a permable. I mean,

5738
02:35:47,990 --> 02:35:48,000
You're a permable. I mean,
 

5739
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:52,630
You're a permable. I mean,
I'm not permable yet.

5740
02:35:52,630 --> 02:35:52,640

 

5741
02:35:52,640 --> 02:35:54,870

If we can set a daily higher low and we

5742
02:35:54,870 --> 02:35:54,880
If we can set a daily higher low and we
 

5743
02:35:54,880 --> 02:35:56,630
If we can set a daily higher low and we
start breaking out later in the week,

5744
02:35:56,630 --> 02:35:56,640
start breaking out later in the week,
 

5745
02:35:56,640 --> 02:35:59,030
start breaking out later in the week,
then yes, I think alltime highs can

5746
02:35:59,030 --> 02:35:59,040
then yes, I think alltime highs can
 

5747
02:35:59,040 --> 02:36:01,590
then yes, I think alltime highs can
definitely be taken. No doubt about it.

5748
02:36:01,590 --> 02:36:01,600
definitely be taken. No doubt about it.
 

5749
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:03,429
definitely be taken. No doubt about it.
I'm not saying that on a Monday of a new

5750
02:36:03,429 --> 02:36:03,439
I'm not saying that on a Monday of a new
 

5751
02:36:03,439 --> 02:36:04,950
I'm not saying that on a Monday of a new
month after a low volume week. I think

5752
02:36:04,950 --> 02:36:04,960
month after a low volume week. I think
 

5753
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:08,469
month after a low volume week. I think
that would be idiotic to be quite honest

5754
02:36:08,469 --> 02:36:08,479
that would be idiotic to be quite honest
 

5755
02:36:08,479 --> 02:36:10,950
that would be idiotic to be quite honest
to say something like that because we've

5756
02:36:10,950 --> 02:36:10,960
to say something like that because we've
 

5757
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:12,950
to say something like that because we've
traded for

5758
02:36:12,950 --> 02:36:12,960
traded for
 

5759
02:36:12,960 --> 02:36:15,110
traded for
2 and 1/2 hours with some of the lowest

5760
02:36:15,110 --> 02:36:15,120
2 and 1/2 hours with some of the lowest
 

5761
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:18,469
2 and 1/2 hours with some of the lowest
volume I've ever seen.

5762
02:36:18,469 --> 02:36:18,479
volume I've ever seen.
 

5763
02:36:18,479 --> 02:36:20,630
volume I've ever seen.
So, I think trying to be that biased

5764
02:36:20,630 --> 02:36:20,640
So, I think trying to be that biased
 

5765
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:23,670
So, I think trying to be that biased
will probably get you in trouble.

5766
02:36:23,670 --> 02:36:23,680
will probably get you in trouble.
 

5767
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:25,270
will probably get you in trouble.
And it's fine to say permable, but

5768
02:36:25,270 --> 02:36:25,280
And it's fine to say permable, but
 

5769
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:27,750
And it's fine to say permable, but
permable versus what? Because you're a

5770
02:36:27,750 --> 02:36:27,760
permable versus what? Because you're a
 

5771
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:29,670
permable versus what? Because you're a
day trader, so it really doesn't mean

5772
02:36:29,670 --> 02:36:29,680
day trader, so it really doesn't mean
 

5773
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:31,750
day trader, so it really doesn't mean
[\h__\h] does it?

5774
02:36:31,750 --> 02:36:31,760
[\h__\h] does it?
 

5775
02:36:31,760 --> 02:36:33,590
[\h__\h] does it?
Because what actually matters is where

5776
02:36:33,590 --> 02:36:33,600
Because what actually matters is where
 

5777
02:36:33,600 --> 02:36:35,110
Because what actually matters is where
you're buying and where you're selling.

5778
02:36:35,110 --> 02:36:35,120
you're buying and where you're selling.
 

5779
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:37,429
you're buying and where you're selling.
Saying things other than that, it

5780
02:36:37,429 --> 02:36:37,439
Saying things other than that, it
 

5781
02:36:37,439 --> 02:36:39,590
Saying things other than that, it
doesn't really matter. I'm bullish to

5782
02:36:39,590 --> 02:36:39,600
doesn't really matter. I'm bullish to
 

5783
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:41,270
doesn't really matter. I'm bullish to
alltime highs. So that's great. Where

5784
02:36:41,270 --> 02:36:41,280
alltime highs. So that's great. Where
 

5785
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:44,550
alltime highs. So that's great. Where
are you buying it? How big's your stop?

5786
02:36:44,550 --> 02:36:44,560
are you buying it? How big's your stop?
 

5787
02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:50,309
are you buying it? How big's your stop?
How big are your bollocks?

5788
02:36:50,309 --> 02:36:50,319

 

5789
02:36:50,319 --> 02:36:52,710

Since 350.

5790
02:36:52,710 --> 02:36:52,720
Since 350.
 

5791
02:36:52,720 --> 02:36:54,790
Since 350.
Yeah, on that reclaim. Yeah, not bad. I

5792
02:36:54,790 --> 02:36:54,800
Yeah, on that reclaim. Yeah, not bad. I
 

5793
02:36:54,800 --> 02:36:55,990
Yeah, on that reclaim. Yeah, not bad. I
think these are the targets at the

5794
02:36:55,990 --> 02:36:56,000
think these are the targets at the
 

5795
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,230
think these are the targets at the
moment. I can't see beyond that. But

5796
02:36:58,230 --> 02:36:58,240
moment. I can't see beyond that. But
 

5797
02:36:58,240 --> 02:37:00,550
moment. I can't see beyond that. But
guess what? That guy pulled his order,

5798
02:37:00,550 --> 02:37:00,560
guess what? That guy pulled his order,
 

5799
02:37:00,560 --> 02:37:02,469
guess what? That guy pulled his order,
the 300 lot that I told you about. I

5800
02:37:02,469 --> 02:37:02,479
the 300 lot that I told you about. I
 

5801
02:37:02,479 --> 02:37:04,630
the 300 lot that I told you about. I
told you he'd pull it. It's too much

5802
02:37:04,630 --> 02:37:04,640
told you he'd pull it. It's too much
 

5803
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:06,630
told you he'd pull it. It's too much
spoofing on the tape today. Way, way,

5804
02:37:06,630 --> 02:37:06,640
spoofing on the tape today. Way, way,
 

5805
02:37:06,640 --> 02:37:08,469
spoofing on the tape today. Way, way,
way too much spoofing on the tape today

5806
02:37:08,469 --> 02:37:08,479
way too much spoofing on the tape today
 

5807
02:37:08,479 --> 02:37:10,630
way too much spoofing on the tape today
for me.

5808
02:37:10,630 --> 02:37:10,640
for me.
 

5809
02:37:10,640 --> 02:37:13,270
for me.
Low volume and we're spoofing. Like,

5810
02:37:13,270 --> 02:37:13,280
Low volume and we're spoofing. Like,
 

5811
02:37:13,280 --> 02:37:16,710
Low volume and we're spoofing. Like,
what are you doing?

5812
02:37:16,710 --> 02:37:16,720
what are you doing?
 

5813
02:37:16,720 --> 02:37:47,190
what are you doing?
Why? Why bother?

5814
02:37:47,190 --> 02:37:47,200

 

5815
02:37:47,200 --> 02:37:55,429

So slow. My gosh.

5816
02:37:55,429 --> 02:37:55,439

 

5817
02:37:55,439 --> 02:37:57,910

Video's coming back to test that 180.

5818
02:37:57,910 --> 02:37:57,920
Video's coming back to test that 180.
 

5819
02:37:57,920 --> 02:37:59,510
Video's coming back to test that 180.
That's definitely an options level up

5820
02:37:59,510 --> 02:37:59,520
That's definitely an options level up
 

5821
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:01,190
That's definitely an options level up
there. They failed every time they've

5822
02:38:01,190 --> 02:38:01,200
there. They failed every time they've
 

5823
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:09,429
there. They failed every time they've
attempted it.

5824
02:38:09,429 --> 02:38:09,439

 

5825
02:38:09,439 --> 02:38:12,389

How long to lunch? 10 minutes. What a

5826
02:38:12,389 --> 02:38:12,399
How long to lunch? 10 minutes. What a
 

5827
02:38:12,399 --> 02:38:46,630
How long to lunch? 10 minutes. What a
boring session.

5828
02:38:46,630 --> 02:38:46,640

 

5829
02:38:46,640 --> 02:38:50,309

Man, there's so much spoofing.

5830
02:38:50,309 --> 02:38:50,319
Man, there's so much spoofing.
 

5831
02:38:50,319 --> 02:38:52,950
Man, there's so much spoofing.
I don't get it. Why would you Why would

5832
02:38:52,950 --> 02:38:52,960
I don't get it. Why would you Why would
 

5833
02:38:52,960 --> 02:38:57,830
I don't get it. Why would you Why would
you put a bid out for

5834
02:38:57,830 --> 02:38:57,840

 

5835
02:38:57,840 --> 02:39:01,270

two seconds?

5836
02:39:01,270 --> 02:39:01,280

 

5837
02:39:01,280 --> 02:39:02,790

It's not like we're even close to it.

5838
02:39:02,790 --> 02:39:02,800
It's not like we're even close to it.
 

5839
02:39:02,800 --> 02:39:04,790
It's not like we're even close to it.
You put it like 10 points below for a

5840
02:39:04,790 --> 02:39:04,800
You put it like 10 points below for a
 

5841
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:06,550
You put it like 10 points below for a
whole two seconds. It's some weird [\h__\h]

5842
02:39:06,550 --> 02:39:06,560
whole two seconds. It's some weird [\h__\h]
 

5843
02:39:06,560 --> 02:39:15,349
whole two seconds. It's some weird [\h__\h]
going on, man.

5844
02:39:15,349 --> 02:39:15,359

 

5845
02:39:15,359 --> 02:39:18,389

we can get some nice retrace. I mean, it

5846
02:39:18,389 --> 02:39:18,399
we can get some nice retrace. I mean, it
 

5847
02:39:18,399 --> 02:39:20,790
we can get some nice retrace. I mean, it
doesn't look like that to me.

5848
02:39:20,790 --> 02:39:20,800
doesn't look like that to me.
 

5849
02:39:20,800 --> 02:39:22,950
doesn't look like that to me.
Everything's been absorbed.

5850
02:39:22,950 --> 02:39:22,960
Everything's been absorbed.
 

5851
02:39:22,960 --> 02:39:25,349
Everything's been absorbed.
Um, there's no aggressive participants

5852
02:39:25,349 --> 02:39:25,359
Um, there's no aggressive participants
 

5853
02:39:25,359 --> 02:39:28,790
Um, there's no aggressive participants
at the moment.

5854
02:39:28,790 --> 02:39:28,800

 

5855
02:39:28,800 --> 02:39:32,469

It just seems like a very slow drift and

5856
02:39:32,469 --> 02:39:32,479
It just seems like a very slow drift and
 

5857
02:39:32,479 --> 02:39:37,830
It just seems like a very slow drift and
grind higher trying to get gap fill, but

5858
02:39:37,830 --> 02:39:37,840
grind higher trying to get gap fill, but
 

5859
02:39:37,840 --> 02:39:40,150
grind higher trying to get gap fill, but
they're so slow. That's all it feels

5860
02:39:40,150 --> 02:39:40,160
they're so slow. That's all it feels
 

5861
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:43,190
they're so slow. That's all it feels
like. They're just there's nothing

5862
02:39:43,190 --> 02:39:43,200
like. They're just there's nothing
 

5863
02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:49,590
like. They're just there's nothing
here to do for me.

5864
02:39:49,590 --> 02:39:49,600

 

5865
02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:51,429

Big buyer just tried there. They just

5866
02:39:51,429 --> 02:39:51,439
Big buyer just tried there. They just
 

5867
02:39:51,439 --> 02:39:58,950
Big buyer just tried there. They just
filled those guys at 450.

5868
02:39:58,950 --> 02:39:58,960

 

5869
02:39:58,960 --> 02:40:00,630

I mean, why are you going to fill that

5870
02:40:00,630 --> 02:40:00,640
I mean, why are you going to fill that
 

5871
02:40:00,640 --> 02:40:03,270
I mean, why are you going to fill that
and not come up here?

5872
02:40:03,270 --> 02:40:03,280
and not come up here?
 

5873
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:04,710
and not come up here?
It looks like that's what they're going

5874
02:40:04,710 --> 02:40:04,720
It looks like that's what they're going
 

5875
02:40:04,720 --> 02:40:06,230
It looks like that's what they're going
to do. We're going to slam back down to

5876
02:40:06,230 --> 02:40:06,240
to do. We're going to slam back down to
 

5877
02:40:06,240 --> 02:40:22,230
to do. We're going to slam back down to
30s now, are we?

5878
02:40:22,230 --> 02:40:22,240

 

5879
02:40:22,240 --> 02:40:24,870

Jesus Christ. Go in a 20 point rotation

5880
02:40:24,870 --> 02:40:24,880
Jesus Christ. Go in a 20 point rotation
 

5881
02:40:24,880 --> 02:40:29,830
Jesus Christ. Go in a 20 point rotation
again for another 20 minutes.

5882
02:40:29,830 --> 02:40:29,840

 

5883
02:40:29,840 --> 02:40:36,150

Are we going to do this again?

5884
02:40:36,150 --> 02:40:36,160

 

5885
02:40:36,160 --> 02:41:08,710

So done.

5886
02:41:08,710 --> 02:41:08,720

 

5887
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:11,831

Oh my gosh.

5888
02:41:11,831 --> 02:41:11,841
Oh my gosh.
 

5889
02:41:11,841 --> 02:41:22,950
Oh my gosh.
[snorts]

5890
02:41:22,950 --> 02:41:22,960

 

5891
02:41:22,960 --> 02:41:24,630

All right. Well, Bulls have got to

5892
02:41:24,630 --> 02:41:24,640
All right. Well, Bulls have got to
 

5893
02:41:24,640 --> 02:41:27,429
All right. Well, Bulls have got to
defend this level that they've made up

5894
02:41:27,429 --> 02:41:27,439
defend this level that they've made up
 

5895
02:41:27,439 --> 02:41:30,150
defend this level that they've made up
here now. 420 to 400. That's your

5896
02:41:30,150 --> 02:41:30,160
here now. 420 to 400. That's your
 

5897
02:41:30,160 --> 02:41:31,990
here now. 420 to 400. That's your
overunder. Balls need to defend this.

5898
02:41:31,990 --> 02:41:32,000
overunder. Balls need to defend this.
 

5899
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,389
overunder. Balls need to defend this.
The rotation completion is up here. They

5900
02:41:34,389 --> 02:41:34,399
The rotation completion is up here. They
 

5901
02:41:34,399 --> 02:41:36,469
The rotation completion is up here. They
don't do that. I don't see what the

5902
02:41:36,469 --> 02:41:36,479
don't do that. I don't see what the
 

5903
02:41:36,479 --> 02:41:38,150
don't do that. I don't see what the
point in today was. If you're going to

5904
02:41:38,150 --> 02:41:38,160
point in today was. If you're going to
 

5905
02:41:38,160 --> 02:41:39,670
point in today was. If you're going to
drift higher, get this close to a gap

5906
02:41:39,670 --> 02:41:39,680
drift higher, get this close to a gap
 

5907
02:41:39,680 --> 02:41:41,590
drift higher, get this close to a gap
fill and not do it. I don't really

5908
02:41:41,590 --> 02:41:41,600
fill and not do it. I don't really
 

5909
02:41:41,600 --> 02:41:43,270
fill and not do it. I don't really
understand what the point in any of this

5910
02:41:43,270 --> 02:41:43,280
understand what the point in any of this
 

5911
02:41:43,280 --> 02:41:45,990
understand what the point in any of this
is at that point. We need them to fill

5912
02:41:45,990 --> 02:41:46,000
is at that point. We need them to fill
 

5913
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,150
is at that point. We need them to fill
it. So, that allows us to have a better

5914
02:41:48,150 --> 02:41:48,160
it. So, that allows us to have a better
 

5915
02:41:48,160 --> 02:41:49,750
it. So, that allows us to have a better
trade tomorrow because I'm not

5916
02:41:49,750 --> 02:41:49,760
trade tomorrow because I'm not
 

5917
02:41:49,760 --> 02:41:51,190
trade tomorrow because I'm not
interested in trading this shite

5918
02:41:51,190 --> 02:41:51,200
interested in trading this shite
 

5919
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:58,070
interested in trading this shite
tomorrow.

5920
02:41:58,070 --> 02:41:58,080

 

5921
02:41:58,080 --> 02:41:59,910

They're going to come back 420 now. Are

5922
02:41:59,910 --> 02:41:59,920
They're going to come back 420 now. Are
 

5923
02:41:59,920 --> 02:42:10,230
They're going to come back 420 now. Are
they come and test these 420s?

5924
02:42:10,230 --> 02:42:10,240

 

5925
02:42:10,240 --> 02:42:12,710

Yeah, I'm going to come back 420. That's

5926
02:42:12,710 --> 02:42:12,720
Yeah, I'm going to come back 420. That's
 

5927
02:42:12,720 --> 02:42:15,750
Yeah, I'm going to come back 420. That's
what I want to do at the moment.

5928
02:42:15,750 --> 02:42:15,760
what I want to do at the moment.
 

5929
02:42:15,760 --> 02:42:32,150
what I want to do at the moment.
Bidding down there.

5930
02:42:32,150 --> 02:42:32,160

 

5931
02:42:32,160 --> 02:42:34,150

and we said Tesla that 180 is definitely

5932
02:42:34,150 --> 02:42:34,160
and we said Tesla that 180 is definitely
 

5933
02:42:34,160 --> 02:42:35,830
and we said Tesla that 180 is definitely
the level they can't get through it.

5934
02:42:35,830 --> 02:42:35,840
the level they can't get through it.
 

5935
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:48,389
the level they can't get through it.
They front run it again.

5936
02:42:48,389 --> 02:42:48,399

 

5937
02:42:48,399 --> 02:42:50,630

There you go. Here's that move to 425

5938
02:42:50,630 --> 02:42:50,640
There you go. Here's that move to 425
 

5939
02:42:50,640 --> 02:42:57,190
There you go. Here's that move to 425
420 that we just talked about.

5940
02:42:57,190 --> 02:42:57,200

 

5941
02:42:57,200 --> 02:42:59,030

And this is the decision point. Balls

5942
02:42:59,030 --> 02:42:59,040
And this is the decision point. Balls
 

5943
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:00,469
And this is the decision point. Balls
need to defend this. Failing to defend

5944
02:43:00,469 --> 02:43:00,479
need to defend this. Failing to defend
 

5945
02:43:00,479 --> 02:43:03,030
need to defend this. Failing to defend
this will open up a bit bigger wash.

5946
02:43:03,030 --> 02:43:03,040
this will open up a bit bigger wash.
 

5947
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:05,110
this will open up a bit bigger wash.
This is the level that they must defend

5948
02:43:05,110 --> 02:43:05,120
This is the level that they must defend
 

5949
02:43:05,120 --> 02:43:14,309
This is the level that they must defend
at this point. They got to defend this.

5950
02:43:14,309 --> 02:43:14,319

 

5951
02:43:14,319 --> 02:43:17,030

I just don't understand

5952
02:43:17,030 --> 02:43:17,040
I just don't understand
 

5953
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:18,630
I just don't understand
why you would do all this work to not

5954
02:43:18,630 --> 02:43:18,640
why you would do all this work to not
 

5955
02:43:18,640 --> 02:43:20,790
why you would do all this work to not
fill the gap. Surely you're going to

5956
02:43:20,790 --> 02:43:20,800
fill the gap. Surely you're going to
 

5957
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:22,950
fill the gap. Surely you're going to
fill the gap. You've done all this work

5958
02:43:22,950 --> 02:43:22,960
fill the gap. You've done all this work
 

5959
02:43:22,960 --> 02:43:27,429
fill the gap. You've done all this work
of absorbing it all day long.

5960
02:43:27,429 --> 02:43:27,439
of absorbing it all day long.
 

5961
02:43:27,439 --> 02:43:34,550
of absorbing it all day long.
Surely you're going to go for gap fill.

5962
02:43:34,550 --> 02:43:34,560

 

5963
02:43:34,560 --> 02:43:35,990

Doesn't look like the auction's finished

5964
02:43:35,990 --> 02:43:36,000
Doesn't look like the auction's finished
 

5965
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,710
Doesn't look like the auction's finished
to me at the high either.

5966
02:43:38,710 --> 02:43:38,720
to me at the high either.
 

5967
02:43:38,720 --> 02:43:39,990
to me at the high either.
Don't think there's a buyer stuck at

5968
02:43:39,990 --> 02:43:40,000
Don't think there's a buyer stuck at
 

5969
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:41,429
Don't think there's a buyer stuck at
higher day. There was some big buying up

5970
02:43:41,429 --> 02:43:41,439
higher day. There was some big buying up
 

5971
02:43:41,439 --> 02:43:42,710
higher day. There was some big buying up
there, but it doesn't seem like he's

5972
02:43:42,710 --> 02:43:42,720
there, but it doesn't seem like he's
 

5973
02:43:42,720 --> 02:43:46,413
there, but it doesn't seem like he's
stuck yet.

5974
02:43:46,413 --> 02:43:46,423

 

5975
02:43:46,423 --> 02:43:48,870

[sighs] Apple now green, Amazon green,

5976
02:43:48,870 --> 02:43:48,880
[sighs] Apple now green, Amazon green,
 

5977
02:43:48,880 --> 02:43:50,630
[sighs] Apple now green, Amazon green,
Nvidia green, but still not through that

5978
02:43:50,630 --> 02:43:50,640
Nvidia green, but still not through that
 

5979
02:43:50,640 --> 02:43:53,110
Nvidia green, but still not through that
180. That's the level I'd say. 180.

5980
02:43:53,110 --> 02:43:53,120
180. That's the level I'd say. 180.
 

5981
02:43:53,120 --> 02:44:01,750
180. That's the level I'd say. 180.
That's the level.

5982
02:44:01,750 --> 02:44:01,760

 

5983
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:03,030

Yeah, I'm all right. I'm just low on

Yeah, I'm all right. I'm just low on
 

5985

Yeah, I'm all right. I'm just low on
energy. I would have liked another trade

5986
02:44:04,870 --> 02:44:04,880
energy. I would have liked another trade
 

5987
02:44:04,880 --> 02:44:10,150
energy. I would have liked another trade
today really, but

5988
02:44:10,150 --> 02:44:10,160

 

5989
02:44:10,160 --> 02:44:35,110

The tape just looks very slow.

02:44:35,110 --> 02:44:35,120

 

5991
02:44:35,120 --> 02:44:36,469

What you're saying doesn't actually make

5992
02:44:36,469 --> 02:44:36,479
What you're saying doesn't actually make
 

5993
02:44:36,479 --> 02:44:38,309
What you're saying doesn't actually make
sense. You just said you're a permable.

5994
02:44:38,309 --> 02:44:38,319
sense. You just said you're a permable.
 

5995
02:44:38,319 --> 02:44:39,990
sense. You just said you're a permable.
Then you said I didn't say I'm long now.

5996
02:44:39,990 --> 02:44:40,000
Then you said I didn't say I'm long now.
 

5997
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,309
Then you said I didn't say I'm long now.
I don't short markets. I'm only longs.

5998
02:44:42,309 --> 02:44:42,319
I don't short markets. I'm only longs.
 

5999

I don't short markets. I'm only longs.
So what? You day trade and you're only

6000
02:44:44,230 --> 02:44:44,240
So what? You day trade and you're only
 

6001
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:46,710
So what? You day trade and you're only
long. It's going to make your life quite

6002
02:44:46,710 --> 02:44:46,720
long. It's going to make your life quite
 

6003
02:44:46,720 --> 02:44:50,469
long. It's going to make your life quite
hard.

02:44:50,469 --> 02:44:50,479

 

6005
02:44:50,479 --> 02:44:51,990

Or are you swing trading and you're only

6006
02:44:51,990 --> 02:44:52,000
Or are you swing trading and you're only
 

6007
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,469
Or are you swing trading and you're only
long? That makes sense to me. That

6008
02:44:54,469 --> 02:44:54,479
long? That makes sense to me. That
 

6009
02:44:54,479 --> 02:45:09,670
long? That makes sense to me. That
definitely makes sense.

02:49:37,510 --> 02:49:37,520
it's like three days worth of volume. So
 

6141
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:40,550
it's like three days worth of volume. So
Monday the 10th, Tuesday the 11th,

6142
02:49:40,550 --> 02:49:40,560
Monday the 10th, Tuesday the 11th,
 

6143
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:43,110
Monday the 10th, Tuesday the 11th,
Wednesday the 12th, and some volume from

6144
02:49:43,110 --> 02:49:43,120
Wednesday the 12th, and some volume from
 

6145
02:49:43,120 --> 02:49:44,950
Wednesday the 12th, and some volume from
Thursday the 13th. All right. So we

6146
02:49:44,950 --> 02:49:44,960
Thursday the 13th. All right. So we
 

6147
02:49:44,960 --> 02:49:46,309
Thursday the 13th. All right. So we
basically got three, let's just call it

6148
02:49:46,309 --> 02:49:46,319
basically got three, let's just call it
 

6149
02:49:46,319 --> 02:49:48,389
basically got three, let's just call it
three and a bit days of volume are

6150
02:49:48,389 --> 02:49:48,399
three and a bit days of volume are
 

6151
02:49:48,399 --> 02:49:52,070
three and a bit days of volume are
hanging out from 500 to 800. That's

6152
02:49:52,070 --> 02:49:52,080
hanging out from 500 to 800. That's
 

6153
02:49:52,080 --> 02:49:54,150
hanging out from 500 to 800. That's
where the sellers are. I'm not uber

6154
02:49:54,150 --> 02:49:54,160
where the sellers are. I'm not uber
 

6155
02:49:54,160 --> 02:49:55,830
where the sellers are. I'm not uber
bullish like some of you until we

6156
02:49:55,830 --> 02:49:55,840
bullish like some of you until we
 

6157
02:49:55,840 --> 02:49:57,830
bullish like some of you until we
reclaim that level because every time

6158
02:49:57,830 --> 02:49:57,840
reclaim that level because every time
 

6159
02:49:57,840 --> 02:49:59,429
reclaim that level because every time
we've come into there we have a two

6160
02:49:59,429 --> 02:49:59,439
we've come into there we have a two
 

6161
02:49:59,439 --> 02:50:01,110
we've come into there we have a two
weeks worth of balance range where we're

6162
02:50:01,110 --> 02:50:01,120
weeks worth of balance range where we're
 

6163
02:50:01,120 --> 02:50:03,590
weeks worth of balance range where we're
very very thick up there and everyone

6164
02:50:03,590 --> 02:50:03,600
very very thick up there and everyone
 

6165
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:07,190
very very thick up there and everyone
above 900 is still stuck. So all the

6166
02:50:07,190 --> 02:50:07,200
above 900 is still stuck. So all the
 

6167
02:50:07,200 --> 02:50:09,269
above 900 is still stuck. So all the
bulls are still stuck over 900. So I'm

6168
02:50:09,269 --> 02:50:09,279
bulls are still stuck over 900. So I'm
 

6169
02:50:09,279 --> 02:50:11,269
bulls are still stuck over 900. So I'm
not uber bullish until we get back

6170
02:50:11,269 --> 02:50:11,279
not uber bullish until we get back
 

6171
02:50:11,279 --> 02:50:13,990
not uber bullish until we get back
through these levels above back through

6172
02:50:13,990 --> 02:50:14,000
through these levels above back through
 

6173
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:15,429
through these levels above back through
here. All right. Every time we've come

6174
02:50:15,429 --> 02:50:15,439
here. All right. Every time we've come
 

6175
02:50:15,439 --> 02:50:17,910
here. All right. Every time we've come
up here we have got stuck. So that's

6176
02:50:17,910 --> 02:50:17,920
up here we have got stuck. So that's
 

6177
02:50:17,920 --> 02:50:19,830
up here we have got stuck. So that's
what I'm watching. I think they're going

6178
02:50:19,830 --> 02:50:19,840
what I'm watching. I think they're going
 

6179
02:50:19,840 --> 02:50:22,070
what I'm watching. I think they're going
to sell these again. I think we need a

6180
02:50:22,070 --> 02:50:22,080
to sell these again. I think we need a
 

6181
02:50:22,080 --> 02:50:23,990
to sell these again. I think we need a
deeper pullback probably back down to

6182
02:50:23,990 --> 02:50:24,000
deeper pullback probably back down to
 

6183
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:25,910
deeper pullback probably back down to
24,900s

6184
02:50:25,910 --> 02:50:25,920
24,900s
 

6185
02:50:25,920 --> 02:50:28,630
24,900s
and a hold of that. And if we hold that,

6186
02:50:28,630 --> 02:50:28,640
and a hold of that. And if we hold that,
 

6187
02:50:28,640 --> 02:50:29,990
and a hold of that. And if we hold that,
that looks a bit better. So, that's

6188
02:50:29,990 --> 02:50:30,000
that looks a bit better. So, that's
 

6189
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:34,710
that looks a bit better. So, that's
where my thoughts are for the week. Um,

6190
02:50:34,710 --> 02:50:34,720
where my thoughts are for the week. Um,
 

6191
02:50:34,720 --> 02:50:36,630
where my thoughts are for the week. Um,
I don't make anything of it, TJ, because

6192
02:50:36,630 --> 02:50:36,640
I don't make anything of it, TJ, because
 

6193
02:50:36,640 --> 02:50:38,070
I don't make anything of it, TJ, because
I think the volume's so low. I think

6194
02:50:38,070 --> 02:50:38,080
I think the volume's so low. I think
 

6195
02:50:38,080 --> 02:50:42,070
I think the volume's so low. I think
it's kind of inconsequential, but uh

6196
02:50:42,070 --> 02:50:42,080
it's kind of inconsequential, but uh
 

6197
02:50:42,080 --> 02:50:44,550
it's kind of inconsequential, but uh
yeah, we haven't made

6198
02:50:44,550 --> 02:50:44,560
yeah, we haven't made
 

6199
02:50:44,560 --> 02:50:46,710
yeah, we haven't made
higher highs on the cumulative delta all

6200
02:50:46,710 --> 02:50:46,720
higher highs on the cumulative delta all
 

6201
02:50:46,720 --> 02:50:48,309
higher highs on the cumulative delta all
morning really since, you know, that

6202
02:50:48,309 --> 02:50:48,319
morning really since, you know, that
 

6203
02:50:48,319 --> 02:50:51,990
morning really since, you know, that
10:30 push. So I I don't like I said I

6204
02:50:51,990 --> 02:50:52,000
10:30 push. So I I don't like I said I
 

6205
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:53,750
10:30 push. So I I don't like I said I
think with such a low volume day I think

6206
02:50:53,750 --> 02:50:53,760
think with such a low volume day I think
 

6207
02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:55,510
think with such a low volume day I think
it's easy to just move stuff around. I'm

6208
02:50:55,510 --> 02:50:55,520
it's easy to just move stuff around. I'm
 

6209
02:50:55,520 --> 02:50:58,309
it's easy to just move stuff around. I'm
more interested how we operate

6210
02:50:58,309 --> 02:50:58,319
more interested how we operate
 

6211
02:50:58,319 --> 02:51:00,230
more interested how we operate
the rest of the week. All right. So

6212
02:51:00,230 --> 02:51:00,240
the rest of the week. All right. So
 

6213
02:51:00,240 --> 02:51:01,830
the rest of the week. All right. So
hopefully we fill this gap. Really don't

6214
02:51:01,830 --> 02:51:01,840
hopefully we fill this gap. Really don't
 

6215
02:51:01,840 --> 02:51:03,349
hopefully we fill this gap. Really don't
want to leave that open. That makes

6216
02:51:03,349 --> 02:51:03,359
want to leave that open. That makes
 

6217
02:51:03,359 --> 02:51:04,950
want to leave that open. That makes
tomorrow a pain in the butt if we leave

6218
02:51:04,950 --> 02:51:04,960
tomorrow a pain in the butt if we leave
 

6219
02:51:04,960 --> 02:51:08,150
tomorrow a pain in the butt if we leave
that open. If we can leave that open

6220
02:51:08,150 --> 02:51:08,160
that open. If we can leave that open
 

6221
02:51:08,160 --> 02:51:10,309
that open. If we can leave that open
what I'd be looking at this week. Very

6222
02:51:10,309 --> 02:51:10,319
what I'd be looking at this week. Very
 

6223
02:51:10,319 --> 02:51:12,070
what I'd be looking at this week. Very
simple.

6224
02:51:12,070 --> 02:51:12,080
simple.
 

6225
02:51:12,080 --> 02:51:13,990
simple.
Right. Here's your two weeks balance

6226
02:51:13,990 --> 02:51:14,000
Right. Here's your two weeks balance
 

6227
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,309
Right. Here's your two weeks balance
range. You can see right buyers are

6228
02:51:16,309 --> 02:51:16,319
range. You can see right buyers are
 

6229
02:51:16,319 --> 02:51:19,110
range. You can see right buyers are
trapped up here. No doubt about it. This

6230
02:51:19,110 --> 02:51:19,120
trapped up here. No doubt about it. This
 

6231
02:51:19,120 --> 02:51:21,990
trapped up here. No doubt about it. This
is the range. All right. If sellers

6232
02:51:21,990 --> 02:51:22,000
is the range. All right. If sellers
 

6233
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,150
is the range. All right. If sellers
defend this, then we're looking for that

6234
02:51:24,150 --> 02:51:24,160
defend this, then we're looking for that
 

6235
02:51:24,160 --> 02:51:26,389
defend this, then we're looking for that
rotation down to here. If we come down

6236
02:51:26,389 --> 02:51:26,399
rotation down to here. If we come down
 

6237
02:51:26,399 --> 02:51:28,469
rotation down to here. If we come down
here first, then we're looking for that

6238
02:51:28,469 --> 02:51:28,479
here first, then we're looking for that
 

6239
02:51:28,479 --> 02:51:30,469
here first, then we're looking for that
rotation up. So, there's a move here and

6240
02:51:30,469 --> 02:51:30,479
rotation up. So, there's a move here and
 

6241
02:51:30,479 --> 02:51:33,510
rotation up. So, there's a move here and
here. There's a move here and here. If

6242
02:51:33,510 --> 02:51:33,520
here. There's a move here and here. If
 

6243
02:51:33,520 --> 02:51:35,110
here. There's a move here and here. If
we lose this level, it's good night,

6244
02:51:35,110 --> 02:51:35,120
we lose this level, it's good night,
 

6245
02:51:35,120 --> 02:51:37,190
we lose this level, it's good night,
sweetheart. All right. So, that's what

6246
02:51:37,190 --> 02:51:37,200
sweetheart. All right. So, that's what
 

6247
02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:38,630
sweetheart. All right. So, that's what
I'm thinking about this week. I think

6248
02:51:38,630 --> 02:51:38,640
I'm thinking about this week. I think
 

6249
02:51:38,640 --> 02:51:41,030
I'm thinking about this week. I think
we're going to do some rotation from

6250
02:51:41,030 --> 02:51:41,040
we're going to do some rotation from
 

6251
02:51:41,040 --> 02:51:44,630
we're going to do some rotation from
here to where was it? Here. I think this

6252
02:51:44,630 --> 02:51:44,640
here to where was it? Here. I think this
 

6253
02:51:44,640 --> 02:51:46,790
here to where was it? Here. I think this
is the game plan for the week. Build

6254
02:51:46,790 --> 02:51:46,800
is the game plan for the week. Build
 

6255
02:51:46,800 --> 02:51:49,590
is the game plan for the week. Build
liquidity in here. If we hold this is

6256
02:51:49,590 --> 02:51:49,600
liquidity in here. If we hold this is
 

6257
02:51:49,600 --> 02:51:51,190
liquidity in here. If we hold this is
very bullish because we're probably

6258
02:51:51,190 --> 02:51:51,200
very bullish because we're probably
 

6259
02:51:51,200 --> 02:51:52,950
very bullish because we're probably
letting them out. But if we look and

6260
02:51:52,950 --> 02:51:52,960
letting them out. But if we look and
 

6261
02:51:52,960 --> 02:51:54,710
letting them out. But if we look and
fail down to here is bullish from here

6262
02:51:54,710 --> 02:51:54,720
fail down to here is bullish from here
 

6263
02:51:54,720 --> 02:51:56,550
fail down to here is bullish from here
back up. That's what I'm looking at for

6264
02:51:56,550 --> 02:51:56,560
back up. That's what I'm looking at for
 

6265
02:51:56,560 --> 02:51:58,469
back up. That's what I'm looking at for
the week. I'm not thinking beyond that.

6266
02:51:58,469 --> 02:51:58,479
the week. I'm not thinking beyond that.
 

6267
02:51:58,479 --> 02:51:59,830
the week. I'm not thinking beyond that.
I'm not thinking about anything else

6268
02:51:59,830 --> 02:51:59,840
I'm not thinking about anything else
 

6269
02:51:59,840 --> 02:52:02,630
I'm not thinking about anything else
beyond that. Um volume's telling the

6270
02:52:02,630 --> 02:52:02,640
beyond that. Um volume's telling the
 

6271
02:52:02,640 --> 02:52:04,309
beyond that. Um volume's telling the
tape.

6272
02:52:04,309 --> 02:52:04,319
tape.
 

6273
02:52:04,319 --> 02:52:07,510
tape.
That is very very thick but it's not

6274
02:52:07,510 --> 02:52:07,520
That is very very thick but it's not
 

6275
02:52:07,520 --> 02:52:10,309
That is very very thick but it's not
fresh right because we've come into it

6276
02:52:10,309 --> 02:52:10,319
fresh right because we've come into it
 

6277
02:52:10,319 --> 02:52:13,510
fresh right because we've come into it
once, twice, three times, third visit

6278
02:52:13,510 --> 02:52:13,520
once, twice, three times, third visit
 

6279
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:15,990
once, twice, three times, third visit
into it. So this this is the area how we

6280
02:52:15,990 --> 02:52:16,000
into it. So this this is the area how we
 

6281
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,309
into it. So this this is the area how we
react there probably dictates what

6282
02:52:18,309 --> 02:52:18,319
react there probably dictates what
 

6283
02:52:18,319 --> 02:52:19,590
react there probably dictates what
happens for the rest of the year to be

6284
02:52:19,590 --> 02:52:19,600
happens for the rest of the year to be
 

6285
02:52:19,600 --> 02:52:22,630
happens for the rest of the year to be
honest into January. Reclaim that. Yeah,

6286
02:52:22,630 --> 02:52:22,640
honest into January. Reclaim that. Yeah,
 

6287
02:52:22,640 --> 02:52:23,910
honest into January. Reclaim that. Yeah,
we're going to make new highs. No doubt

6288
02:52:23,910 --> 02:52:23,920
we're going to make new highs. No doubt
 

6289
02:52:23,920 --> 02:52:25,269
we're going to make new highs. No doubt
about it. We reclaim that we're making

6290

new highs.
 

6293
02:52:27,760 --> 02:52:30,790
new highs.
All right. Uh that'll be that then.

6294
02:52:30,790 --> 02:52:30,800
All right. Uh that'll be that then.

Hopefully they fill this gap because I
 

6299
02:52:34,319 --> 02:52:35,910
Hopefully they fill this gap because I
don't want to leave an imbalance to go

6300
02:52:35,910 --> 02:52:35,920
don't want to leave an imbalance to go
 

6301
02:52:35,920 --> 02:52:37,510
don't want to leave an imbalance to go
into tomorrow. If they can fill this

6302
02:52:37,510 --> 02:52:37,520
into tomorrow. If they can fill this
 

6303
02:52:37,520 --> 02:52:38,790
into tomorrow. If they can fill this
after doing all that work today, at

6304
02:52:38,790 --> 02:52:38,800
after doing all that work today, at
 

6305
02:52:38,800 --> 02:52:41,510
after doing all that work today, at
least we've been efficient and we can

6306
02:52:41,510 --> 02:52:41,520

6307
02:52:41,520 --> 02:52:44,469

see what we get tomorrow. Um, that's it.

02:52:49,590 --> 02:52:49,600
volume here being traded. I think one of
 

6315
02:52:49,600 --> 02:52:51,030

says, if he spooks the market or if he

6322
02:52:56,790 --> 02:52:56,800

actually pivots to being dovish like the
