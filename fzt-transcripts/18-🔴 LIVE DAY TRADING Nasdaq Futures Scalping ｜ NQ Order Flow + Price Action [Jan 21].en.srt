00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
Ballinger. Very rare to see us trade
 

55
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,270
Ballinger. Very rare to see us trade
under the daily Ballinger without

under the daily Ballinger without
 

57
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,790
under the daily Ballinger without
normally trying to trade inside. We're

58
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
normally trying to trade inside. We're
 

59
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,150

What is the key pivot? Key pivot very

00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
What is the key pivot? Key pivot very
 

63
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,790
What is the key pivot? Key pivot very
clearly here, isn't it? Into these 900s.

64

65
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,950
clearly here, isn't it? Into these 900s.
All right, this is the big pivot that

66
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:50,960
All right, this is the big pivot that
 

67
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,670
All right, this is the big pivot that
we've been talking about. We might well

68
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:53,680
we've been talking about. We might well
 

69
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,670
we've been talking about. We might well
need to build out some liquidity here

70
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
need to build out some liquidity here
 

71
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,350
need to build out some liquidity here
and let these Ballingers and the

72
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
and let these Ballingers and the
 

73
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,790
and let these Ballingers and the
fiveday, you can see the fiveday cross

74
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
fiveday, you can see the fiveday cross
 

75
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,869
fiveday, you can see the fiveday cross
and everything start to trend down to

76
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
and everything start to trend down to
 

77
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,029
and everything start to trend down to
play catch up if we're going to come for

78
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
play catch up if we're going to come for
 

79
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,950
play catch up if we're going to come for
these. It's very possible that we need

80
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
these. It's very possible that we need
 

81
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,029
these. It's very possible that we need
to do that. Maybe not. Maybe the market

82
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
to do that. Maybe not. Maybe the market
 

83
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,469
to do that. Maybe not. Maybe the market
doesn't like what it hears today and we

84
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
doesn't like what it hears today and we
 

85
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,390
doesn't like what it hears today and we
just go continuation straight straight

86
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
just go continuation straight straight
 

87
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,150
just go continuation straight straight
away. We're going to find out, but we're

88
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
away. We're going to find out, but we're
 

89
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,430
away. We're going to find out, but we're
going to have to like respect some of

90
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
going to have to like respect some of
 

91
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,350
going to have to like respect some of
these levels. We're going to see more of

92
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
these levels. We're going to see more of
 

93
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,189
these levels. We're going to see more of
these levels on the hourlys. All right,

94
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199
these levels on the hourlys. All right,
 

95
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,790
these levels on the hourlys. All right,
so let's move into the hourlys. Let's

96
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
so let's move into the hourlys. Let's
 

97
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,990
so let's move into the hourlys. Let's
have a look at what we're doing with

98
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000
have a look at what we're doing with
 

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,390
have a look at what we're doing with
value. All

100
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
value. All
 

101
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,869
value. All
right, here we go. So, this profile here

102
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:24,879
right, here we go. So, this profile here
 

103
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,029
right, here we go. So, this profile here
is the current week developing profile.

104
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
is the current week developing profile.
 

105
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,629
is the current week developing profile.
It's really important you zoom out and

106
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
It's really important you zoom out and
 

107
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,029
It's really important you zoom out and
look at where we are trying to reclaim,

108
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
look at where we are trying to reclaim,
 

109
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,110
look at where we are trying to reclaim,
where we lost a bid, all these key

110
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
where we lost a bid, all these key
 

111
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,990
where we lost a bid, all these key
levels. But yesterday's profile, if we

112
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
levels. But yesterday's profile, if we
 

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,230
levels. But yesterday's profile, if we
think about value yesterday, previous

114
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
think about value yesterday, previous
 

115
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,949
think about value yesterday, previous
day value area low is 240. We can see in

116
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:40,959
day value area low is 240. We can see in
 

117
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,469
day value area low is 240. We can see in
this developing profile, we have a

118
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
this developing profile, we have a
 

119
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,470
this developing profile, we have a
couple of very thick areas here. I'd say

120
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
couple of very thick areas here. I'd say
 

121
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,190
couple of very thick areas here. I'd say
it starts basically 200 all the way up

122
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
it starts basically 200 all the way up
 

123
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,710
it starts basically 200 all the way up
into these uh what's the edge of this

124
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
into these uh what's the edge of this
 

125
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,190
into these uh what's the edge of this
225 and then we get thin um into sort of

126
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
225 and then we get thin um into sort of
 

127
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,190
225 and then we get thin um into sort of
230. So what I'm looking at this morning

128
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
230. So what I'm looking at this morning
 

129
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,990
230. So what I'm looking at this morning
is is price

130
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
is is price
 

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,230
is is price
going to respect these levels? Is it

132
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
going to respect these levels? Is it
 

133
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,470
going to respect these levels? Is it
going to respect previous day value area

134
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
going to respect previous day value area
 

135
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,230
going to respect previous day value area
low? If so, is there like a little look

136
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
low? If so, is there like a little look
 

137
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,310
low? If so, is there like a little look
above and fail back under and then this

138
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
above and fail back under and then this
 

139
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,590
above and fail back under and then this
trade back down and we're going to

140
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
trade back down and we're going to
 

141
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,430
trade back down and we're going to
respect this node here and if we find

142
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
respect this node here and if we find
 

143
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,430
respect this node here and if we find
acceptance then we move lower. That's

144
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
acceptance then we move lower. That's
 

145
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,110
acceptance then we move lower. That's
one thing we could consider. If not, if

146
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
one thing we could consider. If not, if
 

147
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,509
one thing we could consider. If not, if
this is a failed auction lower, if we're

148
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
this is a failed auction lower, if we're
 

149
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,430
this is a failed auction lower, if we're
not willing to trade underneath and

150
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
not willing to trade underneath and
 

151
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,670
not willing to trade underneath and
we're going to reclaim and base here at

152
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
we're going to reclaim and base here at
 

153
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,910
we're going to reclaim and base here at
sort of 225, 230, 240, 250, then we can

154
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
sort of 225, 230, 240, 250, then we can
 

155
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,110
sort of 225, 230, 240, 250, then we can
expect this rotation up into 350 for

156
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
expect this rotation up into 350 for
 

157
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,630
expect this rotation up into 350 for
this point of control. So, there's 100

158
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
this point of control. So, there's 100
 

159
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,269
this point of control. So, there's 100
points up for grabs here, right? This

160
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279
points up for grabs here, right? This
 

161
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,870
points up for grabs here, right? This
will be your counter trend play. I want

162
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
will be your counter trend play. I want
 

163
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,389
will be your counter trend play. I want
to make that very, very clear. All

164
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
to make that very, very clear. All
 

165
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,590
to make that very, very clear. All
right, if we think about what the

166
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
right, if we think about what the
 

167
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,389
right, if we think about what the
market's doing since the Sunday open,

168
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:42,399
market's doing since the Sunday open,
 

169
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,630
market's doing since the Sunday open,
all right, we have been moving low, but

170
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
all right, we have been moving low, but
 

171
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,470
all right, we have been moving low, but
if we see this, then this will be

172
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
if we see this, then this will be
 

173
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,630
if we see this, then this will be
compression and you can't rule this out.

174
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:48,640
compression and you can't rule this out.
 

175
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,150
compression and you can't rule this out.
And if they keep going back to the top

176
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,160
And if they keep going back to the top
 

177
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,470
And if they keep going back to the top
side, it's possible, folks. Anything is

178
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,480
side, it's possible, folks. Anything is
 

179
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,910
side, it's possible, folks. Anything is
possible in this market. All right,

180
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
possible in this market. All right,
 

181
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,910
possible in this market. All right,
anything's possible.

182
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
anything's possible.
 

183
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,509
anything's possible.
So, those are the two plays. All right,

184
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
So, those are the two plays. All right,
 

185
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,829
So, those are the two plays. All right,
this level here is key as we come

186
00:09:59,829 --> 00:09:59,839
this level here is key as we come
 

187
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,350
this level here is key as we come
trading into this, which we're already

188
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,360
trading into this, which we're already
 

189
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,350
trading into this, which we're already
doing right now, coming flying into it.

190
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
doing right now, coming flying into it.
 

191
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,710
doing right now, coming flying into it.
This is going to be key. Do we see a

192
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
This is going to be key. Do we see a
 

193
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,470
This is going to be key. Do we see a
rejection here? It might be a look above

194
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
rejection here? It might be a look above
 

195
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,790
rejection here? It might be a look above
and fail. It might be a rejection in

196
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:08,800
and fail. It might be a rejection in
 

197
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,030
and fail. It might be a rejection in
front of it. It might be a reclaim and a

198
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
front of it. It might be a reclaim and a
 

199
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,750
front of it. It might be a reclaim and a
base and hold and up to 350. So those

200
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
base and hold and up to 350. So those
 

201
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,750
base and hold and up to 350. So those
are the two plays I'm looking at for

202
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:15,760
are the two plays I'm looking at for
 

203
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,350
are the two plays I'm looking at for
this morning's session. We can see we've

204
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
this morning's session. We can see we've
 

205
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,949
this morning's session. We can see we've
probably got some imbalances here. If we

206
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
probably got some imbalances here. If we
 

207
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,430
probably got some imbalances here. If we
look above on this 5minute chart, you

208
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440
look above on this 5minute chart, you
 

209
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,630
look above on this 5minute chart, you
can see GloEx kind of went sideways.

210
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:24,640
can see GloEx kind of went sideways.
 

211
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,949
can see GloEx kind of went sideways.
All right, London just peaked above and

212
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
All right, London just peaked above and
 

213
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,949
All right, London just peaked above and
then lost the GlobeEx bid. All right,

214
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
then lost the GlobeEx bid. All right,
 

215
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,550
then lost the GlobeEx bid. All right,
and then there's a big follow through.

216
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
and then there's a big follow through.
 

217
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,310
and then there's a big follow through.
Very similar to here. Peak above, lost

218
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
Very similar to here. Peak above, lost
 

219
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,670
Very similar to here. Peak above, lost
the bid, follow through. Similar to

220
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
the bid, follow through. Similar to
 

221
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,670
the bid, follow through. Similar to
here, peak above, lost the bid, follow

222
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,680
here, peak above, lost the bid, follow
 

223
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,350
here, peak above, lost the bid, follow
through. All right, that's what we're

224
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
through. All right, that's what we're
 

225
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,670
through. All right, that's what we're
seeing. But this is your key pivot. You

226
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
seeing. But this is your key pivot. You
 

227
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,910
seeing. But this is your key pivot. You
can see this developing node here. Very,

228
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920
can see this developing node here. Very,
 

229
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,750
can see this developing node here. Very,
very important.

230
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
very important.
 

231
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,829
very important.
Okay, moving up into the lower time

232
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:45,839
Okay, moving up into the lower time
 

233
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,990
Okay, moving up into the lower time
frames as we're getting very close to

234
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
frames as we're getting very close to
 

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,030
frames as we're getting very close to
some of these key levels here already.

236
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
some of these key levels here already.
 

237
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,710
some of these key levels here already.
And we can just have a quick look. Let's

238
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
And we can just have a quick look. Let's
 

239
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,949
And we can just have a quick look. Let's
move this up to five minute and ES. We

240
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
move this up to five minute and ES. We
 

241
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,630
move this up to five minute and ES. We
can look at the same stuff. Yeah, ES

242
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
can look at the same stuff. Yeah, ES
 

243
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,870
can look at the same stuff. Yeah, ES
already into that New York VW up. Big

244
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:58,880
already into that New York VW up. Big
 

245
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,949
already into that New York VW up. Big
big pivot from yesterday. We can just

246
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
big pivot from yesterday. We can just
 

247
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,069
big pivot from yesterday. We can just
put uh you know what, let's just put one

248
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
put uh you know what, let's just put one
 

249
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,310
put uh you know what, let's just put one
on from

250
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320
on from
 

251
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,269
on from
Sunday on here.

252
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279

 

253
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,790

Okay, that's current week developing.

254
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800
Okay, that's current week developing.
 

255
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,230
Okay, that's current week developing.
Same kind of thing here, folks. All

256
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
Same kind of thing here, folks. All
 

257
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,030
Same kind of thing here, folks. All
right, you can see this node here into

258
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
right, you can see this node here into
 

259
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,670
right, you can see this node here into
sort of 860s. All right, you'd want

260
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,680
sort of 860s. All right, you'd want
 

261
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,670
sort of 860s. All right, you'd want
bears to defend this. You're into a low

262
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
bears to defend this. You're into a low
 

263
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,590
bears to defend this. You're into a low
volume node here. You'd want bears to

264
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
volume node here. You'd want bears to
 

265
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,910
volume node here. You'd want bears to
defend this to cause this downside

266
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
defend this to cause this downside
 

267
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,350
defend this to cause this downside
rotation. That's from what a 60 or 70

268
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
rotation. That's from what a 60 or 70
 

269
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,069
rotation. That's from what a 60 or 70
down to 30. So there's 30 40 points up

270
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
down to 30. So there's 30 40 points up
 

271
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,630
down to 30. So there's 30 40 points up
for grabs there on ES if they reject it.

272
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
for grabs there on ES if they reject it.
 

273
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,790
for grabs there on ES if they reject it.
If you see a reclaim, then the squeeze

274
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
If you see a reclaim, then the squeeze
 

275
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,470
If you see a reclaim, then the squeeze
is on to try and try try and take this

276
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
is on to try and try try and take this
 

277
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,389
is on to try and try try and take this
out. So, same kind of story on it. ES.

278
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:40,399
out. So, same kind of story on it. ES.
 

279
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,310
out. So, same kind of story on it. ES.
If we look at the spiders, they're

280
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
If we look at the spiders, they're
 

281
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,310
If we look at the spiders, they're
matching up nicely. All right. Big gap

282
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
matching up nicely. All right. Big gap
 

283
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,870
matching up nicely. All right. Big gap
down. All right. The question is, do we

284
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
down. All right. The question is, do we
 

285
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,550
down. All right. The question is, do we
see a little poke above and a fail or

286
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
see a little poke above and a fail or
 

287
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,310
see a little poke above and a fail or
are we going to see some of this for the

288
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
are we going to see some of this for the
 

289
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,310
are we going to see some of this for the
rotation back up to here? Gap still

290
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
rotation back up to here? Gap still
 

291
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,550
rotation back up to here? Gap still
open. Of course, cues is going to be

292
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
open. Of course, cues is going to be
 

293
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,389
open. Of course, cues is going to be
exactly the same. There you go. So, you

294
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
exactly the same. There you go. So, you
 

295
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,310
exactly the same. There you go. So, you
see yesterday we lost that pivot. This

296
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
see yesterday we lost that pivot. This
 

297
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,670
see yesterday we lost that pivot. This
is the pivot we were talking about

298
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
is the pivot we were talking about
 

299
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,190
is the pivot we were talking about
fading yesterday. Okay, remember I was

300
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,200
fading yesterday. Okay, remember I was
 

301
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,750
fading yesterday. Okay, remember I was
looking to fade yesterday because we had

302
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
looking to fade yesterday because we had
 

303
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,470
looking to fade yesterday because we had
left value trapped. We had a key pivot.

304
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,480
left value trapped. We had a key pivot.
 

305
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,069
left value trapped. We had a key pivot.
We traded into that. We had three

306
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:10,079
We traded into that. We had three
 

307
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,389
We traded into that. We had three
attempts in the morning session and you

308
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
attempts in the morning session and you
 

309
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,230

these breaks and we're starting to
 

359
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,590
these breaks and we're starting to
really get going now. So, I want to be

careful there. And the 10 and the five,

368
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:16,399
careful there. And the 10 and the five,
 

369
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,790
careful there. And the 10 and the five,
the lower ones, they look all right.

370
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
the lower ones, they look all right.

the lower ones, they look all right.
This is the divergence between the two,

This is the divergence between the two,
 

373
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,550
This is the divergence between the two,
which we commonly see when we go into a

374
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:22,560
which we commonly see when we go into a
 

375
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,994
which we commonly see when we go into a

That's a huge sell. All right, does it

386
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
That's a huge sell. All right, does it
 

387
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,750
That's a huge sell. All right, does it
repric up to 250? Big question mark if

it can do that. All right, and does it

390
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
it can do that. All right, and does it
 

391
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,710
it can do that. All right, and does it
reject here if it does or is it just

392
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
reject here if it does or is it just
 

393
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,310
reject here if it does or is it just
going to do a little twoleg not make it

394
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
going to do a little twoleg not make it
 

395
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,710
going to do a little twoleg not make it
that far and resell down?

396
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720

00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
yesterday's close, but again into
 

403
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,230
yesterday's close, but again into
previous day's action. So, an inside bar

404
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
previous day's action. So, an inside bar
 

405
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,870
previous day's action. So, an inside bar
there on Amazon.

406
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
there on Amazon.
 

407
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,990

failure pre-market trying to trade back
 

411
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,629
failure pre-market trying to trade back
inside yesterday's range. So, possibly

412
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
inside yesterday's range. So, possibly
 

413
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,870
inside yesterday's range. So, possibly
an inside bar there. Meta definitely an

414
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880

Nvidia. It's a nice push off the lows
 

421
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,509
Nvidia. It's a nice push off the lows
again inside bar. You got to watch these

422
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519
again inside bar. You got to watch these
 

423
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,949
again inside bar. You got to watch these
levels into uh 80, let's call it 82 and

424
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:24,959
levels into uh 80, let's call it 82 and
 

425
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,470
levels into uh 80, let's call it 82 and
83s are the levels to watch from Nvidia

426
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:28,480
83s are the levels to watch from Nvidia
 

427
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,269
83s are the levels to watch from Nvidia
and tests are the same um straight back

428
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
and tests are the same um straight back
 

429
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,670
and tests are the same um straight back
inside. So all of them trading an inside

430
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
inside. So all of them trading an inside
 

431
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,350
inside. So all of them trading an inside
bar right now. All right. So the

432
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360
bar right now. All right. So the
 

433
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,990
bar right now. All right. So the
question is do any of them have follow

434
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
question is do any of them have follow
 

435
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,509
question is do any of them have follow
through downside or are they going to

436
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:39,519
through downside or are they going to
 

437
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,189
through downside or are they going to
reclaim and come and test the top of the

438
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
reclaim and come and test the top of the
 

439
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,189
reclaim and come and test the top of the
range created yesterday? Equally

440
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
range created yesterday? Equally
 

441
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,949
range created yesterday? Equally
weighted.

442
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:48,959

 

443
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,030

Yeah, equally weighted. Same story. All

444
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,040
Yeah, equally weighted. Same story. All
 

445
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,829
Yeah, equally weighted. Same story. All
right, here's yesterday's close. Here's

446
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
right, here's yesterday's close. Here's
 

447
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,750
right, here's yesterday's close. Here's
yesterday's highs. Here's yesterday's

448
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
yesterday's highs. Here's yesterday's
 

449
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,069
yesterday's highs. Here's yesterday's
bar. And we are trading probably near

450
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:58,079
bar. And we are trading probably near
 

451
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,670
bar. And we are trading probably near
the midpoint of it right now. So, coming

452
00:14:59,670 --> 00:14:59,680
the midpoint of it right now. So, coming
 

453
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,629
the midpoint of it right now. So, coming
into some interesting levels and Netflix

454
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
into some interesting levels and Netflix
 

455
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,230
into some interesting levels and Netflix

going to start accumulating a very, very
 

461
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,550
going to start accumulating a very, very
small net. Like I've said to my team,

462
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
small net. Like I've said to my team,
 

463
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,189
small net. Like I've said to my team,
I'm waiting to see if we offer a bigger

I'm waiting to see if we offer a bigger
 

465
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,949
I'm waiting to see if we offer a bigger
flush down into these pivots and if

466
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959
flush down into these pivots and if
 

467
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,230
flush down into these pivots and if
there's something worth scooping up

468
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,240
there's something worth scooping up
 

469
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,790
there's something worth scooping up
under there. But I've just got like my

470
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
under there. But I've just got like my
 

471
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,389
under there. But I've just got like my
feet wet at the moment. I'm just waiting

472
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
feet wet at the moment. I'm just waiting
 

473
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,949
feet wet at the moment. I'm just waiting
to see how we respond. We're already 40%

474
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:22,959
to see how we respond. We're already 40%
 

475
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,030
to see how we respond. We're already 40%
off the highs. I just want to see if

476
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,040
off the highs. I just want to see if
 

477
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,470
off the highs. I just want to see if
there's a flush moment if the market

478
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:26,480
there's a flush moment if the market
 

479
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,829
there's a flush moment if the market
starts to get heavy and I can pick up

480
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:27,839
starts to get heavy and I can pick up
 

481
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,750
starts to get heavy and I can pick up
some cheap long term. I'm talking years

482
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:29,760
some cheap long term. I'm talking years
 

483
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,069
some cheap long term. I'm talking years
and years and years looking to hold for

484
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:32,079
and years and years looking to hold for
 

485
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,629
and years and years looking to hold for
this. And um yeah, that's pretty much

486
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:34,639
this. And um yeah, that's pretty much
 

487
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,310
this. And um yeah, that's pretty much
it, folks. If we look uh the broader

488
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320
it, folks. If we look uh the broader
 

489
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,710
it, folks. If we look uh the broader
market probably pretty much the same in

490
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:38,720
market probably pretty much the same in
 

491
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,030
market probably pretty much the same in
tech.

492
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040

Ninja is up and running properly. Let's
 

509
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,629
Ninja is up and running properly. Let's
zoom this in as we come into this

510
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
zoom this in as we come into this
 

511
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:19,430
zoom this in as we come into this
previous day value very low.

512
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,440

 

513
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,430

Where's my trade account? There we go.

514
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
Where's my trade account? There we go.
 

515
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,829
Where's my trade account? There we go.
Okay, so opening up here in the next

516
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:25,839
Okay, so opening up here in the next
 

517
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,910
Okay, so opening up here in the next
five minutes right on previous day value

518
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:27,920
five minutes right on previous day value
 

519
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,910
five minutes right on previous day value
area low and view up. Remember a squeeze

520
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
area low and view up. Remember a squeeze
 

521
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,269
area low and view up. Remember a squeeze
above this will probably take us up to

522
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:31,279
above this will probably take us up to
 

523
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,870
above this will probably take us up to
the 340 350s.

524
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880

 

525
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,310

526
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,320
I'm just going to turn Trump up just so
 

527
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:51,990
I'm just going to turn Trump up just so
I can have a little listen here.

528
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,000

 

529
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,829

Morning all.

530
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:53,839
Morning all.
 

531
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,990
Morning all.
What's the relevance of an inside bar?

532
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
What's the relevance of an inside bar?
 

533
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,150
What's the relevance of an inside bar?
Uh well, it's trading versus yesterday's

534
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
Uh well, it's trading versus yesterday's
 

535
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,590
Uh well, it's trading versus yesterday's
price action, which means it's building

536
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
price action, which means it's building
 

537
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,749
price action, which means it's building
liquidity. It's not expanding liquidity.

538
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:01,759
liquidity. It's not expanding liquidity.
 

539
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,230
liquidity. It's not expanding liquidity.
So, it's currently probably inside of

540
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,240
So, it's currently probably inside of
 

541
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,909
So, it's currently probably inside of
value which is where we are now. We're

542
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919
value which is where we are now. We're
 

543
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,949
value which is where we are now. We're
trying to trade back inside of value.

544
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,959
trying to trade back inside of value.
 

545
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,990
trying to trade back inside of value.
All right, we are inside an inside bar

546
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000
All right, we are inside an inside bar
 

547
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,949
All right, we are inside an inside bar
as well because PDC is here. All right,

548
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:14,959
as well because PDC is here. All right,
 

549
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,750
as well because PDC is here. All right,
and we've looked below and failed and we

550
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:17,760
and we've looked below and failed and we
 

551
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,909
and we've looked below and failed and we
are now trading back inside yesterday's

552
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:19,919
are now trading back inside yesterday's
 

553
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,309
are now trading back inside yesterday's
bar is here. All right, and yesterday's

554
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,319
bar is here. All right, and yesterday's
 

555
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,710
bar is here. All right, and yesterday's
value is here. So, if we can't find

556
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720
value is here. So, if we can't find
 

557
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,630
value is here. So, if we can't find
acceptance below this, guess what? We're

558
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
acceptance below this, guess what? We're
 

559
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,150
acceptance below this, guess what? We're
going to rotate inside yesterday's

560
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:28,160
going to rotate inside yesterday's
 

561
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,150
going to rotate inside yesterday's
value. So, why is it significant? Well,

562
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,160
value. So, why is it significant? Well,
 

563
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,070
value. So, why is it significant? Well,
it starts to help us understand the type

564
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
it starts to help us understand the type
 

565
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,230
it starts to help us understand the type
of market conditions. We might very well

566
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
of market conditions. We might very well
 

567
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,230
of market conditions. We might very well
go into a rotational market if we can't

568
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
go into a rotational market if we can't
 

569
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,029
go into a rotational market if we can't
find price acceptance outside of 240 and

570
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:39,039
find price acceptance outside of 240 and
 

571
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:48,549
find price acceptance outside of 240 and
below.

572
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:48,559

and current week value is down at 185.
 

629
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,070
and current week value is down at 185.
So there is a pivot down here if they do

630
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,080
So there is a pivot down here if they do
 

631
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,909
So there is a pivot down here if they do
want to hold it on the developing weekly

632
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:03,919
want to hold it on the developing weekly
 

633
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,150
want to hold it on the developing weekly
profile. Otherwise you'll probably see a

634
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,160
profile. Otherwise you'll probably see a
 

635
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,470
profile. Otherwise you'll probably see a
flush to 132. So these are the big

636
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:08,480
flush to 132. So these are the big
 

637
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,270
flush to 132. So these are the big
contested levels. Now

638
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,280
contested levels. Now
 

639
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,990
contested levels. Now
there we go into this open in what the

640
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,000
there we go into this open in what the
 

641
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,630
there we go into this open in what the
next two minutes already rejecting value

642
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:16,640
next two minutes already rejecting value
 

643
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,950
next two minutes already rejecting value
like we just talked about. Right? These

644
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:18,960
like we just talked about. Right? These
 

645
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,950
like we just talked about. Right? These
are the key levels. We want to trade

646
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:20,960
are the key levels. We want to trade
 

647
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,070
are the key levels. We want to trade
around these key levels.

648
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,080

 

649
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,830

Is this huge pump bullish for the day?

650
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:27,840
Is this huge pump bullish for the day?
 

651
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,510
Is this huge pump bullish for the day?
No.

652
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
No.
 

653
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,510
No.
No. Definitely not. Not unless we

654
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,520
No. Definitely not. Not unless we
 

655
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,350
No. Definitely not. Not unless we
reclaim and even then it would be a

656
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,360
reclaim and even then it would be a
 

657
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,070
reclaim and even then it would be a
rotational day. All right. So, this is a

658
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,080
rotational day. All right. So, this is a
 

659
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,190
rotational day. All right. So, this is a
huge drive off the lows to retest value.

660
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200
huge drive off the lows to retest value.
 

661
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,350
huge drive off the lows to retest value.
All right, we're retesting value. If we

662
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,360
All right, we're retesting value. If we
 

663
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,310
All right, we're retesting value. If we
leave value and close this gap, they

664
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,320
leave value and close this gap, they
 

665
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,669
leave value and close this gap, they
will either try and bid between these

666
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:45,679
will either try and bid between these
 

667
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,510
will either try and bid between these
two or if they lose this, we can look

668
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,520
two or if they lose this, we can look
 

669
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,070
two or if they lose this, we can look
for these 190s. All right, if they hold

670
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,080
for these 190s. All right, if they hold
 

671
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,230
for these 190s. All right, if they hold
back inside here, then arguably it's

672
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,240
back inside here, then arguably it's
 

673
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,990
back inside here, then arguably it's
bullish, but it's a rotational bullish

674
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,000
bullish, but it's a rotational bullish
 

675
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,470
bullish, but it's a rotational bullish
move up into here. All right, it's also

676
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
move up into here. All right, it's also
 

677
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,789
move up into here. All right, it's also
possible they do a fail break. So, this

678
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
possible they do a fail break. So, this
 

679
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,270
possible they do a fail break. So, this
is a big big level and we are going to

680
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,280
is a big big level and we are going to
 

681
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,430
is a big big level and we are going to
respect it. So, I don't not convinced

682
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,440
respect it. So, I don't not convinced
 

683
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,630
respect it. So, I don't not convinced
I'm going to take a trade at the open

684
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
I'm going to take a trade at the open
 

685
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,230
I'm going to take a trade at the open
today. Not like yesterday. Not unless we

686
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
today. Not like yesterday. Not unless we
 

687
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,149
today. Not like yesterday. Not unless we
drive straight up into here and I can

688
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:08,159
drive straight up into here and I can
 

689
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,070
drive straight up into here and I can
think about selling this market back

690
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
think about selling this market back
 

691
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,470
think about selling this market back
down because it's an overextension

692
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,480
down because it's an overextension
 

693
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,310
down because it's an overextension
at the moment. You can see quite clear

694
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,320
at the moment. You can see quite clear
 

695
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,310
at the moment. You can see quite clear
rejection of previous day's value. Like

696
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,320
rejection of previous day's value. Like
 

697
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,390
rejection of previous day's value. Like
I said, current weekly value is

698
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:18,400
I said, current weekly value is
 

699
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,270
I said, current weekly value is
currently at 185 186 somewhere around

700
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:21,280
currently at 185 186 somewhere around
 

701
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,710
currently at 185 186 somewhere around
here. So, it's possible they might want

702
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:22,720
here. So, it's possible they might want
 

703
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:29,270
here. So, it's possible they might want
to hold a dip here. [snorts]

704
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280

 

705
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,190

Okay. Still going on about Biden. It's

706
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
Okay. Still going on about Biden. It's
 

707
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,350
Okay. Still going on about Biden. It's
insane. Is he going to do this in 3

708
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
insane. Is he going to do this in 3
 

709
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,710
insane. Is he going to do this in 3
years time as well? Still talk about

710
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
years time as well? Still talk about
 

711
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,630
years time as well? Still talk about
previous presidents.

712
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:38,640

 

713
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,430

Come on, buddy. Jog it on a little bit.

714
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:41,440
Come on, buddy. Jog it on a little bit.
 

715
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,750
Come on, buddy. Jog it on a little bit.
Change your narrative.

716
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:43,760
Change your narrative.
 

717
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:54,470
Change your narrative.
You were funny for about a minute.

718
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:54,480

 

719
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,990

Alex, did we take that full shelf down

720
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,000
Alex, did we take that full shelf down
 

721
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,590
Alex, did we take that full shelf down
you mentioned yesterday from stream or

722
00:21:59,590 --> 00:21:59,600
you mentioned yesterday from stream or
 

723
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,510
you mentioned yesterday from stream or
do you think There's further to go. Uh

724
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:01,520
do you think There's further to go. Uh
 

725
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,510
do you think There's further to go. Uh
we did the move. Yeah, yesterday we did

726
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
we did the move. Yeah, yesterday we did
 

727
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,870
we did the move. Yeah, yesterday we did
the move that we've completed, but

728
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:04,880
the move that we've completed, but
 

729
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,310
the move that we've completed, but
there's more to go. We can come into

730
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,320
there's more to go. We can come into
 

731
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,310
there's more to go. We can come into
this block down here if we want. Haven't

732
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,320
this block down here if we want. Haven't
 

733
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,430
this block down here if we want. Haven't
quite got there yet. [sighs]

734
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:11,440
quite got there yet. [sighs]
 

735
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,830
quite got there yet. [sighs]
Okay, folks. Here we go. This is the

736
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:13,840
Okay, folks. Here we go. This is the
 

737
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,430
Okay, folks. Here we go. This is the
open. Let's see what we do. So, coming

738
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,440
open. Let's see what we do. So, coming
 

739
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,230
open. Let's see what we do. So, coming
back down into current weekly value area

740
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,240
back down into current weekly value area
 

741
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,070
back down into current weekly value area
low, developing weekly value area low,

742
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,080
low, developing weekly value area low,
 

743
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,270
low, developing weekly value area low,
which is where we're trading at right

744
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
which is where we're trading at right
 

745
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,549
which is where we're trading at right
now. So, we're going to watch this

746
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:22,559
now. So, we're going to watch this
 

747
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,230
now. So, we're going to watch this
between previous day value and this

748
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,240
between previous day value and this
 

749
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,710
between previous day value and this
level right now and 24-hour VW up and

750
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:26,720
level right now and 24-hour VW up and
 

751
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,149
level right now and 24-hour VW up and
see if we catch a bid here. If they

752
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:28,159
see if we catch a bid here. If they
 

753
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,590
see if we catch a bid here. If they
protect this gap or if we're going to

754
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
protect this gap or if we're going to
 

755
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,270
protect this gap or if we're going to
see follow through downside. I can give

756
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,280
see follow through downside. I can give
 

757
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,669
see follow through downside. I can give
you a quick readout on the mag here.

758
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:33,679
you a quick readout on the mag here.
 

759
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,149
you a quick readout on the mag here.

little bit of a uh shuffle around in

00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:49,039
little bit of a uh shuffle around in

little bit of a uh shuffle around in

772
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:50,559
these mag. They're not in alignment
 

773
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,710
these mag. They're not in alignment
right now. We have time here. We we can

774
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:52,720
right now. We have time here. We we can
 

775
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,630
right now. We have time here. We we can
have some time. So protecting current

776
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:54,640
have some time. So protecting current
 

777
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,549
have some time. So protecting current
weekly value. We have to watch this

778
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:56,559
weekly value. We have to watch this
 

779
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,029
weekly value. We have to watch this
level here. We have to watch previous

780
00:22:59,029 --> 00:22:59,039
level here. We have to watch previous
 

781
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:06,710
level here. We have to watch previous
day value. Very very important.

782
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720

 

783
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,710

It's amazing the difference. See this

784
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:08,720
It's amazing the difference. See this
 

785
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,990
It's amazing the difference. See this
has got this at 340. I've got P on Ninja

786
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
has got this at 340. I've got P on Ninja
 

787
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,750
has got this at 340. I've got P on Ninja
at 280.

788
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:13,760
at 280.
 

789
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,590
at 280.
So I want to be careful here between the

790
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:15,600
So I want to be careful here between the
 

791
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,149
So I want to be careful here between the
two. Clear discrepancy. So 280 will be a

792
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
two. Clear discrepancy. So 280 will be a
 

793
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:24,070
two. Clear discrepancy. So 280 will be a
level as well it seems. that.

794
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,080

 

795
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,630

So, still rejecting up here. This node

796
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:26,640
So, still rejecting up here. This node
 

797
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,470
So, still rejecting up here. This node
still just trading between these two,

798
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
still just trading between these two,
 

799
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,430
still just trading between these two,
between current week value area low and

800
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,440
between current week value area low and
 

801
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,510
between current week value area low and
previous day value area low. We're

802
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:33,520
previous day value area low. We're
 

803
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,110
previous day value area low. We're
opening outside of value. So,

804
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,120
opening outside of value. So,
 

805
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,950
opening outside of value. So,
technically we're bearish until it

806
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:36,960
technically we're bearish until it
 

807
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,110
technically we're bearish until it
reclaims. I just want to be somewhat

808
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,120
reclaims. I just want to be somewhat
 

809
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,950
reclaims. I just want to be somewhat
careful here.

810
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:40,960
careful here.
 

811
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:56,390
careful here.

those mornings where it requires a bit
 

879
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,510

Testing that New York open. Can't
 

883
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,789
Testing that New York open. Can't
reclaim it. All right. So these big

884
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:04,799
reclaim it. All right. So these big
 

885
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,230
reclaim it. All right. So these big
levels. So we're trading right now. The

886
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,240
levels. So we're trading right now. The
 

887
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,630
levels. So we're trading right now. The
rotation is between this. Oh, don't move

888
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:08,640
rotation is between this. Oh, don't move
 

889
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,590
rotation is between this. Oh, don't move
it between these two boxes.

890
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:11,600
it between these two boxes.
 

891
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,269
it between these two boxes.
All right, there's your gap fill area

892
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:13,279
All right, there's your gap fill area
 

893
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,669
All right, there's your gap fill area
here. All right, squeeze potential can

894
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:15,679
here. All right, squeeze potential can
 

895
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,669
here. All right, squeeze potential can
happen over here if they base above. It

896
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:17,679
happen over here if they base above. It
 

897
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,190
happen over here if they base above. It
can also be a look above and fail and we

898
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,200
can also be a look above and fail and we
 

899
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,630
can also be a look above and fail and we
can play downside. So, I just want to

900
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:20,640
can play downside. So, I just want to
 

901
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,990
can play downside. So, I just want to
let this develop. Either we're going to

902
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,000
let this develop. Either we're going to
 

903
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,990
let this develop. Either we're going to
get under the close under the lows and

904
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,000
get under the close under the lows and
 

905
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,510
get under the close under the lows and
stay heavy or they're going to do a

906
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:25,520
stay heavy or they're going to do a
 

907
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,350
stay heavy or they're going to do a
little look below and fail and come back

908
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:27,360
little look below and fail and come back
 

909
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,190
little look below and fail and come back
into here or they do a look above and

910
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,200
into here or they do a look above and
 

911
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,950
into here or they do a look above and
fail and come back down or they base and

912
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
fail and come back down or they base and
 

913
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,390
fail and come back down or they base and
go. I know there's a lot of opportunity

914
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:32,400
go. I know there's a lot of opportunity
 

915
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,310
go. I know there's a lot of opportunity
here. I'm looking at every direction

916
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,320
here. I'm looking at every direction
 

917
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,669
here. I'm looking at every direction
because I don't know if we're going to

918
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:35,679
because I don't know if we're going to
 

919
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,430
because I don't know if we're going to
have follow through or if we need a

920
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:37,440
have follow through or if we need a
 

921
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,110
have follow through or if we need a
counter trend squeeze higher yet. So,

922
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:39,120
counter trend squeeze higher yet. So,
 

923
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,710
counter trend squeeze higher yet. So,
just waiting for it to develop and I'll

924
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:40,720
just waiting for it to develop and I'll
 

925
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,430
just waiting for it to develop and I'll
play once it becomes clear what it wants

926
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:43,440
play once it becomes clear what it wants
 

927
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,350
play once it becomes clear what it wants
to do.

928

YM's stronger. All you have to do is
 

941
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,470
YM's stronger. All you have to do is
look at the percentage change. We have

942

look at the percentage change. We have
 

943
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,350
look at the percentage change. We have

947
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,029
That's been the same for a while because
we keep rotating out of tech and into

948
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:19,039
we keep rotating out of tech and into
 

949
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,950
we keep rotating out of tech and into
the broader market, right? It's been the

950
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:20,960
the broader market, right? It's been the
 

951
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:30,950
the broader market, right? It's been the
narrative since December.

952
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:30,960

 

953
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,950

This guy's already been talking for

954
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:32,960
This guy's already been talking for
 

955
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:46,329
This guy's already been talking for
ages, like an hour. It's insane.

956
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:46,339

 

957
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:49,830

[snorts]

958
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:49,840

 

959
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,990

Okay, so there's 150 buyers now been

960
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,000
Okay, so there's 150 buyers now been
 

961
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,750
Okay, so there's 150 buyers now been
filled. There's still some sellers up at

962
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:53,760
filled. There's still some sellers up at
 

963
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,389
filled. There's still some sellers up at
85 and 200. We still haven't really

964
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:56,399
85 and 200. We still haven't really
 

965
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,470
85 and 200. We still haven't really
closed this gap yet. So, just waiting to

966
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:58,480
closed this gap yet. So, just waiting to
 

967
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,110
closed this gap yet. So, just waiting to
see if we close that gap and then how do

968
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,120
see if we close that gap and then how do
 

969
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,149
see if we close that gap and then how do
we react? So far, previous day value

970
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:04,159
we react? So far, previous day value
 

971
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:25,669
we react? So far, previous day value
definitely holding up.

972
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:25,679

 

973
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,870

Without the United States, you don't

974
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:26,880
Without the United States, you don't
 

975
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,630
Without the United States, you don't
have a country. Yes, that's right. Well,

976
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:28,640
have a country. Yes, that's right. Well,
 

977
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,909
have a country. Yes, that's right. Well,
you what you meant to say is we don't

978
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:29,919
you what you meant to say is we don't
 

979
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,750
you what you meant to say is we don't
have a world, and we definitely do have

980
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:31,760
have a world, and we definitely do have
 

981
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,190
have a world, and we definitely do have
a world without the United States.

982
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:33,200
a world without the United States.
 

983
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,870
a world without the United States.
There's plenty of other countries out

984
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:34,880
There's plenty of other countries out
 

985
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,669
There's plenty of other countries out
there, Donald.

986
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:37,679
there, Donald.
 

987
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,190
there, Donald.
Gez Louise, this guy's on one today.

988
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,200
Gez Louise, this guy's on one today.
 

989
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,750
Gez Louise, this guy's on one today.
Right. See if we can get a gap fill here

990
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:43,760
Right. See if we can get a gap fill here
 

991
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,750
Right. See if we can get a gap fill here
and then see what opportunities come

992
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:45,760
and then see what opportunities come
 

993
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:54,549
and then see what opportunities come
afterwards. Just being patient here.

994
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:54,559

 

995
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,470

All right. So, nice rejection of value

996
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,480
All right. So, nice rejection of value
 

997
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,190
All right. So, nice rejection of value
pre-market. Coming back down to this big

998
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,200
pre-market. Coming back down to this big
 

999
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,950
pre-market. Coming back down to this big
gray box. We got a big node here.

1000
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:02,960
gray box. We got a big node here.
 

1001
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,070
gray box. We got a big node here.
We're finding bids in at the moment.

1002
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,080
We're finding bids in at the moment.
 

1003
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,070
We're finding bids in at the moment.
If we get under this node and we stay

1004
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,080
If we get under this node and we stay
 

1005
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,070
If we get under this node and we stay
heavy versus sort of 28s and 20s, then I

1006
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,080
heavy versus sort of 28s and 20s, then I
 

1007
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,190
heavy versus sort of 28s and 20s, then I
think there's a bigger flush in the

1008
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,200
think there's a bigger flush in the
 

1009
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,389
think there's a bigger flush in the
market. Otherwise, you want to be very

1010
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:14,399
market. Otherwise, you want to be very
 

1011
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,149
market. Otherwise, you want to be very
careful. If you were short from value

1012
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:16,159
careful. If you were short from value
 

1013
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,750
careful. If you were short from value
area low, you want to be covering some

1014
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:17,760
area low, you want to be covering some
 

1015
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,110
area low, you want to be covering some
into here and then seeing if you find

1016
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,120
into here and then seeing if you find
 

1017
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,110
into here and then seeing if you find
price acceptance lower. I'm not in

1018
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,120
price acceptance lower. I'm not in
 

1019
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,110
price acceptance lower. I'm not in
anything yet. I'm just being very, very

1020
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,120
anything yet. I'm just being very, very
 

1021
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:42,789
anything yet. I'm just being very, very
patient.

1022
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:42,799

 

1023
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,789

back for this 200 test. This New York

1024
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:44,799
back for this 200 test. This New York
 

1025
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,470
back for this 200 test. This New York
open. So, between these gray boxes, the

1026
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:46,480
open. So, between these gray boxes, the
 

1027
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,149
open. So, between these gray boxes, the
rotation still. That's why I'm having to

1028
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:48,159
rotation still. That's why I'm having to
 

1029
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,430
rotation still. That's why I'm having to
be patient this morning. Very different

1030
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:49,440
be patient this morning. Very different
 

1031
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,870
be patient this morning. Very different
to yesterday when I attacked it out of

1032
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:50,880
to yesterday when I attacked it out of
 

1033
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,350
to yesterday when I attacked it out of
the gate. [snorts]

1034
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,360

 

1035
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,630

Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Josh, it's

1036
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:56,640
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Josh, it's
 

1037
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,470
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Josh, it's
still it's like an hour. Like, how And

1038
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:58,480
still it's like an hour. Like, how And
 

1039
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,830
still it's like an hour. Like, how And
he's How long is he going to talk for?

1040
00:29:59,830 --> 00:29:59,840
he's How long is he going to talk for?
 

1041
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,110
he's How long is he going to talk for?
I'm just waiting for him to stop talking

1042
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,120
I'm just waiting for him to stop talking
 

1043
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:11,510
I'm just waiting for him to stop talking
so the news also stop looking for words.

1044
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:11,520

 

1045
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,149

Yes. Back through that New York open.

1046
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:16,159

 

1047
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,110

We're back to these 200s again.

1048
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,120
We're back to these 200s again.
 

1049
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,870
We're back to these 200s again.
So, do they sell this gray box again for

1050
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:20,880
So, do they sell this gray box again for
 

1051
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,389
So, do they sell this gray box again for
the rotation back down and fill the gap?

1052
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:22,399
the rotation back down and fill the gap?
 

1053
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,830
the rotation back down and fill the gap?
or are we going to see the start of a

1054
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:23,840
or are we going to see the start of a
 

1055
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,389
or are we going to see the start of a
squeeze

1056
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:28,399

 

1057
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,070

into this gray box? Are we going to

1058
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,080
into this gray box? Are we going to
 

1059
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,830
into this gray box? Are we going to
extend now and come up for previous date

1060
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:31,840
extend now and come up for previous date
 

1061
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,029
extend now and come up for previous date
value to 240? Is it possible?

1062
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:35,039
value to 240? Is it possible?
 

1063
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,630
value to 240? Is it possible?
Still this gray box being defended for

1064
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:36,640
Still this gray box being defended for
 

1065
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,830
Still this gray box being defended for
now. So, we've just got to be patient

1066
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:37,840
now. So, we've just got to be patient
 

1067
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:51,830
now. So, we've just got to be patient
here, folks.

1068
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:51,840

 

1069
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,669

Okay, so if they get through here,

1070
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:53,679
Okay, so if they get through here,
 

1071
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,070
Okay, so if they get through here,
possible squeeze to 40s. I'm waiting to

1072
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,080
possible squeeze to 40s. I'm waiting to
 

1073
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,149
possible squeeze to 40s. I'm waiting to
get outside of value. Either a look

1074
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:58,159
get outside of value. Either a look
 

1075
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,430
get outside of value. Either a look
above and fail and I'll fade it back

1076
00:30:59,430 --> 00:30:59,440
above and fail and I'll fade it back
 

1077
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,870
above and fail and I'll fade it back
down or a look above and base and I will

1078
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:00,880
down or a look above and base and I will
 

1079
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,470
down or a look above and base and I will
play the squeeze back up. I do not want

1080
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:02,480
play the squeeze back up. I do not want
 

1081
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,029
play the squeeze back up. I do not want
to trade in this garbage here for me

1082
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,039
to trade in this garbage here for me
 

1083
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,149
to trade in this garbage here for me
personally.

1084
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:08,159

 

1085
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,669

Just looking at the owl, it's just a

1086
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:09,679
Just looking at the owl, it's just a
 

1087
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,029
Just looking at the owl, it's just a
little bit messy in here. We've had a

1088
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:11,039
little bit messy in here. We've had a
 

1089
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,789
little bit messy in here. We've had a
big drive up. We've run the stops over

1090
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:12,799
big drive up. We've run the stops over
 

1091
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,029
big drive up. We've run the stops over
247. And we've come back inside, but

1092
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:15,039
247. And we've come back inside, but
 

1093
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,630
247. And we've come back inside, but
we're not seeing follow through yet. So,

1094
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:16,640
we're not seeing follow through yet. So,
 

1095
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,789
we're not seeing follow through yet. So,
just trying to wait for it to show me

1096
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:18,799
just trying to wait for it to show me
 

1097
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,630
just trying to wait for it to show me
the direction it wants to go in. Let's

1098
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:20,640
the direction it wants to go in. Let's
 

1099
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,070
the direction it wants to go in. Let's
have a quick look at the MAC. Tesla

1100
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,080
have a quick look at the MAC. Tesla
 

1101
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,549
have a quick look at the MAC. Tesla
0.61% up. Nvidia 0.60% up. Microsoft 1%

00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,160

 

1261
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,829

Yeah, big pivot up here if we get over

1262
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:11,839
Yeah, big pivot up here if we get over
 

1263
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,750
Yeah, big pivot up here if we get over
it there. There is squeeze relief over

1264
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:13,760
it there. There is squeeze relief over
 

1265
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,230
it there. There is squeeze relief over
this up into these these areas up here.

1266
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,240
this up into these these areas up here.
 

1267
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,710
this up into these these areas up here.
Definitely.

1268
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:18,720
Definitely.
 

1269
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:35,750
Definitely.
So, I want to be aware of that.

1270
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:35,760

 

1271
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,990

205 was that level of that huge seller

1272
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:38,000
205 was that level of that huge seller
 

1273
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,310
205 was that level of that huge seller
yesterday as well. Worth remembering.

1274
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:44,320

 

1275
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,910

Still back and forth here between these

1276
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:45,920
Still back and forth here between these
 

1277
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,829
Still back and forth here between these
two. All right, took a little long here

1278
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:47,839
two. All right, took a little long here
 

1279
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,230
two. All right, took a little long here
for a scalp into this. Lots of money in

1280
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,240
for a scalp into this. Lots of money in
 

1281
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,430
for a scalp into this. Lots of money in
already.

1282

1283
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,589

Not sizing into this yet unless we get a

1284

Not sizing into this yet unless we get a
 

1285
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:27,109
Not sizing into this yet unless we get a
break above and a squeeze.

1286
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:27,119

 

1287
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,470

I know I'm not talking much today,

1288
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:28,480
I know I'm not talking much today,
 

1289
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,190
I know I'm not talking much today,
folks. It's just very slow. Just waiting

1290
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,200
folks. It's just very slow. Just waiting
 

1291
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,470
folks. It's just very slow. Just waiting
for a clean break or a clean trap.

1292
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:34,480
for a clean break or a clean trap.
 

1293

1297

little bit to go and fill these guys.

This is where he came in last time.

What is my bias? Well, currently my bias
 

1325
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,109
What is my bias? Well, currently my bias
is rotation.

1326
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:25,119
is rotation.
 

1327
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,670
is rotation.
Um, if we get above previous day value,

1328
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:27,680
Um, if we get above previous day value,
 

1329
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,510
Um, if we get above previous day value,
when technically we can be sure all the

00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:29,520
when technically we can be sure all the

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,349
when technically we can be sure all the

up to here. If we get back inside value,

1334
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:33,680
up to here. If we get back inside value,
 

1335
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,990
up to here. If we get back inside value,
I'm expecting a rotation higher unless

1336
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,000
I'm expecting a rotation higher unless
 

1337
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,750
I'm expecting a rotation higher unless
we peak above and fail. If we keep

1338
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:37,760
we peak above and fail. If we keep
 

1339
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,670
we peak above and fail. If we keep
rejecting value, then I'm expecting a

1340
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:39,680
rejecting value, then I'm expecting a
 

1341
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,030
rejecting value, then I'm expecting a
rotation lower, but we're going to have

1342
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,040
rotation lower, but we're going to have
 

1343
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,270
rotation lower, but we're going to have
to get under PDC, which has held again

1344
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:43,280
to get under PDC, which has held again
 

1345

these two levels. All right.

one of these. If they hold New York and
 

1383
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,069
one of these. If they hold New York and
they do this, you will see relief up

they do this, you will see relief up
 

1385
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,069
they do this, you will see relief up

1393
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,510

So dips now need to hold 205s really

1394
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:21,520
So dips now need to hold 205s really
 

1395
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,349
So dips now need to hold 205s really
somewhere around that. If they fail 200s

1396
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:23,359
somewhere around that. If they fail 200s
 

1397
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,670
somewhere around that. If they fail 200s
and fail the New York open,

1398
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:25,680
and fail the New York open,
 

1399
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,030
and fail the New York open,
they're just going to fail to break out.

1400
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,040
they're just going to fail to break out.

We've got divergence to ES which just
took the highs as well and is trading

1404
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:30,400
took the highs as well and is trading
 

1405
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,230
took the highs as well and is trading

1406
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:32,240
back inside. It's very messy here this

morning, folks. Going to have to be very

So testing value area high right now

1412
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,200

hold. If they fail to hold that there

00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:43,200
hold. If they fail to hold that there
 

1417
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,670
hold. If they fail to hold that there
will be no chance to rotate through the

will be no chance to rotate through the
 

1419
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,589
will be no chance to rotate through the
250s. If they hold this they have got a

1420
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:47,599
250s. If they hold this they have got a
 

1421
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,270
250s. If they hold this they have got a
shot of going through 250 and then

1422
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:49,280
shot of going through 250 and then
 

1423
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,630
shot of going through 250 and then
through that 280 and then 350s are the

1424
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:52,640
through that 280 and then 350s are the
 

1425
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,790
through that 280 and then 350s are the
targets if they can hold. It's a big if

1426
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:54,800
targets if they can hold. It's a big if
 

1427
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:03,473
targets if they can hold. It's a big if
right now folks. It's a big if.

1428
00:41:03,473 --> 00:41:03,483

 

1429
00:41:03,483 --> 00:41:04,470

VIX lower day breaking previous day lows

1432
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:06,640
VIX lower day breaking previous day lows
 

1433
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,230
VIX lower day breaking previous day lows
here.

1434
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:08,240
here.
 

1435
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,430
here.
So if FIX gets followed through

1436
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:09,440
So if FIX gets followed through
 

1437
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,870
So if FIX gets followed through
downside, we might see more relief.

1438
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:10,880
downside, we might see more relief.
 

1439
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,630
downside, we might see more relief.
Right, here's the test of the sort of

1440
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:12,640
Right, here's the test of the sort of
 

1441
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,190
Right, here's the test of the sort of
205s we just talked about. Do they rebid

1442
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:15,200
205s we just talked about. Do they rebid
 

1443
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,109
205s we just talked about. Do they rebid
this? If not, then uh there's nothing to

1444
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:17,119
this? If not, then uh there's nothing to
 

1445
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,069
this? If not, then uh there's nothing to
do here. We're just going to go back

1446
00:41:18,069 --> 00:41:18,079
do here. We're just going to go back
 

1447
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,910
do here. We're just going to go back
inside current value, which will be a

1448
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:19,920
inside current value, which will be a
 

1449
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,910
inside current value, which will be a
nightmare.

1450
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:25,920

 

1451
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,430

Can't get through that opening range

1452
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:27,440
Can't get through that opening range
 

1453
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,190
Can't get through that opening range
right now. Failing the opening range

1454
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:29,200
right now. Failing the opening range
 

1455
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,550
right now. Failing the opening range
high at the moment.

1456
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:34,560

 

1457
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,790

They need to lift back through the 225s

1458
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:36,800
They need to lift back through the 225s
 

1459
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,470
They need to lift back through the 225s
and 250s at the moment is what they need

1460
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:38,480
and 250s at the moment is what they need
 

1461
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,589
and 250s at the moment is what they need
to do.

1462
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:41,599
to do.
 

1463
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,829
to do.
There's the 25 test. They got to get

1464
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:43,839
There's the 25 test. They got to get
 

1465
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,190
There's the 25 test. They got to get
back through this. There are buyers

1466
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:45,200
back through this. There are buyers
 

1467
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,109
back through this. There are buyers
stuck at 30s. They got to get back over

1468
00:41:47,109 --> 00:41:47,119
stuck at 30s. They got to get back over
 

1469
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,430
stuck at 30s. They got to get back over
30s to be comfortable.

1470
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:49,440
30s to be comfortable.
 

1471
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,829
30s to be comfortable.
Here we go. It's over 30s. Nice. Right.

1472
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:51,839
Here we go. It's over 30s. Nice. Right.
 

1473
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,990
Here we go. It's over 30s. Nice. Right.
Can we lift to 250 and then can we get

1474
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,000
Can we lift to 250 and then can we get
 

1475
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,390
Can we lift to 250 and then can we get
going on a squeeze? Come on, baby.

1476
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:58,400
going on a squeeze? Come on, baby.
 

1477

for me so I can get a big giant squeeze
 

1481
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,950
for me so I can get a big giant squeeze
out here. It' be really fun.

1482
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:06,960

 

1483
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,550

Big seller just stepped in there. So we

1484
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:08,560
Big seller just stepped in there. So we
 

1485
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,270
Big seller just stepped in there. So we
now know huge seller at 240. Huge seller

1488
00:42:15,109 --> 00:42:15,119
came in at 240. Still looking to trade
 

1489
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,309
came in at 240. Still looking to trade
this higher at the moment. Want to get

1490
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:16,319
this higher at the moment. Want to get
 

1491
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,470
this higher at the moment. Want to get
through 240 and 250 and make this seller

1492
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:18,480
through 240 and 250 and make this seller
 

1493
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,270
through 240 and 250 and make this seller
stop out.

1494
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,280
stop out.
 

1495
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,589
stop out.
So currently long from here on this dip

1496
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:23,599
So currently long from here on this dip
 

1497
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,349
So currently long from here on this dip
trying to get acceptance through here.

1498
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:25,359
trying to get acceptance through here.
 

1499
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,870
trying to get acceptance through here.
I'm going to trim some into these levels

1500
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:26,880
I'm going to trim some into these levels
 

1501
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,950
I'm going to trim some into these levels
here because we keep rejecting 240 again

1502
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:28,960
here because we keep rejecting 240 again
 

1503
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,870
here because we keep rejecting 240 again
as big seller. But we have got liquidity

1504
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:30,880
as big seller. But we have got liquidity
 

1505
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,390
as big seller. But we have got liquidity
all the way up into 60s. I think we can

1506
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:32,400
all the way up into 60s. I think we can
 

1507
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:43,030
all the way up into 60s. I think we can
lift here on a runner.

1508
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,040

 

1509
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,670

Come on. Lift it through 260. Here we

1510
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:45,680
Come on. Lift it through 260. Here we
 

1511
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,990
Come on. Lift it through 260. Here we
go.

1512
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:48,000
go.
 

1513
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,109
go.
Let's go. Let's go.

1514
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:51,119
Let's go. Let's go.
 

1515
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,030
Let's go. Let's go.
Okay. So, we're going to watch 280 now

1516
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:53,040
Okay. So, we're going to watch 280 now
 

1517
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,030
Okay. So, we're going to watch 280 now
and 350 on the runner. Be very careful

1518
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:55,040
and 350 on the runner. Be very careful
 

1519
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:02,069
and 350 on the runner. Be very careful
if they look above here and fail.

1520
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:02,079

 

1521
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,069

Really nice. Be very careful if they

1522
00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:04,079
Really nice. Be very careful if they
 

1523
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:11,030
Really nice. Be very careful if they
look above and fail.

1524
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:11,040

 

1525
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,510

Uh the delta CVD is very strong. It's

1526
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:13,520
Uh the delta CVD is very strong. It's
 

1527
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,829
Uh the delta CVD is very strong. It's
very strong upside right now. So, it's

1528
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:15,839
very strong upside right now. So, it's
 

1529
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,349
very strong upside right now. So, it's
good aggressive buyers stepping in. So,

1530
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:17,359
good aggressive buyers stepping in. So,
 

1531
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,470
good aggressive buyers stepping in. So,
there was some passive selling, but

1532
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:18,480
there was some passive selling, but
 

1533
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,670
there was some passive selling, but
we're starting to get through it all.

1534
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:19,680
we're starting to get through it all.
 

1535
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,230
we're starting to get through it all.
So, now looking to see if we can go 280

1536
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:22,240
So, now looking to see if we can go 280
 

1537
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,870
So, now looking to see if we can go 280
and then 350. All right. So should have

1538
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:24,880
and then 350. All right. So should have
 

1539
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,390
and then 350. All right. So should have
paid yourself here. All right, you

1540
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:26,400
paid yourself here. All right, you
 

1541
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,990
paid yourself here. All right, you
should have paid yourself here in this

1542
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:28,000
should have paid yourself here in this
 

1543
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,470
should have paid yourself here in this
move. If we get lucky, we get 280s. And

1544
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:30,480
move. If we get lucky, we get 280s. And
 

1545
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,470
move. If we get lucky, we get 280s. And
if we get through that, we can get to

1546
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:32,480
if we get through that, we can get to
 

1547
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,550
if we get through that, we can get to
350. But you must pay yourself here.

1548
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:34,560
350. But you must pay yourself here.
 

1549
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:41,589
350. But you must pay yourself here.
Please

1550
00:43:41,589 --> 00:43:41,599

 

1551
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,430

do not want to see a look above and fail

1552
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:43,440
do not want to see a look above and fail
 

1553
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,349
do not want to see a look above and fail
here because then we come right back

1554
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:45,359
here because then we come right back
 

1555
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,109
here because then we come right back
down into this range. So it's why we're

1556
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:47,119
down into this range. So it's why we're
 

1557
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,030
down into this range. So it's why we're
paying ourselves.

1558
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:49,040
paying ourselves.
 

1559
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,510
paying ourselves.
We know this is like one of the edges

1560
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:51,520
We know this is like one of the edges
 

1561
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,670
We know this is like one of the edges
from the current week developing value.

1562
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:53,680
from the current week developing value.
 

1563
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,030
from the current week developing value.
We've got a little bit of a node here.

1564
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:55,040
We've got a little bit of a node here.
 

1565
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,710
We've got a little bit of a node here.
If we can get through this, there is a

1566
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:56,720
If we can get through this, there is a
 

1567
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,829
If we can get through this, there is a
lift to like 300 and really

1568
00:43:59,829 --> 00:43:59,839
lift to like 300 and really
 

1569
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,270
lift to like 300 and really
340 350. So through 280 there is the

1570
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:03,280
340 350. So through 280 there is the
 

1571
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,990
340 350. So through 280 there is the
chance to go to 340 350. We will respect

1572
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,000
chance to go to 340 350. We will respect
 

1573
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,990
chance to go to 340 350. We will respect
the whole number

1574
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:08,000
the whole number
 

1575
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,510
the whole number
but trying to get up into here if

1576
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:09,520
but trying to get up into here if
 

1577
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,270
but trying to get up into here if
possible.

1578
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:11,280
possible.
 

1579
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,950
possible.
So that W that we talked about down

1580
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:12,960
So that W that we talked about down
 

1581
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,950
So that W that we talked about down
here, we just drew it out. If you can

1582
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:14,960
here, we just drew it out. If you can
 

1583
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,550
here, we just drew it out. If you can
remember this, we said if we can hold

1584
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:16,560
remember this, we said if we can hold
 

1585
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,990
remember this, we said if we can hold
this, there's a chance to do this. And

1586
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:18,000
this, there's a chance to do this. And
 

1587
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,910
this, there's a chance to do this. And
then we're looking for this. Yes. Let's

1588
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:19,920
then we're looking for this. Yes. Let's
 

1589
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,829
then we're looking for this. Yes. Let's
go.

1590
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:21,839
go.
 

1591
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,150
go.
Let's go.

1592
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:24,160
Let's go.
 

1593
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,510
Let's go.
All right. So, I'll tell you on Ninja,

1594
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:27,520
All right. So, I'll tell you on Ninja,
 

1595
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,270
All right. So, I'll tell you on Ninja,
I have previous day point of control at

1596
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:29,280
I have previous day point of control at
 

1597
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,270
I have previous day point of control at
280. That's why I'm I'm being aware of

1598
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:31,280
280. That's why I'm I'm being aware of
 

1599
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,870
280. That's why I'm I'm being aware of
it. On Trading View, I have it all the

1600
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:32,880
it. On Trading View, I have it all the
 

1601
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,390
it. On Trading View, I have it all the
way up here at 350. So, they're both

1602
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:34,400
way up here at 350. So, they're both
 

1603
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,710
way up here at 350. So, they're both
high volume nodes.

1604
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:38,720

 

1605
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,349

Let's go, baby.

1606
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:41,359
Let's go, baby.
 

1607
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:42,870
Let's go, baby.
Let's go, baby. Let's see if we can get

1608
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:42,880
Let's go, baby. Let's see if we can get
 

1609
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,510
Let's go, baby. Let's see if we can get
a bit more here.

1610
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:45,520
a bit more here.
 

1611
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,990
a bit more here.
Remember,

1612
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:50,000

 

1613
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,589

we're counter trend, right? So, this is

1614
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:51,599
we're counter trend, right? So, this is
 

1615
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,630
we're counter trend, right? So, this is
a relief rally. We are bearish overall

1616
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:54,640
a relief rally. We are bearish overall
 

1617
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,030
a relief rally. We are bearish overall
in the market, but we don't expect this

1618
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:57,040
in the market, but we don't expect this
 

1619
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,510
in the market, but we don't expect this
market to keep flushing underneath the

1620
00:44:59,510 --> 00:44:59,520
market to keep flushing underneath the
 

1621
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,950
market to keep flushing underneath the
daily Ballinger band to do what we talk

1622
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:00,960
daily Ballinger band to do what we talk
 

1623
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,630
daily Ballinger band to do what we talk
about. Here's 280. Pay yourself some

1624
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:02,640
about. Here's 280. Pay yourself some
 

1625
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,470
about. Here's 280. Pay yourself some
here. Just pay myself a little bit more.

1626
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:04,480
here. Just pay myself a little bit more.
 

1627
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,069
here. Just pay myself a little bit more.
And then we're going to watch 300s and

1628
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:06,079
And then we're going to watch 300s and
 

1629
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,750
And then we're going to watch 300s and
350s. Really nice. We don't really

1630
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:07,760
350s. Really nice. We don't really
 

1631
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,950
350s. Really nice. We don't really
expect much more than that. All right.

1632
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:08,960
expect much more than that. All right.
 

1633
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,109
expect much more than that. All right.
We're going to It's likely that we

1634
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:11,119
We're going to It's likely that we
 

1635
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,349
We're going to It's likely that we
either hit a block here or here. If we

1636
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:13,359
either hit a block here or here. If we
 

1637
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,270
either hit a block here or here. If we
get acceptance over 350, then you know,

1638
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:15,280
get acceptance over 350, then you know,
 

1639
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,710
get acceptance over 350, then you know,
maybe we come out all the way up into

1640
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:16,720
maybe we come out all the way up into
 

1641
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,230
maybe we come out all the way up into
previous days value area high, but I

1642
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:18,240
previous days value area high, but I
 

1643
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,510
previous days value area high, but I
would find it unlikely. It's probably

1644
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:19,520
would find it unlikely. It's probably
 

1645
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,910
would find it unlikely. It's probably
more likely we're trying to get into uh

1646
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:21,920
more likely we're trying to get into uh
 

1647
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,589
more likely we're trying to get into uh
point of control, which we're at one

1648
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:23,599
point of control, which we're at one
 

1649
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,190
point of control, which we're at one
now. And there's another node up here.

1650
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:25,200
now. And there's another node up here.
 

1651
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,270
now. And there's another node up here.
Really good. We're [snorts] really,

1652
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:27,280
Really good. We're [snorts] really,

1655
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,510
really good now, folks.
So, just hold this. See if we can keep

1656
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:31,520
So, just hold this. See if we can keep
 

1657
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,870
So, just hold this. See if we can keep
squeezing. This is a straight squeeze.

1658
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:32,880
squeezing. This is a straight squeeze.
 

1659
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,349
squeezing. This is a straight squeeze.

1683
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,670

Just be very careful into this level.

Just be very careful into this level.
 

1685
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,670
Just be very careful into this level.
It's a big level. The 280s I called it

1686
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:17,680
It's a big level. The 280s I called it
 

1687
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,589
It's a big level. The 280s I called it
out 280s, 300, 350s, right? You must be

1688
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:21,599
out 280s, 300, 350s, right? You must be
 

1689
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,190
out 280s, 300, 350s, right? You must be
paying yourself into these. Here comes

1690
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:23,200
paying yourself into these. Here comes
 

1691
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,430
paying yourself into these. Here comes
the flush from 280s. All right, so they

1692
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:25,440
the flush from 280s. All right, so they
 

1693
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,150
the flush from 280s. All right, so they
stacked it. We're still bullish in the

1694
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:28,160
stacked it. We're still bullish in the
 

1695
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,829
stacked it. We're still bullish in the
intraday, but we're still bearish

1696
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:29,839
intraday, but we're still bearish
 

1697
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:34,630
intraday, but we're still bearish
overall. Okay.

1698

And uh buyers will want to hold previous
 

1701
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,069
And uh buyers will want to hold previous
day value area. If we're going to do a

day value area. If we're going to do a
 

1703
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,910

rotation now, right? If we're going to

hold this to rotate up here. If they
 

1709

Here's the attempt to drive higher. They
 

1723
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,790
Here's the attempt to drive higher. They
must hold value now to drive higher. If

1724
00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:58,800
must hold value now to drive higher. If
 

1725
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,950
must hold value now to drive higher. If
they fail to hold value, this will be a

1726
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:00,960
they fail to hold value, this will be a
 

1727
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,950
they fail to hold value, this will be a
look above inside previous day's value

1728
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:02,960
look above inside previous day's value
 

1729
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,950
look above inside previous day's value
and we'll rotate lower. But right now,

1730
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:04,960
and we'll rotate lower. But right now,
 

1731
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,150
and we'll rotate lower. But right now,
we're bullish and we're looking for

1732
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:06,160
we're bullish and we're looking for
 

1733
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,230
we're bullish and we're looking for
expansion now through 280s. We're

1734
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:08,240
expansion now through 280s. We're
 

1735
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,430
expansion now through 280s. We're
looking for 300 and then up here.

1736
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:11,440
looking for 300 and then up here.
 

1737
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,430
looking for 300 and then up here.
And this will be us done for the day if

1738
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:13,440
And this will be us done for the day if
 

1739
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,482
And this will be us done for the day if
we can get this.

1740
00:47:17,482 --> 00:47:17,492

 

1741
00:47:17,492 --> 00:47:18,870

[snorts]

1742
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:18,880
[snorts]
 

1743
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,309
[snorts]
Let's go. All right. 300 test coming.

1744
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:22,319
Let's go. All right. 300 test coming.
 

1745
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:27,349
Let's go. All right. 300 test coming.
Come on, baby.

1746
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:27,359

 

1747
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:28,630

Right. If we get very lucky, we're going

1748
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:28,640
Right. If we get very lucky, we're going
 

1749
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,309
Right. If we get very lucky, we're going
to get up into here. If we get very

1750
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:30,319
to get up into here. If we get very
 

1751
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:40,470
to get up into here. If we get very
lucky, 300 would be a big level.

1752
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:40,480

 

1753
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:55,109

Watch this pivot and spy

1754
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:55,119

 

1755
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,030

back inside yesterday's IB. We've done

1756
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:57,040
back inside yesterday's IB. We've done
 

1757
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,430
back inside yesterday's IB. We've done
the same now on uh the cues as well. So

1758
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,440
the same now on uh the cues as well. So
 

1759
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,950
the same now on uh the cues as well. So
pullbacks, if they're going to hold the

1760
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:02,960
pullbacks, if they're going to hold the
 

1761
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,910
pullbacks, if they're going to hold the
pullbacks, I said they're going to have

1762
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:03,920
pullbacks, I said they're going to have
 

1763
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,670
pullbacks, I said they're going to have
to hold value, which is probably

1764
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:05,680
to hold value, which is probably
 

1765
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,710
to hold value, which is probably
yesterday's initial balance.

1766
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:08,720
yesterday's initial balance.
 

1767
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,230
yesterday's initial balance.
A little look. Yeah, pretty much 234s.

1768
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:12,240
A little look. Yeah, pretty much 234s.
 

1769
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,309
A little look. Yeah, pretty much 234s.
So, two 235s we just call it.

1770
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:16,319
So, two 235s we just call it.
 

1771
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,390
So, two 235s we just call it.
So, inside yesterday's value, we should

1772
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:18,400
So, inside yesterday's value, we should
 

1773
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:24,790
So, inside yesterday's value, we should
rotate. We should rotate now. [snorts]

1774
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:24,800

 

1775
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,630

Yeah, number. Thanks, JD. I would have

1776
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:26,640
Yeah, number. Thanks, JD. I would have
 

1777
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,829
Yeah, number. Thanks, JD. I would have
almost forgotten that. Yeah, you're

1778
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:27,839
almost forgotten that. Yeah, you're
 

1779
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,430
almost forgotten that. Yeah, you're
right. There are some numbers. We talked

1780
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:29,440
right. There are some numbers. We talked
 

1781
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,670
right. There are some numbers. We talked
about it right at the open. Uh numbers

1782
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:31,680
about it right at the open. Uh numbers
 

1783
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,589
about it right at the open. Uh numbers
are

1784
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:33,599
are
 

1785
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,510
are
uh so there's going to have Fed Cook's

1786
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:35,520
uh so there's going to have Fed Cook's
 

1787
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,270
uh so there's going to have Fed Cook's
argument. Then you've got construction

1788
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:37,280
argument. Then you've got construction
 

1789
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,870
argument. Then you've got construction
spending and pending home sales. All

1790
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:38,880
spending and pending home sales. All
 

1791
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,829
spending and pending home sales. All
right,

1792
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:41,839
right,
 

1793
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,589
right,
some buyers just c got caught there at

1794
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:43,599
some buyers just c got caught there at
 

1795
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,630
some buyers just c got caught there at
300. Big delta left up there at 300. So

1796
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:46,640
300. Big delta left up there at 300. So
 

1797
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,069
300. Big delta left up there at 300. So
right now we have 121 lot and an 87 lot

1798
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:50,079
right now we have 121 lot and an 87 lot
 

1799
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,910
right now we have 121 lot and an 87 lot
300. So we need to trade back over 300

1800
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:51,920
300. So we need to trade back over 300
 

1801
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,630
300. So we need to trade back over 300
for them to be safe. There we go. Nice.

1802
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:54,640
for them to be safe. There we go. Nice.
 

1803
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,390
for them to be safe. There we go. Nice.
So still holding this. Still looking

1804
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:56,400
So still holding this. Still looking
 

1805
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:08,150
So still holding this. Still looking
good. We might hit final target here.

1806
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:08,160

 

1807
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,589

Why would we be done for the day? Well,

1808
00:49:09,589 --> 00:49:09,599
Why would we be done for the day? Well,
 

1809
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:10,870
Why would we be done for the day? Well,
it's not that you have to be done, but

1810
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:10,880
it's not that you have to be done, but
 

1811
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,589
it's not that you have to be done, but
if I hit my A+ trade, if I catch a full

1812
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:13,599
if I hit my A+ trade, if I catch a full
 

1813
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:15,990
if I hit my A+ trade, if I catch a full
rotation, what's the reason for me to

1814
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:16,000
rotation, what's the reason for me to
 

1815
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,750
rotation, what's the reason for me to
keep trading? Unless I, you know, maybe

1816
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:17,760
keep trading? Unless I, you know, maybe
 

1817
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,390
keep trading? Unless I, you know, maybe
I can consider

1818
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:20,400
I can consider
 

1819
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,390
I can consider
something like this back down. Maybe

1820
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:22,400
something like this back down. Maybe
 

1821
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,670
something like this back down. Maybe
there's a short to be had on an

1822
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:23,680
there's a short to be had on an
 

1823
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,670
there's a short to be had on an
overextension back down into here.

1824
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:25,680
overextension back down into here.
 

1825
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,829
overextension back down into here.
Possibly. Maybe that happens from 300

1826
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:27,839
Possibly. Maybe that happens from 300
 

1827
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,510
Possibly. Maybe that happens from 300
and I play it back up. But once we go

1828
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:31,520
and I play it back up. But once we go
 

1829
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,510
and I play it back up. But once we go
from a lowhanging fruit to a lowhanging

1830
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:33,520
from a lowhanging fruit to a lowhanging
 

1831
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,190
from a lowhanging fruit to a lowhanging
fruit, you've got to ask what's there

1832
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:35,200
fruit, you've got to ask what's there
 

1833
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,270
fruit, you've got to ask what's there
left to do other than build out

1834
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:37,280
left to do other than build out
 

1835
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,549
left to do other than build out
liquidity, right? But it's personal

1836
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:40,559
liquidity, right? But it's personal
 

1837
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:43,589
liquidity, right? But it's personal
preference. Here we go.

1838
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:43,599
preference. Here we go.
 

1839
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:48,150
preference. Here we go.
Go team. Let's go.

1840
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:48,160

 

1841
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,589

So 340 345 on deck. That's PC from

1842
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:51,599
So 340 345 on deck. That's PC from
 

1843
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:52,710
So 340 345 on deck. That's PC from
previous day. That's where they're

1844
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:52,720
previous day. That's where they're
 

1845
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,430
previous day. That's where they're
trying to lift to.

1846
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:55,440
trying to lift to.
 

1847
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,109
trying to lift to.
You seen some front running in front of

1848
00:49:57,109 --> 00:49:57,119
You seen some front running in front of
 

1849
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,950
You seen some front running in front of
that now.

1850
00:49:58,950 --> 00:49:58,960
that now.
 

1851
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,309
that now.
We have a little node here being

1852
00:50:00,309 --> 00:50:00,319
We have a little node here being
 

1853
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,309
We have a little node here being
developed. And just mark this guy out

1854
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:02,319
developed. And just mark this guy out
 

1855
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:10,710
developed. And just mark this guy out
here on that high time frame. Algo,

1856
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:10,720

 

1857
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:16,790

really good

1858
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:16,800

 

1859
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,630

ES coming into a pivot as well here

1860
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:20,640
ES coming into a pivot as well here
 

1861
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,630
ES coming into a pivot as well here
into some thick areas from yesterday.

1862
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:22,640
into some thick areas from yesterday.
 

1863
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,710
into some thick areas from yesterday.
Really nice lift here. Here we go,

1864
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:24,720
Really nice lift here. Here we go,
 

1865
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,309
Really nice lift here. Here we go,
folks. So, getting ready to try and take

1866
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:26,319
folks. So, getting ready to try and take
 

1867
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:27,910
folks. So, getting ready to try and take
final target. I don't think I'm going to

1868
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:27,920
final target. I don't think I'm going to
 

1869
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,870
final target. I don't think I'm going to
hold on beyond this the 45s. And I guess

1870
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:30,880
hold on beyond this the 45s. And I guess
 

1871
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,630
hold on beyond this the 45s. And I guess
there's an argument to hold on to 420s

1872
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:32,640
there's an argument to hold on to 420s
 

1873
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,630
there's an argument to hold on to 420s
if it really wants to get going.

1874
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:36,640
if it really wants to get going.
 

1875
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,309
if it really wants to get going.
Here we go. Here we go, folks. So, 45s

1876

[snorts]
 

1909
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,829
[snorts]
Okay. Uh, one of you asking the entry.

1910
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:21,839
Okay. Uh, one of you asking the entry.
 

1911
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:23,349
Okay. Uh, one of you asking the entry.
What was the entry? Yes. Well, I didn't

1912
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:23,359
What was the entry? Yes. Well, I didn't
 

1913
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,270
What was the entry? Yes. Well, I didn't
want to trade. We talked about the

1914
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:25,280
want to trade. We talked about the
 

1915
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,670
want to trade. We talked about the
rotation from gray to gray, right? Gray,

1916
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:27,680
rotation from gray to gray, right? Gray,
 

1917
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,950
rotation from gray to gray, right? Gray,
gray, gray, gray. Okay, this is PDC gap

1918
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:30,960
gray, gray, gray. Okay, this is PDC gap
 

1919
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,430
gray, gray, gray. Okay, this is PDC gap
then got filled. Here's your W. Here's a

1920
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:33,440
then got filled. Here's your W. Here's a
 

1921
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,150
then got filled. Here's your W. Here's a
base. We're over

1922
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:36,160
base. We're over
 

1923
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,349
base. We're over
uh weekly value, the 85s, over the 200.

1924
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:39,359
uh weekly value, the 85s, over the 200.
 

1925
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,589
uh weekly value, the 85s, over the 200.
So, I started in here, small size, and

1926
00:51:41,589 --> 00:51:41,599
So, I started in here, small size, and
 

1927
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,430
So, I started in here, small size, and
then adding and then we got that squeeze

1928
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:43,440
then adding and then we got that squeeze
 

1929
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,030
then adding and then we got that squeeze
because now we're back inside previous

1930
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:45,040
because now we're back inside previous
 

1931
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,870
because now we're back inside previous
day's value. Our target is previous

1932
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:46,880
day's value. Our target is previous
 

1933
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,470
day's value. Our target is previous
day's point of control. We expect there

1934
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:48,480
day's point of control. We expect there
 

1935
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,470
day's point of control. We expect there
to be resistance here. they might well

1936
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:50,480
to be resistance here. they might well
 

1937
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,150
to be resistance here. they might well
flush this back down unless they're able

1938
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:52,160
flush this back down unless they're able
 

1939
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,549
flush this back down unless they're able
to catch it and complete the whole

1940
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:54,559
to catch it and complete the whole
 

1941
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,470
to catch it and complete the whole
rotation of the whole of previous day's

1942
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:56,480
rotation of the whole of previous day's
 

1943
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,430
rotation of the whole of previous day's
value. So that was the thesis. Go back

1944
00:51:59,430 --> 00:51:59,440
value. So that was the thesis. Go back
 

1945
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,950
value. So that was the thesis. Go back
to the very beginning of the show and we

1946
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:00,960
to the very beginning of the show and we
 

1947
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,270
to the very beginning of the show and we
talked about it

1948
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:03,280
talked about it
 

1949
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,910
talked about it
like 9:15 around that time. I talked

1950
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:05,920
like 9:15 around that time. I talked
 

1951
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,430
like 9:15 around that time. I talked
about what I'd be looking for today and

1952
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:07,440
about what I'd be looking for today and
 

1953
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,270
about what I'd be looking for today and
I was willing to play both sides. If we

1954
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:09,280
I was willing to play both sides. If we
 

1955
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,030
I was willing to play both sides. If we
had acceptance below, I was willing. If

1956
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:11,040
had acceptance below, I was willing. If
 

1957
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,390
had acceptance below, I was willing. If
we couldn't find acceptance, I was

1958
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:12,400
we couldn't find acceptance, I was
 

1959
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,910
we couldn't find acceptance, I was
willing.

1960
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:15,920

 

1961
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,270

And it's still trying to fill these 40s

1962
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:17,280
And it's still trying to fill these 40s
 

1963
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,510
And it's still trying to fill these 40s
and 45s. I'm out of this now, folks. I'm

1964
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:19,520
and 45s. I'm out of this now, folks. I'm
 

1965
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:25,829
and 45s. I'm out of this now, folks. I'm
out of this now.

1966
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:25,839

 

1967
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:31,190

Vick's just dripping lower.

1968
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:31,200

 

1969
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,549

There's the 40s and 45 fills. So, 42 and

1970
00:52:34,549 --> 00:52:34,559
There's the 40s and 45 fills. So, 42 and
 

1971
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,030
There's the 40s and 45 fills. So, 42 and
45 left up there. Lots of buyers just

1972
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:37,040
45 left up there. Lots of buyers just
 

1973
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,349
45 left up there. Lots of buyers just
got caught up there, I'll tell you that.

1974
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:39,359
got caught up there, I'll tell you that.
 

1975
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,510
got caught up there, I'll tell you that.
Lots and lots and lots of buyers just

1976
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:41,520
Lots and lots and lots of buyers just
 

1977
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,750
Lots and lots and lots of buyers just
got caught up there again on that last

1978
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:43,760
got caught up there again on that last
 

1979
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,750
got caught up there again on that last
push.

1980
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:45,760
push.
 

1981
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,430
push.
They probably want to fill these guys at

1982
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:47,440
They probably want to fill these guys at
 

1983
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,309
They probably want to fill these guys at
40 and 45s, but there are buyers getting

1984
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:50,319
40 and 45s, but there are buyers getting
 

1985
00:52:50,319 --> 00:53:07,190
40 and 45s, but there are buyers getting
caught.

1986
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:07,200

 

1987
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,470

Some sellers trying to force this

1988
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:08,480
Some sellers trying to force this
 

1989
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,230
Some sellers trying to force this
breakdown for this pullback probably

1990
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:10,240
breakdown for this pullback probably
 

1991
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,630
breakdown for this pullback probably
towards 84s, but they haven't filled all

1992
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:12,640
towards 84s, but they haven't filled all
 

1993
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,589
towards 84s, but they haven't filled all
these guys on the book yet at 42s. Have

1994
00:53:15,589 --> 00:53:15,599
these guys on the book yet at 42s. Have
 

1995
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,109
these guys on the book yet at 42s. Have
any of them lifted higher is the

1996
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:17,119
any of them lifted higher is the
 

1997
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,510
any of them lifted higher is the
question.

1998
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:19,520
question.
 

1999
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:25,109
question.
Not really. There was a guy up at 370s

2000
00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:25,119
Not really. There was a guy up at 370s
 

2001
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,270
Not really. There was a guy up at 370s
left. So 345 to 350 is definitely a big

2002
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:29,280
left. So 345 to 350 is definitely a big
 

2003
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,190
left. So 345 to 350 is definitely a big
level. sellers will be looking to drive

2004
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:31,200
level. sellers will be looking to drive
 

2005
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,150
level. sellers will be looking to drive
this back down to 280s and 245s at the

2006
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:34,160
this back down to 280s and 245s at the
 

2007
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,990
this back down to 280s and 245s at the
moment, which is why I'm out is if we go

2008
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:36,000
moment, which is why I'm out is if we go
 

2009
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,069
moment, which is why I'm out is if we go
sideways here and more sellers get

2010
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:38,079
sideways here and more sellers get
 

2011
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,589
sideways here and more sellers get
caught, it's possible they can go for

2012
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:39,599
caught, it's possible they can go for
 

2013
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,589
caught, it's possible they can go for
all the way up here into 420. And you

2014
00:53:41,589 --> 00:53:41,599
all the way up here into 420. And you
 

2015
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:46,710
all the way up here into 420. And you
can't rule it out. Can't rule it out.

2016
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:46,720
can't rule it out. Can't rule it out.
 

2017
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,390
can't rule it out. Can't rule it out.

Here we go.

2024
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:07,040

 

2025
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,790

We know this is a huge level from

2026
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:08,800
We know this is a huge level from
 

2027
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,910
We know this is a huge level from
yesterday and it's a huge level from the

2028
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:11,920
yesterday and it's a huge level from the
 

2029
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,150
yesterday and it's a huge level from the
developing weekly profile. If we get

2030
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:14,160
developing weekly profile. If we get
 

2031
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,589
developing weekly profile. If we get
through 345 350, they could definitely

2032
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:17,599
through 345 350, they could definitely
 

2033
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,790
through 345 350, they could definitely
lift it up to the 420s.

2034
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:20,800
lift it up to the 420s.
 

2035
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,470
lift it up to the 420s.
These are the levels. This is a thick

2036
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:22,480
These are the levels. This is a thick
 

2037
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,390
These are the levels. This is a thick
thick level. It's current value from

2038
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:24,400
thick level. It's current value from
 

2039
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,990
thick level. It's current value from
yesterday. It's what they considered

2040
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:26,000
yesterday. It's what they considered
 

2041
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,990
yesterday. It's what they considered
fair value.

2042
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:32,000

 

2043
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,829

Nice work everyone. Lots of WS in chat.

2044
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:33,839
Nice work everyone. Lots of WS in chat.
 

2045
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,829
Nice work everyone. Lots of WS in chat.
I love that. 600 on 10 plus Apex

2046
00:54:35,829 --> 00:54:35,839
I love that. 600 on 10 plus Apex
 

2047
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,510
I love that. 600 on 10 plus Apex
accounts. 86 grand day. That will do,

2048
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:37,520
accounts. 86 grand day. That will do,
 

2049
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,589
accounts. 86 grand day. That will do,
won't it?

2050
00:54:39,589 --> 00:54:39,599
won't it?
 

2051
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,470
won't it?
That will do. The key here though is

2052
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:42,480
That will do. The key here though is
 

2053
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,630
That will do. The key here though is
that this is planned pre-market. You've

2054
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:44,640
that this is planned pre-market. You've
 

2055
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,030
that this is planned pre-market. You've
got to understand the work gets done

2056
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:47,040
got to understand the work gets done
 

2057
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,870
got to understand the work gets done
before the trade and then it's waiting.

2058
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:48,880
before the trade and then it's waiting.
 

2059
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,030
before the trade and then it's waiting.
You see how I like sat out all of this

2060
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:51,040
You see how I like sat out all of this
 

2061
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,950
You see how I like sat out all of this
in here? I wanted to see what they did.

2062
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:52,960
in here? I wanted to see what they did.
 

2063
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,950
in here? I wanted to see what they did.
Once they gap filled and we found a bid

2064
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:54,960
Once they gap filled and we found a bid
 

2065
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,390
Once they gap filled and we found a bid
and then we started to hold, I was like,

2066
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:56,400
and then we started to hold, I was like,
 

2067
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,829
and then we started to hold, I was like,
"Okay, we're going to squeeze." Like

2068
00:54:57,829 --> 00:54:57,839
"Okay, we're going to squeeze." Like
 

2069
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,829
"Okay, we're going to squeeze." Like
they they've set the trap of shorts

2070
00:54:59,829 --> 00:54:59,839
they they've set the trap of shorts
 

2071
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,270
they they've set the trap of shorts
coming in here in this area I was

2072
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:01,280
coming in here in this area I was
 

2073
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,910
coming in here in this area I was
avoiding.

2074
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:03,920
avoiding.
 

2075
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,910
avoiding.
So, we're getting caught at these 340s

2076
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:05,920
So, we're getting caught at these 340s
 

2077
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,109
So, we're getting caught at these 340s
now. 340, 350s that we talked about.

2078
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:09,119
now. 340, 350s that we talked about.
 

2079
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,829
now. 340, 350s that we talked about.
There's still a seller at 42 and 45. So,

2080
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:11,839
There's still a seller at 42 and 45. So,
 

2081
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:13,510
There's still a seller at 42 and 45. So,
the longer we go sideways, the more

2082
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:13,520
the longer we go sideways, the more
 

2083
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,950
the longer we go sideways, the more
chance they've got squeezing upside

2084
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:14,960
chance they've got squeezing upside
 

2085
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,990
chance they've got squeezing upside
again. But, we're starting to develop

2086
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:18,000
again. But, we're starting to develop
 

2087
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,790
again. But, we're starting to develop
a node here. So if we lose this node,

2088
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:20,800
a node here. So if we lose this node,
 

2089
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,069
a node here. So if we lose this node,
then we're probably going to flush down

2090
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:22,079
then we're probably going to flush down
 

2091
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,990
then we're probably going to flush down
to 80s, right? Unless they protect this

2092
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:24,000
to 80s, right? Unless they protect this
 

2093
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,750
to 80s, right? Unless they protect this
300 level. So here we go. So they're

2094
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:25,760
300 level. So here we go. So they're
 

2095
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,750
300 level. So here we go. So they're
starting to try and lose this node or

2096
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:27,760
starting to try and lose this node or
 

2097
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,790
starting to try and lose this node or
the pullback that we talked about.

2098
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:30,800
the pullback that we talked about.
 

2099
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,549
the pullback that we talked about.
And you can watch these sort of 300s,

2100
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:32,559
And you can watch these sort of 300s,
 

2101
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,069
And you can watch these sort of 300s,
this low volume node. If they catch it

2102
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:34,079
this low volume node. If they catch it
 

2103
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,150
this low volume node. If they catch it
here at sort of 315s, they might want to

2104
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:36,160
here at sort of 315s, they might want to
 

2105
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,549
here at sort of 315s, they might want to
try and do one nasty resqueeze higher.

2106
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:38,559
try and do one nasty resqueeze higher.
 

2107
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:39,910
try and do one nasty resqueeze higher.
Let's have a look at the MAG. I give you

2108
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:39,920
Let's have a look at the MAG. I give you
 

2109
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,270
Let's have a look at the MAG. I give you
a readout there. Tesla, uh, 1.20% up

2110
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:43,280
a readout there. Tesla, uh, 1.20% up
 

2111
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,150
a readout there. Tesla, uh, 1.20% up
now. Nvidia 1.35% up. Microsoft the

2112
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:46,160
now. Nvidia 1.35% up. Microsoft the
 

2113
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,630
now. Nvidia 1.35% up. Microsoft the
weakest one today, 0.66% down. Meta one

2114
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:50,640
weakest one today, 0.66% down. Meta one
 

2115
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,630
weakest one today, 0.66% down. Meta one
uh 0.19% up. Google 1.04% up. Amazon a

2116
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:54,640
uh 0.19% up. Google 1.04% up. Amazon a
 

2117
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,710
uh 0.19% up. Google 1.04% up. Amazon a
quarter% up and Apple back green again

2118
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:56,720
quarter% up and Apple back green again
 

2119
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,430
quarter% up and Apple back green again
0.17% up. So they held that low volume

2120
00:55:59,430 --> 00:55:59,440
0.17% up. So they held that low volume
 

2121
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,510
0.17% up. So they held that low volume
node. Right? No followthrough. They're

2122
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:01,520
node. Right? No followthrough. They're
 

2123
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,030
node. Right? No followthrough. They're
trying to force a resqueeze through

2124
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:03,040
trying to force a resqueeze through
 

2125
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,150
trying to force a resqueeze through
this. All right. That's what they're

2126
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:04,160
this. All right. That's what they're
 

2127
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,750
this. All right. That's what they're
trying to do. I'm not touching this at

2128
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:05,760
trying to do. I'm not touching this at
 

2129
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,349
trying to do. I'm not touching this at
this point. If anything, I'm going to

2130
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:07,359
this point. If anything, I'm going to
 

2131
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,430
this point. If anything, I'm going to
look for a fade. All right. If anything,

2132
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:09,440
look for a fade. All right. If anything,
 

2133
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,190
look for a fade. All right. If anything,
I'm going to look for a fade back down

2134
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:11,200
I'm going to look for a fade back down
 

2135
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,230
I'm going to look for a fade back down
here or if we even poke up here and a

2136
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:14,240
here or if we even poke up here and a
 

2137
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,470
here or if we even poke up here and a
rotation of value again. Right. I'm

2138
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:16,480
rotation of value again. Right. I'm
 

2139
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,990
rotation of value again. Right. I'm
definitely not going to be playing long

2140
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:18,000
definitely not going to be playing long
 

2141
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,750
definitely not going to be playing long
up here. That's not what I'm going to be

2142
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:19,760
up here. That's not what I'm going to be
 

2143
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,390
up here. That's not what I'm going to be
doing. But we have to let it develop

2144
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:22,400
doing. But we have to let it develop
 

2145
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,349
doing. But we have to let it develop
now.

2146
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:25,359
now.
 

2147
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,910
now.
Would that be an A+ for me? No.

2148
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:27,920
Would that be an A+ for me? No.
 

2149
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,549
Would that be an A+ for me? No.
Yesterday was an A+ in the afternoon. Uh

2150
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:30,559
Yesterday was an A+ in the afternoon. Uh
 

2151
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:31,829
Yesterday was an A+ in the afternoon. Uh
if I was actually here for it. All

2152
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:31,839
if I was actually here for it. All
 

2153
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,789
if I was actually here for it. All
right. Because yesterday was a protrend

2154
00:56:34,789 --> 00:56:34,799
right. Because yesterday was a protrend
 

2155
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,670
right. Because yesterday was a protrend
trade [snorts] where we left value. We

2156
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:37,680
trade [snorts] where we left value. We
 

2157
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,549
trade [snorts] where we left value. We
had buyers stuck. We trapped a load of

2158
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:40,559
had buyers stuck. We trapped a load of
 

2159
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,510
had buyers stuck. We trapped a load of
participants up here. Right? Remember we

2160
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:43,520
participants up here. Right? Remember we
 

2161
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,430
participants up here. Right? Remember we
had this fade and this fade. I tried all

2162
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:45,440
had this fade and this fade. I tried all
 

2163
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,190
had this fade and this fade. I tried all
of these and then I left for lunch and

2164
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:47,200
of these and then I left for lunch and
 

2165
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,750
of these and then I left for lunch and
then finally it did the huge move. All

2166
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:49,760
then finally it did the huge move. All
 

2167
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,069
then finally it did the huge move. All
right. So yesterday would have been A+

2168
00:56:52,069 --> 00:56:52,079
right. So yesterday would have been A+
 

2169
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,030
right. So yesterday would have been A+
if I was here for it. Today is a counter

2170
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:55,040
if I was here for it. Today is a counter
 

2171
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:00,230
if I was here for it. Today is a counter
trend long. So it's not A+.

2172
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:00,240
trend long. So it's not A+.
 

2173
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,230
trend long. So it's not A+.
It's a relief rally right on the higher

2174
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:02,240
It's a relief rally right on the higher
 

2175
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,589
It's a relief rally right on the higher
time frame.

2176
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:05,599

 

2177
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,109

Keep getting stuck up here at the

2178
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:07,119
Keep getting stuck up here at the
 

2179
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:19,430
Keep getting stuck up here at the
moment.

2180
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:19,440

 

2181
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,950

starting to leave volume here. It's just

2182
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:20,960
starting to leave volume here. It's just
 

2183
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,710
starting to leave volume here. It's just
a little bit trappy down here, but there

2184
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:22,720
a little bit trappy down here, but there
 

2185
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,270
a little bit trappy down here, but there
could be a flush down to these 280s and

2186
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:25,280
could be a flush down to these 280s and
 

2187
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,710
could be a flush down to these 280s and
even back down to value if they're

2188
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:26,720
even back down to value if they're
 

2189
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,470
even back down to value if they're
ready. I just wonder if they need to do

2190
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:28,480
ready. I just wonder if they need to do
 

2191
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,789
ready. I just wonder if they need to do
one more push higher first. Don't like

2192
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:30,799
one more push higher first. Don't like
 

2193
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,630
one more push higher first. Don't like
this flat top up here. I'd rather see

2194
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:32,640
this flat top up here. I'd rather see
 

2195
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,470
this flat top up here. I'd rather see
some big exits up there. If we have a

2196
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:34,480
some big exits up there. If we have a
 

2197
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,950
some big exits up there. If we have a
look

2198
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:38,960

 

2199
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,710

and there are some buyers caught over

2200
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:40,720
and there are some buyers caught over
 

2201
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,190
and there are some buyers caught over
35s,

2202
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:43,200
35s,
 

2203
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,950
35s,
there are some buyers caught over 35.

2204
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:44,960
there are some buyers caught over 35.
 

2205
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,549
there are some buyers caught over 35.
It's not the prettiest setup. I'd rather

2206
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:46,559
It's not the prettiest setup. I'd rather
 

2207
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:57,910
It's not the prettiest setup. I'd rather
see one more squeeze out. I think

2208
00:57:57,910 --> 00:57:57,920

 

2209
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,270

while this does this, folks, I'm just

2210
00:57:59,270 --> 00:57:59,280
while this does this, folks, I'm just
 

2211
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,710
while this does this, folks, I'm just
going to get a quick refill on my tea.

2212
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:00,720
going to get a quick refill on my tea.
 

2213
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:47,109
going to get a quick refill on my tea.
All right, and I'll be right back.

2214
00:58:47,109 --> 00:58:47,119

 

2215
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:48,710

Okay.

2216
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:48,720
Okay.
 

2217
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,230
Okay.
So, do me a favor. Smash that like

had a nice well over 100 point trade

2222
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:54,160
had a nice well over 100 point trade
 

2223
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,069
had a nice well over 100 point trade
today. If we look where you guys got it,

2224
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:56,079
today. If we look where you guys got it,
 

2225
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:02,630
today. If we look where you guys got it,
if you got full TP,

2226
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:02,640

 

2227
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:08,150

right, either from here

2228
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:08,160

 

2229
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,549

or 118 points or even if you joined a

2230
00:59:10,549 --> 00:59:10,559
or 118 points or even if you joined a
 

2231
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:15,670
or 118 points or even if you joined a
bit later for the reclaim up here.

2232
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:15,680

 

2233
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,950

What did you get out of that? Uh,

2234
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:18,960
What did you get out of that? Uh,
 

2235
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,829
What did you get out of that? Uh,
still 50 plus points. Well over well

2236
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:21,839
still 50 plus points. Well over well
 

2237
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:27,816
still 50 plus points. Well over well
over 85 points. really nice.

2238
00:59:27,816 --> 00:59:27,826

 

2239
00:59:27,826 --> 00:59:29,109

[snorts] So, still holding flow zones

2240
00:59:29,109 --> 00:59:29,119
[snorts] So, still holding flow zones
 

2241
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,390
[snorts] So, still holding flow zones
are starting to play catch-up. You can

2242
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:30,400
are starting to play catch-up. You can
 

2243
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,390
are starting to play catch-up. You can
see this big node here. This is what's

2244
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:32,400
see this big node here. This is what's
 

2245
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,990
see this big node here. This is what's
important right now. I would like to see

2246
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:34,000
important right now. I would like to see
 

2247
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,829
important right now. I would like to see
this do one squeeze higher. The reason

2248
00:59:35,829 --> 00:59:35,839
this do one squeeze higher. The reason
 

2249
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,910
this do one squeeze higher. The reason
being I don't love the top of this

2250
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:37,920
being I don't love the top of this
 

2251
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,549
being I don't love the top of this
auction right now. But it might be that

2252
00:59:40,549 --> 00:59:40,559
auction right now. But it might be that
 

2253
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,950
auction right now. But it might be that
they will fade it anyway. We are

2254
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:42,960
they will fade it anyway. We are
 

2255
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,549
they will fade it anyway. We are
overextended,

2256
00:59:44,549 --> 00:59:44,559
overextended,
 

2257
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,309
overextended,
but I would like to see one squeeze

2258
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:46,319
but I would like to see one squeeze
 

2259
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:47,990
but I would like to see one squeeze
higher here, trap a load more bulls

2260
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:48,000
higher here, trap a load more bulls
 

2261
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,390
higher here, trap a load more bulls
before we think about a rotation.

2262
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:52,400

 

2263
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,589

What time frame do I use on my

2264
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:53,599
What time frame do I use on my
 

2265
00:59:53,599 --> 01:00:21,589
What time frame do I use on my
footprint? An M1 and an M5 for me.

2266
01:00:21,589 --> 01:00:21,599

 

2267
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,190

So if you think about those in Discord,

2268
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:23,200
So if you think about those in Discord,
 

2269
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,990
So if you think about those in Discord,
if you look at what I said uh

2270
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:26,000
if you look at what I said uh
 

2271
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,870
if you look at what I said uh
at what was this 7 7:30 or 8:30 this

2272
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:28,880
at what was this 7 7:30 or 8:30 this
 

2273
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,309
at what was this 7 7:30 or 8:30 this
morning, sellers came in at heavy at

2274
01:00:30,309 --> 01:00:30,319
morning, sellers came in at heavy at
 

2275
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:32,789
morning, sellers came in at heavy at
140, buy stuck over 200. So squeeze can

2276
01:00:32,789 --> 01:00:32,799
140, buy stuck over 200. So squeeze can
 

2277
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,270
140, buy stuck over 200. So squeeze can
happen on reclaims those two areas. So

2278
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:35,280
happen on reclaims those two areas. So
 

2279
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:40,150
happen on reclaims those two areas. So
140 to 200 140 right down here. We held

2280
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:40,160
140 to 200 140 right down here. We held
 

2281
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,190
140 to 200 140 right down here. We held
reclaimed 200 squeeze squeeze squeeze

2282
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:43,200
reclaimed 200 squeeze squeeze squeeze
 

2283
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,789
reclaimed 200 squeeze squeeze squeeze
squeeze. So we're in that squeeze that

2284
01:00:44,789 --> 01:00:44,799
squeeze. So we're in that squeeze that
 

2285
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:58,309
squeeze. So we're in that squeeze that
we talked about pre-market.

2286
01:00:58,309 --> 01:00:58,319

 

2287
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,230

Do I use daily time frame to draw

2288
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:00,240
Do I use daily time frame to draw
 

2289
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,950
Do I use daily time frame to draw
previous day value area low? No, I use

2290
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:02,960
previous day value area low? No, I use
 

2291
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,870
previous day value area low? No, I use
the lowest possible time frame like a

2292
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:04,880
the lowest possible time frame like a
 

2293
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,430
the lowest possible time frame like a
one minute and I draw it on the New York

2294
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:07,440
one minute and I draw it on the New York
 

2295
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,030
one minute and I draw it on the New York
session. I'm not interested in what

2296
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:09,040
session. I'm not interested in what
 

2297
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,430
session. I'm not interested in what
happens beyond New York session. Okay,

2298
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:11,440
happens beyond New York session. Okay,
 

2299
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,589
happens beyond New York session. Okay,
we keep coming back down and rejecting

2300
01:01:13,589 --> 01:01:13,599
we keep coming back down and rejecting
 

2301
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,670
we keep coming back down and rejecting
this. So then if they cannot reclaim

2302
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:15,680
this. So then if they cannot reclaim
 

2303
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,750
this. So then if they cannot reclaim
this soon, you can see it shifted PC up

2304
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:17,760
this soon, you can see it shifted PC up
 

2305
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,430
this soon, you can see it shifted PC up
here. Now if they can't reclaim this

2306
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:19,440
here. Now if they can't reclaim this
 

2307
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,670
here. Now if they can't reclaim this
soon, there will be a flush. Buyers are

2308
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:21,680
soon, there will be a flush. Buyers are
 

2309
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,910
soon, there will be a flush. Buyers are
trying to get up into here right now,

2310
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:23,920
trying to get up into here right now,
 

2311
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,589
trying to get up into here right now,
right? They're trying to reclaim the

2312
01:01:25,589 --> 01:01:25,599
right? They're trying to reclaim the
 

2313
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,670
right? They're trying to reclaim the
whole of value. If they keep rejecting

2314
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:27,680
whole of value. If they keep rejecting
 

2315
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,390
whole of value. If they keep rejecting
this, this or this is possible. Very,

2316
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:30,400
this, this or this is possible. Very,
 

2317
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,789
this, this or this is possible. Very,
very, very possible.

2318
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:32,799
very, very possible.
 

2319
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,950
very, very possible.
This is a big drive. Look how big it is.

2320
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:34,960
This is a big drive. Look how big it is.
 

2321
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,630
This is a big drive. Look how big it is.
And it's very it's lacking a lot of

2322
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:36,640
And it's very it's lacking a lot of
 

2323
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:44,230
And it's very it's lacking a lot of
structure. It's got no structure in it.

2324
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:44,240

 

2325
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,150

Thanks for your read, Alex. Picked up 40

Thanks for your read, Alex. Picked up 40
 

2327
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,870
Thanks for your read, Alex. Picked up 40
points on that push. Lovely. Nice work.

2328
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:48,880
points on that push. Lovely. Nice work.
 

2329
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,710
points on that push. Lovely. Nice work.
Nice work. That'll get the day done,

2330
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:50,720
Nice work. That'll get the day done,
 

2331
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,270
Nice work. That'll get the day done,
won't it?

2332
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:53,280
won't it?
 

2333
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,750
won't it?
That will get the day done.

2334
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:57,760

 

2335
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,549

I would love one more drive higher. Uh

2336
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:00,559
I would love one more drive higher. Uh
 

2337
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:03,430
I would love one more drive higher. Uh
because I'm I'm thinking about now of

2338
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:03,440
because I'm I'm thinking about now of
 

2339
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,990
because I'm I'm thinking about now of
fading the edges. I know I hate fading

2340
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:06,000
fading the edges. I know I hate fading
 

2341
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,630
fading the edges. I know I hate fading
the edges, but

2342
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:08,640
the edges, but
 

2343
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,789
the edges, but
one more drive high would be nice.

2344
01:02:12,789 --> 01:02:12,799
one more drive high would be nice.
 

2345
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,270
one more drive high would be nice.
We are starting to build a huge amount

2346
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:15,280
We are starting to build a huge amount
 

2347
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,670
We are starting to build a huge amount
of volume up here now. And we're

2348
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:17,680
of volume up here now. And we're
 

2349
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,990
of volume up here now. And we're
starting to leave it.

2350
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:22,000

 

2351
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,309

There are bids here at 305, 300, 292. So

2352
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:26,319
There are bids here at 305, 300, 292. So
 

2353
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:28,069
There are bids here at 305, 300, 292. So
all in this low volume node is where

2354
01:02:28,069 --> 01:02:28,079
all in this low volume node is where
 

2355
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:31,270
all in this low volume node is where
they are.

2356
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:31,280
they are.
 

2357
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,510
they are.
Just trying to be patient here.

2358
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:35,520

 

2359
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,670

Some decent delta transaction at 300

2360
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:37,680
Some decent delta transaction at 300
 

2361

2367
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,950

leaving this volume now. So probably

2368
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:48,960
leaving this volume now. So probably
 

2369
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,190
leaving this volume now. So probably
looking at either this gray box or this

2370
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:51,200
looking at either this gray box or this
 

2371
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,349
looking at either this gray box or this
gray box to see if buyers defend. They

2372
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:53,359
gray box to see if buyers defend. They
 

2373
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:55,190
gray box to see if buyers defend. They
might very well not defend. They will

2374
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:55,200
might very well not defend. They will
 

2375
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,990
might very well not defend. They will
have to defend 240.

2376
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:58,000
have to defend 240.
 

2377
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,870
have to defend 240.
If they fail to to defend 240 is a

2378
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:00,880
If they fail to to defend 240 is a
 

2379
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,630
If they fail to to defend 240 is a
failure of a reclaim of the previous

failure of a reclaim of the previous
 

2381
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:10,230
failure of a reclaim of the previous

So, we just filled these guys into 300.

01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:21,839
So, we just filled these guys into 300.

So, we just filled these guys into 300.
There's still a guy small size at 92 and

There's still a guy small size at 92 and

another guy adding at 80 now looking to
 

2393
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,470
another guy adding at 80 now looking to
be picked up. So now what you want to

2394
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:28,480
be picked up. So now what you want to
 

2395
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,270
be picked up. So now what you want to
see if you're a seller, if the market's

2396
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:31,280
see if you're a seller, if the market's
 

2397
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,510
see if you're a seller, if the market's
kind, you want a retest of this to sell.

2398
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:33,520
kind, you want a retest of this to sell.
 

2399
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,349
kind, you want a retest of this to sell.
But this is counter trend and I'd be

2400
01:03:35,349 --> 01:03:35,359
But this is counter trend and I'd be
 

2401
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:36,950
But this is counter trend and I'd be
very cautious about this at the moment.

2402
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:36,960
very cautious about this at the moment.
 

2403
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,630
very cautious about this at the moment.
That's the only thing making me feel a

2404
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:38,640
That's the only thing making me feel a
 

2405
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:43,109
That's the only thing making me feel a
bit iffy about this right now.

2406
01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:43,119

 

2407
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,670

I don't love Let me see the high of this

2408
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:45,680
I don't love Let me see the high of this
 

2409
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:50,870
I don't love Let me see the high of this
auction.

2410
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:50,880

 

2411
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,150

I mean, there definitely has been

2412
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:52,160
I mean, there definitely has been
 

2413
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,390
I mean, there definitely has been
passive selling into 40s all day long,

2414
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:54,400
passive selling into 40s all day long,
 

2415
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,470
passive selling into 40s all day long,
but I just don't love the look of it. I

2416
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:56,480
but I just don't love the look of it. I
 

2417
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,750
but I just don't love the look of it. I
would love it if there was a bit more

2418
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:57,760
would love it if there was a bit more
 

2419
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,670
would love it if there was a bit more
excess up there. I could drive through

2420
01:03:59,670 --> 01:03:59,680
excess up there. I could drive through
 

2421
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,630
excess up there. I could drive through
to 50 in a failure. When I talk about

2422
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:02,640
to 50 in a failure. When I talk about
 

2423
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,470
to 50 in a failure. When I talk about
that is like we've we've had a passive

2424
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:04,480
that is like we've we've had a passive
 

2425
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,430
that is like we've we've had a passive
seller at 40s and above here, but a good

2426
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:07,440
seller at 40s and above here, but a good
 

2427
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,750
seller at 40s and above here, but a good
high would be something like this, you

2428
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:09,760
high would be something like this, you
 

2429
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,349
high would be something like this, you
know, where we leave all the buyers

2430
01:04:11,349 --> 01:04:11,359
know, where we leave all the buyers
 

2431
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:16,309
know, where we leave all the buyers
trapped up here and then can offer this.

2432
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:16,319
trapped up here and then can offer this.
 

2433
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:17,829
trapped up here and then can offer this.
But hey, we don't always get exactly

2434
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:17,839
But hey, we don't always get exactly
 

2435
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:19,510
But hey, we don't always get exactly
what we want. Like I talk about all the

what we want. Like I talk about all the

01:05:56,309 --> 01:05:56,319
low volume node. We have we don't have
 

2491
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:57,990
low volume node. We have we don't have
much excess up here. So, I think it's

2492
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:58,000
much excess up here. So, I think it's
 

2493
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,349
much excess up here. So, I think it's
possible if they build lots of shorts

2494
01:05:59,349 --> 01:05:59,359
possible if they build lots of shorts
 

2495
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:01,430
possible if they build lots of shorts
into here and we find acceptance. It's

2496
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:01,440
into here and we find acceptance. It's
 

2497
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,190
into here and we find acceptance. It's
possible. I'm not going to join the long

2498
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:03,200
possible. I'm not going to join the long
 

2499
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,190
possible. I'm not going to join the long
now. All right. The long the cheap long

2500
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:05,200
now. All right. The long the cheap long
 

2501
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,549
now. All right. The long the cheap long
was down here. All right. Remember, we

2502
01:06:06,549 --> 01:06:06,559
was down here. All right. Remember, we
 

2503
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:09,990
was down here. All right. Remember, we
were joining in discount under previous

2504
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,000
were joining in discount under previous
 

2505
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,950
were joining in discount under previous
days value and at previous day's value.

2506
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:12,960
days value and at previous day's value.
 

2507
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,950
days value and at previous day's value.
All right, we're now at fair value. I

2508
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:14,960
All right, we're now at fair value. I
 

2509
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,470
All right, we're now at fair value. I
don't want to join at fair value to get

2510
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:16,480
don't want to join at fair value to get
 

2511
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,910
don't want to join at fair value to get
up to an extreme. So, I'd rather wait,

2512
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:19,920
up to an extreme. So, I'd rather wait,
 

2513
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,309
up to an extreme. So, I'd rather wait,
let it go up there or let it fail here

2514
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:22,319
let it go up there or let it fail here
 

2515
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:25,109
let it go up there or let it fail here
for the trade back down inside if I'm

2516
01:06:25,109 --> 01:06:25,119
for the trade back down inside if I'm
 

2517
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:27,020
for the trade back down inside if I'm
going to take another trade now.

2518
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:27,030
going to take another trade now.
 

2519
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:40,120
going to take another trade now.
[snorts]

2520
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:40,130

 

2521
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:45,750

[snorts]

2522
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:45,760

 

2523
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,510

Waiting for the pullback, Tim. Yeah. Um,

2524
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:47,520
Waiting for the pullback, Tim. Yeah. Um,
 

2525
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,150
Waiting for the pullback, Tim. Yeah. Um,
and if you're waiting for the pullback,

2526
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:50,160
and if you're waiting for the pullback,
 

2527
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,549
and if you're waiting for the pullback,
the best area is going to be here,

2528
01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:52,559
the best area is going to be here,
 

2529
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,069
the best area is going to be here,
right? So, if they do

2530
01:06:56,069 --> 01:06:56,079
right? So, if they do
 

2531
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,990
right? So, if they do
something like this, or maybe it's just

2532
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:58,000
something like this, or maybe it's just
 

2533
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,910
something like this, or maybe it's just
like this, or maybe they don't even do

2534
01:06:59,910 --> 01:06:59,920
like this, or maybe they don't even do
 

2535
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,309
like this, or maybe they don't even do
that. Maybe they just do that. Or maybe

2536
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:02,319
that. Maybe they just do that. Or maybe
 

2537
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:05,029
that. Maybe they just do that. Or maybe
they do this. Right? This is the area

2538
01:07:05,029 --> 01:07:05,039
they do this. Right? This is the area
 

2539
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,870
they do this. Right? This is the area
that buyers are going to need to defend,

2540
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:08,880
that buyers are going to need to defend,
 

2541
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,670
that buyers are going to need to defend,
right? Because this is the edge of value

2542
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:11,680
right? Because this is the edge of value
 

2543
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,589
right? Because this is the edge of value
based on yesterday, right? This is fair

2544
01:07:13,589 --> 01:07:13,599
based on yesterday, right? This is fair
 

2545
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,750
based on yesterday, right? This is fair
value. This is the extreme high. This is

2546
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:15,760
value. This is the extreme high. This is
 

2547
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,510
value. This is the extreme high. This is
the extreme low based on value. We

2548
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:17,520
the extreme low based on value. We
 

2549
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:25,316
the extreme low based on value. We
bought discount.

2550
01:07:25,316 --> 01:07:25,326

 

2551
01:07:25,326 --> 01:07:27,589

[snorts]

2552
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:27,599

 

2553
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,829

Buyers now caught there. So that's more

2554
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:29,839
Buyers now caught there. So that's more
 

2555
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:31,750
Buyers now caught there. So that's more
excess up there. Let's see if they get

2556
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:31,760
excess up there. Let's see if they get
 

2557
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,829
excess up there. Let's see if they get
follow through. Buyers now caught above

2558
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:33,839
follow through. Buyers now caught above
 

2559
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:36,950
follow through. Buyers now caught above
45 into that previous day value.

2560
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:36,960
45 into that previous day value.
 

2561
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:43,001
45 into that previous day value.
That's better excess on this candle.

2562
01:07:43,001 --> 01:07:43,011

 

2563
01:07:43,011 --> 01:07:44,630

[snorts] Still adding. They're still

2564
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:44,640
[snorts] Still adding. They're still
 

2565
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,150
[snorts] Still adding. They're still
sellers are still adding above. All the

2566
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:46,160
sellers are still adding above. All the
 

2567
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,430
sellers are still adding above. All the
time they add above, I don't like it

2568
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:47,440
time they add above, I don't like it
 

2569
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,789
time they add above, I don't like it
because it's like it's attracting the

2570
01:07:48,789 --> 01:07:48,799
because it's like it's attracting the
 

2571
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:50,390
because it's like it's attracting the
market to come and grab the liquidity

2572
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:50,400
market to come and grab the liquidity
 

2573
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,910
market to come and grab the liquidity
all the way up into 60s now.

2574
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:53,920
all the way up into 60s now.
 

2575
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,470
all the way up into 60s now.
That push definitely trapped some buyers

2576
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:56,480
That push definitely trapped some buyers
 

2577
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,190
That push definitely trapped some buyers
up there over 35s. It's all buy side

2578
01:07:59,190 --> 01:07:59,200
up there over 35s. It's all buy side
 

2579
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,750
up there over 35s. It's all buy side
over 35s right now. So sellers will want

2580
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:01,760
over 35s right now. So sellers will want
 

2581
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,910
over 35s right now. So sellers will want
to defend 35s to see follow through.

2582
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:05,920
to defend 35s to see follow through.
 

2583
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,190
to defend 35s to see follow through.
If [snorts] they can't do that, then a

2584
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:07,200
If [snorts] they can't do that, then a
 

2585
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,910
If [snorts] they can't do that, then a
squeeze is on.

2586
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:09,920
squeeze is on.
 

2587
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,630
squeeze is on.
So here's 35. Check through the 35.

2588
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:12,640
So here's 35. Check through the 35.
 

2589
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,150
So here's 35. Check through the 35.
Squeeze is on now. So they've got a

2590
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:14,160
Squeeze is on now. So they've got a
 

2591
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,910
Squeeze is on now. So they've got a
chance to push this and create more

2592
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:15,920
chance to push this and create more
 

2593
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,910
chance to push this and create more
excess. So still waiting. I'm not

2594
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:17,920
excess. So still waiting. I'm not
 

2595
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,149
excess. So still waiting. I'm not
trading this long. Like I said, it very

2596
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:20,159
trading this long. Like I said, it very
 

2597
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:23,349
trading this long. Like I said, it very
well might come up here. I'll just wait.

2598
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:23,359
well might come up here. I'll just wait.
 

2599
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:28,870
well might come up here. I'll just wait.
So reclaim. Here's the two leg.

2600
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:28,880

 

2601
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,709

Here's the hold of low volume. We never

2602
01:08:30,709 --> 01:08:30,719
Here's the hold of low volume. We never
 

2603
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:32,870
Here's the hold of low volume. We never
get down into this. They reclaim. They

2604
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:32,880
get down into this. They reclaim. They
 

2605
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,669
get down into this. They reclaim. They
trap at 35 and now they're looking for

2606
01:08:35,669 --> 01:08:35,679
trap at 35 and now they're looking for
 

2607
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:41,669
trap at 35 and now they're looking for
the expansion up.

2608
01:08:41,669 --> 01:08:41,679

 

2609
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:44,070

Okay, so lots of sellers came in here.

2610
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:44,080
Okay, so lots of sellers came in here.
 

2611
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,470
Okay, so lots of sellers came in here.
Sellers came in there from sort of 31

2612
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:46,480
Sellers came in there from sort of 31
 

2613
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,870
Sellers came in there from sort of 31
all the way down to 300. So it's all

2614
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:48,880
all the way down to 300. So it's all
 

2615
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,309
all the way down to 300. So it's all
those sellers stops getting run down.

2616
01:08:50,309 --> 01:08:50,319
those sellers stops getting run down.
 

2617
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:51,669
those sellers stops getting run down.
We're very close. Someone just asked

2618
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:51,679
We're very close. Someone just asked
 

2619
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:53,269
We're very close. Someone just asked
about previous days value high. So we've

2620
01:08:53,269 --> 01:08:53,279
about previous days value high. So we've
 

2621
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,630
about previous days value high. So we've
got one node here that we're about to

2622
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:54,640
got one node here that we're about to
 

2623
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,550
got one node here that we're about to
trade into. Once we get above that,

2624
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:56,560
trade into. Once we get above that,
 

2625
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,470
trade into. Once we get above that,
we've got previous day value high and

2626
01:08:58,470 --> 01:08:58,480
we've got previous day value high and
 

2627
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,709
we've got previous day value high and
then previous day high. You just never

2628
01:09:00,709 --> 01:09:00,719
then previous day high. You just never
 

2629
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,430
then previous day high. You just never
know. You just never know. But this is

2630
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:03,440
know. You just never know. But this is
 

2631
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,269
know. You just never know. But this is
not an area you want to be uh a new

2632
01:09:05,269 --> 01:09:05,279
not an area you want to be uh a new
 

2633
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,470
not an area you want to be uh a new
money long in. That's for sure.

2634
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:08,480
money long in. That's for sure.
 

2635
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,950
money long in. That's for sure.
Big old squeeze. And maybe ES to those

2636
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:10,960
Big old squeeze. And maybe ES to those
 

2637
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,349
Big old squeeze. And maybe ES to those
900s is possible.

2638
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:13,359
900s is possible.
 

2639
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:17,590
900s is possible.
Big old squeeze out.

2640
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:17,600

 

2641
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:22,550

Big old squeeze out.

2642
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:22,560

 

2643
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,309

And if we come back under all these

2644
01:09:24,309 --> 01:09:24,319
And if we come back under all these
 

2645
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,550
And if we come back under all these
levels we just put in, then we can get

2646
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:26,560
levels we just put in, then we can get
 

2647
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,870
levels we just put in, then we can get
very aggressive lower. But right now,

2648
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:28,880
very aggressive lower. But right now,
 

2649
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:41,430
very aggressive lower. But right now,
everything's bullish.

2650
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:41,440

 

2651
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,309

ing this excess here. Who's this buyer

2652
01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:44,319
ing this excess here. Who's this buyer
 

2653
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:53,510
ing this excess here. Who's this buyer
that just came in? 54s and 62s.

2654
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:53,520

 

2655
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,110

Value area high now 46s on the day. See

2656
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:57,120
Value area high now 46s on the day. See
 

2657
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:09,270
Value area high now 46s on the day. See
if they rebid this or not.

2658
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:09,280

 

2659
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,709

Buyers will want to hold this shelf. If

2660
01:10:10,709 --> 01:10:10,719
Buyers will want to hold this shelf. If
 

2661
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:12,630
Buyers will want to hold this shelf. If
we lose this shelf now, then we've now

2662
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:12,640
we lose this shelf now, then we've now
 

2663
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:18,870
we lose this shelf now, then we've now
got excess. Buyers will want to rebid

2664
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:18,880

 

2665
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,390

around here. Previous day point of

2666
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:20,400
around here. Previous day point of
 

2667
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,149
around here. Previous day point of
control. This shelf, current day point

01:10:22,149 --> 01:10:22,159
control. This shelf, current day point
 

2669
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:24,390
control. This shelf, current day point
control to complete it. If we lose this

2670
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:24,400
control to complete it. If we lose this
 

2671
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,910
control to complete it. If we lose this
at any point today though, we are

2672
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:25,920
at any point today though, we are
 

2673
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,189
at any point today though, we are
playing short now under here. if we lose

2674
01:10:29,189 --> 01:10:29,199
playing short now under here. if we lose
 

2675
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:30,950
playing short now under here. if we lose
it because we have a low volume node

2676
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:30,960
it because we have a low volume node
 

2677
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,310
it because we have a low volume node
with now with lots of people trapped

2678
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:34,320
with now with lots of people trapped
 

2679
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,030
with now with lots of people trapped
for a rotation. Not playing it before

2680
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:37,040
for a rotation. Not playing it before
 

2681
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,790
for a rotation. Not playing it before
that point though. Need everyone

2682
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:38,800
that point though. Need everyone
 

2683
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,790
that point though. Need everyone
trapped. [snorts]

2684
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:40,800
trapped. [snorts]
 

2685
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,709
trapped. [snorts]
So these are the 46ers we just talked

2686
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:42,719
So these are the 46ers we just talked
 

2687
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:50,709
So these are the 46ers we just talked
about.

2688
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:50,719

 

2689
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:52,470

How did I know to stay out? I don't

2690
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:52,480
How did I know to stay out? I don't
 

2691
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,590
How did I know to stay out? I don't
know. Probably just too much experience.

2692
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:55,600
know. Probably just too much experience.
 

2693
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,550
know. Probably just too much experience.
Um just seen it too many times. Lack of

2694
01:10:58,550 --> 01:10:58,560
Um just seen it too many times. Lack of
 

2695
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,870
Um just seen it too many times. Lack of
excess at the high is probably the main

2696
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:00,880
excess at the high is probably the main
 

2697
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,830
excess at the high is probably the main
reason. Just too much experience.

2698
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:03,840
reason. Just too much experience.
 

2699
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,510
reason. Just too much experience.
You want to see like remember when

2700
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:05,520
You want to see like remember when
 

2701
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,030
You want to see like remember when
you're try when you're going to trade

2702
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:07,040
you're try when you're going to trade
 

2703
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,350
you're try when you're going to trade
away from where price is, you need

2704
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:09,360
away from where price is, you need
 

2705
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,430
away from where price is, you need
people to be stuck. And if there's not

2706
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:11,440
people to be stuck. And if there's not
 

2707
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,430
people to be stuck. And if there's not
enough people stuck and you're trying to

2708
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:13,440
enough people stuck and you're trying to
 

2709
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,950
enough people stuck and you're trying to
trade away from it, then you don't have

2710
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:14,960
trade away from it, then you don't have
 

2711
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:27,189
trade away from it, then you don't have
enough people's pain to use.

2712
01:11:27,189 --> 01:11:27,199

 

2713
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,189

So back to PC's these are the areas

2714
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:29,199
So back to PC's these are the areas
 

2715
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:30,950
So back to PC's these are the areas
where buyers now want to defend. If we

2716
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:30,960
where buyers now want to defend. If we
 

2717
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,790
where buyers now want to defend. If we
start losing all of this I will consider

2718
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:32,800
start losing all of this I will consider
 

2719
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,030
start losing all of this I will consider
the short

2720
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:35,040
the short
 

2721
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,110
the short
not before that because before that if

2722
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:37,120
not before that because before that if
 

2723
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,189
not before that because before that if
they hold all of this we will drive up

2724
01:11:39,189 --> 01:11:39,199
they hold all of this we will drive up
 

2725
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:40,310
they hold all of this we will drive up
here. This is when people say well you

2726
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:40,320
here. This is when people say well you
 

2727
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,669
here. This is when people say well you
give two options. That's cuz what the

2728
01:11:41,669 --> 01:11:41,679
give two options. That's cuz what the
 

2729
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:44,070
give two options. That's cuz what the
market gives. If we hold this it's going

2730
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:44,080
market gives. If we hold this it's going
 

2731
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,390
market gives. If we hold this it's going
to try and drive up to here. If we lose

2732
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:46,400
to try and drive up to here. If we lose
 

2733
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,149
to try and drive up to here. If we lose
this there's a very good chance of a

2734
01:11:48,149 --> 01:11:48,159
this there's a very good chance of a
 

2735
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:49,990
this there's a very good chance of a
rotation back down to value and even

2736
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:50,000
rotation back down to value and even
 

2737
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,750
rotation back down to value and even
down here today. Right? You have to obey

2738
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:53,760
down here today. Right? You have to obey
 

2739
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,750
down here today. Right? You have to obey
what the market is telling you. Right?

2740
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:55,760
what the market is telling you. Right?
 

2741
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,310
what the market is telling you. Right?
There's always two options to anything.

2742
01:11:58,310 --> 01:11:58,320
There's always two options to anything.
 

2743
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,870
There's always two options to anything.
There's always, always, always two

2744
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:00,880
There's always, always, always two
 

2745
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,310
There's always, always, always two
options in the market. There's never

2746
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:02,320
options in the market. There's never
 

2747
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:18,470
options in the market. There's never
just one option.

2748
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:18,480

 

2749
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,390

Any chance for last week's close? What

2750
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:20,400
Any chance for last week's close? What
 

2751
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,870
Any chance for last week's close? What
was where was last week's close as in

2752
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:22,880
was where was last week's close as in
 

2753
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,310
was where was last week's close as in
the gap fill 256

2754
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:26,320
the gap fill 256
 

2755
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,790
the gap fill 256
690?

2756
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:28,800
690?
 

2757
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,669
690?
It's asking a lot.

2758
01:12:31,669 --> 01:12:31,679
It's asking a lot.
 

2759
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:33,990
It's asking a lot.
Any chance? Yeah, there is a chance.

2760
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:34,000
Any chance? Yeah, there is a chance.
 

2761
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,070
Any chance? Yeah, there is a chance.
Strong chance. Not today.

2762
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:38,080
Strong chance. Not today.
 

2763
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,990
Strong chance. Not today.
I don't think not not a strong chance

2764
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:40,000
I don't think not not a strong chance
 

2765
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,750
I don't think not not a strong chance
today. You you'd have you'd be asking it

2766
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:41,760
today. You you'd have you'd be asking it
 

2767
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,550
today. You you'd have you'd be asking it
for it to move outside all our range and

2768
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:44,560
for it to move outside all our range and
 

2769
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,550
for it to move outside all our range and
fill a huge gap when we've left value. I

2770
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:46,560
fill a huge gap when we've left value. I
 

2771
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,070
fill a huge gap when we've left value. I
mean it's possible but it's very

2772
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:48,080
mean it's possible but it's very
 

2773
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,950
mean it's possible but it's very
unlikely that we will see that today

2774
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:50,960
unlikely that we will see that today
 

2775
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:53,030
unlikely that we will see that today
during the week if we start bidding and

2776
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:53,040
during the week if we start bidding and
 

2777
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,030
during the week if we start bidding and
moving value up. It's possible.

2778
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:57,040
moving value up. It's possible.
 

2779
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,470
moving value up. It's possible.
I don't think it's likely but it's

2780
01:12:58,470 --> 01:12:58,480
I don't think it's likely but it's
 

2781
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,025
I don't think it's likely but it's
possible.

2782
01:13:00,025 --> 01:13:00,035
possible.
 

2783
01:13:00,035 --> 01:13:01,350
possible.
[clears throat] All right. So starting

2784
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:01,360
[clears throat] All right. So starting
 

2785
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:05,350
[clears throat] All right. So starting
to see this back into these nodes again.

2786
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:05,360
to see this back into these nodes again.
 

2787
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:11,189
to see this back into these nodes again.
Watching this

2788
01:13:11,189 --> 01:13:11,199

back into the lower part of this volume
 

2791
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:22,295
back into the lower part of this volume
is gray shelf. Remember,

2792
01:13:22,295 --> 01:13:22,305

Alex, can you go over the morning trade

2796
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:25,760
Alex, can you go over the morning trade
 

2797

2799
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,229
again? Uh, yeah. I mean, trying to
actually zoom in and make some money

2800
01:13:30,229 --> 01:13:30,239
actually zoom in and make some money
 

2801
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,590
actually zoom in and make some money
here in case it leaves, but let's try.

2802
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:33,600
here in case it leaves, but let's try.
 

2803
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,270
here in case it leaves, but let's try.
Right. Where did we open? We opened

2804
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:35,280
Right. Where did we open? We opened
 

2805
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:39,189
Right. Where did we open? We opened
underneath value from yesterday.

2806
01:13:39,189 --> 01:13:39,199
underneath value from yesterday.
 

2807
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,510
underneath value from yesterday.
We put in this W. We filled this gap.

2808
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:41,520
We put in this W. We filled this gap.
 

2809
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,030
We put in this W. We filled this gap.
All right. This is the cash players gap

2810
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:43,040
All right. This is the cash players gap
 

2811
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,270
All right. This is the cash players gap
where they're trying to bid. We don't

2812
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:45,280
where they're trying to bid. We don't
 

2813
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,790
where they're trying to bid. We don't
trade between here and here. We let

2814
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:46,800
trade between here and here. We let
 

2815
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,390
trade between here and here. We let
everyone else do that move. And then

2816
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:48,400
everyone else do that move. And then
 

2817
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,390
everyone else do that move. And then
once we reclaim it, we're over New York

2818
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:50,400
once we reclaim it, we're over New York
 

2819
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,709
once we reclaim it, we're over New York
open. We're inside value. We create a

2820
01:13:52,709 --> 01:13:52,719
open. We're inside value. We create a
 

2821
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:54,550
open. We're inside value. We create a
flag and we're looking for a move back.

2822
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:54,560
flag and we're looking for a move back.
 

2823
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,390
flag and we're looking for a move back.
What? Into previous days value, which

2824
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:56,400
What? Into previous days value, which
 

2825
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,950
What? Into previous days value, which
means what? Everything up under here is

2826
01:13:58,950 --> 01:13:58,960
means what? Everything up under here is
 

2827
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,470
means what? Everything up under here is
a failed auction. That means no

2828
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:00,480
a failed auction. That means no
 

2829
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,229
a failed auction. That means no
acceptance of price there. So what are

2830
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:02,239
acceptance of price there. So what are
 

2831
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,709
acceptance of price there. So what are
we going to do? If we failed an auction

2832
01:14:04,709 --> 01:14:04,719
we going to do? If we failed an auction
 

2833
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:06,149
we going to do? If we failed an auction
under value, we're going to look for

2834
01:14:06,149 --> 01:14:06,159
under value, we're going to look for
 

2835
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:07,590
under value, we're going to look for
price acceptance. What's the most

2836
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:07,600
price acceptance. What's the most
 

2837
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,350
price acceptance. What's the most
logical area where we found price

2838
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:09,360
logical area where we found price
 

2839
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,910
logical area where we found price
acceptance yesterday? point of control

2840
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:11,920
acceptance yesterday? point of control
 

2841
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,070
acceptance yesterday? point of control
because that's fair value. So we trade

2842
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:14,080
because that's fair value. So we trade
 

2843
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,149
because that's fair value. So we trade
into here, right? So I'm trading here,

2844
01:14:16,149 --> 01:14:16,159
into here, right? So I'm trading here,
 

2845
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:18,390
into here, right? So I'm trading here,
adding here into here, and then I'm out

2846
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:18,400
adding here into here, and then I'm out
 

2847
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,830
adding here into here, and then I'm out
because now we've searched for fair

2848
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:19,840
because now we've searched for fair
 

2849
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:24,390
because now we've searched for fair
value. That's it. That's the trade.

2850
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:24,400
value. That's it. That's the trade.
 

2851
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,390
value. That's it. That's the trade.
We're now going to respect previous days

2852
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:26,400
We're now going to respect previous days
 

2853
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,390
We're now going to respect previous days
areas, right? Value area high, previous

2854
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:28,400
areas, right? Value area high, previous
 

2855
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,990
areas, right? Value area high, previous
day point of control, previous day value

2856
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:30,000
day point of control, previous day value
 

2857
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,510
day point of control, previous day value
area low, current day value area low.

2858
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:31,520
area low, current day value area low.
 

2859
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,870
area low, current day value area low.
Everything's matching up today and

2860
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:32,880
Everything's matching up today and
 

2861
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,510
Everything's matching up today and
yesterday pretty well. Okay, bottom side

2862
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:35,520
yesterday pretty well. Okay, bottom side
 

2863
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,350
yesterday pretty well. Okay, bottom side
of this node, right? If they don't

2864
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:37,360
of this node, right? If they don't
 

2865
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,990
of this node, right? If they don't
defend this and we see a break and and

2866
01:14:39,990 --> 01:14:40,000
defend this and we see a break and and
 

2867
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,070
defend this and we see a break and and
retest and we stay heavy, I'll consider

2868
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:42,080
retest and we stay heavy, I'll consider
 

2869
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,750
retest and we stay heavy, I'll consider
the short. And not until that point, I'm

2870
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:43,760
the short. And not until that point, I'm
 

2871
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:51,030
the short. And not until that point, I'm
not considering it.

2872
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:51,040

 

2873
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:56,709

Nice.

2874
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:56,719

 

2875
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:59,189

When's the trend back bullish once we

2876
01:14:59,189 --> 01:14:59,199
When's the trend back bullish once we
 

2877
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:02,709
When's the trend back bullish once we
higher low on a daily? Um, yeah. I mean,

2878
01:15:02,709 --> 01:15:02,719
higher low on a daily? Um, yeah. I mean,
 

2879
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:04,790
higher low on a daily? Um, yeah. I mean,
honestly, we'd have to reclaim all that

2880
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:04,800
honestly, we'd have to reclaim all that
 

2881
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,669
honestly, we'd have to reclaim all that
old range.

2882
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:07,679
old range.
 

2883
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:10,470
old range.
we like we can come up to like six and

2884
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:10,480
we like we can come up to like six and
 

2885
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,189
we like we can come up to like six and
700s and still reject, right? So, we've

2886
01:15:13,189 --> 01:15:13,199
700s and still reject, right? So, we've
 

2887
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:17,350
700s and still reject, right? So, we've
left value. Um, technically,

2888
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:17,360
left value. Um, technically,
 

2889
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,189
left value. Um, technically,
right, we haven't broken down under like

2890
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:19,199
right, we haven't broken down under like
 

2891
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:22,790
right, we haven't broken down under like
the 900s, which is a big pivot, but uh

2892
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:22,800
the 900s, which is a big pivot, but uh
 

2893
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,870
the 900s, which is a big pivot, but uh
I'd be surprised if we don't do that at

2894
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:24,880
I'd be surprised if we don't do that at
 

2895
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,790
I'd be surprised if we don't do that at
some point.

2896
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:26,800
some point.
 

2897
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,550
some point.
Yeah, I mean, we get very bullish. This

2898
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:28,560
Yeah, I mean, we get very bullish. This
 

2899
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:29,910
Yeah, I mean, we get very bullish. This
is a long way away, but we get very

2900
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:29,920
is a long way away, but we get very
 

2901
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,590
is a long way away, but we get very
bullish for a break and hold over

2902
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:31,600
bullish for a break and hold over
 

2903
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,310
bullish for a break and hold over
26,100. that that's when the market will

2904
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:34,320
26,100. that that's when the market will
 

2905
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,790
26,100. that that's when the market will
really start screaming upside because

2906
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:36,800
really start screaming upside because
 

2907
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,229
really start screaming upside because
we'll have a lot of trapped sellers

2908
01:15:38,229 --> 01:15:38,239
we'll have a lot of trapped sellers
 

2909
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:40,229
we'll have a lot of trapped sellers
underneath. But we we just don't look

2910
01:15:40,229 --> 01:15:40,239
underneath. But we we just don't look
 

2911
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:42,550
underneath. But we we just don't look
anything like that right now. We'd have

2912
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:42,560
anything like that right now. We'd have
 

2913
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,310
anything like that right now. We'd have
to get back above that what was it a

2914
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:44,320
to get back above that what was it a
 

2915
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,750
to get back above that what was it a
three or four week balance range that

2916
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:45,760
three or four week balance range that
 

2917
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,310
three or four week balance range that
we've talked about where we've rejected

2918
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:48,320
we've talked about where we've rejected
 

2919
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,550
we've talked about where we've rejected
up there. We rejected up there all

2920
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:50,560
up there. We rejected up there all
 

2921
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,510
up there. We rejected up there all
through November, all through December

2922
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:53,520
through November, all through December
 

2923
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,590
through November, all through December
and all through January. We cannot get a

2924
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:55,600
and all through January. We cannot get a
 

2925
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:59,030
and all through January. We cannot get a
base and hold over sort of 26,26100.

2926
01:15:59,030 --> 01:15:59,040
base and hold over sort of 26,26100.
 

2927
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,270
base and hold over sort of 26,26100.
Okay. So, still they're holding here.

2928
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:01,280
Okay. So, still they're holding here.
 

2929
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,510
Okay. So, still they're holding here.
Still they defended this volume shelf

2930
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:03,520
Still they defended this volume shelf
 

2931
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:05,030
Still they defended this volume shelf
still. Then they want to try and move up

2932
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:05,040
still. Then they want to try and move up
 

2933
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,870
still. Then they want to try and move up
into here. We do have a node here from

2934
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:06,880
into here. We do have a node here from
 

2935
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,950
into here. We do have a node here from
yesterday. The big level is 420 and then

2936
01:16:10,950 --> 01:16:10,960
yesterday. The big level is 420 and then
 

2937
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,790
yesterday. The big level is 420 and then
470. That's where they're trying to get

2938
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:12,800
470. That's where they're trying to get
 

2939
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,070
470. That's where they're trying to get
right now. That's why we don't front. We

2940
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,080
right now. That's why we don't front. We
 

2941
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,149
right now. That's why we don't front. We
don't guess price. We let price leave an

2942
01:16:18,149 --> 01:16:18,159
don't guess price. We let price leave an
 

2943
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:28,229
don't guess price. We let price leave an
area or we don't touch it.

2944
01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:28,239

 

2945
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:30,390

Nice DCT. And you've got a good name as

2946
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:30,400
Nice DCT. And you've got a good name as
 

2947
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:35,522
Nice DCT. And you've got a good name as
well. It's almost flow zone trader.

2948
01:16:35,522 --> 01:16:35,532

 

2949
01:16:35,532 --> 01:16:40,229

[snorts]

2950
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:40,239

 

2951
01:16:40,239 --> 01:17:03,189

Vick's down sub 18s now.

2952
01:17:03,189 --> 01:17:03,199

There's nothing to sell against. But
 

3005
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,990
There's nothing to sell against. But
hey, this looks to me like they want to

hey, this looks to me like they want to
 

3007
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,390
hey, this looks to me like they want to
lift more and get into those 420s. And

3008
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:12,400
lift more and get into those 420s. And
 

3009
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,470
lift more and get into those 420s. And
you know, you don't know. Maybe maybe

3010
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:14,480
you know, you don't know. Maybe maybe
 

3011
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,669
you know, you don't know. Maybe maybe
they have the strength to go previous

3012
01:18:15,669 --> 01:18:15,679
they have the strength to go previous
 

3013

3017
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:28,630

bothered about that. Maybe I'll leave

3018
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:28,640
bothered about that. Maybe I'll leave
 

3019
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,270
bothered about that. Maybe I'll leave
it.

3020
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:31,280
it.
 

3021
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:39,270

Okay.

3022
01:18:39,270 --> 01:18:39,280

 

3023
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:42,070

Do I use CVD? Yeah, I do. But there's no

3024

Do I use CVD? Yeah, I do. But there's no
 

3025
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,390
Do I use CVD? Yeah, I do. But there's no
divergence right now. 5 minute CVD is

3026
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:44,400
divergence right now. 5 minute CVD is
 

3027
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,830
divergence right now. 5 minute CVD is
matching up very nicely to the drive

3028
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:45,840
matching up very nicely to the drive
 

3029
01:18:45,840 --> 01:19:02,149

3031
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:04,550

I'm going to trade right through this.

3032
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:04,560
I'm going to trade right through this.
 

3033
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,174
I'm going to trade right through this.
Don't think there's a reason for this.

3034
01:19:06,174 --> 01:19:06,184
Don't think there's a reason for this.

3047
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,149

Maybe I closed my long position. I

3048
01:19:32,149 --> 01:19:32,159
Maybe I closed my long position. I
 

3049
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:33,590
Maybe I closed my long position. I
closed my long position all the way down

3050
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:33,600
closed my long position all the way down
 

3051
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,510
closed my long position all the way down
here. I told you I closed long. I didn't

3052
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:35,520
here. I told you I closed long. I didn't
 

3053
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,830

hold through any of this. I didn't add

01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:37,840
hold through any of this. I didn't add
 

3055
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,350
hold through any of this. I didn't add

anywhere up here. I'm not interested.
 

3057
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,350
anywhere up here. I'm not interested.
But I'd rather fade it back down inside

3058
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:41,360
But I'd rather fade it back down inside
 

3059
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,430
But I'd rather fade it back down inside
either underneath this or on a drive up

3060
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:43,440
either underneath this or on a drive up
 

3061
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,350
either underneath this or on a drive up
if we create more volume. But right now,

3062
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:45,360
if we create more volume. But right now,
 

3063
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,110
if we create more volume. But right now,
this structure is just a grindy bullish

3064
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:47,120
this structure is just a grindy bullish
 

3065
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,630
this structure is just a grindy bullish
move. I don't want to fade a grindy

3066
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:48,640
move. I don't want to fade a grindy
 

3067
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:53,430
move. I don't want to fade a grindy
bullish move. [snorts]

3069
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,590

I closed my long position probably here

3070
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:55,600
I closed my long position probably here
 

3071
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:59,189
I closed my long position probably here
957 or something. I didn't even hold for

420s. If you're still in this long, you
 

3099

01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:11,360
area. And I'll tell you what, the gap is
 

3107
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:14,550
area. And I'll tell you what, the gap is

01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:14,560
over 474. Let's just draw this gap in in
 

3109
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:19,270
over 474. Let's just draw this gap in in
case we end up needing to use it.

3110
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:19,280

 

3111
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:22,390

There's our gap.

3112
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:22,400
There's our gap.
 

3113
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,270
There's our gap.
This is a big pivot. So, the gap starts

This is a big pivot. So, the gap starts
 

3115
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,270
This is a big pivot. So, the gap starts
in this gray box and this is a big pivot

3116
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:27,280
in this gray box and this is a big pivot

near that, you should have sold most
 

3167
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:09,430
near that, you should have sold most
already. And then 472 if you got very,

3168
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:09,440
already. And then 472 if you got very,
 

3169

there's no real strong volume until
 

3191
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,110
there's no real strong volume until
340s. So, at some point, I think we're

3192
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:51,120
340s. So, at some point, I think we're
 

3193
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,669
340s. So, at some point, I think we're
likely to see a fade back down. Um, but

3194
01:23:53,669 --> 01:23:53,679
likely to see a fade back down. Um, but

01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:37,600
just above the 15s. We're currently
 

3265
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,470
just above the 15s. We're currently
trading at 1489s.

3266
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:40,480
trading at 1489s.
 

3267
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,830
trading at 1489s.
Very close to taking out previous day

3268
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:41,840
Very close to taking out previous day
 

3269
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:46,310
Very close to taking out previous day
high here on the Q's.

3270
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:46,320

 

3271
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:52,229

I'm talking about on the ETFs, right?

3272
01:25:52,229 --> 01:25:52,239

 

3273
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:54,709

So, value now hit 420 now hit. The only

3274
01:25:54,709 --> 01:25:54,719
So, value now hit 420 now hit. The only
 

3275
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:56,870
So, value now hit 420 now hit. The only
thing left now is previous day high if

3276
01:25:56,870 --> 01:25:56,880
thing left now is previous day high if
 

3277
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:05,110
thing left now is previous day high if
it wants it.

3278
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:05,120

 

3279
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,030

That player at 390 is still down there.

3280
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:07,040
That player at 390 is still down there.
 

3281
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,950
That player at 390 is still down there.
He hasn't moved up. So, he's put a wall

3282
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:08,960
He hasn't moved up. So, he's put a wall
 

3283
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:15,430
He hasn't moved up. So, he's put a wall
in at 390 currently.

3284
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:15,440

 

3285
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:18,149

Vicks into that key level of 1750. So it

3286
01:26:18,149 --> 01:26:18,159
Vicks into that key level of 1750. So it
 

3287
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:19,430
Vicks into that key level of 1750. So it
needs to hold here. If it doesn't hold

3288
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:19,440
needs to hold here. If it doesn't hold
 

3289
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:23,590
needs to hold here. If it doesn't hold
here, we probably go 1684s,

3290
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:23,600

 

3291
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,350

which will be a giant squeeze on the

3292
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:25,360
which will be a giant squeeze on the
 

3293
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:38,390
which will be a giant squeeze on the
market if we if we do that, I would say.

3294
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:38,400

 

3295
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:42,310

They completed a full rotation. I'm

3296
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:42,320
They completed a full rotation. I'm
 

3297
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,750
They completed a full rotation. I'm
kind of kicking myself. Maybe we could

3298
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:43,760
kind of kicking myself. Maybe we could
 

3299
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,110
kind of kicking myself. Maybe we could
have held a runner for an extra 100

3300
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:45,120
have held a runner for an extra 100
 

3301
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,350
have held a runner for an extra 100
points here. I don't know. But happy

3302
01:26:47,350 --> 01:26:47,360
points here. I don't know. But happy
 

3303
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:50,070
points here. I don't know. But happy
with what I made. Okay, so only thing

3304
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:50,080
with what I made. Okay, so only thing
 

3305
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,229
with what I made. Okay, so only thing
left now really is to come up here into

3306
01:26:52,229 --> 01:26:52,239
left now really is to come up here into
 

3307
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:55,350
left now really is to come up here into
70s if they have the juice. Otherwise,

3308
01:26:55,350 --> 01:26:55,360
70s if they have the juice. Otherwise,
 

3309
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,510
70s if they have the juice. Otherwise,
the rotation now still probably back

3310
01:26:57,510 --> 01:26:57,520
the rotation now still probably back
 

3311
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:58,950
the rotation now still probably back
down into here when they're ready for

01:26:58,950 --> 01:26:58,960
down into here when they're ready for
 

3313

Those are the levels we're thinking
 

3621
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:49,590

about out loud in our heads. 35 is where
 

3623
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,350
about out loud in our heads. 35 is where
the buyer came in and absorbed the tape.

to force him out. 20s is our sort of
 

3629
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:59,350
to force him out. 20s is our sort of
overunder for value

3630

overunder for value
 

3631
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:06,390
overunder for value
at this level right here.

01:36:06,390 --> 01:36:06,400

 

3633
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,070

trying to fill the Monday gap. I don't

3689
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:34,310

almost into 85. I'm going to assume

3690
01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:34,320
almost into 85. I'm going to assume
 

3691
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,470
almost into 85. I'm going to assume
that's a massive, massive, massive gamma

3692
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:36,480
that's a massive, massive, massive gamma
 

3693
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:40,229
that's a massive, massive, massive gamma
level as well.

3695
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:42,870

Okay, 75 just lifted to 80. So, he just

3696
01:37:42,870 --> 01:37:42,880
Okay, 75 just lifted to 80. So, he just
 

3697
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:44,310
Okay, 75 just lifted to 80. So, he just
keeps lifting and lifting and lifting

3698
01:37:44,310 --> 01:37:44,320
keeps lifting and lifting and lifting
 

3699
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,629
keeps lifting and lifting and lifting
and lifting. So, he's moved higher. He's

3700
01:37:46,629 --> 01:37:46,639
and lifting. So, he's moved higher. He's
 

3701
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:47,990

So let's see if they can do it.
Here they go. One's just left the tape.

3728
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:15,360
Here they go. One's just left the tape.
 

3729
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,669
Here they go. One's just left the tape.
So he's just left 350 lot. So the 700

3730
01:38:17,669 --> 01:38:17,679
So he's just left 350 lot. So the 700
 

3731
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:20,470
So he's just left 350 lot. So the 700
lot was a spoofer he just left. Here's

3732
01:38:20,470 --> 01:38:20,480
lot was a spoofer he just left. Here's
 

3733
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:22,470
lot was a spoofer he just left. Here's
the move to 75. Previous day high now

3734
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:22,480
the move to 75. Previous day high now
 

3735
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:27,669
the move to 75. Previous day high now
taken into the edge of this gap

3736
01:38:27,669 --> 01:38:27,679

 

3737
01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:29,990

transaction here. Didn't fill either of

3738
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:30,000
transaction here. Didn't fill either of
 

3739
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,430
transaction here. Didn't fill either of
them. So, they were both spoofing.

3740
01:38:31,430 --> 01:38:31,440
them. So, they were both spoofing.
 

3741
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:37,189
them. So, they were both spoofing.
Surprise, surprise.

3742
01:38:37,189 --> 01:38:37,199

 

3743
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:40,790

ES uh sorry, spy tapping 85.

3744
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:40,800
ES uh sorry, spy tapping 85.
 

3745
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,109
ES uh sorry, spy tapping 85.
Small rejection there at 85. Watching

3746
01:38:43,109 --> 01:38:43,119
Small rejection there at 85. Watching
 

3747
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:44,790
Small rejection there at 85. Watching
this now. If there's a big transaction

3748
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:44,800
this now. If there's a big transaction
 

3749
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,830
this now. If there's a big transaction
here and buyers get caught, not until

3750
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:47,840
here and buyers get caught, not until
 

3751
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,910
here and buyers get caught, not until
then. But if there is and buyers get

3752
01:38:49,910 --> 01:38:49,920
then. But if there is and buyers get
 

3753
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,910
then. But if there is and buyers get
caught, I'm interested. It's into a big

3754
01:38:51,910 --> 01:38:51,920
caught, I'm interested. It's into a big
 

3755
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:53,750
caught, I'm interested. It's into a big
level. But not until then. If they keep

3756
01:38:53,750 --> 01:38:53,760
level. But not until then. If they keep
 

3757
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,750
level. But not until then. If they keep
squeezing, you've just got to let them

3758
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:55,760
squeezing, you've just got to let them
 

3759
01:38:55,760 --> 01:39:14,070
squeezing, you've just got to let them
keep squeezing.

3760
01:39:14,070 --> 01:39:14,080

 

3761
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:23,430

Don't like the height of that auction,

3762
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:23,440

 

3763
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:26,229

man.

3764
01:39:26,229 --> 01:39:26,239
man.
 

3765
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:27,750
man.
Can't help looking at this thinking,

3766
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:27,760
Can't help looking at this thinking,
 

3767
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:30,550
Can't help looking at this thinking,
wow,

3768
01:39:30,550 --> 01:39:30,560
wow,
 

3769
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,310
wow,
could have got another 150 points out of

this on a runner, Alex. Lesson learned.
 

3773

Okay, they're st they're stacking 75s

3780
01:39:48,790 --> 01:39:48,800

 

3781
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:55,109

75s and 80s.

3782
01:39:55,109 --> 01:39:55,119

 

3783
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:58,070

VIX now losing 1750. So you want to be

3784
01:39:58,070 --> 01:39:58,080
VIX now losing 1750. So you want to be
 

3785
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:07,189
VIX now losing 1750. So you want to be
careful here.

3786
01:40:07,189 --> 01:40:07,199

 

3787
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:10,229

Building out some nasty looking uh

3788
01:40:10,229 --> 01:40:10,239
Building out some nasty looking uh
 

3789
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:12,310
Building out some nasty looking uh
volume up there.

3790
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:12,320
volume up there.
 

3791
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:14,470
volume up there.
Not too clean.

3792
01:40:14,470 --> 01:40:14,480
Not too clean.
 

3793

Not too clean.
Not too clean.

Not too clean.
 

3795
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,510
Not too clean.
And they've just added liquidity now up

3796
01:40:19,510 --> 01:40:19,520
And they've just added liquidity now up
 

3797
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:31,750
And they've just added liquidity now up
at 500.

3798
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:31,760

 

3799
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,510

Some buyers got caught on that last push

3800
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:33,520
Some buyers got caught on that last push
 

3801
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:34,950
Some buyers got caught on that last push
a little bit. We've not traded back down

3802
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:34,960
a little bit. We've not traded back down
 

3803
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,709
a little bit. We've not traded back down
away from them. Delta is still very

3804
01:40:36,709 --> 01:40:36,719
away from them. Delta is still very
 

3805
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:49,030
away from them. Delta is still very
strong.

3806
01:40:49,030 --> 01:40:49,040

 

3807
01:40:49,040 --> 01:41:06,709

Someone just pulled his bid at 60s.

3808
01:41:06,709 --> 01:41:06,719

 

3809
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:08,629

There's not much for bid down here now.

3810
01:41:08,629 --> 01:41:08,639
There's not much for bid down here now.
 

3811
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:13,189
There's not much for bid down here now.
Where's the next big bed? There isn't.

3812
01:41:13,189 --> 01:41:13,199
Where's the next big bed? There isn't.
 

3813

Where's the next big bed? There isn't.
There isn't much.

3815
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:32,149

276 lot now added at 480s above.

3816
01:41:32,149 --> 01:41:32,159

 

3817
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:33,750

I'm interested in the fade underneath

3818
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:33,760
I'm interested in the fade underneath
 

3819
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,590
I'm interested in the fade underneath
all of this if we if we drift down under

3820
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:35,600
all of this if we if we drift down under
 

3821
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:37,109
all of this if we if we drift down under
there. Other than that, I'm not

3822
01:41:37,109 --> 01:41:37,119
there. Other than that, I'm not
 

3823
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:38,709
there. Other than that, I'm not
interested in it. They're going to keep

3824
01:41:38,709 --> 01:41:38,719
interested in it. They're going to keep
 

3825
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:40,550
interested in it. They're going to keep
searching for 480s. I tell you what, I'm

3826
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:40,560
searching for 480s. I tell you what, I'm
 

3827
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:41,830
searching for 480s. I tell you what, I'm
going to use the bathroom while these

3828
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:41,840
going to use the bathroom while these
 

3829
01:41:41,840 --> 01:42:46,870
going to use the bathroom while these
guys piss about. Be right back.

3830
01:42:46,870 --> 01:42:46,880

 

3831
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:48,709

Okay, let's have a look. Still no

3832
01:42:48,709 --> 01:42:48,719
Okay, let's have a look. Still no
 

3833
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:51,510
Okay, let's have a look. Still no
change.

3834
01:42:51,510 --> 01:42:51,520
change.
 

3835
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:54,310
change.
Still no change.

3836
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:54,320
Still no change.
 

3837
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:55,669
Still no change.
So, I'm certainly not going to get long

3838
01:42:55,669 --> 01:42:55,679
So, I'm certainly not going to get long
 

3839
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:57,510
So, I'm certainly not going to get long
up here.

3840
01:42:57,510 --> 01:42:57,520
up here.
 

3841
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:00,629
up here.
I will consider a rotation if we get

3842
01:43:00,629 --> 01:43:00,639
I will consider a rotation if we get
 

3843
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:03,030
I will consider a rotation if we get
stuck underneath these. Certainly under

3844
01:43:03,030 --> 01:43:03,040
stuck underneath these. Certainly under
 

3845
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,790
stuck underneath these. Certainly under
this as well. So, I'll be careful about

3846
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:04,800
this as well. So, I'll be careful about
 

3847
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:07,350
this as well. So, I'll be careful about
this. But I'll consider that. But we're

3848
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:07,360
this. But I'll consider that. But we're
 

3849
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:12,790
this. But I'll consider that. But we're
into the gap now. 500 above.

3850
01:43:12,790 --> 01:43:12,800

 

3851
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:15,430

But I want to see us leave. Maybe if we

3852
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:15,440
But I want to see us leave. Maybe if we
 

3853
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:16,950
But I want to see us leave. Maybe if we
create a shelf here, it could be useful

3854
01:43:16,950 --> 01:43:16,960
create a shelf here, it could be useful
 

3855
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:19,030
create a shelf here, it could be useful
as well. I want to see us at least leave

3856
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:19,040
as well. I want to see us at least leave
 

3857
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,030
as well. I want to see us at least leave
some volume trapped. I'm not going to

3858
01:43:21,030 --> 01:43:21,040
some volume trapped. I'm not going to
 

3859
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:23,510
some volume trapped. I'm not going to
play short against what is a very strong

3860
01:43:23,510 --> 01:43:23,520
play short against what is a very strong
 

3861
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:25,030
play short against what is a very strong
squeezy trend. Remember, we were long

3862
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:25,040
squeezy trend. Remember, we were long
 

3863
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,590
squeezy trend. Remember, we were long
from here. Sold my position there.

3864
01:43:27,590 --> 01:43:27,600
from here. Sold my position there.
 

3865
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:29,750
from here. Sold my position there.
Kicking myself now cuz we've got a

3866
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:29,760
Kicking myself now cuz we've got a
 

3867
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:31,910
Kicking myself now cuz we've got a
second leg higher.

3868
01:43:31,910 --> 01:43:31,920
second leg higher.
 

3869
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,629
second leg higher.
And now just need to wait. Big buyer

3870
01:43:34,629 --> 01:43:34,639
And now just need to wait. Big buyer
 

3871
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:37,270
And now just need to wait. Big buyer
here. 200 lot. This is huge delta up

3872
01:43:37,270 --> 01:43:37,280
here. 200 lot. This is huge delta up
 

3873
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:44,390
here. 200 lot. This is huge delta up
into 80. Big buyer.

3874
01:43:44,390 --> 01:43:44,400

 

3875
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,629

They're adding more at 490. They're just

3876
01:43:46,629 --> 01:43:46,639
They're adding more at 490. They're just
 

3877
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:48,629
They're adding more at 490. They're just
constantly trying to add liquidity

3878
01:43:48,629 --> 01:43:48,639
constantly trying to add liquidity
 

3879
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,229
constantly trying to add liquidity
higher to make it search for it at the

3880
01:43:50,229 --> 01:43:50,239
higher to make it search for it at the
 

3881
01:43:50,239 --> 01:43:59,590
higher to make it search for it at the
moment.

3882
01:43:59,590 --> 01:43:59,600

 

3883
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,350

This is starting to be a little bit

3884
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:01,360
This is starting to be a little bit
 

3885
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:04,709
This is starting to be a little bit
insane here. Let me just

3886
01:44:04,709 --> 01:44:04,719
insane here. Let me just
 

3887
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:06,709
insane here. Let me just
have a look.

3888
01:44:06,709 --> 01:44:06,719
have a look.
 

3889
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:15,189
have a look.
What are we seeing here? He's

3890
01:44:15,189 --> 01:44:15,199

 

3891
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:19,189

starting to get into some congestion.

3892
01:44:19,189 --> 01:44:19,199
starting to get into some congestion.
 

3893
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:24,229
starting to get into some congestion.
Just check the chips quickly.

3894
01:44:24,229 --> 01:44:24,239

 

3895
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:27,669

Break out.

3896
01:44:27,669 --> 01:44:27,679

 

3897
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:32,229

Yeah, big pivot.

3898
01:44:32,229 --> 01:44:32,239

 

3899
01:44:32,239 --> 01:44:34,070

Once those slow down and they see a

3900
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:34,080
Once those slow down and they see a
 

3901
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:35,910
Once those slow down and they see a
pullback and it looks like it's trying

3902
01:44:35,910 --> 01:44:35,920
pullback and it looks like it's trying
 

3903
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:37,830
pullback and it looks like it's trying
to come in AMD at the moment, we might

3904
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:37,840
to come in AMD at the moment, we might
 

3905
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:40,629
to come in AMD at the moment, we might
see this market

3906
01:44:40,629 --> 01:44:40,639
see this market
 

3907
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:43,350
see this market
have that pullback leg.

3908
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:43,360
have that pullback leg.
 

3909
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:47,109
have that pullback leg.
Oh,

3910
01:44:47,109 --> 01:44:47,119

 

3911
01:44:47,119 --> 01:44:48,709

okay. Back into volume shelf. Remember,

3912
01:44:48,709 --> 01:44:48,719
okay. Back into volume shelf. Remember,
 

3913
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:50,790
okay. Back into volume shelf. Remember,
we've held volume every single time

3914
01:44:50,790 --> 01:44:50,800
we've held volume every single time
 

3915
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,229
we've held volume every single time
today. We've come into volume, we've

3916
01:44:52,229 --> 01:44:52,239
today. We've come into volume, we've
 

3917
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:54,149
today. We've come into volume, we've
held it. So, if we lose this, maybe a

3918
01:44:54,149 --> 01:44:54,159
held it. So, if we lose this, maybe a
 

3919
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:56,149
held it. So, if we lose this, maybe a
drift down further. I am watching this

3920
01:44:56,149 --> 01:44:56,159
drift down further. I am watching this
 

3921
01:44:56,159 --> 01:45:01,990
drift down further. I am watching this
now to see if it gets aggressive.

3922
01:45:01,990 --> 01:45:02,000

 

3923
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,669

Holding that low volume node for now. I

3924
01:45:03,669 --> 01:45:03,679
Holding that low volume node for now. I
 

3925
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:05,430
Holding that low volume node for now. I
want to see us trade like well under

3926
01:45:05,430 --> 01:45:05,440
want to see us trade like well under
 

3927
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:06,950
want to see us trade like well under
that.

3928
01:45:06,950 --> 01:45:06,960
that.
 

3929
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:12,550
that.
Tempted to try and feather in here, but

3930
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:12,560

 

3931
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:21,990

still holding that low volume now.

3932
01:45:21,990 --> 01:45:22,000

 

3933
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:33,510

So semi very very very strong.

3934
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:33,520

 

3935
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:35,750

Definitely buyers caught at 480. I want

3936
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:35,760
Definitely buyers caught at 480. I want
 

3937
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,310
Definitely buyers caught at 480. I want
that to be clear.

3938
01:45:38,310 --> 01:45:38,320
that to be clear.
 

3939
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:39,830
that to be clear.
If we let them out, we're risk queens

3940
01:45:39,830 --> 01:45:39,840
If we let them out, we're risk queens
 

3941
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,790
If we let them out, we're risk queens
again though.

3942
01:45:42,790 --> 01:45:42,800
again though.
 

3943
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,790
again though.
Get a MA chart up here because it's so

3944
01:45:44,790 --> 01:45:44,800
Get a MA chart up here because it's so
 

3945
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:47,750
Get a MA chart up here because it's so
this is becoming uh so dependent what's

3946
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:47,760
this is becoming uh so dependent what's
 

3947
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:57,669
this is becoming uh so dependent what's
going on outside of this.

3948
01:45:57,669 --> 01:45:57,679

 

3949
01:45:57,679 --> 01:46:00,149

Yeah, Nvidia

3950
01:46:00,149 --> 01:46:00,159
Yeah, Nvidia
 

3951
01:46:00,159 --> 01:46:03,430
Yeah, Nvidia
through that pivot into its gap. Very

3952
01:46:03,430 --> 01:46:03,440
through that pivot into its gap. Very
 

3953
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,510
through that pivot into its gap. Very
dangerous here. If Nvidia starts going,

3954
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:05,520
dangerous here. If Nvidia starts going,
 

3955
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,709
dangerous here. If Nvidia starts going,
it can cause like another rally higher.

3956
01:46:08,709 --> 01:46:08,719
it can cause like another rally higher.
 

3957
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:11,350
it can cause like another rally higher.
Oracle's just not moving.

3958
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:11,360
Oracle's just not moving.
 

3959
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:15,830
Oracle's just not moving.
AVGO isn't. It's AMD, AMU, and Nvidia.

3960
01:46:15,830 --> 01:46:15,840
AVGO isn't. It's AMD, AMU, and Nvidia.
 

3961
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,669
AVGO isn't. It's AMD, AMU, and Nvidia.
AMD is having its first five minute

3962
01:46:17,669 --> 01:46:17,679
AMD is having its first five minute
 

3963
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:24,950
AMD is having its first five minute
pullback.

3964
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:24,960

 

3965
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:27,750

Nvidia coming into it 5day above. Yeah,

3966
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:27,760
Nvidia coming into it 5day above. Yeah,
 

3967
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:41,510
Nvidia coming into it 5day above. Yeah,
five day above.

3968
01:46:41,510 --> 01:46:41,520

 

3969
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,109

Yeah, resqueeze now because we're back

3970
01:46:43,109 --> 01:46:43,119
Yeah, resqueeze now because we're back
 

3971
01:46:43,119 --> 01:46:44,870
Yeah, resqueeze now because we're back
above those 80s. So all the time above

3972
01:46:44,870 --> 01:46:44,880
above those 80s. So all the time above
 

3973
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,629
above those 80s. So all the time above
80s. Look, every dip into volume, we

3974
01:46:46,629 --> 01:46:46,639
80s. Look, every dip into volume, we
 

3975
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:48,390
80s. Look, every dip into volume, we
just talked about that. Every dip into

3976
01:46:48,390 --> 01:46:48,400
just talked about that. Every dip into
 

3977
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,470
just talked about that. Every dip into
volume's held. Everything is becoming a

3978
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:50,480
volume's held. Everything is becoming a
 

3979
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:53,510
volume's held. Everything is becoming a
buyers market now. Every dip of every

3980
01:46:53,510 --> 01:46:53,520
buyers market now. Every dip of every
 

3981
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,990
buyers market now. Every dip of every
volume node, even if it's small, is

3982
01:46:55,990 --> 01:46:56,000
volume node, even if it's small, is
 

3983
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,149
volume node, even if it's small, is
holding, is holding, is holding. You

3984
01:46:58,149 --> 01:46:58,159
holding, is holding, is holding. You
 

3985
01:46:58,159 --> 01:47:01,109
holding, is holding, is holding. You
can't fade this. You need to see it

3986
01:47:01,109 --> 01:47:01,119
can't fade this. You need to see it
 

3987
01:47:01,119 --> 01:47:02,550
can't fade this. You need to see it
start coming around the other side if

3988
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:02,560
start coming around the other side if
 

3989
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:04,070
start coming around the other side if
you're desperate for a fade on it. Um,

3990
01:47:04,070 --> 01:47:04,080
you're desperate for a fade on it. Um,
 

3991
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,990
you're desperate for a fade on it. Um,
why am I not buying? Because we bought

3992
01:47:05,990 --> 01:47:06,000
why am I not buying? Because we bought
 

3993
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,910
why am I not buying? Because we bought
discount this morning down here.

3994
01:47:09,910 --> 01:47:09,920
discount this morning down here.
 

3995
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:11,750
discount this morning down here.
I didn't like that buy off fair value. I

3996
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:11,760
I didn't like that buy off fair value. I
 

3997
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,189
I didn't like that buy off fair value. I
didn't think we'd complete the rotation.

3998
01:47:13,189 --> 01:47:13,199
didn't think we'd complete the rotation.
 

3999
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:15,270
didn't think we'd complete the rotation.
It's obviously I'm wrong because we have

4000
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:15,280
It's obviously I'm wrong because we have
 

4001
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:16,629
It's obviously I'm wrong because we have
completed it and then we're now printing

4002
01:47:16,629 --> 01:47:16,639
completed it and then we're now printing
 

4003
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:19,430
completed it and then we're now printing
upside. But we're also getting into

4004
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:19,440
upside. But we're also getting into
 

4005
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:20,709
upside. But we're also getting into
territory where we can start breaking

4006
01:47:20,709 --> 01:47:20,719
territory where we can start breaking
 

4007
01:47:20,719 --> 01:47:22,310
territory where we can start breaking
out here. Want to be very careful

4008
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:22,320
out here. Want to be very careful
 

4009
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:24,149
out here. Want to be very careful
because we're coming into that gap. Uh

4010
01:47:24,149 --> 01:47:24,159
because we're coming into that gap. Uh
 

4011
01:47:24,159 --> 01:47:27,430
because we're coming into that gap. Uh
next pivot really through this gap

4012
01:47:27,430 --> 01:47:27,440
next pivot really through this gap
 

4013
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:30,629
next pivot really through this gap
is all the way at 590s this white line.

4014
01:47:30,629 --> 01:47:30,639
is all the way at 590s this white line.
 

4015
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:32,229
is all the way at 590s this white line.
So want to be careful if they are

4016
01:47:32,229 --> 01:47:32,239
So want to be careful if they are
 

4017
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:45,590
So want to be careful if they are
adamant on rebid, rebid, rebid.

4018
01:47:45,590 --> 01:47:45,600

 

4019
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:47,590

So back to volume again. I will consider

4020
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:47,600
So back to volume again. I will consider
 

4021
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,590
So back to volume again. I will consider
if we start leaving volume trapped, I

4022
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:49,600
if we start leaving volume trapped, I
 

4023
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,750
if we start leaving volume trapped, I
will consider a fade especially if we

4024
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:51,760
will consider a fade especially if we
 

4025
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:53,350
will consider a fade especially if we
get underneath value and we get

4026
01:47:53,350 --> 01:47:53,360
get underneath value and we get
 

4027
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:55,270
get underneath value and we get
underneath

4028
01:47:55,270 --> 01:47:55,280
underneath
 

4029
01:47:55,280 --> 01:48:04,470
underneath
um the flow zones. Right.

4030
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:04,480

 

4031
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,149

How do you get volume to anchor to the

4032
01:48:06,149 --> 01:48:06,159
How do you get volume to anchor to the
 

4033
01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:08,390
How do you get volume to anchor to the
New York open? Use an anchored volume

4034
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:08,400
New York open? Use an anchored volume
 

4035
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:14,310
New York open? Use an anchored volume
profile.

4036
01:48:14,310 --> 01:48:14,320

 

4037
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:15,990

Okay, back into this volume. Are we

4038
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:16,000
Okay, back into this volume. Are we
 

4039
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,550
Okay, back into this volume. Are we
going to start to leave this now?

4040
01:48:18,550 --> 01:48:18,560
going to start to leave this now?
 

4041
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,470
going to start to leave this now?
It's perking my interest here, folks. It

4042
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:20,480
It's perking my interest here, folks. It
 

4043
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:22,470
It's perking my interest here, folks. It
is definitely perking my interest here.

4044
01:48:22,470 --> 01:48:22,480
is definitely perking my interest here.
 

4045
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:23,830
is definitely perking my interest here.
Just want to see sellers come through

4046
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:23,840
Just want to see sellers come through
 

4047
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:29,669
Just want to see sellers come through
strong here. Where are these bids?

4048
01:48:29,669 --> 01:48:29,679

 

4049
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:31,669

Big buyer just came back in at 65.

4065

low volume nodes. I can't trade it

4066
01:48:51,109 --> 01:48:51,119
low volume nodes. I can't trade it

Last push failed. We got to get back

4102
01:49:42,470 --> 01:49:42,480
Last push failed. We got to get back
 

4103
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:45,430
Last push failed. We got to get back
under 65, though. They're just rebidding

4104
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:45,440
under 65, though. They're just rebidding
 

4105
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,590
under 65, though. They're just rebidding
65. If we trade under 65, I'm interested

4106
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:47,600
65. If we trade under 65, I'm interested
 

4107
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:57,270
65. If we trade under 65, I'm interested
for a flush down to 35s.

4108
01:49:57,270 --> 01:49:57,280

 

4109
01:49:57,280 --> 01:50:05,189

Relentless.

4110
01:50:05,189 --> 01:50:05,199

 

4111
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:07,830

Come on, Mark.

Come on, Mark.
 

4113
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,189
Come on, Mark.
You going to give me another trade today

4114
01:50:09,189 --> 01:50:09,199
You going to give me another trade today
 

4115
01:50:09,199 --> 01:50:12,790
You going to give me another trade today
or not? No. Rebid 30 65 again. Jesus

4116
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:12,800
or not? No. Rebid 30 65 again. Jesus
 

4117
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:17,590

Christ, these guys are [\h__\h] adamant.

4118
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:17,600

 

4119
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:19,830

Where do they want? They want 500. Like,

4120
01:50:19,830 --> 01:50:19,840
Where do they want? They want 500. Like,
 

4121
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,189
Where do they want? They want 500. Like,
where where the [\h__\h] are you trying to

4122
01:50:21,189 --> 01:50:21,199
where where the [\h__\h] are you trying to
 

4123
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:23,750
where where the [\h__\h] are you trying to
take it right now?

4124
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:23,760
take it right now?
 

4125
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:28,709
take it right now?
It's the next pivot.

4126
01:50:28,709 --> 01:50:28,719

 

4127
01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:30,149

I think this will be a look above and

4128
01:50:30,149 --> 01:50:30,159
I think this will be a look above and
 

4129
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:31,830
I think this will be a look above and
below. I cannot imagine them getting

4130
01:50:31,830 --> 01:50:31,840
below. I cannot imagine them getting
 

4131
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:35,030
below. I cannot imagine them getting
this up to 600 today. But

4132
01:50:35,030 --> 01:50:35,040
this up to 600 today. But
 

4133
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:42,310
this up to 600 today. But
what are we going to do? A 10% AMD day.

4134
01:50:42,310 --> 01:50:42,320

 

4135
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:50,870

Seriously,

4136
01:50:50,870 --> 01:50:50,880

 

4137
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,629

if buyers are stuck at 80 and above,

4138
01:50:52,629 --> 01:50:52,639
if buyers are stuck at 80 and above,
 

4139
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:54,709
if buyers are stuck at 80 and above,
over that will be a resqueeze. There is

4140
01:50:54,709 --> 01:50:54,719
over that will be a resqueeze. There is
 

4141
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:58,709
over that will be a resqueeze. There is
a little shelf at 84 and it's tiny.

4142
01:50:58,709 --> 01:50:58,719
a little shelf at 84 and it's tiny.
 

4143
01:50:58,719 --> 01:51:00,470
a little shelf at 84 and it's tiny.
I'm waiting for an entry for us to

4144
01:51:00,470 --> 01:51:00,480
I'm waiting for an entry for us to
 

4145
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:02,790
I'm waiting for an entry for us to
leave. If we leave 65, I'll look for a

4146
01:51:02,790 --> 01:51:02,800
leave. If we leave 65, I'll look for a
 

4147
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:20,870
leave. If we leave 65, I'll look for a
short. Not until then.

4148
01:51:20,870 --> 01:51:20,880

 

4149
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:22,550

Buy the dip there. Yeah, I mean, we did

4150
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:22,560
Buy the dip there. Yeah, I mean, we did
 

4151
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:24,870
Buy the dip there. Yeah, I mean, we did
buy the dip this morning. Should have

4152
01:51:24,870 --> 01:51:24,880
buy the dip this morning. Should have
 

4153
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,390
buy the dip this morning. Should have
held it longer, though. I just didn't

4154
01:51:26,390 --> 01:51:26,400
held it longer, though. I just didn't
 

4155
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:27,669
held it longer, though. I just didn't
think we'd come all the way back up

4156
01:51:27,669 --> 01:51:27,679
think we'd come all the way back up
 

4157
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:30,550
think we'd come all the way back up
here, but hey, it's all right. Okay,

4158
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:30,560
here, but hey, it's all right. Okay,
 

4159
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:33,350
here, but hey, it's all right. Okay,
here we go. Still watching these 65s.

4160
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:33,360
here we go. Still watching these 65s.
 

4161
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:34,790
here we go. Still watching these 65s.
There's still a guy trying to protect

4162
01:51:34,790 --> 01:51:34,800
There's still a guy trying to protect
 

4163
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:36,550
There's still a guy trying to protect
65. If we start flushing under that, I'm

4164
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:36,560
65. If we start flushing under that, I'm
 

4165
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,149
65. If we start flushing under that, I'm
going to join short for a move down to

4166
01:51:38,149 --> 01:51:38,159
going to join short for a move down to
 

4167
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:40,629
going to join short for a move down to
35. If we stay heavy under 35 and under

4168
01:51:40,629 --> 01:51:40,639
35. If we stay heavy under 35 and under
 

4169
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:42,149
35. If we stay heavy under 35 and under
20, I'm going to look for a full

4170
01:51:42,149 --> 01:51:42,159
20, I'm going to look for a full
 

4171
01:51:42,159 --> 01:51:43,910
20, I'm going to look for a full
rotation back down to IB. If we stay

4172
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:43,920
rotation back down to IB. If we stay
 

4173
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,990
rotation back down to IB. If we stay
heavy in there, we'll see if we can get

4174
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:46,000
heavy in there, we'll see if we can get
 

4175
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,830
heavy in there, we'll see if we can get
a full rotation all the way back down to

4176
01:51:47,830 --> 01:51:47,840
a full rotation all the way back down to
 

4177
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:49,750
a full rotation all the way back down to
here if they really want to do it. But

4178
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:49,760
here if they really want to do it. But
 

4179
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:51,669
here if they really want to do it. But
watching these areas as cover points

4180
01:51:51,669 --> 01:51:51,679
watching these areas as cover points
 

4181
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:54,149
watching these areas as cover points
right now. I'm not in yet. Waiting for

4182
01:51:54,149 --> 01:51:54,159
right now. I'm not in yet. Waiting for
 

4183
01:51:54,159 --> 01:51:57,270
right now. I'm not in yet. Waiting for
this market to let go of 65s.

4184
01:51:57,270 --> 01:51:57,280
this market to let go of 65s.
 

4185
01:51:57,280 --> 01:52:06,629
this market to let go of 65s.
We have a constant bid here still.

4186
01:52:06,629 --> 01:52:06,639

 

4187
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:09,270

Now they're bidding 70s. [\h__\h] hell.

4188
01:52:09,270 --> 01:52:09,280
Now they're bidding 70s. [\h__\h] hell.
 

4189
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:12,070
Now they're bidding 70s. [\h__\h] hell.
They're stacking nonstop,

4190
01:52:12,070 --> 01:52:12,080
They're stacking nonstop,
 

4191
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:14,870
They're stacking nonstop,
mate. I haven't seen it like this for a

4192
01:52:14,870 --> 01:52:14,880
mate. I haven't seen it like this for a
 

4193
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:17,189
mate. I haven't seen it like this for a
while. It goes quiet, quiet, quiet,

4194
01:52:17,189 --> 01:52:17,199
while. It goes quiet, quiet, quiet,
 

4195
01:52:17,199 --> 01:52:20,229
while. It goes quiet, quiet, quiet,
quiet, quiet, and then they step on. I

4196
01:52:20,229 --> 01:52:20,239
quiet, quiet, and then they step on. I
 

4197
01:52:20,239 --> 01:52:22,070
quiet, quiet, and then they step on. I
have not seen it like this for a while.

4198
01:52:22,070 --> 01:52:22,080
have not seen it like this for a while.
 

4199
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,589
have not seen it like this for a while.
It's definitely feels like a shift in

4200
01:52:23,589 --> 01:52:23,599
It's definitely feels like a shift in
 

4201
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:28,550
It's definitely feels like a shift in
tone today.

4202

Gray box to gray box. I took a little

01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:07,760
Gray box to gray box. I took a little
 

4405
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:11,750
Gray box to gray box. I took a little
piece there just in case. But

4406
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:11,760
piece there just in case. But
 

4407
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:14,629
piece there just in case. But

They had the chance to do it there. They

4410
01:58:16,870 --> 01:58:16,880
They had the chance to do it there. They
 

4411
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:18,310
They had the chance to do it there. They
had the chance to do it there. They're

4412
01:58:18,310 --> 01:58:18,320
had the chance to do it there. They're
 

4413
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:23,350
had the chance to do it there. They're
absorbing still.

4414
01:58:23,350 --> 01:58:23,360

 

4415
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:24,870

Maybe they resell it now, but they're

4416
01:58:24,870 --> 01:58:24,880
Maybe they resell it now, but they're
 

4417
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:27,030
Maybe they resell it now, but they're
they're being tricky buggers. So, we're

4418
01:58:27,030 --> 01:58:27,040
they're being tricky buggers. So, we're
 

4419
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:29,109
they're being tricky buggers. So, we're
doing rotation gray box to gray box,

4420
01:58:29,109 --> 01:58:29,119
doing rotation gray box to gray box,
 

4421
01:58:29,119 --> 01:58:31,109
doing rotation gray box to gray box,
gray box to gray box. This is why we

4422
01:58:31,109 --> 01:58:31,119
gray box to gray box. This is why we
 

4423
01:58:31,119 --> 01:58:32,709
gray box to gray box. This is why we
have it highlighted. I was looking for a

4424
01:58:32,709 --> 01:58:32,719
have it highlighted. I was looking for a
 

4425
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:34,390
have it highlighted. I was looking for a
bit deeper in this the other side of it.

4426
01:58:34,390 --> 01:58:34,400
bit deeper in this the other side of it.
 

4427
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:36,149
bit deeper in this the other side of it.
35s. I did pay myself some along the

4428
01:58:36,149 --> 01:58:36,159
35s. I did pay myself some along the
 

4429
01:58:36,159 --> 01:58:39,030
35s. I did pay myself some along the
way, but didn't make too much. And the

4430
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:39,040
way, but didn't make too much. And the
 

4431
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:40,470
way, but didn't make too much. And the
real price acceptance would be down

4432
01:58:40,470 --> 01:58:40,480
real price acceptance would be down
 

4433
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:44,870
real price acceptance would be down
here. If we keep building here,

4434
01:58:44,870 --> 01:58:44,880
here. If we keep building here,
 

4435
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:46,310
here. If we keep building here,
there is a pivot up here that you can

4436
01:58:46,310 --> 01:58:46,320
there is a pivot up here that you can
 

4437
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:48,790
there is a pivot up here that you can
come for.

4438
01:58:48,790 --> 01:58:48,800
come for.
 

4439
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:50,629
come for.
So, there you go. Try. I tried folks. I

4440
01:58:50,629 --> 01:58:50,639
So, there you go. Try. I tried folks. I
 

4441
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:52,709
So, there you go. Try. I tried folks. I
tried. Didn't get much out of it. No

4442
01:58:52,709 --> 01:58:52,719
tried. Didn't get much out of it. No
 

4443
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:57,750
tried. Didn't get much out of it. No
joy.

4444
01:58:57,750 --> 01:58:57,760

 

4445
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:00,149

Still 80s is a level where we have delta

4446
01:59:00,149 --> 01:59:00,159
Still 80s is a level where we have delta
 

4447
01:59:00,159 --> 01:59:01,990
Still 80s is a level where we have delta
trapped.

4448
01:59:01,990 --> 01:59:02,000
trapped.
 

4449
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:07,830
trapped.
Uh buy side

4450
01:59:07,830 --> 01:59:07,840

 

4451
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:10,790

right here. This level here is massive.

4452
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:10,800
right here. This level here is massive.
 

4453
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:12,870
right here. This level here is massive.
Right. I'm trying to trade down to here.

4454
01:59:12,870 --> 01:59:12,880
Right. I'm trying to trade down to here.
 

4455
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:15,510
Right. I'm trying to trade down to here.
So this is where buyers are stuck 80s

4456
01:59:15,510 --> 01:59:15,520
So this is where buyers are stuck 80s
 

4457
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:18,390
So this is where buyers are stuck 80s
and above and the seller is stuck at 35.

4458
01:59:18,390 --> 01:59:18,400
and above and the seller is stuck at 35.
 

4459
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:21,109
and above and the seller is stuck at 35.
So, I was trying to trade this 65 break.

4460
01:59:21,109 --> 01:59:21,119
So, I was trying to trade this 65 break.
 

4461
01:59:21,119 --> 01:59:22,709
So, I was trying to trade this 65 break.
You can see a 65 break. I'm trying to

4462
01:59:22,709 --> 01:59:22,719
You can see a 65 break. I'm trying to
 

4463
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:24,950
You can see a 65 break. I'm trying to
trade it down into this pivot here.

4464
01:59:24,950 --> 01:59:24,960
trade it down into this pivot here.
 

4465
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:26,310
trade it down into this pivot here.
That's what I was trying to do in this

4466
01:59:26,310 --> 01:59:26,320
That's what I was trying to do in this
 

4467
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:28,550
That's what I was trying to do in this
low volume node. Didn't quite make it.

4468
01:59:28,550 --> 01:59:28,560
low volume node. Didn't quite make it.
 

4469
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:29,910
low volume node. Didn't quite make it.
Was a little bit short, but you can see

4470
01:59:29,910 --> 01:59:29,920
Was a little bit short, but you can see
 

4471
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:32,322
Was a little bit short, but you can see
the thesis what I'm looking for.

4472
01:59:32,322 --> 01:59:32,332
the thesis what I'm looking for.
 

4473
01:59:32,332 --> 01:59:33,109
the thesis what I'm looking for.

me uh they're going to do it now, aren't
 

4513
02:00:33,199 --> 02:00:41,830
me uh they're going to do it now, aren't
they? [\h__\h] sake. I'm out.

4514
02:00:41,830 --> 02:00:41,840

 

4515
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:55,910

Get a re-entry here or not

4516
02:00:55,910 --> 02:00:55,920

 

4517
02:00:55,920 --> 02:01:01,270

re-entry.

4518
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:01,280

 

4519
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:02,709

Let me show you what I'm talking about.

4520
02:01:02,709 --> 02:01:02,719
Let me show you what I'm talking about.
 

4521
02:01:02,719 --> 02:01:04,070
Let me show you what I'm talking about.
You need to be aware of this on the

4522
02:01:04,070 --> 02:01:04,080
You need to be aware of this on the
 

4523
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:07,350
You need to be aware of this on the
hourly, right? If they hold this pivot,

4524
02:01:07,350 --> 02:01:07,360
hourly, right? If they hold this pivot,
 

4525
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:08,790
hourly, right? If they hold this pivot,
right? If they're very very strong today

4526
02:01:08,790 --> 02:01:08,800
right? If they're very very strong today
 

4527
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:11,430
right? If they're very very strong today
and they hold above this, this rotation

4528
02:01:11,430 --> 02:01:11,440
and they hold above this, this rotation
 

4529
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:13,990
and they hold above this, this rotation
can happen. Um the better short comes

4530
02:01:13,990 --> 02:01:14,000
can happen. Um the better short comes
 

4531
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,350
can happen. Um the better short comes
when they let go of this. All right? So

4532
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:15,360
when they let go of this. All right? So
 

4533
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:16,950
when they let go of this. All right? So
if this what does that mean? That means

4534
02:01:16,950 --> 02:01:16,960
if this what does that mean? That means
 

4535
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:19,910
if this what does that mean? That means
this would be a look above and fail

4536
02:01:19,910 --> 02:01:19,920
this would be a look above and fail
 

4537
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:22,550
this would be a look above and fail
and this can happen back down. Right? So

4538
02:01:22,550 --> 02:01:22,560
and this can happen back down. Right? So
 

4539
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:24,149
and this can happen back down. Right? So
at the moment we've got one of these.

4540
02:01:24,149 --> 02:01:24,159
at the moment we've got one of these.
 

4541
02:01:24,159 --> 02:01:25,430
at the moment we've got one of these.
This is a straight squeeze out. There's

4542
02:01:25,430 --> 02:01:25,440
This is a straight squeeze out. There's
 

4543
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:26,790
This is a straight squeeze out. There's
been no pullback. We're looking for that

4544
02:01:26,790 --> 02:01:26,800
been no pullback. We're looking for that
 

4545
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:28,470
been no pullback. We're looking for that
pullback. So we can fade that pullback.

4546
02:01:28,470 --> 02:01:28,480
pullback. So we can fade that pullback.
 

4547
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:29,830
pullback. So we can fade that pullback.
We don't know how far that pullback

4548
02:01:29,830 --> 02:01:29,840
We don't know how far that pullback
 

4549
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:32,070
We don't know how far that pullback
comes. It might be that that pullback

4550
02:01:32,070 --> 02:01:32,080
comes. It might be that that pullback
 

4551
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:34,149
comes. It might be that that pullback
you're going to get 35s maybe only comes

4552
02:01:34,149 --> 02:01:34,159
you're going to get 35s maybe only comes
 

4553
02:01:34,159 --> 02:01:35,830
you're going to get 35s maybe only comes
to here. It might be that it comes all

4554
02:01:35,830 --> 02:01:35,840
to here. It might be that it comes all
 

4555
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:36,950
to here. It might be that it comes all
the way down to here. So that's why

4556
02:01:36,950 --> 02:01:36,960
the way down to here. So that's why
 

4557
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:58,070
the way down to here. So that's why
we're trying to position for it.

4558
02:01:58,070 --> 02:01:58,080

 

4559
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:00,950

35s and 20 still big level. 35s and 20.

4560
02:02:00,950 --> 02:02:00,960
35s and 20 still big level. 35s and 20.
 

4561
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:02,950
35s and 20 still big level. 35s and 20.
You might get it.

4562
02:02:02,950 --> 02:02:02,960
You might get it.
 

4563
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:05,990
You might get it.
You might get it here. This level here

4564
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:06,000
You might get it here. This level here
 

4565
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,750
You might get it here. This level here
and this level here underneath

4566
02:02:07,750 --> 02:02:07,760
and this level here underneath
 

4567
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:09,669
and this level here underneath
underneath this and this. There's

4568
02:02:09,669 --> 02:02:09,679
underneath this and this. There's
 

4569
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:12,470
underneath this and this. There's
potential for a bigger fade.

4570
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:12,480
potential for a bigger fade.
 

4571
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:14,229
potential for a bigger fade.
This we lack structure in here. So it's

4572
02:02:14,229 --> 02:02:14,239
This we lack structure in here. So it's
 

4573
02:02:14,239 --> 02:02:16,149
This we lack structure in here. So it's
why this is a big level because if we do

4574
02:02:16,149 --> 02:02:16,159
why this is a big level because if we do
 

4575
02:02:16,159 --> 02:02:18,070
why this is a big level because if we do
this, we can fill some of this structure

4576
02:02:18,070 --> 02:02:18,080
this, we can fill some of this structure
 

4577
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:21,510
this, we can fill some of this structure
in.

4578
02:02:21,510 --> 02:02:21,520

 

4579
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:25,109

Here we go. So 50s.

4580
02:02:25,109 --> 02:02:25,119
Here we go. So 50s.
 

4581
02:02:25,119 --> 02:02:28,149
Here we go. So 50s.
Can you get those 35s and below?

4582
02:02:28,149 --> 02:02:28,159
Can you get those 35s and below?
 

4583
02:02:28,159 --> 02:02:39,000
Can you get those 35s and below?
They're

4584
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:39,010

 

4585
02:02:39,010 --> 02:02:41,669

4586

4587
02:02:41,679 --> 02:02:43,669

stacking 50s down to 30s at the moment.

4588
02:02:43,669 --> 02:02:43,679
stacking 50s down to 30s at the moment.
 

4589
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:45,510
stacking 50s down to 30s at the moment.
Be nice if you filled some of that for

4590
02:02:45,510 --> 02:02:45,520
Be nice if you filled some of that for
 

4591
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:46,950
Be nice if you filled some of that for
those of you who are still short so you

4592
02:02:46,950 --> 02:02:46,960
those of you who are still short so you
 

4593
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:49,430
those of you who are still short so you
could get some profits. And just be

4594
02:02:49,430 --> 02:02:49,440
could get some profits. And just be
 

4595
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:51,109
could get some profits. And just be
careful between these two gray boxes,

4596
02:02:51,109 --> 02:02:51,119
careful between these two gray boxes,
 

4597
02:02:51,119 --> 02:03:02,709

squeezing, folks. That thing has been a

02:03:27,910 --> 02:03:27,920
squeezing, folks. That thing has been a
 

4611
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:30,629
squeezing, folks. That thing has been a
rocket ship today

Um, let me do from EDC

4616
02:03:38,550 --> 02:03:38,560

 

4617
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:40,870

here.

4618
02:03:40,870 --> 02:03:40,880
here.
 

4619
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:43,109
here.
It's right into its golden zone at the

It's right into its golden zone at the
 

4621

It's right into its golden zone at the
moment. All the way up to 8436 is

4622
02:03:50,390 --> 02:03:50,400

 

4623
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:53,990

just depends.

4624
02:03:53,990 --> 02:03:54,000

 

4625
02:03:54,000 --> 02:04:02,950

depends what they want to do with it.

4626
02:04:02,950 --> 02:04:02,960

 

4627
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:04,709

What was the chip news today? Did I miss

4628
02:04:04,709 --> 02:04:04,719
What was the chip news today? Did I miss
 

4629
02:04:04,719 --> 02:04:06,070
What was the chip news today? Did I miss
something? Maybe some of you can tell me

4630
02:04:06,070 --> 02:04:06,080
something? Maybe some of you can tell me
 

4631
02:04:06,080 --> 02:04:12,470
something? Maybe some of you can tell me
what was the big chip news.

4632
02:04:12,470 --> 02:04:12,480

 

4633
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:16,950

I see sellers trapped at 450. Um,

4634
02:04:16,950 --> 02:04:16,960
I see sellers trapped at 450. Um,
 

4635
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:20,229
I see sellers trapped at 450. Um,
no, not really.

4636
02:04:20,229 --> 02:04:20,239
no, not really.
 

4637
02:04:20,239 --> 02:04:23,510
no, not really.
470 to 460 is where sellers have come

4638
02:04:23,510 --> 02:04:23,520
470 to 460 is where sellers have come
 

4639

470 to 460 is where sellers have come
in.

And they're going to go again. Wow. Just

4642
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:31,760
And they're going to go again. Wow. Just
 

4643

And they're going to go again. Wow. Just
every dip holding. Incredible. Well,

every dip holding. Incredible. Well,
just a day not to fade. Just a day to

02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:44,320

 

4649
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:47,510

There we go. 500's coming up then.

4650
02:04:47,510 --> 02:04:47,520
There we go. 500's coming up then.

There we go. 500's coming up then.
Mental. This is quite the move today, I

4652
02:04:51,750 --> 02:04:51,760
Mental. This is quite the move today, I
 

4653
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:53,910
Mental. This is quite the move today, I
will tell you. If you want to have a

4654
02:04:53,910 --> 02:04:53,920
will tell you. If you want to have a
 

4655
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:56,310
will tell you. If you want to have a
look at five minute, this is pretty

4656
02:04:56,310 --> 02:04:56,320
look at five minute, this is pretty
 

4657
02:04:56,320 --> 02:05:00,790
look at five minute, this is pretty
steep. This is pretty pretty impressive.

4658
02:05:00,790 --> 02:05:00,800
steep. This is pretty pretty impressive.

02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:03,350
steep. This is pretty pretty impressive.
It's a pretty impressive move from these

It's a pretty impressive move from these
folks today. I'm I am impressed. I am

previous day high. We've gone from under

previous day high. We've gone from under
 

4667

previous day high. We've gone from under
previous day low with no acceptance to

02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:16,149
above previous day high. Like nothing
happened. Like yesterday meant nothing.

4672
02:05:16,149 --> 02:05:16,159
happened. Like yesterday meant nothing.

right. Buyers now will want to control
 

4677
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:21,510
right. Buyers now will want to control
above 480. Remember that was the level

4678
02:05:21,510 --> 02:05:21,520
above 480. Remember that was the level
 

4679
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:23,109
above 480. Remember that was the level
that buyers were stuck. If they stay

4680
02:05:23,109 --> 02:05:23,119
that buyers were stuck. If they stay
 

4681
02:05:23,119 --> 02:05:27,669
that buyers were stuck. If they stay
above 480, they can keep squeezing.

4682
02:05:27,669 --> 02:05:27,679
above 480, they can keep squeezing.
 

4683
02:05:27,679 --> 02:05:29,109
above 480, they can keep squeezing.

There's just a aggressive rebid. Wild.
Come on.

Come on.
 

4831
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,350
Come on.
We need these buyers to be trapped. We

4832
02:10:13,350 --> 02:10:13,360
We need these buyers to be trapped. We
 

4833
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:15,750
We need these buyers to be trapped. We
got to move aggressively lower. I'm

4834
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:15,760
got to move aggressively lower. I'm
 

4835
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:19,350
got to move aggressively lower. I'm
getting impatient. Come on.

4836
02:10:19,350 --> 02:10:19,360
getting impatient. Come on.
 

4837
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:22,709
getting impatient. Come on.
Very impatient at this point.

4838
02:10:22,709 --> 02:10:22,719
Very impatient at this point.
 

4839
02:10:22,719 --> 02:10:25,030
Very impatient at this point.
Yeah, exactly, Peter. It's where my

4840
02:10:25,030 --> 02:10:25,040
Yeah, exactly, Peter. It's where my
 

4841
02:10:25,040 --> 02:10:26,390
Yeah, exactly, Peter. It's where my
head's at. Are we just going to go

4842
02:10:26,390 --> 02:10:26,400
head's at. Are we just going to go
 

4843
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:29,189
head's at. Are we just going to go
sideways?

4844
02:10:29,189 --> 02:10:29,199
sideways?
 

4845
02:10:29,199 --> 02:10:30,629
sideways?
They don't have The problem is they

4846
02:10:30,629 --> 02:10:30,639
They don't have The problem is they
 

4847
02:10:30,639 --> 02:10:32,069
They don't have The problem is they
don't have to dump it. If they're not

4848
02:10:32,069 --> 02:10:32,079
don't have to dump it. If they're not
 

4849
02:10:32,079 --> 02:10:33,750
don't have to dump it. If they're not
going to leave, if they're not going to

4850
02:10:33,750 --> 02:10:33,760
going to leave, if they're not going to
 

4851
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:35,669
going to leave, if they're not going to
aggressively leave away, then we're

4852
02:10:35,669 --> 02:10:35,679
aggressively leave away, then we're
 

4853
02:10:35,679 --> 02:10:37,350
aggressively leave away, then we're
going to bid up. I'm trying to tell

4854
02:10:37,350 --> 02:10:37,360
going to bid up. I'm trying to tell
 

4855
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:39,669
going to bid up. I'm trying to tell
myself, I have to remember, we're over

4856
02:10:39,669 --> 02:10:39,679
myself, I have to remember, we're over
 

4857
02:10:39,679 --> 02:10:42,870
myself, I have to remember, we're over
value. We're over IB. Trend has been up.

4858
02:10:42,870 --> 02:10:42,880
value. We're over IB. Trend has been up.
 

4859
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:44,950
value. We're over IB. Trend has been up.
We're in a squeeze. I'm trying to play

4860
02:10:44,950 --> 02:10:44,960
We're in a squeeze. I'm trying to play
 

4861
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:46,550
We're in a squeeze. I'm trying to play
from here to here to here to here, but

4862
02:10:46,550 --> 02:10:46,560
from here to here to here to here, but
 

4863
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:48,390
from here to here to here to here, but
it's just not giving it to me. And if it

4864
02:10:48,390 --> 02:10:48,400
it's just not giving it to me. And if it
 

4865
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:49,990
it's just not giving it to me. And if it
doesn't give it to me, I have to respect

4866
02:10:49,990 --> 02:10:50,000
doesn't give it to me, I have to respect
 

4867
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,470
doesn't give it to me, I have to respect
it. So, I'm trying to sit in this with a

4868
02:10:52,470 --> 02:10:52,480
it. So, I'm trying to sit in this with a
 

4869
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:54,870
it. So, I'm trying to sit in this with a
stop here to protect it, but it's it's

4870
02:10:54,870 --> 02:10:54,880
stop here to protect it, but it's it's
 

4871
02:10:54,880 --> 02:10:59,350
stop here to protect it, but it's it's
just not behaving right now. AMD still

4872
02:10:59,350 --> 02:10:59,360
just not behaving right now. AMD still
 

4873
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:04,950
just not behaving right now. AMD still
[\h__\h] going, man. Oh my god.

4874
02:11:04,950 --> 02:11:04,960

 

4875
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:11,430

They're trying to retest the high again.

4876
02:11:11,430 --> 02:11:11,440

 

4877
02:11:11,440 --> 02:11:14,149

Is Nvidia right into that 5day on

4878
02:11:14,149 --> 02:11:14,159
Is Nvidia right into that 5day on
 

4879
02:11:14,159 --> 02:11:16,390
Is Nvidia right into that 5day on
Nvidia. We're close. It feels close to a

4880
02:11:16,390 --> 02:11:16,400
Nvidia. We're close. It feels close to a
 

4881
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:18,069
Nvidia. We're close. It feels close to a
top here, but if they resqueeze it,

4882
02:11:18,069 --> 02:11:18,079
top here, but if they resqueeze it,
 

4883
02:11:18,079 --> 02:11:20,629
top here, but if they resqueeze it,
Nvidia can it's going to go 848450 and

4884
02:11:20,629 --> 02:11:20,639
Nvidia can it's going to go 848450 and
 

4885
02:11:20,639 --> 02:11:23,005
Nvidia can it's going to go 848450 and
this thing's going to [\h__\h] fly again.

4886
02:11:23,005 --> 02:11:23,015
this thing's going to [\h__\h] fly again.
 

4887
02:11:23,015 --> 02:11:32,390
this thing's going to [\h__\h] fly again.

4889
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:33,830

I don't think this has got anything to

4890
02:11:33,830 --> 02:11:33,840
I don't think this has got anything to
 

4891
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:35,030
I don't think this has got anything to
do with Trump's talk. I'm going to be

4892
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:35,040
do with Trump's talk. I'm going to be
 

4893
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:36,310
do with Trump's talk. I'm going to be
honest with you. It's got absolutely

4894
02:11:36,310 --> 02:11:36,320
honest with you. It's got absolutely
 

4895
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:37,830
honest with you. It's got absolutely
nothing to do with his talk. I don't

4896
02:11:37,830 --> 02:11:37,840
nothing to do with his talk. I don't
 

4897
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:39,669
nothing to do with his talk. I don't
think anyone pays much attention to him

4898
02:11:39,669 --> 02:11:39,679
think anyone pays much attention to him
 

4899
02:11:39,679 --> 02:11:44,149
think anyone pays much attention to him
now. [snorts]

4900

4901
02:11:44,159 --> 02:11:46,709

Okay, come on. Still protecting it.

02:11:46,709 --> 02:11:46,719
Okay, come on. Still protecting it.
 

4903

4907
02:11:51,119 --> 02:11:54,790
through 50s and go 35. Look at all the
stacks here. 50, 45, 40, 35, 30. All

4908
02:11:54,790 --> 02:11:54,800

stacking up bid side.

4910
02:12:04,870 --> 02:12:04,880

 

4911
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:06,069

I want to try and get a piece out

4912
02:12:06,069 --> 02:12:06,079
I want to try and get a piece out
 

4913

I want to try and get a piece out
towards the 35s if I can. Just looking

4915
02:12:08,239 --> 02:12:10,069
towards the 35s if I can. Just looking
for one more flush. There's so many bids

4916
02:12:10,069 --> 02:12:10,079
for one more flush. There's so many bids
 

4917
02:12:10,079 --> 02:12:12,069
for one more flush. There's so many bids

4940
02:13:01,430 --> 02:13:01,440
down so I can at least move my stop.
 

4941
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:04,950

Going to go insane.
 

4947
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:12,709
Going to go insane.
It's not that hard to do 20 point flush,

4948
02:13:12,709 --> 02:13:12,719
It's not that hard to do 20 point flush,
 

4949
02:13:12,719 --> 02:13:15,589
It's not that hard to do 20 point flush,

I'm going to show you what I'm looking

4954
02:13:19,030 --> 02:13:19,040
I'm going to show you what I'm looking
 

4955
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:22,069
I'm going to show you what I'm looking
at. But Mm. It is absolutely ludicrous.

We've got all these guys stacked and

We've got all these guys stacked and
 

4959
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:26,470
We've got all these guys stacked and
they are front running it every time and

4960
02:13:26,470 --> 02:13:26,480
they are front running it every time and
 

4961
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:28,149
they are front running it every time and
rebidding up and rebidding up. All I

4962
02:13:28,149 --> 02:13:28,159
rebidding up and rebidding up. All I
 

4963
02:13:28,159 --> 02:13:29,669
rebidding up and rebidding up. All I
want to do is fill these participants

4964
02:13:29,669 --> 02:13:29,679
want to do is fill these participants
 

4965
02:13:29,679 --> 02:13:31,430
want to do is fill these participants
and get a cover out into here and it's

4966
02:13:31,430 --> 02:13:31,440
and get a cover out into here and it's
 

4967
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:34,870
and get a cover out into here and it's
just not flipping happening. It is not

4968
02:13:34,870 --> 02:13:34,880
just not flipping happening. It is not
 

4969
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:37,109
just not flipping happening. It is not
happening.

4970
02:13:37,109 --> 02:13:37,119
happening.
 

4971
02:13:37,119 --> 02:13:40,870
happening.
So, I have to respect what I'm seeing.

4972
02:13:40,870 --> 02:13:40,880
So, I have to respect what I'm seeing.
 

4973
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:42,550
So, I have to respect what I'm seeing.
I have to respect what I'm seeing. We're

4974
02:13:42,550 --> 02:13:42,560
I have to respect what I'm seeing. We're
 

4975
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:44,149
I have to respect what I'm seeing. We're
just going to keep getting stuck between

4976
02:13:44,149 --> 02:13:44,159
just going to keep getting stuck between
 

4977
02:13:44,159 --> 02:13:52,347
just going to keep getting stuck between
these gray boxes.

4978
02:13:52,347 --> 02:13:52,357

 

4979
02:13:52,357 --> 02:13:54,629

[sighs]

4980
02:13:54,629 --> 02:13:54,639

Oh my days.

5005
02:14:57,599 --> 02:14:59,830

Has 20 points ever been so hard in all

5006
02:14:59,830 --> 02:14:59,840
Has 20 points ever been so hard in all
 

5007
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:19,109
Has 20 points ever been so hard in all
my life? I don't think so.

5008
02:15:19,109 --> 02:15:19,119

 

5009
02:15:19,119 --> 02:15:21,589

Need to be very careful here, folks. I'm

5010
02:15:21,589 --> 02:15:21,599
Need to be very careful here, folks. I'm
 

5011
02:15:21,599 --> 02:15:23,189
Need to be very careful here, folks. I'm
watching the hourly. You need to be very

5012
02:15:23,189 --> 02:15:23,199
watching the hourly. You need to be very
 

5013
02:15:23,199 --> 02:15:25,669
watching the hourly. You need to be very
careful. If it starts holding here into

5014
02:15:25,669 --> 02:15:25,679
careful. If it starts holding here into
 

5015
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:29,109
careful. If it starts holding here into
sort of 420s and even above this, this

5016
02:15:29,109 --> 02:15:29,119
sort of 420s and even above this, this
 

5017
02:15:29,119 --> 02:15:30,950
sort of 420s and even above this, this
can be a 1 hour flag that then breaks

5018
02:15:30,950 --> 02:15:30,960
can be a 1 hour flag that then breaks
 

5019
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:33,109
can be a 1 hour flag that then breaks
higher. You need to be very very very

5020
02:15:33,109 --> 02:15:33,119
higher. You need to be very very very
 

5021
02:15:33,119 --> 02:15:45,430
higher. You need to be very very very
careful here.

5022
02:15:45,430 --> 02:15:45,440

 

5023
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:47,189

I've been here 40 minutes now going

5024
02:15:47,189 --> 02:15:47,199
I've been here 40 minutes now going
 

5025
02:15:47,199 --> 02:15:58,550
I've been here 40 minutes now going
sideways.

5026
02:15:58,550 --> 02:15:58,560

 

5027
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:00,069

It's not been a [\h__\h] I mean, we made

5028
02:16:00,069 --> 02:16:00,079
It's not been a [\h__\h] I mean, we made
 

5029
02:16:00,079 --> 02:16:02,229
It's not been a [\h__\h] I mean, we made
really good money today. I'm I'm like,

5030
02:16:02,229 --> 02:16:02,239
really good money today. I'm I'm like,
 

5031
02:16:02,239 --> 02:16:04,390
really good money today. I'm I'm like,
look, we for those joining late, we were

5032
02:16:04,390 --> 02:16:04,400
look, we for those joining late, we were
 

5033
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:07,030
look, we for those joining late, we were
long here today and here for this move

5034
02:16:07,030 --> 02:16:07,040
long here today and here for this move
 

5035
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:09,589
long here today and here for this move
into here. I sold that cuz I thought

5036
02:16:09,589 --> 02:16:09,599
into here. I sold that cuz I thought
 

5037
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:11,270
into here. I sold that cuz I thought
we'd come back for a retest of this and

5038
02:16:11,270 --> 02:16:11,280
we'd come back for a retest of this and
 

5039
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:12,629
we'd come back for a retest of this and
then I could think about that if I

5040
02:16:12,629 --> 02:16:12,639
then I could think about that if I
 

5041
02:16:12,639 --> 02:16:14,629
then I could think about that if I
really wanted, but we just went straight

5042
02:16:14,629 --> 02:16:14,639
really wanted, but we just went straight
 

5043
02:16:14,639 --> 02:16:17,830
really wanted, but we just went straight
squeeze. And so now I got stuck waiting

5044
02:16:17,830 --> 02:16:17,840
squeeze. And so now I got stuck waiting
 

5045
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:20,550
squeeze. And so now I got stuck waiting
to try and fade this back in. Um, it

5046
02:16:20,550 --> 02:16:20,560
to try and fade this back in. Um, it
 

5047
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:22,550
to try and fade this back in. Um, it
doesn't have to do it. It really does

5048
02:16:22,550 --> 02:16:22,560
doesn't have to do it. It really does
 

5049
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:24,069
doesn't have to do it. It really does
not have to do it. So, this why I keep

5050
02:16:24,069 --> 02:16:24,079
not have to do it. So, this why I keep
 

5051
02:16:24,079 --> 02:16:25,430
not have to do it. So, this why I keep
telling myself, if it doesn't want to do

5052
02:16:25,430 --> 02:16:25,440
telling myself, if it doesn't want to do
 

5053
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:26,950
telling myself, if it doesn't want to do
it, it doesn't want to do it. You can't

5054
02:16:26,950 --> 02:16:26,960
it, it doesn't want to do it. You can't
 

5055
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:29,510
it, it doesn't want to do it. You can't
push away. Nvidia with a stronger sell

5056
02:16:29,510 --> 02:16:29,520
push away. Nvidia with a stronger sell
 

5057
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:31,669
push away. Nvidia with a stronger sell
here now back down to the 83s. It's into

5058
02:16:31,669 --> 02:16:31,679
here now back down to the 83s. It's into
 

5059
02:16:31,679 --> 02:16:49,750
here now back down to the 83s. It's into
a 5m minutee pivot here though.

5060
02:16:49,750 --> 02:16:49,760

 

5061
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:57,059

There you go.

We are rejecting point of control,
 

5073
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:12,389
We are rejecting point of control,
though, which is a start. I guess it's

5074
02:17:12,389 --> 02:17:12,399
though, which is a start. I guess it's
 

5075
02:17:12,399 --> 02:17:16,790
though, which is a start. I guess it's
it's something, right? It's something

5076
02:17:16,790 --> 02:17:16,800
it's something, right? It's something

The problem is if is is is this an
 

5081
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:41,589
The problem is if is is is this an
hourly hold? This is the like the big

5082
02:17:41,589 --> 02:17:41,599

02:17:43,270 --> 02:17:43,280
question I've got right now versus
 

5085
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:46,870
question I've got right now versus
current uh developing profile 420. So

5086
02:17:46,870 --> 02:17:46,880
current uh developing profile 420. So
 

5087
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:48,230
current uh developing profile 420. So
that's I'm going to have to be very

5088
02:17:48,230 --> 02:17:48,240
that's I'm going to have to be very
 

5089

5290
02:24:39,429 --> 02:24:39,439
all right, we can travel all the way
 

5291
02:24:39,439 --> 02:24:42,870
all right, we can travel all the way
back down. All right, so if you're short

5292
02:24:42,870 --> 02:24:42,880
back down. All right, so if you're short
 

5293
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:45,270
back down. All right, so if you're short
from any of these, all right, trim some

5294
02:24:45,270 --> 02:24:45,280
from any of these, all right, trim some
 

5295
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:47,270
from any of these, all right, trim some
into here. And if you get a flush

5296
02:24:47,270 --> 02:24:47,280
into here. And if you get a flush
 

5297
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:49,110
into here. And if you get a flush
moment, we might find it all the way

5298
02:24:49,110 --> 02:24:49,120
moment, we might find it all the way
 

5299
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:52,469
moment, we might find it all the way
down. All right, you you might be

5300
02:24:52,469 --> 02:24:52,479
down. All right, you you might be
 

5301
02:24:52,479 --> 02:24:56,389
down. All right, you you might be
absolutely laughing. And um well, I just

you're covering some here. This is the

5306
02:24:59,190 --> 02:24:59,200
you're covering some here. This is the
 

5307
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:00,710
you're covering some here. This is the
edge. Remember, we talked about the edge

5308
02:25:00,710 --> 02:25:00,720
edge. Remember, we talked about the edge
 

5309
02:25:00,720 --> 02:25:02,389
edge. Remember, we talked about the edge
of where the hourly might want to stop.

5310
02:25:02,389 --> 02:25:02,399
of where the hourly might want to stop.
 

5311
02:25:02,399 --> 02:25:04,389
of where the hourly might want to stop.
You need to be very, very aware that if

5312
02:25:04,389 --> 02:25:04,399
You need to be very, very aware that if
 

5313
02:25:04,399 --> 02:25:06,550
You need to be very, very aware that if
we're going to find bid support here,

5314
02:25:06,550 --> 02:25:06,560
we're going to find bid support here,
 

5315
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:08,309
we're going to find bid support here,
they can rebid. But if they lose this,

5316
02:25:08,309 --> 02:25:08,319
they can rebid. But if they lose this,
 

5317
02:25:08,319 --> 02:25:10,230
they can rebid. But if they lose this,
this trade here in this low volume can

5318
02:25:10,230 --> 02:25:10,240
this trade here in this low volume can
 

5319
02:25:10,240 --> 02:25:13,590
this trade here in this low volume can
happen.

5320
02:25:13,590 --> 02:25:13,600

5341
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:25,270
paid yourself, hold a runner here. Um,
if they start letting go of this, it

5342
02:26:25,270 --> 02:26:25,280
if they start letting go of this, it
 

5343
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:27,110
if they start letting go of this, it
will be fantastic. We really lack

5344
02:26:27,110 --> 02:26:27,120
will be fantastic. We really lack
 

5345
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:29,670
will be fantastic. We really lack
structure in here. Okay, we lack

5346
02:26:29,670 --> 02:26:29,680
structure in here. Okay, we lack
 

5347
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:31,830
structure in here. Okay, we lack
structure in here. might very well be

5348
02:26:31,830 --> 02:26:31,840
structure in here. might very well be
 

5349
02:26:31,840 --> 02:26:33,670
structure in here. might very well be
that it comes and fills all of this in.

5350
02:26:33,670 --> 02:26:33,680
that it comes and fills all of this in.
 

5351
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:35,429
that it comes and fills all of this in.
All right, it very well might do that,

5352
02:26:35,429 --> 02:26:35,439
All right, it very well might do that,
 

5353
02:26:35,439 --> 02:26:36,790
All right, it very well might do that,
which is why I was trying to position

5354
02:26:36,790 --> 02:26:36,800
which is why I was trying to position
 

5355
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:40,309
which is why I was trying to position
for it. We were so patient. I mean, we

5356
02:26:40,309 --> 02:26:40,319
for it. We were so patient. I mean, we
 

5357
02:26:40,319 --> 02:26:43,110
for it. We were so patient. I mean, we
were so patient waiting for the peak,

5358
02:26:43,110 --> 02:26:43,120
were so patient waiting for the peak,
 

5359
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:45,030
were so patient waiting for the peak,
waiting for the trapped uh uh

5360
02:26:45,030 --> 02:26:45,040
waiting for the trapped uh uh
 

5361
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:47,910
waiting for the trapped uh uh
participants over 80s. We had like one

5362
02:26:47,910 --> 02:26:47,920
participants over 80s. We had like one
 

5363
02:26:47,920 --> 02:26:49,990
participants over 80s. We had like one
more push in, I stopped out and sort of

5364
02:26:49,990 --> 02:26:50,000
more push in, I stopped out and sort of
 

5365
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:51,429
more push in, I stopped out and sort of
gave up on it then. Probably shouldn't

5366
02:26:51,429 --> 02:26:51,439
gave up on it then. Probably shouldn't
 

5367
02:26:51,439 --> 02:26:52,710
gave up on it then. Probably shouldn't
have given up on it then. That was

5368
02:26:52,710 --> 02:26:52,720
have given up on it then. That was
 

5369
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:54,230
have given up on it then. That was
probably the next chance. And now you've

5370
02:26:54,230 --> 02:26:54,240
probably the next chance. And now you've
 

5371
02:26:54,240 --> 02:26:56,630
probably the next chance. And now you've
got this cell on the flow zone trying to

5372
02:26:56,630 --> 02:26:56,640
got this cell on the flow zone trying to
 

5373
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:58,710
got this cell on the flow zone trying to
rotate. So watch initial balance es into

5374
02:26:58,710 --> 02:26:58,720
rotate. So watch initial balance es into
 

5375
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:00,309
rotate. So watch initial balance es into
IB now. So, you want to be aware this

5376
02:27:00,309 --> 02:27:00,319
IB now. So, you want to be aware this
 

5377
02:27:00,319 --> 02:27:02,630
IB now. So, you want to be aware this
area here is key.

5378
02:27:02,630 --> 02:27:02,640
area here is key.
 

5379
02:27:02,640 --> 02:27:05,510
area here is key.
Um, just to manage your position here.

5393
02:27:29,359 --> 02:27:30,870
you're comfortably in the money now. I
cannot believe that stopped me out. That

5394
02:27:30,870 --> 02:27:30,880
cannot believe that stopped me out. That
 

5395
02:27:30,880 --> 02:27:32,230
cannot believe that stopped me out. That
is my fault. I probably should have put

5396
02:27:32,230 --> 02:27:32,240
is my fault. I probably should have put
 

5397
02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:38,150
is my fault. I probably should have put
my stop at 80. I was short in here.

5398
02:27:38,150 --> 02:27:38,160

 

5399
02:27:38,160 --> 02:27:43,030

02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:03,349
And it's respecting previous days point
of control really well here. So, really,

5528
02:31:03,349 --> 02:31:03,359
of control really well here. So, really,
 

5529
02:31:03,359 --> 02:31:05,110

02:31:05,110 --> 02:31:05,120
really nice trade. You never know like
 

5531
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:08,630
really nice trade. You never know like
if you get I wouldn't I wouldn't expect

5532
02:31:08,630 --> 02:31:08,640
if you get I wouldn't I wouldn't expect
 

5533
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:10,870
if you get I wouldn't I wouldn't expect
it, but if you got very lucky, you'd get

5534
02:31:10,870 --> 02:31:10,880
it, but if you got very lucky, you'd get
 

5535
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:13,110
it, but if you got very lucky, you'd get
this move here. Now,

5536
02:31:13,110 --> 02:31:13,120
this move here. Now,
 

5537
02:31:13,120 --> 02:31:14,870
this move here. Now,
this is still a squeeze, right? So,

5538
02:31:14,870 --> 02:31:14,880
this is still a squeeze, right? So,
 

5539
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:16,389
this is still a squeeze, right? So,
we're just repricing that squeeze, but

5540
02:31:16,389 --> 02:31:16,399
we're just repricing that squeeze, but
 

5541
02:31:16,399 --> 02:31:18,550
we're just repricing that squeeze, but
I'd be out most of my position here.

5542
02:31:18,550 --> 02:31:18,560
I'd be out most of my position here.
 

5543
02:31:18,560 --> 02:31:20,550
I'd be out most of my position here.
This is very similar. It's like the

5544
02:31:20,550 --> 02:31:20,560
This is very similar. It's like the
 

5545
02:31:20,560 --> 02:31:22,630
This is very similar. It's like the
reverse of the first long we took this

5546
02:31:22,630 --> 02:31:22,640
reverse of the first long we took this
 

5547
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:24,389
reverse of the first long we took this
morning. Remember the long we took from

5548
02:31:24,389 --> 02:31:24,399
morning. Remember the long we took from
 

5549
02:31:24,399 --> 02:31:27,910
morning. Remember the long we took from
here from one side to here. And now

5550
02:31:27,910 --> 02:31:27,920
here from one side to here. And now
 

5551
02:31:27,920 --> 02:31:30,389
here from one side to here. And now
we're taking a short from here to here.

5552
02:31:30,389 --> 02:31:30,399
we're taking a short from here to here.
 

5553
02:31:30,399 --> 02:31:31,830
we're taking a short from here to here.
So, we're getting the meat of the move,

5554
02:31:31,830 --> 02:31:31,840
So, we're getting the meat of the move,
 

5555
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:33,110
So, we're getting the meat of the move,
the meat of the move. But you never

5556
02:31:33,110 --> 02:31:33,120
the meat of the move. But you never
 

5557
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:34,389
the meat of the move. But you never
know, they might collapse the whole

5558
02:31:34,389 --> 02:31:34,399
know, they might collapse the whole
 

5559
02:31:34,399 --> 02:31:47,270
know, they might collapse the whole
thing. It's very possible.

5560
02:31:47,270 --> 02:31:47,280

 

5561
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:48,790

a market like this for a while. This

5744
02:36:16,870 --> 02:36:16,880
a market like this for a while. This
 

5745
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:18,870
a market like this for a while. This
wasn't too bad, but from this point on,

02:36:21,349 --> 02:36:21,359
it was just non-stop bid. It was
 

5749
02:36:21,359 --> 02:36:22,950
it was just non-stop bid. It was
non-stop bid. And we weren't feeling

5750
02:36:22,950 --> 02:36:22,960
non-stop bid. And we weren't feeling
 

5751
02:36:22,960 --> 02:36:24,950
non-stop bid. And we weren't feeling
like there was a passive buyer trying to

5752
02:36:24,950 --> 02:36:24,960
like there was a passive buyer trying to
 

5753
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:28,070

walk up. We were not filling him. It was

5754
02:36:28,070 --> 02:36:28,080
walk up. We were not filling him. It was
 

5755
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:30,230
walk up. We were not filling him. It was
aggressive

5756
02:36:30,230 --> 02:36:30,240
aggressive
 

5757
02:36:30,240 --> 02:36:34,309
aggressive
buying. Um, and we can see that

5758
02:36:34,309 --> 02:36:34,319
buying. Um, and we can see that
 

5759
02:36:34,319 --> 02:36:37,190
buying. Um, and we can see that

aggressive market participant. slamming
in. Once we broke this level here,

5770
02:36:50,070 --> 02:36:50,080
in. Once we broke this level here,
 

5771
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:51,750
in. Once we broke this level here,
right, then we got the breakdown and you

5772
02:36:51,750 --> 02:36:51,760
right, then we got the breakdown and you
 

5773
02:36:51,760 --> 02:36:53,510
right, then we got the breakdown and you
can see everyone who was aggressively

5774
02:36:53,510 --> 02:36:53,520
can see everyone who was aggressively
 

5775
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:56,230
can see everyone who was aggressively
bidding it is now caught and we're in

5776
02:36:56,230 --> 02:36:56,240
bidding it is now caught and we're in
 

5777
02:36:56,240 --> 02:36:57,910
bidding it is now caught and we're in
pain cave for them. So, this is why we

5778
02:36:57,910 --> 02:36:57,920
pain cave for them. So, this is why we
 

5779
02:36:57,920 --> 02:37:00,870
pain cave for them. So, this is why we
wanted to trade down again today because

5780
02:37:00,870 --> 02:37:00,880
wanted to trade down again today because
 

5781
02:37:00,880 --> 02:37:04,469
wanted to trade down again today because
once we get to an extreme,

5782
02:37:04,469 --> 02:37:04,479
once we get to an extreme,
 

5783
02:37:04,479 --> 02:37:06,070
once we get to an extreme,
then we can see stuff like this happen

5784
02:37:06,070 --> 02:37:06,080
then we can see stuff like this happen
 

5785
02:37:06,080 --> 02:37:08,469
then we can see stuff like this happen
because we go back to protrend squeeze

5786
02:37:08,469 --> 02:37:08,479
because we go back to protrend squeeze
 

5787
02:37:08,479 --> 02:37:10,309
because we go back to protrend squeeze
is over. We're underneath these pivots

5788
02:37:10,309 --> 02:37:10,319
is over. We're underneath these pivots
 

5789
02:37:10,319 --> 02:37:12,150
is over. We're underneath these pivots
now. VWOP's your next target here. This

day value area low. This can end up

5794
02:37:15,590 --> 02:37:15,600
day value area low. This can end up
 

5795
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:19,190
day value area low. This can end up
being

5796
02:37:19,190 --> 02:37:19,200

 

5797
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:23,830

I'm not jealous at all. I don't know

02:39:03,830 --> 02:39:03,840
I'm not jealous at all. I don't know
 

5863
02:39:03,840 --> 02:39:12,620
I'm not jealous at all. I don't know
what you're talking about. Not one bit.

5864
02:39:12,620 --> 02:39:12,630

 

5865

day value low, the next level for them

5870
02:39:17,270 --> 02:39:17,280
day value low, the next level for them
 

5871
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:19,429
day value low, the next level for them
to check is 180. So, I'd expect some

5872
02:39:19,429 --> 02:39:19,439
to check is 180. So, I'd expect some
 

5873
02:39:19,439 --> 02:39:21,030
to check is 180. So, I'd expect some
bids to come in around here at some

5874
02:39:21,030 --> 02:39:21,040
bids to come in around here at some
 

5875
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:22,550
bids to come in around here at some
point. If they don't come in, it's going

5876
02:39:22,550 --> 02:39:22,560
point. If they don't come in, it's going
 

5877
02:39:22,560 --> 02:39:24,790
point. If they don't come in, it's going
to be very, very, very dangerous for the

5878
02:39:24,790 --> 02:39:24,800
to be very, very, very dangerous for the
 

5879
02:39:24,800 --> 02:39:27,830
to be very, very, very dangerous for the
market. We are picking up big downside

5880
02:39:27,830 --> 02:39:27,840
market. We are picking up big downside
 

5881
02:39:27,840 --> 02:39:34,950
market. We are picking up big downside
momentum here right now.

5882
02:39:34,950 --> 02:39:34,960

 

5883
02:39:34,960 --> 02:39:36,550

But you would expect some bids to start

5884
02:39:36,550 --> 02:39:36,560
But you would expect some bids to start
 

5885
02:39:36,560 --> 02:39:37,990
But you would expect some bids to start
forming around here, which is starting

5886
02:39:37,990 --> 02:39:38,000
forming around here, which is starting
 

5887
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:39,990
forming around here, which is starting
to see some relief right now. So value

5888
02:39:39,990 --> 02:39:40,000
to see some relief right now. So value
 

5889
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:41,750
to see some relief right now. So value
area low on the day 300. That's your

5890
02:39:41,750 --> 02:39:41,760
area low on the day 300. That's your
 

5891
02:39:41,760 --> 02:39:45,349
area low on the day 300. That's your
overunder. If they reclaim that 300, uh

5892
02:39:45,349 --> 02:39:45,359
overunder. If they reclaim that 300, uh
 

5893
02:39:45,359 --> 02:39:49,030
overunder. If they reclaim that 300, uh
they can try and retest 312, 315 and

5894
02:39:49,030 --> 02:39:49,040
they can try and retest 312, 315 and
 

5895
02:39:49,040 --> 02:39:51,830
they can try and retest 312, 315 and
this nugget here. Right. So

5896
02:39:51,830 --> 02:39:51,840
this nugget here. Right. So
 

5897
02:39:51,840 --> 02:39:55,110
this nugget here. Right. So
from here to here can be a retest above

5898
02:39:55,110 --> 02:39:55,120
from here to here can be a retest above
 

5899
02:39:55,120 --> 02:39:58,150
from here to here can be a retest above
this squeeze back out. fill in some of

5900
02:39:58,150 --> 02:39:58,160
this squeeze back out. fill in some of
 

5901
02:39:58,160 --> 02:40:02,309
this squeeze back out. fill in some of
this possible otherwise just more

5902
02:40:02,309 --> 02:40:02,319
this possible otherwise just more
 

5903
02:40:02,319 --> 02:40:04,790
this possible otherwise just more
liquidity built to move lower this area

5904
02:40:04,790 --> 02:40:04,800
liquidity built to move lower this area
 

5905
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:14,309
liquidity built to move lower this area
here. This area here very very key.

5906
02:40:14,309 --> 02:40:14,319

 

5907
02:40:14,319 --> 02:40:15,990

Do I think we get back to market open?

5908
02:40:15,990 --> 02:40:16,000
Do I think we get back to market open?
 

5909
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,870
Do I think we get back to market open?
Uh well, we're not too far.

5910
02:40:18,870 --> 02:40:18,880
Uh well, we're not too far.
 

5911
02:40:18,880 --> 02:40:21,590
Uh well, we're not too far.
It doesn't have to though. It doesn't

5912
02:40:21,590 --> 02:40:21,600
It doesn't have to though. It doesn't
 

5913
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:23,349
It doesn't have to though. It doesn't
have to. I mean, look, we we have

5914
02:40:23,349 --> 02:40:23,359
have to. I mean, look, we we have
 

5915
02:40:23,359 --> 02:40:24,950
have to. I mean, look, we we have
previous day value area low and current

5916
02:40:24,950 --> 02:40:24,960
previous day value area low and current
 

5917
02:40:24,960 --> 02:40:27,590
previous day value area low and current
value area low as like the first points

5918
02:40:27,590 --> 02:40:27,600
value area low as like the first points
 

5919
02:40:27,600 --> 02:40:30,230
value area low as like the first points
of call. Let's call it. So, you go. So,

5920
02:40:30,230 --> 02:40:30,240
of call. Let's call it. So, you go. So,
 

5921
02:40:30,240 --> 02:40:31,750
of call. Let's call it. So, you go. So,
back to the 300 like we just talked

5922
02:40:31,750 --> 02:40:31,760
back to the 300 like we just talked
 

5923
02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:33,270
back to the 300 like we just talked
about. This is current value area low on

5924
02:40:33,270 --> 02:40:33,280
about. This is current value area low on
 

5925
02:40:33,280 --> 02:40:38,309
about. This is current value area low on
the day. Now, for me,

5926
02:40:38,309 --> 02:40:38,319

 

5927
02:40:38,319 --> 02:40:40,710

relief back here and now back to this

5928
02:40:40,710 --> 02:40:40,720
relief back here and now back to this
 

5929
02:40:40,720 --> 02:40:43,590
relief back here and now back to this
gray box probably. So, 300 and then gray

5930
02:40:43,590 --> 02:40:43,600
gray box probably. So, 300 and then gray
 

5931
02:40:43,600 --> 02:40:45,510
gray box probably. So, 300 and then gray
box. And then the question is very much

5932
02:40:45,510 --> 02:40:45,520
box. And then the question is very much
 

5933
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:48,309
box. And then the question is very much
like earlier, right? Do sellers resell

5934
02:40:48,309 --> 02:40:48,319
like earlier, right? Do sellers resell
 

5935
02:40:48,319 --> 02:40:49,830
like earlier, right? Do sellers resell
this? Are they going to try and complete

5936
02:40:49,830 --> 02:40:49,840
this? Are they going to try and complete
 

5937
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:52,630
this? Are they going to try and complete
this move here and lower or do bids

5938
02:40:52,630 --> 02:40:52,640
this move here and lower or do bids
 

5939
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:54,469
this move here and lower or do bids
start to take over again? All right,

5940
02:40:54,469 --> 02:40:54,479
start to take over again? All right,
 

5941
02:40:54,479 --> 02:40:55,750
start to take over again? All right,
that's literally what you're looking for

5942
02:40:55,750 --> 02:40:55,760
that's literally what you're looking for
 

5943
02:40:55,760 --> 02:40:57,750
that's literally what you're looking for
when you're looking at these areas. If

5944
02:40:57,750 --> 02:40:57,760
when you're looking at these areas. If
 

5945
02:40:57,760 --> 02:40:59,349
when you're looking at these areas. If
we come flying in here and you see

5946
02:40:59,349 --> 02:40:59,359
we come flying in here and you see
 

5947
02:40:59,359 --> 02:41:00,950
we come flying in here and you see
aggressive buyers in here and we don't

5948
02:41:00,950 --> 02:41:00,960
aggressive buyers in here and we don't
 

5949
02:41:00,960 --> 02:41:02,150
aggressive buyers in here and we don't
move higher, then you know they're going

5950
02:41:02,150 --> 02:41:02,160
move higher, then you know they're going
 

5951
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:04,230
move higher, then you know they're going
to try and resell it. If we come in here

5952
02:41:04,230 --> 02:41:04,240
to try and resell it. If we come in here
 

5953
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:06,389
to try and resell it. If we come in here
and sellers keep trying but we're not

5954
02:41:06,389 --> 02:41:06,399
and sellers keep trying but we're not
 

5955
02:41:06,399 --> 02:41:08,150
and sellers keep trying but we're not
moving lower, then this becomes

5956
02:41:08,150 --> 02:41:08,160
moving lower, then this becomes
 

5957
02:41:08,160 --> 02:41:09,910
moving lower, then this becomes
available. That's why there's always two

5958
02:41:09,910 --> 02:41:09,920
available. That's why there's always two
 

5959
02:41:09,920 --> 02:41:16,550
available. That's why there's always two
trades at key levels.

5960
02:41:16,550 --> 02:41:16,560

 

5961
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:19,429

the gray area. Do you chart that or does

5962
02:41:19,429 --> 02:41:19,439
the gray area. Do you chart that or does
 

5963
02:41:19,439 --> 02:41:20,950
the gray area. Do you chart that or does
that indicate? No, these are me draw.

6023
02:42:34,640 --> 02:42:36,389

Okay, so they're trying to lift 300 to

6024
02:42:36,389 --> 02:42:36,399
Okay, so they're trying to lift 300 to

Okay, so they're trying to lift 300 to
come and test here. Right. This is what

6026
02:42:37,910 --> 02:42:37,920
come and test here. Right. This is what
 

6027
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:40,309
come and test here. Right. This is what
they're trying to do

6028
02:42:40,309 --> 02:42:40,319
they're trying to do
 

6029
02:42:40,319 --> 02:42:42,389
they're trying to do
at the moment. We're seeing buyers get a

little bit caught over 300 the last two

6032
02:42:44,389 --> 02:42:44,399
little bit caught over 300 the last two
 

6033
02:42:44,399 --> 02:42:45,750
little bit caught over 300 the last two
candles. So, they've tried a couple

6034
02:42:45,750 --> 02:42:45,760
candles. So, they've tried a couple
 

6035
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:47,670
candles. So, they've tried a couple
times to get back inside current value

6036
02:42:47,670 --> 02:42:47,680
times to get back inside current value

become important. If we start losing
these pivots,

6224
02:47:44,790 --> 02:47:44,800
these pivots,
 

6225
02:47:44,800 --> 02:47:46,309
these pivots,
especially this is current week's

6226
02:47:46,309 --> 02:47:46,319
especially this is current week's
 

6227
02:47:46,319 --> 02:47:49,269
especially this is current week's
developing profile. If we lose

6228
02:47:49,269 --> 02:47:49,279
developing profile. If we lose
 

6229
02:47:49,279 --> 02:47:52,389
developing profile. If we lose
what's this sort of 220s, 200s and 220s.

6230
02:47:52,389 --> 02:47:52,399
what's this sort of 220s, 200s and 220s.
 

6231
02:47:52,399 --> 02:47:54,790
what's this sort of 220s, 200s and 220s.
If we lose that, there's a very good

6232
02:47:54,790 --> 02:47:54,800
If we lose that, there's a very good
 

6233
02:47:54,800 --> 02:47:56,950
If we lose that, there's a very good
chance we fade all the way back in. But

6234
02:47:56,950 --> 02:47:56,960
chance we fade all the way back in. But
 

6235
02:47:56,960 --> 02:47:59,030
chance we fade all the way back in. But
if we hold that, you can see some relief

6236
02:47:59,030 --> 02:47:59,040
if we hold that, you can see some relief
 

6237
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:00,469
if we hold that, you can see some relief
back up for a little bit. It would make

6238
02:48:00,469 --> 02:48:00,479
back up for a little bit. It would make
 

6239
02:48:00,479 --> 02:48:02,710
back up for a little bit. It would make
sense. So, coming into some big key

6240
02:48:02,710 --> 02:48:02,720
sense. So, coming into some big key
 

6241
02:48:02,720 --> 02:48:05,510
sense. So, coming into some big key
levels. Here comes target. We just

6242
02:48:05,510 --> 02:48:05,520
levels. Here comes target. We just
 

6243
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:10,389
levels. Here comes target. We just
missed it by what, a tick.

6244
02:48:10,389 --> 02:48:10,399

 

6245
02:48:10,399 --> 02:48:12,309

really to the tick. There you go.

6246
02:48:12,309 --> 02:48:12,319
really to the tick. There you go.
 

6247
02:48:12,319 --> 02:48:13,750
really to the tick. There you go.
Filled. So you guys should have been

6248
02:48:13,750 --> 02:48:13,760
Filled. So you guys should have been
 

6249
02:48:13,760 --> 02:48:15,830
Filled. So you guys should have been
filled there. And anything beyond this

6250
02:48:15,830 --> 02:48:15,840
filled there. And anything beyond this
 

6251
02:48:15,840 --> 02:48:19,349
filled there. And anything beyond this
is now a bonus. What a trade. I am

6252
02:48:19,349 --> 02:48:19,359
is now a bonus. What a trade. I am
 

6253
02:48:19,359 --> 02:48:21,510
is now a bonus. What a trade. I am
absolutely devastated. Look. Look how

6254
02:48:21,510 --> 02:48:21,520
absolutely devastated. Look. Look how
 

6255
02:48:21,520 --> 02:48:28,070
absolutely devastated. Look. Look how
tight a trade that would have been.

6256
02:48:28,070 --> 02:48:28,080

 

6257
02:48:28,080 --> 02:48:29,750

Left 200 points on the table because it

6258
02:48:29,750 --> 02:48:29,760
Left 200 points on the table because it
 

6259
02:48:29,760 --> 02:48:32,150
Left 200 points on the table because it
stopped me out. That's painful. That's

6260
02:48:32,150 --> 02:48:32,160
stopped me out. That's painful. That's
 

6261
02:48:32,160 --> 02:48:34,630
stopped me out. That's painful. That's
[\h__\h] painful. I don't care what

6262
02:48:34,630 --> 02:48:34,640
[\h__\h] painful. I don't care what
 

6263
02:48:34,640 --> 02:48:36,630
[\h__\h] painful. I don't care what
trader you are. That that that stings.

6264
02:48:36,630 --> 02:48:36,640
trader you are. That that that stings.
 

6265
02:48:36,640 --> 02:48:38,309
trader you are. That that that stings.
That hurts the ego. That definitely

6266
02:48:38,309 --> 02:48:38,319
That hurts the ego. That definitely
 

6267
02:48:38,319 --> 02:48:42,870
That hurts the ego. That definitely
hurts the ego.

6268
02:48:42,870 --> 02:48:42,880

 

6269
02:48:42,880 --> 02:48:48,389

That hurts the ego.

6270
02:48:48,389 --> 02:48:48,399

 

6271
02:48:48,399 --> 02:48:50,991

Oh my days.

6272
02:48:50,991 --> 02:48:51,001
Oh my days.
 

6273
02:48:51,001 --> 02:48:52,870
Oh my days.
[laughter]

6274
02:48:52,870 --> 02:48:52,880
[laughter]
 

6275
02:48:52,880 --> 02:48:54,710
[laughter]
Why didn't I get back in? Um, I was

6276
02:48:54,710 --> 02:48:54,720
Why didn't I get back in? Um, I was
 

6277
02:48:54,720 --> 02:48:57,830
Why didn't I get back in? Um, I was
making some breakfast.

6278
02:48:57,830 --> 02:48:57,840
making some breakfast.
 

6279
02:48:57,840 --> 02:48:59,670
making some breakfast.
I was making breakfast. So, it had

6280
02:48:59,670 --> 02:48:59,680
I was making breakfast. So, it had
 

6281
02:48:59,680 --> 02:49:01,429
I was making breakfast. So, it had
faded. I came back and I saw it here and

6282
02:49:01,429 --> 02:49:01,439
faded. I came back and I saw it here and
 

6283
02:49:01,439 --> 02:49:02,550
faded. I came back and I saw it here and
then I came back and we'd already

6284
02:49:02,550 --> 02:49:02,560
then I came back and we'd already
 

6285
02:49:02,560 --> 02:49:04,309
then I came back and we'd already
started puking. And you know, I don't

6286
02:49:04,309 --> 02:49:04,319
started puking. And you know, I don't
 

6287
02:49:04,319 --> 02:49:05,990
started puking. And you know, I don't
want to chase down here. I've lost my

6288
02:49:05,990 --> 02:49:06,000
want to chase down here. I've lost my
 

6289
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,710
want to chase down here. I've lost my
edge at that point.

6290
02:49:08,710 --> 02:49:08,720
edge at that point.
 

6291
02:49:08,720 --> 02:49:11,030
edge at that point.
I also had it's I had three goes at it.

6292
02:49:11,030 --> 02:49:11,040
I also had it's I had three goes at it.
 

6293
02:49:11,040 --> 02:49:13,030
I also had it's I had three goes at it.
It wasn't like I had I tried one and

6294
02:49:13,030 --> 02:49:13,040
It wasn't like I had I tried one and
 

6295
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:15,030
It wasn't like I had I tried one and
done. Like I had a couple a good few

6296
02:49:15,030 --> 02:49:15,040
done. Like I had a couple a good few
 

6297
02:49:15,040 --> 02:49:16,870
done. Like I had a couple a good few
attempts at it. Right. They're trying to

6298
02:49:16,870 --> 02:49:16,880
attempts at it. Right. They're trying to
 

6299
02:49:16,880 --> 02:49:19,910
attempts at it. Right. They're trying to
bid down to 220 here

6300
02:49:19,910 --> 02:49:19,920
bid down to 220 here
 

6301
02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:21,429
bid down to 220 here
which will I think was that level we

6302
02:49:21,429 --> 02:49:21,439
which will I think was that level we
 

6303
02:49:21,439 --> 02:49:23,590
which will I think was that level we
talked about. Right where they probably

6304
02:49:23,590 --> 02:49:23,600
talked about. Right where they probably
 

6305
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:28,070
talked about. Right where they probably
need to hold.

6306
02:49:28,070 --> 02:49:28,080

 

6307
02:49:28,080 --> 02:49:30,950

It's the start of a node. 220 to sort of

6308
02:49:30,950 --> 02:49:30,960
It's the start of a node. 220 to sort of
 

6309
02:49:30,960 --> 02:49:33,190
It's the start of a node. 220 to sort of
180 190 is probably where they will want

6310
02:49:33,190 --> 02:49:33,200
180 190 is probably where they will want
 

6311
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:34,870
180 190 is probably where they will want
to hold. If they don't do that, then

6312
02:49:34,870 --> 02:49:34,880
to hold. If they don't do that, then
 

6313
02:49:34,880 --> 02:49:49,269
to hold. If they don't do that, then
it's the market's in so much trouble.

6314
02:49:49,269 --> 02:49:49,279

 

6315
02:49:49,279 --> 02:49:51,429

Yeah, they they got me. Trader on tilt.

6316
02:49:51,429 --> 02:49:51,439
Yeah, they they got me. Trader on tilt.
 

6317
02:49:51,439 --> 02:49:52,710
Yeah, they they got me. Trader on tilt.
They got me. They knocked me out three

6318
02:49:52,710 --> 02:49:52,720
They got me. They knocked me out three
 

6319
02:49:52,720 --> 02:49:54,710
They got me. They knocked me out three
times. I mean, I made I made money on it

6320
02:49:54,710 --> 02:49:54,720
times. I mean, I made I made money on it
 

6321
02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:58,309
times. I mean, I made I made money on it
all three times, but

6322
02:49:58,309 --> 02:49:58,319
all three times, but
 

6323
02:49:58,319 --> 02:50:03,269
all three times, but
I could have risked the 80 because

6324
02:50:03,269 --> 02:50:03,279
I could have risked the 80 because
 

6325
02:50:03,279 --> 02:50:05,349
I could have risked the 80 because
the delta

6326
02:50:05,349 --> 02:50:05,359
the delta
 

6327
02:50:05,359 --> 02:50:08,550
the delta
was at 80, right? I risked here to the

6328
02:50:08,550 --> 02:50:08,560
was at 80, right? I risked here to the
 

6329
02:50:08,560 --> 02:50:10,389
was at 80, right? I risked here to the
edge of this node and I got wicked out

6330
02:50:10,389 --> 02:50:10,399
edge of this node and I got wicked out
 

6331
02:50:10,399 --> 02:50:13,670
edge of this node and I got wicked out
pretty much to the tick.

6332
02:50:13,670 --> 02:50:13,680
pretty much to the tick.
 

6333
02:50:13,680 --> 02:50:15,590
pretty much to the tick.
Maybe maybe it's my fault. Maybe I

6334
02:50:15,590 --> 02:50:15,600
Maybe maybe it's my fault. Maybe I
 

6335
02:50:15,600 --> 02:50:18,389
Maybe maybe it's my fault. Maybe I
should have lit like been willing to

6336
02:50:18,389 --> 02:50:18,399
should have lit like been willing to
 

6337
02:50:18,399 --> 02:50:21,030
should have lit like been willing to
risk 80. My problem was if I risked 80

6338
02:50:21,030 --> 02:50:21,040
risk 80. My problem was if I risked 80
 

6339
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:23,190
risk 80. My problem was if I risked 80
and I got caught in a squeeze, then the

6340
02:50:23,190 --> 02:50:23,200
and I got caught in a squeeze, then the
 

6341
02:50:23,200 --> 02:50:25,429
and I got caught in a squeeze, then the
fill would have been awful.

6342
02:50:25,429 --> 02:50:25,439
fill would have been awful.
 

6343
02:50:25,439 --> 02:50:27,590
fill would have been awful.
Um because we would have been back above

6344
02:50:27,590 --> 02:50:27,600
Um because we would have been back above
 

6345
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:29,750
Um because we would have been back above
by side um delta and I would have been

6346
02:50:29,750 --> 02:50:29,760
by side um delta and I would have been
 

6347
02:50:29,760 --> 02:50:40,630
by side um delta and I would have been
in big big trouble.

6348
02:50:40,630 --> 02:50:40,640

 

6349
02:50:40,640 --> 02:50:46,928

So we can see this contested level

6350
02:50:46,928 --> 02:50:46,938

 

6351
02:50:46,938 --> 02:50:47,670

[snorts]

6352
02:50:47,670 --> 02:50:47,680
[snorts]
 

6353
02:50:47,680 --> 02:50:49,830
[snorts]
220 is coming up that we just talked

6354
02:50:49,830 --> 02:50:49,840
220 is coming up that we just talked
 

6355
02:50:49,840 --> 02:50:52,469
220 is coming up that we just talked
about. Market is just sliding giving

6356
02:50:52,469 --> 02:50:52,479
about. Market is just sliding giving
 

6357
02:50:52,479 --> 02:50:58,950
about. Market is just sliding giving
everything back. Giving everything back.

6358
02:50:58,950 --> 02:50:58,960

 

6359
02:50:58,960 --> 02:51:01,990

So 25s here

6360
02:51:01,990 --> 02:51:02,000
So 25s here
 

6361
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,469
So 25s here
gray box. Uh this is New York open. This

6362
02:51:04,469 --> 02:51:04,479
gray box. Uh this is New York open. This
 

6363
02:51:04,479 --> 02:51:07,349
gray box. Uh this is New York open. This
is edge of current value. So sliding

6364
02:51:07,349 --> 02:51:07,359
is edge of current value. So sliding
 

6365
02:51:07,359 --> 02:51:10,550
is edge of current value. So sliding
away from this now.

6366
02:51:10,550 --> 02:51:10,560
away from this now.
 

6367
02:51:10,560 --> 02:51:13,910
away from this now.
buyers in big big trouble so far.

6368
02:51:13,910 --> 02:51:13,920
buyers in big big trouble so far.
 

6369
02:51:13,920 --> 02:51:16,309
buyers in big big trouble so far.
So that relentless bid all day has

6370
02:51:16,309 --> 02:51:16,319
So that relentless bid all day has
 

6371
02:51:16,319 --> 02:51:18,630
So that relentless bid all day has
turned into a relentless sell, isn't it?

6372
02:51:18,630 --> 02:51:18,640
turned into a relentless sell, isn't it?
 

6373
02:51:18,640 --> 02:51:20,070
turned into a relentless sell, isn't it?
There hasn't been much relief. I will

6374
02:51:20,070 --> 02:51:20,080
There hasn't been much relief. I will
 

6375
02:51:20,080 --> 02:51:21,190
There hasn't been much relief. I will
say that you got to be careful. This

6376
02:51:21,190 --> 02:51:21,200
say that you got to be careful. This
 

6377
02:51:21,200 --> 02:51:22,389
say that you got to be careful. This
feels very much like yesterday. There

6378
02:51:22,389 --> 02:51:22,399
feels very much like yesterday. There
 

6379
02:51:22,399 --> 02:51:24,230
feels very much like yesterday. There
has not been much relief. So just be

6380
02:51:24,230 --> 02:51:24,240
has not been much relief. So just be
 

6381
02:51:24,240 --> 02:51:25,510
has not been much relief. So just be
careful when we have like these big

6382
02:51:25,510 --> 02:51:25,520
careful when we have like these big
 

6383
02:51:25,520 --> 02:51:27,830
careful when we have like these big
bearish days. You know, too many bears

6384
02:51:27,830 --> 02:51:27,840
bearish days. You know, too many bears
 

6385
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:29,429
bearish days. You know, too many bears
get stuck at the lows into key levels.

6386
02:51:29,429 --> 02:51:29,439
get stuck at the lows into key levels.
 

6387
02:51:29,439 --> 02:51:31,590
get stuck at the lows into key levels.
You can see like really big aggressive

6388
02:51:31,590 --> 02:51:31,600
You can see like really big aggressive
 

6389
02:51:31,600 --> 02:51:33,910
You can see like really big aggressive
reliefs where they get caught. So just

6390
02:51:33,910 --> 02:51:33,920
reliefs where they get caught. So just
 

6391
02:51:33,920 --> 02:51:35,349
reliefs where they get caught. So just
manage your stop. For those of you who

6392
02:51:35,349 --> 02:51:35,359
manage your stop. For those of you who
 

6393
02:51:35,359 --> 02:51:51,910
manage your stop. For those of you who
are still holding

6394
02:51:51,910 --> 02:51:51,920

 

6395
02:51:51,920 --> 02:51:54,230

level 452s

6396
02:51:54,230 --> 02:51:54,240
level 452s
 

6397
02:51:54,240 --> 02:51:59,269
level 452s
seen some bids trying to come in here.

6398
02:51:59,269 --> 02:51:59,279

 

6399
02:51:59,279 --> 02:52:05,510

Haven't even retested value yet.

6400
02:52:05,510 --> 02:52:05,520

 

6401
02:52:05,520 --> 02:52:07,910

So 45s and then I'd say sort of 80s are

6402
02:52:07,910 --> 02:52:07,920
So 45s and then I'd say sort of 80s are
 

6403
02:52:07,920 --> 02:52:11,910
So 45s and then I'd say sort of 80s are
important. 45s and then 80s. So far sell

6404
02:52:11,910 --> 02:52:11,920
important. 45s and then 80s. So far sell
 

6405
02:52:11,920 --> 02:52:14,950
important. 45s and then 80s. So far sell
is in absolute control. Things melting.

6406
02:52:14,950 --> 02:52:14,960
is in absolute control. Things melting.
 

6407
02:52:14,960 --> 02:52:16,389
is in absolute control. Things melting.
There we go. There's the squeeze that we

6408
02:52:16,389 --> 02:52:16,399
There we go. There's the squeeze that we
 

6409
02:52:16,399 --> 02:52:17,670
There we go. There's the squeeze that we
just talked about. There's the test of

6410
02:52:17,670 --> 02:52:17,680
just talked about. There's the test of
 

6411
02:52:17,680 --> 02:52:19,830
just talked about. There's the test of
45s that we just talked about. If it

6412
02:52:19,830 --> 02:52:19,840
45s that we just talked about. If it
 

6413
02:52:19,840 --> 02:52:21,910
45s that we just talked about. If it
goes through there 80s. So 45s and 80s.

6414
02:52:21,910 --> 02:52:21,920
goes through there 80s. So 45s and 80s.
 

6415
02:52:21,920 --> 02:52:23,750
goes through there 80s. So 45s and 80s.
We literally just said it. So be careful

6416
02:52:23,750 --> 02:52:23,760
We literally just said it. So be careful
 

6417
02:52:23,760 --> 02:52:25,269
We literally just said it. So be careful
when too many shorts get caught at the

6418
02:52:25,269 --> 02:52:25,279
when too many shorts get caught at the
 

6419
02:52:25,279 --> 02:52:26,630
when too many shorts get caught at the
lows. This is what happens. You just get

6420
02:52:26,630 --> 02:52:26,640
lows. This is what happens. You just get
 

6421
02:52:26,640 --> 02:52:29,269
lows. This is what happens. You just get
a nasty wick out to test a key level.

6422
02:52:29,269 --> 02:52:29,279
a nasty wick out to test a key level.
 

6423
02:52:29,279 --> 02:52:30,950
a nasty wick out to test a key level.
Sellers are still there so far. But if

6424
02:52:30,950 --> 02:52:30,960
Sellers are still there so far. But if
 

6425
02:52:30,960 --> 02:52:33,269
Sellers are still there so far. But if
we get through 45s, we will go 80s. So

6426
02:52:33,269 --> 02:52:33,279
we get through 45s, we will go 80s. So
 

6427
02:52:33,279 --> 02:52:36,309
we get through 45s, we will go 80s. So
if they start to do one of these,

6428
02:52:36,309 --> 02:52:36,319
if they start to do one of these,
 

6429
02:52:36,319 --> 02:52:38,389
if they start to do one of these,
they are due some relief into the new

6430
02:52:38,389 --> 02:52:38,399
they are due some relief into the new
 

6431
02:52:38,399 --> 02:52:40,710
they are due some relief into the new
hour. It's very possible they do that,

6432
02:52:40,710 --> 02:52:40,720
hour. It's very possible they do that,
 

6433
02:52:40,720 --> 02:52:42,309
hour. It's very possible they do that,
right? And then maybe they resell it or

6434
02:52:42,309 --> 02:52:42,319
right? And then maybe they resell it or
 

6435
02:52:42,319 --> 02:52:43,750
right? And then maybe they resell it or
they resell it here. We don't know. But

6436
02:52:43,750 --> 02:52:43,760
they resell it here. We don't know. But
 

6437
02:52:43,760 --> 02:52:44,950
they resell it here. We don't know. But
I would just manage your position.

6438
02:52:44,950 --> 02:52:44,960
I would just manage your position.
 

6439
02:52:44,960 --> 02:52:46,950
I would just manage your position.
That's all I'm saying, right? Hopefully

6440
02:52:46,950 --> 02:52:46,960
That's all I'm saying, right? Hopefully
 

6441
02:52:46,960 --> 02:52:48,150
That's all I'm saying, right? Hopefully
that made sense to you. I think I said

6442
02:52:48,150 --> 02:52:48,160
that made sense to you. I think I said

it just in time for you. Gave you the
exact levels again.

6446
02:52:53,030 --> 02:52:53,040
exact levels again.
 

6447
02:52:53,040 --> 02:52:55,349
exact levels again.
Pretty accurate.

6448
02:52:55,349 --> 02:52:55,359
Pretty accurate.
 

6449
02:52:55,359 --> 02:52:59,349
Pretty accurate.

6457
02:53:04,479 --> 02:53:06,550
short in this for those 200 plus points,
all right, if we start reclaiming value,

6458
02:53:06,550 --> 02:53:06,560
all right, if we start reclaiming value,
 

6459

That's a big tilt factor. Having that

6560
02:55:58,070 --> 02:55:58,080
That's a big tilt factor. Having that
 

6561
02:55:58,080 --> 02:56:00,630
That's a big tilt factor. Having that
happen two days in a row increases that

6562
02:56:00,630 --> 02:56:00,640
happen two days in a row increases that
 

6563
02:56:00,640 --> 02:56:02,230
happen two days in a row increases that
tilt factor. So I actually have to be

6564
02:56:02,230 --> 02:56:02,240
tilt factor. So I actually have to be
 

6565
02:56:02,240 --> 02:56:03,990
tilt factor. So I actually have to be
very careful now coming into tomorrow

6566
02:56:03,990 --> 02:56:04,000
very careful now coming into tomorrow
 

6567
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:07,510
very careful now coming into tomorrow
based on my own stats. I need to be very

6568
02:56:07,510 --> 02:56:07,520
based on my own stats. I need to be very
 

6569
02:56:07,520 --> 02:56:09,510
based on my own stats. I need to be very
cautious with my size and positioning

6570
02:56:09,510 --> 02:56:09,520
cautious with my size and positioning
 

6571
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:11,190
cautious with my size and positioning
tomorrow because it's very possible I

6572
02:56:11,190 --> 02:56:11,200
tomorrow because it's very possible I
 

6573
02:56:11,200 --> 02:56:13,190
tomorrow because it's very possible I
get emotional tomorrow. That's just

6574
02:56:13,190 --> 02:56:13,200
get emotional tomorrow. That's just
 

6575
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:18,710
get emotional tomorrow. That's just
based on me knowing myself.

6576
02:56:18,710 --> 02:56:18,720

 

6577
02:56:18,720 --> 02:56:20,389

02:56:29,920 --> 02:56:37,910
well, which also impacts my ability to
think clearly sometimes.

6588

6691
02:59:02,800 --> 02:59:05,910
low made this high. Once we break this
low, that's when we have the change in

6692
02:59:05,910 --> 02:59:05,920
low, that's when we have the change in
 

6693
02:59:05,920 --> 02:59:07,910
low, that's when we have the change in
character. Okay. The problem is from

6694
02:59:07,910 --> 02:59:07,920
character. Okay. The problem is from
 

6695
02:59:07,920 --> 02:59:09,269
character. Okay. The problem is from
that point, you you're just going to

6696
02:59:09,269 --> 02:59:09,279
that point, you you're just going to
 

6697
02:59:09,279 --> 02:59:11,990
that point, you you're just going to
look at a flush. Why? Why was this so

6698
02:59:11,990 --> 02:59:12,000
look at a flush. Why? Why was this so
 

6699
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:14,550
look at a flush. Why? Why was this so
aggressive? Because

6700
02:59:14,550 --> 02:59:14,560
aggressive? Because
 

6701
02:59:14,560 --> 02:59:17,030
aggressive? Because
we'd been in here since what was my

6702
02:59:17,030 --> 02:59:17,040
we'd been in here since what was my
 

6703
02:59:17,040 --> 02:59:19,990
we'd been in here since what was my
level? 35s was the first level was it?

6704
02:59:19,990 --> 02:59:20,000
level? 35s was the first level was it?
 

6705
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,309
level? 35s was the first level was it?
35s here. We've been building liquidity

6706
02:59:22,309 --> 02:59:22,319
35s here. We've been building liquidity
 

6707
02:59:22,319 --> 02:59:25,349
35s here. We've been building liquidity
or this edge here from 10:42.

6708
02:59:25,349 --> 02:59:25,359
or this edge here from 10:42.
 

6709
02:59:25,359 --> 02:59:27,670
or this edge here from 10:42.
We're basically there an hour. Okay. So

6710
02:59:27,670 --> 02:59:27,680
We're basically there an hour. Okay. So
 

6711
02:59:27,680 --> 02:59:30,710
We're basically there an hour. Okay. So
for an hour we built liquidity here. We

6712
02:59:30,710 --> 02:59:30,720
for an hour we built liquidity here. We
 

6713
02:59:30,720 --> 02:59:34,550
for an hour we built liquidity here. We
can see it here. When we have this, it's

6714
02:59:34,550 --> 02:59:34,560
can see it here. When we have this, it's
 

6715
02:59:34,560 --> 02:59:36,630
can see it here. When we have this, it's
very possible and very common that we're

6716
02:59:36,630 --> 02:59:36,640
very possible and very common that we're
 

6717
02:59:36,640 --> 02:59:38,550
very possible and very common that we're
not going to do one of these, right?

6718
02:59:38,550 --> 02:59:38,560
not going to do one of these, right?
 

6719
02:59:38,560 --> 02:59:42,070
not going to do one of these, right?
Because once everyone's stops are here,

6720
02:59:42,070 --> 02:59:42,080
Because once everyone's stops are here,
 

6721
02:59:42,080 --> 02:59:43,590
Because once everyone's stops are here,
right? If you think about if you were

6722
02:59:43,590 --> 02:59:43,600
right? If you think about if you were
 

6723
02:59:43,600 --> 02:59:45,269
right? If you think about if you were
one of the buyers, think about this

6724
02:59:45,269 --> 02:59:45,279
one of the buyers, think about this
 

6725
02:59:45,279 --> 02:59:47,670
one of the buyers, think about this
aggressive bid all morning. Buying,

6726
02:59:47,670 --> 02:59:47,680
aggressive bid all morning. Buying,
 

6727
02:59:47,680 --> 02:59:49,670
aggressive bid all morning. Buying,
buying, buying, buying, buying, buying,

6728
02:59:49,670 --> 02:59:49,680
buying, buying, buying, buying, buying,
 

6729
02:59:49,680 --> 02:59:51,429
buying, buying, buying, buying, buying,
buying, buying, buying, buying, buying,

6730
02:59:51,429 --> 02:59:51,439
buying, buying, buying, buying, buying,
 

6731
02:59:51,439 --> 02:59:53,990
buying, buying, buying, buying, buying,
buying, buying, buying,

6732
02:59:53,990 --> 02:59:54,000
buying, buying, buying,
 

6733
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:57,190
buying, buying, buying,
boxed in, point of control. If

6734
02:59:57,190 --> 02:59:57,200
boxed in, point of control. If
 

6735
02:59:57,200 --> 02:59:58,950
boxed in, point of control. If
everyone's got their stop here from the

6736
02:59:58,950 --> 02:59:58,960
everyone's got their stop here from the
 

6737
02:59:58,960 --> 03:00:01,269
everyone's got their stop here from the
last hour, what's going to happen when

6738
03:00:01,269 --> 03:00:01,279
last hour, what's going to happen when
 

6739
03:00:01,279 --> 03:00:03,910
last hour, what's going to happen when
they all stop out? They all become

6740
03:00:03,910 --> 03:00:03,920
they all stop out? They all become
 

6741
03:00:03,920 --> 03:00:05,590
they all stop out? They all become
sellers, right? And not just sellers,

6742
03:00:05,590 --> 03:00:05,600
sellers, right? And not just sellers,
 

6743
03:00:05,600 --> 03:00:08,070
sellers, right? And not just sellers,
aggressive sellers, market sellers. So

6744
03:00:08,070 --> 03:00:08,080
aggressive sellers, market sellers. So
 

6745
03:00:08,080 --> 03:00:18,790
aggressive sellers, market sellers. So
we tank off that. So if we look here

6746
03:00:18,790 --> 03:00:18,800

 

6747
03:00:18,800 --> 03:00:20,550

and this is the [\h__\h] that pulled me

6748
03:00:20,550 --> 03:00:20,560
and this is the [\h__\h] that pulled me
 

6749
03:00:20,560 --> 03:00:22,710
and this is the [\h__\h] that pulled me
out, you absolute

6750
03:00:22,710 --> 03:00:22,720
out, you absolute
 

6751
03:00:22,720 --> 03:00:26,790
out, you absolute
bastard. Right. [laughter]

6752
03:00:26,790 --> 03:00:26,800

 

6753
03:00:26,800 --> 03:00:29,670

Okay. So 35s

6754
03:00:29,670 --> 03:00:29,680
Okay. So 35s
 

6755
03:00:29,680 --> 03:00:32,070
Okay. So 35s
was

6756
03:00:32,070 --> 03:00:32,080
was
 

6757
03:00:32,080 --> 03:00:33,830
was
here.

6758
03:00:33,830 --> 03:00:33,840
here.
 

6759
03:00:33,840 --> 03:00:35,429
here.
Why was this an important level to me?

6760
03:00:35,429 --> 03:00:35,439
Why was this an important level to me?
 

6761
03:00:35,439 --> 03:00:38,870
Why was this an important level to me?
because I knew we had

6762
03:00:38,870 --> 03:00:38,880
because I knew we had
 

6763
03:00:38,880 --> 03:00:40,790
because I knew we had
a very aggressive seller here who got

6764
03:00:40,790 --> 03:00:40,800
a very aggressive seller here who got
 

6765
03:00:40,800 --> 03:00:42,469
a very aggressive seller here who got
absorbed. All right, so here there was

6766
03:00:42,469 --> 03:00:42,479
absorbed. All right, so here there was
 

6767
03:00:42,479 --> 03:00:44,070
absorbed. All right, so here there was
like I can't remember how many lots it

6768
03:00:44,070 --> 03:00:44,080
like I can't remember how many lots it
 

6769
03:00:44,080 --> 03:00:47,030
like I can't remember how many lots it
was. It was like a 300

6770
03:00:47,030 --> 03:00:47,040
was. It was like a 300
 

6771
03:00:47,040 --> 03:00:49,830
was. It was like a 300
limit buyer and a 300 market order

6772
03:00:49,830 --> 03:00:49,840
limit buyer and a 300 market order
 

6773
03:00:49,840 --> 03:00:51,349
limit buyer and a 300 market order
seller. So I knew that this was a big

6774
03:00:51,349 --> 03:00:51,359
seller. So I knew that this was a big
 

6775
03:00:51,359 --> 03:00:54,710
seller. So I knew that this was a big
level. All right, these 35s into here

6776
03:00:54,710 --> 03:00:54,720
level. All right, these 35s into here
 

6777
03:00:54,720 --> 03:00:58,550
level. All right, these 35s into here
right here in this push we run the

6778
03:00:58,550 --> 03:00:58,560
right here in this push we run the
 

6779
03:00:58,560 --> 03:01:01,429
right here in this push we run the
stops.

6780
03:01:01,429 --> 03:01:01,439
stops.
 

6781
03:01:01,439 --> 03:01:03,670
stops.
This is all buy side aggressive buying.

6782
03:01:03,670 --> 03:01:03,680
This is all buy side aggressive buying.
 

6783
03:01:03,680 --> 03:01:05,349
This is all buy side aggressive buying.
Look at this gap. buy side, aggressive

6784
03:01:05,349 --> 03:01:05,359
Look at this gap. buy side, aggressive
 

6785
03:01:05,359 --> 03:01:07,429
Look at this gap. buy side, aggressive
buying. Do they sustain the bid? No,

6786
03:01:07,429 --> 03:01:07,439
buying. Do they sustain the bid? No,
 

6787
03:01:07,439 --> 03:01:09,429
buying. Do they sustain the bid? No,
they flop inside. Okay, so this is the

6788
03:01:09,429 --> 03:01:09,439
they flop inside. Okay, so this is the
 

6789
03:01:09,439 --> 03:01:10,870
they flop inside. Okay, so this is the
chance. Now, we're looking for

6790
03:01:10,870 --> 03:01:10,880
chance. Now, we're looking for
 

6791
03:01:10,880 --> 03:01:13,990
chance. Now, we're looking for
breakdowns underneath. Uh, and I start

6792
03:01:13,990 --> 03:01:14,000
breakdowns underneath. Uh, and I start
 

6793
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,710
breakdowns underneath. Uh, and I start
to add in to wherever that gray box

6794
03:01:16,710 --> 03:01:16,720
to add in to wherever that gray box
 

6795
03:01:16,720 --> 03:01:19,830
to add in to wherever that gray box
would have been. So, somewhere

6796
03:01:19,830 --> 03:01:19,840
would have been. So, somewhere
 

6797
03:01:19,840 --> 03:01:22,469
would have been. So, somewhere
around here, I think.

6798
03:01:22,469 --> 03:01:22,479
around here, I think.
 

6799
03:01:22,479 --> 03:01:24,790
around here, I think.
Right. So, I'm short here looking for

6800
03:01:24,790 --> 03:01:24,800
Right. So, I'm short here looking for
 

6801
03:01:24,800 --> 03:01:28,550
Right. So, I'm short here looking for
that breakdown. I get stopped out

6802
03:01:28,550 --> 03:01:28,560
that breakdown. I get stopped out
 

6803
03:01:28,560 --> 03:01:30,230
that breakdown. I get stopped out
when they fill that imbalance. That is

6804
03:01:30,230 --> 03:01:30,240
when they fill that imbalance. That is
 

6805
03:01:30,240 --> 03:01:31,990
when they fill that imbalance. That is
my fault. My stop should have gone above

6806
03:01:31,990 --> 03:01:32,000
my fault. My stop should have gone above
 

6807
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:33,910
my fault. My stop should have gone above
the 80s where I know we had a buy side

6808
03:01:33,910 --> 03:01:33,920
the 80s where I know we had a buy side
 

6809
03:01:33,920 --> 03:01:35,590
the 80s where I know we had a buy side
imbalance, right? My stop should have

6810
03:01:35,590 --> 03:01:35,600
imbalance, right? My stop should have
 

6811
03:01:35,600 --> 03:01:37,429
imbalance, right? My stop should have
gone above the 80s. I'll show you this

6812
03:01:37,429 --> 03:01:37,439
gone above the 80s. I'll show you this
 

6813
03:01:37,439 --> 03:01:41,269
gone above the 80s. I'll show you this
right here. If I move up

6814
03:01:41,269 --> 03:01:41,279
right here. If I move up
 

6815
03:01:41,279 --> 03:01:44,469
right here. If I move up
this right here, a big delta at 80. My

6816
03:01:44,469 --> 03:01:44,479
this right here, a big delta at 80. My
 

6817
03:01:44,479 --> 03:01:46,469
this right here, a big delta at 80. My
stop should have gone there. My stop

6818
03:01:46,469 --> 03:01:46,479
stop should have gone there. My stop
 

6819
03:01:46,479 --> 03:01:48,309
stop should have gone there. My stop
didn't go there. It went the other side

6820
03:01:48,309 --> 03:01:48,319
didn't go there. It went the other side
 

6821
03:01:48,319 --> 03:01:51,590
didn't go there. It went the other side
of this shelf. It went here at 77s.

6822
03:01:51,590 --> 03:01:51,600
of this shelf. It went here at 77s.
 

6823
03:01:51,600 --> 03:01:53,110
of this shelf. It went here at 77s.
For the sake of three points, I should

6824
03:01:53,110 --> 03:01:53,120
For the sake of three points, I should
 

6825
03:01:53,120 --> 03:01:55,910
For the sake of three points, I should
have given it. I got run out. It's what

6826
03:01:55,910 --> 03:01:55,920
have given it. I got run out. It's what
 

6827
03:01:55,920 --> 03:01:58,630
have given it. I got run out. It's what
happens. It It happens, right? So a

6828
03:01:58,630 --> 03:01:58,640
happens. It It happens, right? So a
 

6829
03:01:58,640 --> 03:02:01,990
happens. It It happens, right? So a
short at 65s was covering some each time

6830
03:02:01,990 --> 03:02:02,000
short at 65s was covering some each time
 

6831
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:03,830
short at 65s was covering some each time
on these flushes and I got run out at

6832
03:02:03,830 --> 03:02:03,840
on these flushes and I got run out at
 

6833
03:02:03,840 --> 03:02:06,309
on these flushes and I got run out at
77s. If I risked 80, we would have got

6834
03:02:06,309 --> 03:02:06,319
77s. If I risked 80, we would have got
 

6835
03:02:06,319 --> 03:02:08,150
77s. If I risked 80, we would have got
it. And then after that, what happens?

6836
03:02:08,150 --> 03:02:08,160
it. And then after that, what happens?
 

6837
03:02:08,160 --> 03:02:10,550
it. And then after that, what happens?
Well, we return back to where we have

6838
03:02:10,550 --> 03:02:10,560
Well, we return back to where we have
 

6839
03:02:10,560 --> 03:02:13,429
Well, we return back to where we have
volume, right? So this is so thin in

6840
03:02:13,429 --> 03:02:13,439
volume, right? So this is so thin in
 

6841
03:02:13,439 --> 03:02:16,630
volume, right? So this is so thin in
here and so thin here on the way up that

6842
03:02:16,630 --> 03:02:16,640
here and so thin here on the way up that
 

6843
03:02:16,640 --> 03:02:18,070
here and so thin here on the way up that
we're just going to return straight back

6844
03:02:18,070 --> 03:02:18,080
we're just going to return straight back
 

6845
03:02:18,080 --> 03:02:19,990
we're just going to return straight back
in because we lack any structure. Right?

6846
03:02:19,990 --> 03:02:20,000
in because we lack any structure. Right?
 

6847
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:21,349
in because we lack any structure. Right?
When we lack structure, this is what

6848
03:02:21,349 --> 03:02:21,359
When we lack structure, this is what
 

6849
03:02:21,359 --> 03:02:22,950
When we lack structure, this is what
happens.

6850
03:02:22,950 --> 03:02:22,960
happens.
 

6851
03:02:22,960 --> 03:02:25,990
happens.
Hopefully that makes sense. So you put

6852
03:02:25,990 --> 03:02:26,000
Hopefully that makes sense. So you put
 

6853
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:27,750
Hopefully that makes sense. So you put
it all together when you have your break

6854
03:02:27,750 --> 03:02:27,760
it all together when you have your break
 

6855
03:02:27,760 --> 03:02:29,590
it all together when you have your break
of structure, your break of trend, your

6856
03:02:29,590 --> 03:02:29,600
of structure, your break of trend, your
 

6857
03:02:29,600 --> 03:02:31,990
of structure, your break of trend, your
build of volume, your trap participants,

6858
03:02:31,990 --> 03:02:32,000
build of volume, your trap participants,
 

6859
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:34,950
build of volume, your trap participants,
your auction high, right? Your auction

6860
03:02:34,950 --> 03:02:34,960
your auction high, right? Your auction
 

6861
03:02:34,960 --> 03:02:37,750
your auction high, right? Your auction
high where we have buyers trapped at the

6862
03:02:37,750 --> 03:02:37,760
high where we have buyers trapped at the
 

6863
03:02:37,760 --> 03:02:39,110
high where we have buyers trapped at the
highs of day and then we start moving

6864
03:02:39,110 --> 03:02:39,120
highs of day and then we start moving
 

6865
03:02:39,120 --> 03:02:40,469
highs of day and then we start moving
away. There's only one thing we're going

6866
03:02:40,469 --> 03:02:40,479
away. There's only one thing we're going
 

6867
03:02:40,479 --> 03:02:41,830
away. There's only one thing we're going
to do. We're going to return back in

6868
03:02:41,830 --> 03:02:41,840
to do. We're going to return back in
 

6869
03:02:41,840 --> 03:02:43,590
to do. We're going to return back in
price. Where are we going to return?

6870
03:02:43,590 --> 03:02:43,600
price. Where are we going to return?
 

6871
03:02:43,600 --> 03:02:45,590
price. Where are we going to return?
We're going to return to areas where

6872
03:02:45,590 --> 03:02:45,600
We're going to return to areas where
 

6873
03:02:45,600 --> 03:02:49,510
We're going to return to areas where
there might be support. We return from

6874
03:02:49,510 --> 03:02:49,520
there might be support. We return from
 

6875
03:02:49,520 --> 03:02:52,309
there might be support. We return from
areas to where there might be support.

6876
03:02:52,309 --> 03:02:52,319
areas to where there might be support.
 

6877
03:02:52,319 --> 03:02:54,150
areas to where there might be support.
where there might be support. Where

6878
03:02:54,150 --> 03:02:54,160
where there might be support. Where
 

6879
03:02:54,160 --> 03:02:55,590
where there might be support. Where
there might be support, where there

6880
03:02:55,590 --> 03:02:55,600
there might be support, where there
 

6881
03:02:55,600 --> 03:02:57,269
there might be support, where there
might be support. Why do we not bid on

6882
03:02:57,269 --> 03:02:57,279
might be support. Why do we not bid on
 

6883
03:02:57,279 --> 03:02:59,110
might be support. Why do we not bid on
this? Because we're in a strong sell.

6884
03:02:59,110 --> 03:02:59,120
this? Because we're in a strong sell.
 

6885
03:02:59,120 --> 03:03:01,990
this? Because we're in a strong sell.
What's the protren? Sell. Higher time

6886
03:03:01,990 --> 03:03:02,000
What's the protren? Sell. Higher time
 

6887
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:03,830
What's the protren? Sell. Higher time
frame is in a sell. All right. So, we're

6888
03:03:03,830 --> 03:03:03,840
frame is in a sell. All right. So, we're
 

6889
03:03:03,840 --> 03:03:06,550
frame is in a sell. All right. So, we're
rotating down. This will be done when

6890
03:03:06,550 --> 03:03:06,560
rotating down. This will be done when
 

6891
03:03:06,560 --> 03:03:08,790
rotating down. This will be done when
it's done. It might never be done. All

6892
03:03:08,790 --> 03:03:08,800
it's done. It might never be done. All
 

6893
03:03:08,800 --> 03:03:10,070
it's done. It might never be done. All
right. This might just be getting

6894
03:03:10,070 --> 03:03:10,080
right. This might just be getting
 

6895
03:03:10,080 --> 03:03:11,590
right. This might just be getting
started. This might be a retest of

6896
03:03:11,590 --> 03:03:11,600
started. This might be a retest of
 

6897
03:03:11,600 --> 03:03:14,469
started. This might be a retest of
supply. We might be zooming out here on

6898
03:03:14,469 --> 03:03:14,479
supply. We might be zooming out here on
 

6899
03:03:14,479 --> 03:03:16,550
supply. We might be zooming out here on
a daily.

6900
03:03:16,550 --> 03:03:16,560
a daily.
 

6901
03:03:16,560 --> 03:03:19,110
a daily.
We might be expanding to come back down

6902
03:03:19,110 --> 03:03:19,120
We might be expanding to come back down
 

6903
03:03:19,120 --> 03:03:20,710
We might be expanding to come back down
into these 900s, which I keep talking

6904
03:03:20,710 --> 03:03:20,720
into these 900s, which I keep talking
 

6905
03:03:20,720 --> 03:03:22,230
into these 900s, which I keep talking
about the newsletter. And then under

6906
03:03:22,230 --> 03:03:22,240
about the newsletter. And then under
 

6907
03:03:22,240 --> 03:03:24,150
about the newsletter. And then under
that we have a gap fill here still

6908
03:03:24,150 --> 03:03:24,160
that we have a gap fill here still
 

6909
03:03:24,160 --> 03:03:27,269
that we have a gap fill here still
possible and lower. Okay. So the main

6910
03:03:27,269 --> 03:03:27,279
possible and lower. Okay. So the main
 

6911
03:03:27,279 --> 03:03:30,389
possible and lower. Okay. So the main
premise is still

6912
03:03:30,389 --> 03:03:30,399
premise is still
 

6913
03:03:30,399 --> 03:03:32,950
premise is still
all this trap buying volume. Right? We

6914
03:03:32,950 --> 03:03:32,960
all this trap buying volume. Right? We
 

6915
03:03:32,960 --> 03:03:35,429
all this trap buying volume. Right? We
want to lean against this short. At any

6916
03:03:35,429 --> 03:03:35,439
want to lean against this short. At any
 

6917
03:03:35,439 --> 03:03:37,110
want to lean against this short. At any
opportunity we have to lean against the

6918
03:03:37,110 --> 03:03:37,120
opportunity we have to lean against the
 

6919
03:03:37,120 --> 03:03:39,269
opportunity we have to lean against the
short. We expected some relief today. We

6920
03:03:39,269 --> 03:03:39,279
short. We expected some relief today. We
 

6921
03:03:39,279 --> 03:03:41,670
short. We expected some relief today. We
then want to lean short. These are the

6922
03:03:41,670 --> 03:03:41,680
then want to lean short. These are the
 

6923
03:03:41,680 --> 03:03:45,750
then want to lean short. These are the
targets. Right? Higher time frames.

6924
03:03:45,750 --> 03:03:45,760
targets. Right? Higher time frames.
 

6925
03:03:45,760 --> 03:03:51,110
targets. Right? Higher time frames.
One, two, failure. Yum. Right.

6926
03:03:51,110 --> 03:03:51,120
One, two, failure. Yum. Right.
 

6927
03:03:51,120 --> 03:04:04,309
One, two, failure. Yum. Right.
Hopefully that helps.

6928
03:04:04,309 --> 03:04:04,319

 

6929
03:04:04,319 --> 03:04:06,870

6961
03:04:49,359 --> 03:04:50,870

could there be an upward force at some

6962

point today? I mean, there could be like

6964
03:04:53,030 --> 03:04:53,040
point today? I mean, there could be like
 

6965
03:04:53,040 --> 03:04:55,429
point today? I mean, there could be like
it it could offer relief, but right now

6966
03:04:55,429 --> 03:04:55,439
it it could offer relief, but right now
 

6967
03:04:55,439 --> 03:04:57,429
it it could offer relief, but right now
we're coming all we're now under new

we're coming all we're now under new
 

6969

open. We're coming right down to the
 

6971
03:04:58,640 --> 03:05:00,230
open. We're coming right down to the
gap. We have previous day low and we

6972
03:05:00,230 --> 03:05:00,240
gap. We have previous day low and we
 

6973
03:05:00,240 --> 03:05:02,309
gap. We have previous day low and we
have targets below. I mean, could there

6974
03:05:02,309 --> 03:05:02,319
have targets below. I mean, could there
 

6975
03:05:02,319 --> 03:05:04,950
have targets below. I mean, could there

6977
03:05:04,960 --> 03:05:06,630
be a relief? Yeah, absolutely. I mean,
this is straight down the straight same

6978
03:05:06,630 --> 03:05:06,640
this is straight down the straight same
 

6979
03:05:06,640 --> 03:05:08,630
this is straight down the straight same
way it's straight up. Like, maybe we we

6980
03:05:08,630 --> 03:05:08,640
way it's straight up. Like, maybe we we
 

6981
03:05:08,640 --> 03:05:10,309
way it's straight up. Like, maybe we we
get relief. Maybe we come into here and

6982
03:05:10,309 --> 03:05:10,319
get relief. Maybe we come into here and
 

6983
03:05:10,319 --> 03:05:12,230
get relief. Maybe we come into here and
then we lift into here and then sell

6984
03:05:12,230 --> 03:05:12,240
then we lift into here and then sell
 

6985
03:05:12,240 --> 03:05:15,190
then we lift into here and then sell
back down. I don't know. I Anything's

6986
03:05:15,190 --> 03:05:15,200
back down. I don't know. I Anything's
 

6987
03:05:15,200 --> 03:05:16,550
back down. I don't know. I Anything's
possible. This is the thing when people

6988
03:05:16,550 --> 03:05:16,560
possible. This is the thing when people
 

6989
03:05:16,560 --> 03:05:18,150
possible. This is the thing when people
tell you it's have it has to do. It

6990
03:05:18,150 --> 03:05:18,160
tell you it's have it has to do. It
 

6991
03:05:18,160 --> 03:05:20,150
tell you it's have it has to do. It
doesn't have to do anything. The market

6992
03:05:20,150 --> 03:05:20,160
doesn't have to do anything. The market
 

6993
03:05:20,160 --> 03:05:21,670
doesn't have to do anything. The market
doesn't have to do anything. If it

6994
03:05:21,670 --> 03:05:21,680
doesn't have to do anything. If it
 

6995
03:05:21,680 --> 03:05:23,269
doesn't have to do anything. If it
didn't want to do this today, it could

6996
03:05:23,269 --> 03:05:23,279
didn't want to do this today, it could
 

6997
03:05:23,279 --> 03:05:25,590
didn't want to do this today, it could
have done that. It like the quicker that

7055
03:06:34,960 --> 03:06:36,469

7057
03:06:36,479 --> 03:06:40,619
