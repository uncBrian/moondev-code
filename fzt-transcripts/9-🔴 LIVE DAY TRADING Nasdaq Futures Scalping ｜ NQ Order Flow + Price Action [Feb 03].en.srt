8
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:09,919
trading. Maybe some of you have traded
 

9
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,390
trading. Maybe some of you have traded
some of GlobeEx overnight. And before we

10
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
some of GlobeEx overnight. And before we
 

11
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,150
some of GlobeEx overnight. And before we
get into the charts, I do talk about

12
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
get into the charts, I do talk about
 

13
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,510
get into the charts, I do talk about
this a lot, but make sure you're doing

14
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
this a lot, but make sure you're doing
 

15
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,590
this a lot, but make sure you're doing
it. Go through your morning prep even

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
it. Go through your morning prep even
 

17
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,950
it. Go through your morning prep even
before you get to these charts, right?

18
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
before you get to these charts, right?
 

19
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,710
before you get to these charts, right?
Have you had your tea or your coffee or

20
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
Have you had your tea or your coffee or
 

21
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,469
Have you had your tea or your coffee or
your water? Have you done your

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,110
visualization or your morning meditation
or gone to the gym or even gone for a

26
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
or gone to the gym or even gone for a
 

27
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,029
or gone to the gym or even gone for a
walk? Whatever is part of your morning

28
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
walk? Whatever is part of your morning
 

29
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,629
walk? Whatever is part of your morning
routine. I cannot tell you the

30
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
routine. I cannot tell you the
 

31
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,150
routine. I cannot tell you the
importance of sticking to that morning

32
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
importance of sticking to that morning
 

33
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,590
importance of sticking to that morning
routine or maybe for you it's an

34
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
routine or maybe for you it's an
 

35
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,110
routine or maybe for you it's an
afternoon or evening routine, but you

36
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
afternoon or evening routine, but you
 

37
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,430
afternoon or evening routine, but you
have to be sticking to that routine. All

38
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
have to be sticking to that routine. All
 

39
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,710
have to be sticking to that routine. All
right, as always, we're going to start

40
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
right, as always, we're going to start
 

41
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,070
right, as always, we're going to start
off on the daily. We are starting off

42
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
off on the daily. We are starting off
 

43
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,469
off on the daily. We are starting off
with an outside bar, which is good news.

44
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
with an outside bar, which is good news.
 

45
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,950
with an outside bar, which is good news.
All right, so yesterday set the tone. So

46
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
All right, so yesterday set the tone. So
 

47
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,350
All right, so yesterday set the tone. So
far, we've drifted outside. Um, this

48
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
far, we've drifted outside. Um, this
 

49
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,950
far, we've drifted outside. Um, this
right here, this volume profile we're

50
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
right here, this volume profile we're
 

51
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,430
right here, this volume profile we're
looking at right here is pinned to this

52
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
looking at right here is pinned to this
 

53
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,590
looking at right here is pinned to this
all-time high. All right? And I want you

54
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
all-time high. All right? And I want you
 

55
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,189
all-time high. All right? And I want you
to just take note of the amount of

56
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
to just take note of the amount of
 

57
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,510
to just take note of the amount of
liquidity we have built in here. All

58
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
liquidity we have built in here. All
 

59
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,029
liquidity we have built in here. All
right? We have another level down here.

60
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
right? We have another level down here.
 

61
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,909
right? We have another level down here.
We're basically split into two halves

62
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
We're basically split into two halves
 

63
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,510
We're basically split into two halves
here. All right? And we are struggling

64
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:03,520
here. All right? And we are struggling
 

65
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,309
here. All right? And we are struggling
to find acceptance over 26,000. We are

66
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
to find acceptance over 26,000. We are
 

67
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,469
to find acceptance over 26,000. We are
struggling to find acceptance underneath

68
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
struggling to find acceptance underneath
 

69
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,469
struggling to find acceptance underneath
25,200.

70
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
25,200.
 

71
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,390
25,200.
And we are starting to build a huge

72
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
And we are starting to build a huge
 

73
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,270
And we are starting to build a huge
amount of liquidity between 26,000 and

74
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
amount of liquidity between 26,000 and
 

75
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,029
amount of liquidity between 26,000 and
25,600.

76
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039
25,600.
 

77
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,350
25,600.
All right. So sort of 400 point range in

78
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
All right. So sort of 400 point range in
 

79
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,430
All right. So sort of 400 point range in
here. And the rest of the time we're in

80
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
here. And the rest of the time we're in
 

81
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,070
here. And the rest of the time we're in
range here. No acceptance outside either

82
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
range here. No acceptance outside either
 

83
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,350
range here. No acceptance outside either
side of it. All right. So we're coming

84
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
side of it. All right. So we're coming
 

85
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,230
side of it. All right. So we're coming
back to test this same level. Now we do

86
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
back to test this same level. Now we do
 

87
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,550
back to test this same level. Now we do
we do have Ballinger bands which are

88
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
we do have Ballinger bands which are
 

89
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,710
we do have Ballinger bands which are
starting to trade upside. All right. And

90
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
starting to trade upside. All right. And
 

91
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,870
starting to trade upside. All right. And
a 5day which will need to turn around.

92
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
a 5day which will need to turn around.
 

93
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,469
a 5day which will need to turn around.
It would take a couple days after what

94
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
It would take a couple days after what
 

95
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,550
It would take a couple days after what
happened last week. And if we do that,

96
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
happened last week. And if we do that,
 

97
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,309
happened last week. And if we do that,
we can go back looking for this again.

98
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
we can go back looking for this again.
 

99
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,749
we can go back looking for this again.
All right. So, what are the

100
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
All right. So, what are the
 

101
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,670
All right. So, what are the
opportunities today? We want to be very

102
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
opportunities today? We want to be very
 

103
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,430
opportunities today? We want to be very
careful, don't we? As we come towards

104
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
careful, don't we? As we come towards
 

105
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,430
careful, don't we? As we come towards
this edge where we keep failing and we

106
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
this edge where we keep failing and we
 

107
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,710
this edge where we keep failing and we
had a look above and fail. All right. We

108
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
had a look above and fail. All right. We
 

109
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,950
had a look above and fail. All right. We
want to be very careful. If we measure

110
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:52,960
want to be very careful. If we measure
 

111
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,870
want to be very careful. If we measure
from that look above and fail to the

112
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
from that look above and fail to the
 

113
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,590
from that look above and fail to the
low, right, we can see we're right in

114
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:57,600
low, right, we can see we're right in
 

115
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,749
low, right, we can see we're right in
the golden pocket. We're right in the

116
00:06:59,749 --> 00:06:59,759
the golden pocket. We're right in the
 

117
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,070
the golden pocket. We're right in the
edge of the value area high based on

118
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
edge of the value area high based on
 

119
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,469
edge of the value area high based on
that pin from October 30th. All right.

120
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
that pin from October 30th. All right.
 

121
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,830
that pin from October 30th. All right.
So we want to be careful thinking about

122
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
So we want to be careful thinking about
 

123
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,550
So we want to be careful thinking about
longs up here. All right, the location

124
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
longs up here. All right, the location
 

125
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,790
longs up here. All right, the location
is not ideal for longs. We are in a

126
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
is not ideal for longs. We are in a
 

127
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,469
is not ideal for longs. We are in a
range. However, if we start to break out

128
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
range. However, if we start to break out
 

129
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,270
range. However, if we start to break out
and hold above and base, there is an

130
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
and hold above and base, there is an
 

131
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,309
and hold above and base, there is an
argument for this now to be a long. Same

132
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
argument for this now to be a long. Same
 

133
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,550
argument for this now to be a long. Same
as we had here. This time it failed. All

134
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
as we had here. This time it failed. All
 

135
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,309
as we had here. This time it failed. All
right, but we fail the lows. We're back

136
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
right, but we fail the lows. We're back
 

137
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,390
right, but we fail the lows. We're back
up. All right, so there's an argument

138
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
up. All right, so there's an argument
 

139
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,029
up. All right, so there's an argument
for this move here. Right, there is an

140
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
for this move here. Right, there is an
 

141
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,710
for this move here. Right, there is an
argument for it. You want to be very

142
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
argument for it. You want to be very
 

143
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,189
argument for it. You want to be very
careful for this move here back down

144
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
careful for this move here back down
 

145
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,589
careful for this move here back down
again. So, we're going to need to look

146
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599
again. So, we're going to need to look
 

147
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,189
again. So, we're going to need to look
for location and momentum. We're going

148
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,199
for location and momentum. We're going
 

149
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,790
for location and momentum. We're going
to have to respect the range that we're

150
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
to have to respect the range that we're
 

151
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,390
to have to respect the range that we're
in there. Best way to do that is move

152
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
in there. Best way to do that is move
 

153
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,189
in there. Best way to do that is move
down into the hourly chart. Uh let's

154
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,199
down into the hourly chart. Uh let's
 

155
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,430
down into the hourly chart. Uh let's
move this up a little bit just so we can

156
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
move this up a little bit just so we can
 

157
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,909
move this up a little bit just so we can
get a bit more depth on here. Okay, so

158
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
get a bit more depth on here. Okay, so
 

159
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,270
get a bit more depth on here. Okay, so
this is the current week developing

160
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
this is the current week developing
 

161
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,230
this is the current week developing
profile. You can see

162
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
profile. You can see
 

163
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,909
profile. You can see
when we say we're not on an inside,

164
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
when we say we're not on an inside,
 

165
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,749
when we say we're not on an inside,
we're not on an inside daily bar, but we

166
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
we're not on an inside daily bar, but we
 

167
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,749
we're not on an inside daily bar, but we
are most certainly inside the previous

168
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
are most certainly inside the previous
 

169
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,189
are most certainly inside the previous
week. All right, here's the previous

170
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:01,199
week. All right, here's the previous
 

171
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,189
week. All right, here's the previous
week value area high. Here's previous

172
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
week value area high. Here's previous
 

173
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,110
week value area high. Here's previous
week value area low. Here's previous

174
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
week value area low. Here's previous
 

175
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,189
week value area low. Here's previous
week point of control. These are our key

176
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
week point of control. These are our key
 

177
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,909
week point of control. These are our key
levels. It is as simple as that. We are

178
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
levels. It is as simple as that. We are
 

179
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,110
levels. It is as simple as that. We are
going to respect them. So, we expect

180
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
going to respect them. So, we expect
 

181
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,230
going to respect them. So, we expect
right 26 down 261

182
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
right 26 down 261
 

183
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,629
right 26 down 261
26,100.

184
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
26,100.
 

185
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,629
26,100.
There we go. You got it out eventually.

186
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
There we go. You got it out eventually.
 

187
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,309
There we go. You got it out eventually.
All right. To be resistance, we expect

188
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
All right. To be resistance, we expect
 

189
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,629
All right. To be resistance, we expect
that to potentially reject. Now, if we

190
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
that to potentially reject. Now, if we
 

191
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,029
that to potentially reject. Now, if we
break above and reclaim that, we have

192
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
break above and reclaim that, we have
 

193
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,710
break above and reclaim that, we have
some liquidity here. You can see it's

194
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
some liquidity here. You can see it's
 

195
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,589
some liquidity here. You can see it's
much much thinner. So, I'd say over 150s

196
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
much much thinner. So, I'd say over 150s
 

197
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,909
much much thinner. So, I'd say over 150s
and the squeeze is on. All right. So, a

198
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
and the squeeze is on. All right. So, a
 

199
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,990
and the squeeze is on. All right. So, a
hold of 100 or a hold of yeah 100, a

200
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
hold of 100 or a hold of yeah 100, a
 

201
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,550
hold of 100 or a hold of yeah 100, a
break of 150 and the squeeze is on.

202
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
break of 150 and the squeeze is on.
 

203
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,190
break of 150 and the squeeze is on.
Right. A look above 100 into 150 even

204
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200
Right. A look above 100 into 150 even
 

205
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,590
Right. A look above 100 into 150 even
and a fail. And we would expect that to

206
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
and a fail. And we would expect that to
 

207
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,509
and a fail. And we would expect that to
be a failed break above the previous

208
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
be a failed break above the previous
 

209
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,509
be a failed break above the previous
week and a rotation probably back down

210
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519
week and a rotation probably back down
 

211
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,590
week and a rotation probably back down
into sort of these 800s. Okay. So, we're

212
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
into sort of these 800s. Okay. So, we're
 

213
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,070
into sort of these 800s. Okay. So, we're
watching that. Traps, right? traps can

214
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,080
watching that. Traps, right? traps can
 

215
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,430
watching that. Traps, right? traps can
live. We can see we've had three drives

216
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
live. We can see we've had three drives
 

217
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,190
live. We can see we've had three drives
here. We want to be very, very careful.

218
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
here. We want to be very, very careful.
 

219
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,990
here. We want to be very, very careful.
One, two, three. Right? Bullish traps

220
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
One, two, three. Right? Bullish traps
 

221
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,550
One, two, three. Right? Bullish traps
can live underneath this swing. I want

222
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,560
can live underneath this swing. I want
 

223
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,550
can live underneath this swing. I want
you to be aware of that. We're very thin

224
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
you to be aware of that. We're very thin
 

225
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,870
you to be aware of that. We're very thin
under here. Okay? So, there's two

226
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
under here. Okay? So, there's two
 

227
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,310
under here. Okay? So, there's two
arguments that can happen down here.

228
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
arguments that can happen down here.
 

229
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,509
arguments that can happen down here.
One, we flush, we fail to reclaim, and

230
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
One, we flush, we fail to reclaim, and
 

231
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,350
One, we flush, we fail to reclaim, and
we rotate right the way back down,

232
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
we rotate right the way back down,
 

233
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,269
we rotate right the way back down,
repairing this thin structure. Very,

234
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
repairing this thin structure. Very,
 

235
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,590
repairing this thin structure. Very,
very possible that we can do that. So,

236
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
very possible that we can do that. So,
 

237
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,190
very possible that we can do that. So,
we're going to pay close attention to

238
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
we're going to pay close attention to
 

239
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,829
we're going to pay close attention to
these sort of 900s down to, I don't

240
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
these sort of 900s down to, I don't
 

241
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,030
these sort of 900s down to, I don't
know, 800s, 850. The other option is

242
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040
know, 800s, 850. The other option is
 

243
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,630
know, 800s, 850. The other option is
that they come for a little stop hunt.

244
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
that they come for a little stop hunt.
 

245
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,910
that they come for a little stop hunt.
Maybe they don't even make it all the

246
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
Maybe they don't even make it all the
 

247
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,509
Maybe they don't even make it all the
way and they do something dirty like

248
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519
way and they do something dirty like
 

249
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,829
way and they do something dirty like
this. They come in here, breakout shorts

250
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
this. They come in here, breakout shorts
 

251
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,670
this. They come in here, breakout shorts
come flying in looking for this move

252
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
come flying in looking for this move
 

253
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,430
come flying in looking for this move
here, and they go, "Nope, f you

254
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440
here, and they go, "Nope, f you
 

255
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,190
here, and they go, "Nope, f you
everyone. We just wanted your stops, and

256
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,200
everyone. We just wanted your stops, and
 

257
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,350
everyone. We just wanted your stops, and
we're going back to the upside." Right?

258
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
we're going back to the upside." Right?
 

259
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,350
we're going back to the upside." Right?
These are the areas I'm looking at, and

260
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
These are the areas I'm looking at, and
 

261
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,110
These are the areas I'm looking at, and
I'm willing to play both ways. And if

262
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
I'm willing to play both ways. And if
 

263
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,310
I'm willing to play both ways. And if
you're new here and you're like, "Well,

264
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
you're new here and you're like, "Well,
 

265
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,389
you're new here and you're like, "Well,
what's the bias? What's the bias?" Well,

266
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399
what's the bias? What's the bias?" Well,
 

267
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,990
what's the bias? What's the bias?" Well,
the bias is we're inside the previous

268
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
the bias is we're inside the previous
 

269
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,470
the bias is we're inside the previous
week. That's the bias, right? So, we're

270
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,480
week. That's the bias, right? So, we're
 

271
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,230
week. That's the bias, right? So, we're
not going to say that we're going

272
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
not going to say that we're going
 

273
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,750
not going to say that we're going
straight upside or straight downside.

274
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
straight upside or straight downside.
 

275
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,389
straight upside or straight downside.
We're going to respect this massive node

276
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:58,399
We're going to respect this massive node
 

277
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,550
We're going to respect this massive node
from previous week, which is also from

278
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
from previous week, which is also from
 

279
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,230
from previous week, which is also from
many, many weeks before. All right?

280
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
many, many weeks before. All right?
 

281
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,509
many, many weeks before. All right?
We're trading in 1 2 3 4 five. You could

282
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
We're trading in 1 2 3 4 five. You could
 

283
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,070
We're trading in 1 2 3 4 five. You could
even argue this one. Six, seven. Seven

284
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,080
even argue this one. Six, seven. Seven
 

285
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,670
even argue this one. Six, seven. Seven
weeks of volume we're trading in right

286
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
weeks of volume we're trading in right
 

287
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,790
weeks of volume we're trading in right
now. So, we're going to respect that

288
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
now. So, we're going to respect that
 

289
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,470
now. So, we're going to respect that
volume. We're not going to be arrogant

290
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
volume. We're not going to be arrogant
 

291
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,150
volume. We're not going to be arrogant
enough to say the market has to do this

292
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
enough to say the market has to do this
 

293
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,230
enough to say the market has to do this
or has to do that, right? We're going to

294
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
or has to do that, right? We're going to
 

295
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,829
or has to do that, right? We're going to
be willing to play both sides. So the

296
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
be willing to play both sides. So the
 

297
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,230
be willing to play both sides. So the
opportunities today are this, are this,

298
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
opportunities today are this, are this,
 

299
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,389
opportunities today are this, are this,
are this, and are this. All right, these

300
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399
are this, and are this. All right, these
 

301
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,990
are this, and are this. All right, these
are the opportunities. I guess the other

302
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
are the opportunities. I guess the other
 

303
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,990
are the opportunities. I guess the other
opportunity is it goes f you to all of

304
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
opportunity is it goes f you to all of
 

305
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,870
opportunity is it goes f you to all of
us and just does that. It is possible.

306
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
us and just does that. It is possible.
 

307
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,389
us and just does that. It is possible.
It is possible it could do that if it

308
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
It is possible it could do that if it
 

309
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,430
It is possible it could do that if it
wants. All right, so that's what we're

310
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,440
wants. All right, so that's what we're
 

311
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,269
wants. All right, so that's what we're
looking at this morning. These these pa

312
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,279
looking at this morning. These these pa
 

313
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,949
looking at this morning. These these pa
things here. So we're going to take big

314
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:38,959
things here. So we're going to take big
 

315
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,949
things here. So we're going to take big
note as we come drift down into some of

316
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
note as we come drift down into some of
 

317
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,990
note as we come drift down into some of
these. All right, need to get a bit of a

318
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
these. All right, need to get a bit of a
 

319
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,269
these. All right, need to get a bit of a
move on here. Let's have a look at what

320
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279
move on here. Let's have a look at what
 

321
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,910
move on here. Let's have a look at what
happened in GlobeEx overnight. Let move

322
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
happened in GlobeEx overnight. Let move
 

323
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,990
happened in GlobeEx overnight. Let move
this down.

324
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,000
this down.
 

325
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,710
this down.
All right. So, if we think about what we

326
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
All right. So, if we think about what we
 

327
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,430
All right. So, if we think about what we
did yesterday, we reclaimed that all

328
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
did yesterday, we reclaimed that all
 

329
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,990
did yesterday, we reclaimed that all
important 20-day. Remember, this was

330
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
important 20-day. Remember, this was
 

331
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,389
important 20-day. Remember, this was
lower Ballinger band tag. This is mean

332
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
lower Ballinger band tag. This is mean
 

333
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,030
lower Ballinger band tag. This is mean
reversion. This is 20-day to 5day. We

334
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
reversion. This is 20-day to 5day. We
 

335
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,790
reversion. This is 20-day to 5day. We
talked about that rotation a lot. Get

336
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
talked about that rotation a lot. Get
 

337
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,590
talked about that rotation a lot. Get
above 5day. Holding above 5day now. And

338
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
above 5day. Holding above 5day now. And
 

339
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,750
above 5day. Holding above 5day now. And
we will wait and see. So, what we had

340
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:09,760
we will wait and see. So, what we had
 

341
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,590
we will wait and see. So, what we had
overnight was just a slow drift high.

342
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
overnight was just a slow drift high.
 

343
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,750
overnight was just a slow drift high.
That's all it is. So a little pullback

344
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:13,760
That's all it is. So a little pullback
 

345
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,710
That's all it is. So a little pullback
which held this key volume node. Asia

346
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:16,720
which held this key volume node. Asia
 

347
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,269
which held this key volume node. Asia
came in, bought the bids. London sold

348
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:19,279
came in, bought the bids. London sold
 

349
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,269
came in, bought the bids. London sold
the highs against this in front of this

350
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
the highs against this in front of this
 

351
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,910
the highs against this in front of this
old level front running it back down to

352
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
old level front running it back down to
 

353
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,310
old level front running it back down to
the 5day. Caught a bid inside London

354
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320
the 5day. Caught a bid inside London
 

355
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,990
the 5day. Caught a bid inside London
back down to the 5day again. We're

356
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
back down to the 5day again. We're
 

357
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,670
back down to the 5day again. We're
watching this level here. This level

358
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
watching this level here. This level
 

359
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,430
watching this level here. This level
here is the big overunder. All right,

360
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
here is the big overunder. All right,
 

361
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,430
here is the big overunder. All right,
that's what we're watching. All right,

362
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
that's what we're watching. All right,
 

363
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,790
that's what we're watching. All right,
let's move into the lower time frame.

364
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
let's move into the lower time frame.
 

365
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,150
let's move into the lower time frame.
Look at some of the ETFs, etc., etc.

366
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160

 

367
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,069

Get rid of this guy.

368
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079

 

369
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,310

Uh, starting off with ES, it's going to

370
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
Uh, starting off with ES, it's going to
 

371
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,590
Uh, starting off with ES, it's going to
be the same story. We're very close to

372
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,600
be the same story. We're very close to
 

373
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,590
be the same story. We're very close to
alltime highs here, folks. All right,

374
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
alltime highs here, folks. All right,
 

375
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,110
alltime highs here, folks. All right,
very, very close to alltime highs. You

376
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
very, very close to alltime highs. You
 

377
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,470
very, very close to alltime highs. You
can see this big shelf being developed

378
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,480
can see this big shelf being developed
 

379
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,310
can see this big shelf being developed
here. It needs to get above 17s.

380
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
here. It needs to get above 17s.
 

381
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,509
here. It needs to get above 17s.
Basically, you're looking for a base

382
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:57,519
Basically, you're looking for a base
 

383
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,990
Basically, you're looking for a base
above 17s on ES. Make it really, really

384
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
above 17s on ES. Make it really, really
 

385
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,750
above 17s on ES. Make it really, really
clear, right? Every time it's come up

386
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
clear, right? Every time it's come up
 

387
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,230
clear, right? Every time it's come up
here, it's failed. All right. And the

388
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,240
here, it's failed. All right. And the
 

389
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,230
here, it's failed. All right. And the
low of that is 31. So, that's your

390
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
low of that is 31. So, that's your
 

391
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,030
low of that is 31. So, that's your
rotation. All right.

392
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040
rotation. All right.
 

393
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,190
rotation. All right.
If it gets above here and it can base,

394
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
If it gets above here and it can base,
 

395
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,389
If it gets above here and it can base,
all right, then you're looking for that

396
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
all right, then you're looking for that
 

397
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,629
all right, then you're looking for that
upside shot. Simple as that. If we want

398
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
upside shot. Simple as that. If we want
 

399
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,230
upside shot. Simple as that. If we want
to have a look at that on the spiders on

400
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
to have a look at that on the spiders on
 

401
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,310
to have a look at that on the spiders on
the cash market,

402
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
the cash market,
 

403
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,829
the cash market,
same kind of story. They're probably

404
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:19,839
same kind of story. They're probably
 

405
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,590
same kind of story. They're probably
looking for the 700s. All right, it will

406
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
looking for the 700s. All right, it will
 

407
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,829
looking for the 700s. All right, it will
look exactly the same on the cash

408
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:23,839
look exactly the same on the cash
 

409
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,230
look exactly the same on the cash
market. It looks exactly the same. So,

410
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
market. It looks exactly the same. So,
 

411
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,670
market. It looks exactly the same. So,
it's just a question of can they get

412
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
it's just a question of can they get
 

413
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,069
it's just a question of can they get
going for that breakout over all-time

414
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
going for that breakout over all-time
 

415
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,910
going for that breakout over all-time
highs or that breakout above the base.

416
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
highs or that breakout above the base.
 

417
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,269
highs or that breakout above the base.
So, we can we just put a little alert in

418
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:35,279
So, we can we just put a little alert in
 

419
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,269
So, we can we just put a little alert in
here. Thanks very much. So that we can

420
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:37,279
here. Thanks very much. So that we can
 

421
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,790
here. Thanks very much. So that we can
remember that is the high, isn't it? It

422
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
remember that is the high, isn't it? It
 

423
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,829
remember that is the high, isn't it? It
is indeed. Make sure going left. Yes.

424
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:41,839
is indeed. Make sure going left. Yes.
 

425
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,910
is indeed. Make sure going left. Yes.
Okay. So we put price alert in there in

426
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:43,920
Okay. So we put price alert in there in
 

427
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,870
Okay. So we put price alert in there in
case we do break out. QQQ. Same story.

428
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
case we do break out. QQQ. Same story.
 

429
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,230
case we do break out. QQQ. Same story.
You can see this the level we're trying

430
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
You can see this the level we're trying
 

431
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,509
You can see this the level we're trying
to come and back test. Right. This is

432
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:49,519
to come and back test. Right. This is
 

433
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,110
to come and back test. Right. This is
where buyers are stuck. We must remember

434
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,120
where buyers are stuck. We must remember
 

435
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,829
where buyers are stuck. We must remember
this on QQQ on the cash market. We have

436
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
this on QQQ on the cash market. We have
 

437
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,750
this on QQQ on the cash market. We have
buyers stuck here until we get

438
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:55,760
buyers stuck here until we get
 

439
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,110
buyers stuck here until we get
acceptance back inside I'd say of 32s.

440
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,120
acceptance back inside I'd say of 32s.
 

441
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,710
acceptance back inside I'd say of 32s.
All right. Until we find acceptance back

442
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
All right. Until we find acceptance back
 

443
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,190
All right. Until we find acceptance back
inside of 32s.

444
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
inside of 32s.
 

445
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,670
inside of 32s.
Let's draw that out.

446
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,680
Let's draw that out.
 

447
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,990
Let's draw that out.
Let's just quickly put one of these on

448
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
Let's just quickly put one of these on
 

449
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,269
Let's just quickly put one of these on
here. Just want to make sure. Yeah, 32s

450
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,279
here. Just want to make sure. Yeah, 32s
 

451
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,590
here. Just want to make sure. Yeah, 32s
is a good level. So, let's put a price

452
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
is a good level. So, let's put a price
 

453
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,470
is a good level. So, let's put a price
alert on there. Um, I would imagine

454
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
alert on there. Um, I would imagine
 

455
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,150
alert on there. Um, I would imagine
there's some gamma in here. So, let's

456
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
there's some gamma in here. So, let's
 

457
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,949
there's some gamma in here. So, let's
add an alert in there.

458
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
add an alert in there.
 

459
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,710
add an alert in there.
QQQ 32 reclaim just so we've got that

460
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
QQQ 32 reclaim just so we've got that
 

461
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,470
QQQ 32 reclaim just so we've got that
ready.

462
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
ready.
 

463
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,949
ready.
All right. So, until QQQ's get inside of

464
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:28,959
All right. So, until QQQ's get inside of
 

465
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,550
All right. So, until QQQ's get inside of
that, we know that the buyers are stuck

466
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
that, we know that the buyers are stuck
 

467
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,990
that, we know that the buyers are stuck
up here. All right. This is the

468
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
up here. All right. This is the
 

469
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,310
up here. All right. This is the
rotation. We can build this out here.

470
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
rotation. We can build this out here.
 

471
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,389
rotation. We can build this out here.
This can be the head, left shoulder,

472
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
This can be the head, left shoulder,
 

473
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,910
This can be the head, left shoulder,
right shoulder. It might need to do a

474
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
right shoulder. It might need to do a
 

475
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,910
right shoulder. It might need to do a
little dunk and then what happens in

476
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
little dunk and then what happens in
 

477
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,910
little dunk and then what happens in
here becomes key. If it does this, we're

478
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:41,920
here becomes key. If it does this, we're
 

479
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,509
here becomes key. If it does this, we're
going to expect bullish moves. If we

480
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
going to expect bullish moves. If we
 

481
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,430
going to expect bullish moves. If we
come up, poke, reject, do this, then

482
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
come up, poke, reject, do this, then
 

483
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,670
come up, poke, reject, do this, then
we're coming straight back downside. All

484
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:47,680
we're coming straight back downside. All
 

485
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,829
we're coming straight back downside. All
right, Dixie still trying to find a bit

486
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
right, Dixie still trying to find a bit
 

487
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,829
right, Dixie still trying to find a bit
of a bid here. Let's just zoom out of

488
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
of a bid here. Let's just zoom out of
 

489
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,670
of a bid here. Let's just zoom out of
this. Right, you can see same kind of

490
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680
this. Right, you can see same kind of
 

491
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,870
this. Right, you can see same kind of
story into a key pivot. All right, so if

492
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
story into a key pivot. All right, so if
 

493
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,550
story into a key pivot. All right, so if
you were long Dixie, you should be

494
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
you were long Dixie, you should be
 

495
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,150
you were long Dixie, you should be
selling a good chunk of your position

496
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,160
selling a good chunk of your position
 

497
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,670
selling a good chunk of your position
now because again, this is same thing.

498
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680
now because again, this is same thing.
 

499
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,509
now because again, this is same thing.
That's where trap buyers are. If we find

500
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:03,519
That's where trap buyers are. If we find
 

501
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,269
That's where trap buyers are. If we find
acceptance in this, then you get a

502
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:05,279
acceptance in this, then you get a
 

503
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,949
acceptance in this, then you get a
continuation squeeze. But at the moment,

504
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:06,959
continuation squeeze. But at the moment,
 

505
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,150
continuation squeeze. But at the moment,
you want to be selling some of your

506
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
you want to be selling some of your
 

507
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,110
you want to be selling some of your
Dixie into that move. We can have a

508
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
Dixie into that move. We can have a
 

509
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,870
Dixie into that move. We can have a
quick look at metals. All right, we are

510
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:12,880
quick look at metals. All right, we are
 

511
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,910
quick look at metals. All right, we are
looking for a trade upside here. Um, and

512
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:15,920

513
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,509
looking for a trade upside here. Um, and
then to resell into for failed

514
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
then to resell into for failed
 

515
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,189
then to resell into for failed
followrough. So, we're getting close.

516
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:19,199
followrough. So, we're getting close.
 

517
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,110
followrough. So, we're getting close.
So, I'm interested in this kind of move

518
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,120
So, I'm interested in this kind of move
 

519
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,350
So, I'm interested in this kind of move

520
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360
here to see if buyers get stuck and we
 

521
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,269
here to see if buyers get stuck and we
get a retest of somewhere down towards

522
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:25,279
get a retest of somewhere down towards
 

523
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,110
get a retest of somewhere down towards
these lows is what my expectation would

524
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120
these lows is what my expectation would
 

525
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,509
these lows is what my expectation would
be on the metals. Same here. Same kind

00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:31,440
of move for any of you trading metals.
 

529
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,910

then a resell down and you're taking

538
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:41,680
then a resell down and you're taking

started to find a bid yesterday. Let's
 

557
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,750
started to find a bid yesterday. Let's
have a look here. Slight gap down on

have a look here. Slight gap down on
 

559
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,910
have a look here. Slight gap down on
Apple. We'd be watching this pivot into

560
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
Apple. We'd be watching this pivot into
 

561
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,509
Apple. We'd be watching this pivot into
here to hold. 65s to hold on Apple. 65

562
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
here to hold. 65s to hold on Apple. 65
 

563
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,870
here to hold. 65s to hold on Apple. 65
holds, then we look good for

00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
holds, then we look good for
 

565
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,870

569
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,150

570
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
pivot, all right, that we're looking for
 

571
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,750
pivot, all right, that we're looking for
at Apple. The one that held yesterday,

572
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:13,760

575
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,110

It's it can might undercut it and do

576
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,120
It's it can might undercut it and do
 

577
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,710
It's it can might undercut it and do
that. That's fine. What you don't want

578
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
that. That's fine. What you don't want
 

579
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,189
that. That's fine. What you don't want
is for Amazon to lose that and snap all

580
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:21,199
is for Amazon to lose that and snap all
 

581
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,150
is for Amazon to lose that and snap all
the way down. Goo, let's have a look at

582
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
the way down. Goo, let's have a look at
 

583
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,670
the way down. Goo, let's have a look at
the GooG. Remember, some of these got

584
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:25,680
the GooG. Remember, some of these got
 

585
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,590
the GooG. Remember, some of these got
earnings this week. G big drive up

586
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
earnings this week. G big drive up
 

587
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,829
earnings this week. G big drive up
anticipation for earnings which are

588
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
anticipation for earnings which are
 

589
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,590
anticipation for earnings which are
coming this week. Maybe we can pull back

590
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
coming this week. Maybe we can pull back
 

591
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,470
coming this week. Maybe we can pull back
and hold 45s and continue higher. It

592
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
and hold 45s and continue higher. It
 

593
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,389
and hold 45s and continue higher. It
looks like they're pricing in earnings

594
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
looks like they're pricing in earnings
 

595
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,230
looks like they're pricing in earnings
nice and early. Very very similar to

596
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
nice and early. Very very similar to
 

597
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,910
nice and early. Very very similar to
last week. We priced in earnings early

598
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:39,920
last week. We priced in earnings early
 

599
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,710
last week. We priced in earnings early
and then sold it off Meta um being

600
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:42,720
and then sold it off Meta um being
 

601
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,949
and then sold it off Meta um being
priced in early. There you go. There's

602
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
priced in early. There you go. There's
 

603
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,949
priced in early. There you go. There's
the big move on on Meta. We can think

604
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
the big move on on Meta. We can think
 

605
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,550
the big move on on Meta. We can think
about that. You can think about this

606
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:48,560
about that. You can think about this
 

607
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,110
about that. You can think about this
whole move right. Are we pulling back?

608
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
whole move right. Are we pulling back?
 

609
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,590
whole move right. Are we pulling back?
Yeah. Still very very bullish right on

00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:53,600
Yeah. Still very very bullish right on
 

611
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,350
Yeah. Still very very bullish right on
Meta. I'm still long Meta. Looking to

612
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
Meta. I'm still long Meta. Looking to
 

613
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,509
Meta. I'm still long Meta. Looking to
see if we can get up into the 760s right

614
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:57,519
see if we can get up into the 760s right
 

615
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,189
see if we can get up into the 760s right
now. Microsoft that looks terrible. Very

616
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
now. Microsoft that looks terrible. Very
 

617
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,949
now. Microsoft that looks terrible. Very
well might undercut here. So Microsoft's

618
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:02,959
well might undercut here. So Microsoft's
 

619
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,870
well might undercut here. So Microsoft's
got two opportunities here. One little

620
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
got two opportunities here. One little
 

621
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,949
got two opportunities here. One little
trap down here or two what it looks more

622
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
trap down here or two what it looks more
 

623
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,269
trap down here or two what it looks more
like. One two starting to fail and

624
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
like. One two starting to fail and
 

625
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,790
like. One two starting to fail and
continuation lower. If we're going to

626
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
continuation lower. If we're going to
 

627
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,110
continuation lower. If we're going to
look lower can have a little look we

628
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
look lower can have a little look we
 

629
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,110
look lower can have a little look we
might even come down all the way down

630
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120
might even come down all the way down
 

631
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,189
might even come down all the way down
into this little zone here into the low

632
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:17,199
into this little zone here into the low
 

633
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,430
into this little zone here into the low
400s. I will be looking to scoop some on

634
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,440
400s. I will be looking to scoop some on
 

635
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,910
400s. I will be looking to scoop some on
M on Microsoft if we move too much lower

636
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
M on Microsoft if we move too much lower
 

637
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,269
M on Microsoft if we move too much lower
cuz that is a big move off the highs

638
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
cuz that is a big move off the highs
 

639
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,710
cuz that is a big move off the highs
now.

640
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:30,720

 

641
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,590

Yeah, 24% if we can get down into here.

642
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600
Yeah, 24% if we can get down into here.
 

643
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,310
Yeah, 24% if we can get down into here.
What date was that? Feb. Yeah, I'm

644
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,320
What date was that? Feb. Yeah, I'm
 

645
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,829
What date was that? Feb. Yeah, I'm
interested in that. If it comes too much

646
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:39,839
interested in that. If it comes too much
 

647
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,470
interested in that. If it comes too much
lower, I will it will per my interest.

648
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
lower, I will it will per my interest.
 

649
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,790
lower, I will it will per my interest.
Nvidia.

650
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800

 

651
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,550

We still in the dance in Nvidia. Looks

652
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
We still in the dance in Nvidia. Looks
 

653
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,269
We still in the dance in Nvidia. Looks
by the looks of it. Yeah, still in a

654
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:51,279
by the looks of it. Yeah, still in a
 

655
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,870
by the looks of it. Yeah, still in a
sideways dance coming to the lower side

656
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
sideways dance coming to the lower side
 

657
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,389
sideways dance coming to the lower side
of the range. It's got a pivot down

658
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,399
of the range. It's got a pivot down
 

659
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,910
of the range. It's got a pivot down
here. That looks messy. Not something

660
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
here. That looks messy. Not something
 

661
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,269
here. That looks messy. Not something
I'll be touching right now as a day

662
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:57,279
I'll be touching right now as a day
 

663
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,350
I'll be touching right now as a day
trade. Tesla

664
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,360
trade. Tesla
 

665
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,430
trade. Tesla
still in its range. Uh starting to

666
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,440
still in its range. Uh starting to
 

667
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,949
still in its range. Uh starting to
potentially build out more of a base

668
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:02,959
potentially build out more of a base
 

669
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,470
potentially build out more of a base
here now. So, it might have just walked

670
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:04,480
here now. So, it might have just walked
 

671
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,429
here now. So, it might have just walked
this up. Uh didn't lose this shelf. So,

672
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:07,439
this up. Uh didn't lose this shelf. So,
 

673
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,909
this up. Uh didn't lose this shelf. So,
if they can hold 22s, you're looking for

674
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:09,919
if they can hold 22s, you're looking for
 

675
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,189
if they can hold 22s, you're looking for
a drive up to 40s. If they lose 22s,

676
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:13,199
a drive up to 40s. If they lose 22s,
 

677
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,710
a drive up to 40s. If they lose 22s,
probably a flush down to take out those

678
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:14,720
probably a flush down to take out those
 

679
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,510
probably a flush down to take out those
lows at 14s. We can have a quick look at

680
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
lows at 14s. We can have a quick look at
 

681
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,230
lows at 14s. We can have a quick look at
some of the rest of the market. Uh

682
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
some of the rest of the market. Uh
 

683
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,590
some of the rest of the market. Uh
Netflix still waiting to see if we can

684
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
Netflix still waiting to see if we can
 

685
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,350
Netflix still waiting to see if we can
come down into these 70s would be ideal.

686
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
come down into these 70s would be ideal.
 

687
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,429
come down into these 70s would be ideal.
And AMD

688
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
And AMD
 

689
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,270
And AMD
big drive yesterday, earnings on the

690
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
big drive yesterday, earnings on the
 

691
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,710
big drive yesterday, earnings on the
way. Let's see if it takes out these

692
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
way. Let's see if it takes out these
 

693
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,549
way. Let's see if it takes out these
pivot highs. Very, very possible in

694
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:32,559
pivot highs. Very, very possible in
 

695
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,110
pivot highs. Very, very possible in
these markets. Uh Palanteer obviously

696
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,120
these markets. Uh Palanteer obviously
 

697
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,630
these markets. Uh Palanteer obviously
got going this morning off earnings as

698
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:36,640
got going this morning off earnings as
 

699
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,789
got going this morning off earnings as
well, folks. All right, so that should

700
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
well, folks. All right, so that should
 

701
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:45,110
well, folks. All right, so that should
have you pretty much covered.

702
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,120

 

703
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,510

this in.

704
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
this in.
 

705
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,110
this in.
There we go. All right, guys. So, this

706
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,120
There we go. All right, guys. So, this
 

707
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,549
There we go. All right, guys. So, this
is the level that I'm interested in.

708
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
is the level that I'm interested in.
 

709
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,270
is the level that I'm interested in.
This gray box down here, all these boxes

710
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280
This gray box down here, all these boxes
 

711
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,549
This gray box down here, all these boxes
up here. All right. I don't really want

712
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:54,559
up here. All right. I don't really want
 

713
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,070
up here. All right. I don't really want
to trade between this. So, if we come

714
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,080
to trade between this. So, if we come
 

715
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,470
to trade between this. So, if we come
down here and we wash and reclaim, I

716
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
down here and we wash and reclaim, I
 

717
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,310
down here and we wash and reclaim, I
want to get long. If we come down here

718
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,320
want to get long. If we come down here
 

719
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,029
want to get long. If we come down here
and lose this gray box, uh, then there's

720
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:03,039
and lose this gray box, uh, then there's
 

721
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,830
and lose this gray box, uh, then there's
an argument for a drift down to 700s and

722
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:05,840
an argument for a drift down to 700s and
 

723
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,830
an argument for a drift down to 700s and
600s. All right, that's what we are

724
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:07,840
600s. All right, that's what we are
 

725
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,430
600s. All right, that's what we are
looking at here this morning.

726
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440

 

727
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,510

button nice and early so I don't have to
 

733
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:24,150
button nice and early so I don't have to
talk about it anymore.

750
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,080

 

751
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,950

This government, what a joke. What a

This government, what a joke. What a
 

753
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,669
This government, what a joke. What a
joke.

Yeah, that's why that's why the news
disappeared from the calendar.

758
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,200

 

759
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,909

What can you do? Eh,

760
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
What can you do? Eh,
 

761
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,830
What can you do? Eh,
I don't remember time when we went into

762
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:01,840
I don't remember time when we went into
 

763
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,510
I don't remember time when we went into
two potential shutdowns. Hopefully they

764
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:03,520
two potential shutdowns. Hopefully they
 

765
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,710
two potential shutdowns. Hopefully they
they won't um do it as long as last

766
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:06,720
they won't um do it as long as last
 

767
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,029
they won't um do it as long as last
time. It was ridiculous last time. Went

768
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,039
time. It was ridiculous last time. Went
 

769
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,909
time. It was ridiculous last time. Went
on far too long, didn't it?

770
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
on far too long, didn't it?
 

771
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,310
on far too long, didn't it?

looking for a little snap into here and
 

831
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,590
looking for a little snap into here and
then see if we can trap sellers. Ideally

then see if we can trap sellers. Ideally
 

833
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,270
then see if we can trap sellers. Ideally
they come a bit lower than what they are

acceptance over this then technically
speaking we can drift up here. It's not

towards previous day point of control,
 

885
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,190
towards previous day point of control,
previous week point of control. Can we

937
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,669
they come. They're coming for them now.
All right. So, watching ES as well for

938
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:25,679
All right. So, watching ES as well for
 

939
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:39,750
All right. So, watching ES as well for
gap fill potential.

940
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:39,760

 

941
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,909

Getting close.

942
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:41,919
Getting close.
 

943
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:49,669
Getting close.
Starting to per my interest now.

944
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:49,679

 

945
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,230

Nice. Here we go into these areas and

946
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,240
Nice. Here we go into these areas and
 

947
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,149
Nice. Here we go into these areas and
we'll see if we trap down here or even

948
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,159
we'll see if we trap down here or even
 

949
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,870
we'll see if we trap down here or even
under the area. If not, if we stay heavy

950
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:56,880
under the area. If not, if we stay heavy
 

951
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,390
under the area. If not, if we stay heavy
and reject it, I'm happy to play that

952
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,400
and reject it, I'm happy to play that
 

953
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,750
and reject it, I'm happy to play that
short further down.

954
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:03,760

 

955
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,510

Not quite a gap though. QQQ almost

00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,520
Not quite a gap though. QQQ almost
 

957
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,510
Not quite a gap though. QQQ almost
there. Spy not there. VIX has filled it

958
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:07,520
there. Spy not there. VIX has filled it
 

959
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,269
there. Spy not there. VIX has filled it
gap as well. So the uh ES and the SPY

960
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:13,279
gap as well. So the uh ES and the SPY
 

961
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,190
gap as well. So the uh ES and the SPY
relative strength here on this flush

962
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,200
relative strength here on this flush
 

963
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,789
relative strength here on this flush
down right gap now filled PDC now

964
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:18,799
down right gap now filled PDC now
 

965
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,549
down right gap now filled PDC now
tagged. So only thing left previous day

966
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
tagged. So only thing left previous day
 

967
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,310
tagged. So only thing left previous day
value area low and we have this shelf at

968
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
value area low and we have this shelf at
 

969
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,909
value area low and we have this shelf at
the bottom of this gray box. Now do we

970
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:23,919
the bottom of this gray box. Now do we
 

971
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,990
the bottom of this gray box. Now do we
trap under this shelf or are we going to

972
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,000
trap under this shelf or are we going to
 

973
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,990
trap under this shelf or are we going to
fail under and give it back? So there's

974
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,000
fail under and give it back? So there's
 

975
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,269
fail under and give it back? So there's
a couple options here. Either we're

976
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:29,279
a couple options here. Either we're
 

977
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,310
a couple options here. Either we're
going to do we talked about this

978
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,320
going to do we talked about this
 

979
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,669
going to do we talked about this
premarket. We're either going to do one

980
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:31,679
premarket. We're either going to do one
 

981
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,830
premarket. We're either going to do one
of these and a straight flush down or

982
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:33,840
of these and a straight flush down or
 

983
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,590
of these and a straight flush down or
we're going to do some nasty little trap

984
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:35,600
we're going to do some nasty little trap
 

985
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,430
we're going to do some nasty little trap
and do this run back up. I'm happy to

986
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,440
and do this run back up. I'm happy to
 

987
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,029

00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:39,039
play either. I'm just going to let it
 

989

trying to reclaim New York open.

1052
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:11,760

 

1053
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,510

We're just dancing between previous week

1054
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
We're just dancing between previous week
 

1055
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,870
We're just dancing between previous week
point of control and previous day point

1056
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:14,880
point of control and previous day point
 

1057
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,149
point of control and previous day point
of control around here somewhere right

1058
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159
of control around here somewhere right
 

1059
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,310
of control around here somewhere right
now. This is slightly off. I think this

1060
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:18,320
now. This is slightly off. I think this
 

1061
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,110
now. This is slightly off. I think this
is uh what this here 72s

1062
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,120
is uh what this here 72s
 

1063
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,110
is uh what this here 72s
somewhere like that

1064
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,120

 

1065
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,190

and value area low down here. Traps can

1066
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,200
and value area low down here. Traps can
 

1067
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,789
and value area low down here. Traps can
be under here. It can also be a big

1068
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:30,799
be under here. It can also be a big
 

1069
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,029
be under here. It can also be a big
flush down to here if they stay heavy.

1070
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:33,039
flush down to here if they stay heavy.
 

1071
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:41,590
flush down to here if they stay heavy.
So, I'm willing to play both sides.

1072
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,600

 

1073
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,430

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,909
Nvidia selling like crazy. Not really.
It's 0.82% down. That is definitely not

1076
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:45,919
It's 0.82% down. That is definitely not
 

1077
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,590
It's 0.82% down. That is definitely not
selling like crazy.

1078
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:49,600

 

1079
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,870

It's lost 1.54.

1080
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
It's lost 1.54.
 

1081
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,190
It's lost 1.54.
It's uh No, that's not a crazy sale.

1082
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,200
It's uh No, that's not a crazy sale.

Vida can move 10 plus dollars very

1084
00:26:59,669 --> 00:26:59,679

1087
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,470

Okay, still waiting to see if they trap

1088
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,480
Okay, still waiting to see if they trap
 

1089
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,669
Okay, still waiting to see if they trap
or flush low. They're still adding

1090
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:07,679
or flush low. They're still adding
 

1091
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,470
or flush low. They're still adding
liquidity lower at the moment, but maybe

1092
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,480
liquidity lower at the moment, but maybe
 

1093
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,909
liquidity lower at the moment, but maybe
one more flush down before they do

1094
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:11,919
one more flush down before they do
 

1095
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,149
one more flush down before they do
something else with it. Back to this gap

1096
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:14,159
something else with it. Back to this gap
 

1097
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,590
something else with it. Back to this gap
or maybe they come and trade into these

1098
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,600
or maybe they come and trade into these
 

1099
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,190
or maybe they come and trade into these
26s. We do have lots of resting uh

1100
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,200
26s. We do have lots of resting uh
 

1101
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,310
26s. We do have lots of resting uh
orders down there.

1102
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,320
orders down there.
 

1103
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,430
orders down there.
And they're looking for these resting

1104
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:23,440
And they're looking for these resting
 

1105
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,630
And they're looking for these resting
orders into 25s now.

move into previous day value area low.
 

1111
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,950

This is where the traps will live under

1112
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:32,960
This is where the traps will live under
 

1113
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,630
This is where the traps will live under
here. Otherwise, if we stay heavy,

1114
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:34,640
here. Otherwise, if we stay heavy,
 

1115
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,149
here. Otherwise, if we stay heavy,
retest, stay heavy, I will be playing

1116
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:36,159
retest, stay heavy, I will be playing
 

1117
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,549
retest, stay heavy, I will be playing
short side down to 700600. But if we

1118
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:38,559
short side down to 700600. But if we
 

1119
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,230
short side down to 700600. But if we
trap down here, I will be willing to

1120
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,240
trap down here, I will be willing to
 

1121
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,029
trap down here, I will be willing to
look for longs.

1122
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:43,039
look for longs.
 

1123
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,510
look for longs.
Let's see folks. Gap now filled on the

1124

Let's see folks. Gap now filled on the
 

1125
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,669
Let's see folks. Gap now filled on the
ES. Not quite filled on the spiders, but

1126
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:47,679
ES. Not quite filled on the spiders, but

1133
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,750

right into value area low from

00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:57,760
right into value area low from
 

1135
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,430
right into value area low from
yesterday. Okay, so we're watching this

1136
00:27:59,430 --> 00:27:59,440
yesterday. Okay, so we're watching this
 

1137
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,590
yesterday. Okay, so we're watching this
shelf now. Remember, zoom out. If we

1138
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:01,600
shelf now. Remember, zoom out. If we
 

1139
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,510
shelf now. Remember, zoom out. If we
lose this shelf, they can trap. If they

1140
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:05,520
lose this shelf, they can trap. If they
 

1141
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,070
lose this shelf, they can trap. If they
uh if they want to trap down here, they

1142
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,080
uh if they want to trap down here, they
 

1143
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,830
uh if they want to trap down here, they
will. If they want to do, let me draw it

1144
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:09,840
will. If they want to do, let me draw it
 

1145
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,950
will. If they want to do, let me draw it
for the team. Remember, we talked about

1146
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:10,960
for the team. Remember, we talked about
 

1147
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,549
for the team. Remember, we talked about
this pre-market. Please let me draw it

1148
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:12,559
this pre-market. Please let me draw it
 

1149
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,149
this pre-market. Please let me draw it
for the team. I'm running out of time.

1150
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,159
for the team. I'm running out of time.
 

1151
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,510
for the team. I'm running out of time.
All right, the trap will be something

1152
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:15,520
All right, the trap will be something
 

1153
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,909
All right, the trap will be something
like this. The continuation will be a

1154
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:17,919
like this. The continuation will be a
 

1155
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,990
like this. The continuation will be a
fade back down to this. All right, these

1156
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:20,000
fade back down to this. All right, these
 

1157
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,070
fade back down to this. All right, these
are the opportunities right now. If they

1158
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,080
are the opportunities right now. If they
 

1159
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,590
are the opportunities right now. If they
just do a straight flush 100 points

1160
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:23,600
just do a straight flush 100 points
 

1161
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,350
just do a straight flush 100 points
down, there's other rule we can do with

1162
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:25,360
down, there's other rule we can do with
 

1163
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,549
down, there's other rule we can do with
it.

1164
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:28,559

 

1165
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,549

So, see if they trap down here or not.

1166
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:30,559
So, see if they trap down here or not.
 

1167
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,389
So, see if they trap down here or not.
Selling still coming in for now. And

1168
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:32,399
Selling still coming in for now. And
 

1169
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,070
Selling still coming in for now. And
they're adding liquidity lower to 800.

1170
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,080
they're adding liquidity lower to 800.
 

1171
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,430
they're adding liquidity lower to 800.
So, they might want a deeper wash here

1172
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:35,440
So, they might want a deeper wash here
 

1173
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,510
So, they might want a deeper wash here
by the looks of it.

1174
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:41,520

 

1175
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,710

Buyers are trying to step in here. Can

1186
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:55,840
Buyers are trying to step in here. Can
 

1187
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,510
Buyers are trying to step in here. Can
they force a squeeze back up is the

1188
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:57,520
they force a squeeze back up is the
 

1189
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,990
they force a squeeze back up is the
question.

1190
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,000

Buyers need to break 850s really

1198
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,120
Buyers need to break 850s really
 

1199
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,750
Buyers need to break 850s really
otherwise they can be still downside.

1200
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:15,760
otherwise they can be still downside.
 

1201
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,110
otherwise they can be still downside.
They are trying to come in here though.

1202

They are trying to come in here though.
 

1203

The buyers don't think they're doing a
 

1205
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,830
The buyers don't think they're doing a
very good job right now. We're going to

1206
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:19,840
very good job right now. We're going to
 

1207
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,510
very good job right now. We're going to
need to get it above 850 and then we can

1208
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:21,520
need to get it above 850 and then we can
 

1209
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,789
need to get it above 850 and then we can
think about what's what.

1210
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:26,799

 

1211
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,310

SPY filled its gap now. So, we have

1212
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:28,320
SPY filled its gap now. So, we have
 

1213
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,830
SPY filled its gap now. So, we have
efficient markets now.

1214
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:31,840
efficient markets now.
 

1215
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,190
efficient markets now.
What are we going to do? Are we trapping

1216
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,200
What are we going to do? Are we trapping
 

1217
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,789
What are we going to do? Are we trapping
to go back higher or we going to see

1218
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:34,799
to go back higher or we going to see
 

1219
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:40,230
to go back higher or we going to see
that continuation?

1220
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,240

 

1221
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,909

Still adding liquidity at 800s. Think

1222
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:41,919
Still adding liquidity at 800s. Think
 

1223
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,830
Still adding liquidity at 800s. Think
they still want to come into these 800s.

1224
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:43,840
they still want to come into these 800s.
 

1225
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,190
they still want to come into these 800s.
There you go. They're trying to force to

1226
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:45,200
There you go. They're trying to force to
 

1227
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,430
There you go. They're trying to force to
fill these players down at 800s. There

1228
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:47,440
fill these players down at 800s. There
 

1229
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,110
fill these players down at 800s. There
are some old imbalances down there.

1230
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,120
are some old imbalances down there.
 

1231
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,870
are some old imbalances down there.
There are actually some imbalances down

1232
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:50,880
There are actually some imbalances down
 

1233
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,549
There are actually some imbalances down
at 68 and 55 if they really want to go a

1234
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
at 68 and 55 if they really want to go a
 

1235
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,669
at 68 and 55 if they really want to go a
bit deeper down into here. So, how we

1236
00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:57,679
bit deeper down into here. So, how we
 

1237
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,630
bit deeper down into here. So, how we
now in this gray box will be key. If we

1238
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:00,640
now in this gray box will be key. If we
 

1239
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,070
now in this gray box will be key. If we
trap enough shorts down here and the

1240
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,080
trap enough shorts down here and the
 

1241
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,830
trap enough shorts down here and the
buyers come and reclaim, passive buyers

1242
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:03,840
buyers come and reclaim, passive buyers
 

1243
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,830
buyers come and reclaim, passive buyers
step in and reclaim, then you'd expect

1244
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:05,840
step in and reclaim, then you'd expect
 

1245
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,310
step in and reclaim, then you'd expect
an upside move. If we push and fail,

1246
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,320
an upside move. If we push and fail,
 

1247
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,230
an upside move. If we push and fail,
then we're going to expect 700s. So,

1248
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,240
then we're going to expect 700s. So,

00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:37,200
great. And now bookmap can't even keep
 

1403
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,630
great. And now bookmap can't even keep
up the data. Thanks, CME.

1404
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:40,640
up the data. Thanks, CME.
 

1405
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:52,630
up the data. Thanks, CME.
Well, that's useful.

1406
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:52,640

 

1407
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,990

That must have been too quick for the

1408
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,000
That must have been too quick for the
 

1409
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,509
That must have been too quick for the
market because even CME can give me

1410
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:55,519
market because even CME can give me
 

1411
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,590
market because even CME can give me
data. But man, there we go. It's coming

1412
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:57,600
data. But man, there we go. It's coming
 

1413
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,149
data. But man, there we go. It's coming
back now. All right. 725s

1414
00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:02,159

 

1415
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,990

into this gray box like we talked about.

1416
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,000
into this gray box like we talked about.
 

1417
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,389
into this gray box like we talked about.
That is not a retest for me to short.

1418
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:06,399
That is not a retest for me to short.
 

1419
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,710
That is not a retest for me to short.
That is a horrible, horrible move.

1420
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:08,720
That is a horrible, horrible move.
 

1421
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,109
That is a horrible, horrible move.
Nothing I can do with that.

1422
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:11,119
Nothing I can do with that.
 

1423
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,629
Nothing I can do with that.
This would have been nice if they

1424
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:12,639
This would have been nice if they
 

1425
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,149
This would have been nice if they
actually built out some structure. If

1426
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:14,159
actually built out some structure. If
 

1427
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,750
actually built out some structure. If
they build out something like this for

1428
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:15,760
they build out something like this for
 

1429
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,829
they build out something like this for
us to fade down into here, but that is

1430
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:17,839
us to fade down into here, but that is
 

1431
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,190
us to fade down into here, but that is
uh there's nothing I can do with that,

1432
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,200
uh there's nothing I can do with that,
 

1433
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,669
uh there's nothing I can do with that,
folks. No, nothing missed there. That's

1434
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:21,679
folks. No, nothing missed there. That's
 

1435
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:30,149
folks. No, nothing missed there. That's
not a trade setup.

1436
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:30,159

 

1437
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,589

They're still selling this. Still

1438
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:31,599
They're still selling this. Still
 

1439
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,750
They're still selling this. Still
buyers. There's a 200 lot here at 25.

1440
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:33,760
buyers. There's a 200 lot here at 25.
 

1441
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,149
buyers. There's a 200 lot here at 25.
They're still not done with this yet.

1442
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:36,159
They're still not done with this yet.
 

1443
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,669
They're still not done with this yet.
Where did that big seller came in? And

1444
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:37,679
Where did that big seller came in? And
 

1445
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,149
Where did that big seller came in? And
what was his size? 430 lot came in at

1446
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:40,159
what was his size? 430 lot came in at
 

1447
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:48,069
what was his size? 430 lot came in at
75. So that's going to be the level.

1448
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:48,079

 

1449
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,750

That's going to be the level. This is

1450
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:49,760
That's going to be the level. This is
 

1451
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,190
That's going to be the level. This is
the pullback. We can measure this

1452
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,200
the pullback. We can measure this
 

1453
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,069
the pullback. We can measure this
pullback from the low as well. We can

1454
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:54,079
pullback from the low as well. We can
 

1455
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,589
pullback from the low as well. We can
remember this can still be the inverse

1456
00:34:55,589 --> 00:34:55,599
remember this can still be the inverse
 

1457
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,190
remember this can still be the inverse
right shoulder. We're into well 50%

1458
00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,200
right shoulder. We're into well 50%
 

1459
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,630
right shoulder. We're into well 50%
pullback will be all the way down into

1460
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:00,640
pullback will be all the way down into
 

1461
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,910
pullback will be all the way down into
600 still.

1462
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:03,920
600 still.
 

1463
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,430
600 still.
Just make sure you're zoomed out. Think

1464
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:05,440
Just make sure you're zoomed out. Think
 

1465
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,790
Just make sure you're zoomed out. Think
about what we're doing here. We talked

1466
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:06,800
about what we're doing here. We talked
 

1467
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,589
about what we're doing here. We talked
about this this morning. This right

1468
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:09,599
about this this morning. This right
 

1469
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,270
about this this morning. This right
here, okay, we can build out liquidity.

1470
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:13,280
here, okay, we can build out liquidity.
 

1471
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,349
here, okay, we can build out liquidity.
We can wash these guys. If they reclaim

1472
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:15,359
We can wash these guys. If they reclaim
 

1473
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,190
We can wash these guys. If they reclaim
this, we will go higher. It is possible

1474
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:17,200
this, we will go higher. It is possible
 

1475
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,630
this, we will go higher. It is possible
we come right down into this. But this

1476
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:18,640
we come right down into this. But this
 

1477
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,190
we come right down into this. But this
node here is important. We marked it out

1478
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,200
node here is important. We marked it out
 

1479
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,510
node here is important. We marked it out
for a reason. This gray node, this gray

1480
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:23,520
for a reason. This gray node, this gray
 

1481
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,069
for a reason. This gray node, this gray
node, this gray node, this is where

1482
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:26,079
node, this gray node, this is where
 

1483
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,990
node, this gray node, this is where
we're finding a bid right now. We have

1484
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,000
we're finding a bid right now. We have
 

1485
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,190
we're finding a bid right now. We have
not really back tested any key level yet

1486
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:31,200
not really back tested any key level yet
 

1487
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,030
not really back tested any key level yet
for me. We've not back tested anything

1488
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,040
for me. We've not back tested anything
 

1489
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:44,230
for me. We've not back tested anything
yet.

1490
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:44,240

 

1491
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,230

Yeah, it was there was a data issue

1492
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:46,240
Yeah, it was there was a data issue
 

1493
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,190
Yeah, it was there was a data issue
there. Uh, for sure. For sure. On that

1494
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:49,200
there. Uh, for sure. For sure. On that
 

1495
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,589
there. Uh, for sure. For sure. On that
big lot. But when that 400 lot came in,

1496
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:51,599
big lot. But when that 400 lot came in,
 

1497
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,230
big lot. But when that 400 lot came in,
he was 165 lot. He actually chased. He

1498
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,240
he was 165 lot. He actually chased. He
 

1499
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,150
he was 165 lot. He actually chased. He
went 65, 165, 326,

1500
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,160
went 65, 165, 326,
 

1501
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,310
went 65, 165, 326,
and 206. All right. We're coming back to

1502
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:00,320
and 206. All right. We're coming back to
 

1503
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,670
and 206. All right. We're coming back to
where he was. All right. So 73s is the

1504
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:03,680
where he was. All right. So 73s is the
 

1505
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,750
where he was. All right. So 73s is the
level. Watching this. If they start to

1506
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:05,760
level. Watching this. If they start to
 

1507
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,190
level. Watching this. If they start to
reclaim, there's a squeeze and a back

1508
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:07,200
reclaim, there's a squeeze and a back
 

1509
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,589
reclaim, there's a squeeze and a back
test towards the 800s here, which is

1510
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:09,599
test towards the 800s here, which is
 

1511
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,470
test towards the 800s here, which is
what we're starting to do.

1512
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:12,480
what we're starting to do.
 

1513
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,550
what we're starting to do.
Starting to see this lift a little bit.

1514
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:14,560
Starting to see this lift a little bit.
 

1515
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,790
Starting to see this lift a little bit.
Um, so big sellers started to come in

1516
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:16,800
Um, so big sellers started to come in
 

1517
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,870
Um, so big sellers started to come in
here like we talked about the 73s. So if

1518
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:18,880
here like we talked about the 73s. So if
 

1519
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,630
here like we talked about the 73s. So if
they resell, we go lower. If they are

1520
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:20,640
they resell, we go lower. If they are
 

1521
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,710
they resell, we go lower. If they are
done with it, then you'll see a bid back

1522
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:22,720
done with it, then you'll see a bid back
 

1523
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,670
done with it, then you'll see a bid back
up now towards the 800s.

1524
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:25,680
up now towards the 800s.
 

1525
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,589
up now towards the 800s.
So 73s, this is where the sellers came

1526
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:27,599
So 73s, this is where the sellers came
 

1527
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,550
So 73s, this is where the sellers came
in 73s. Where is that? 73s. This is

1528
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:30,560
in 73s. Where is that? 73s. This is
 

1529
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,990
in 73s. Where is that? 73s. This is
where they were owned before. We can see

1530
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,000
where they were owned before. We can see
 

1531
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,630
where they were owned before. We can see
it on map. They started at 73. Well,

1532
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:34,640
it on map. They started at 73. Well,
 

1533
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,790
it on map. They started at 73. Well,
they started at 809's all the way to 73.

1534
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:36,800
they started at 809's all the way to 73.
 

1535
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,150
they started at 809's all the way to 73.
So watching this now for the counter

1536
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,160
So watching this now for the counter
 

1537
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,870
So watching this now for the counter
trend back up. Here we go. moving up

1538
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:40,880
trend back up. Here we go. moving up
 

1539
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,270
trend back up. Here we go. moving up
with this now as we start to drift in

1540
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:43,280
with this now as we start to drift in
 

1541
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,349
with this now as we start to drift in
towards the 800s

1542
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:47,359

 

1543
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,069

and if we start to reclaim buyers got

1544
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:50,079
and if we start to reclaim buyers got
 

1545
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,990
and if we start to reclaim buyers got
trapped to 803s. So if we get through

1546
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:52,000
trapped to 803s. So if we get through
 

1547
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,630
trapped to 803s. So if we get through
803s there'll be a back test of the gray

1548
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:54,640
803s there'll be a back test of the gray
 

1549
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,630
803s there'll be a back test of the gray
box above. So we might well come back up

1550
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:56,640
box above. So we might well come back up
 

1551
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,270
box above. So we might well come back up
into here right 803s is a big level

1552
00:36:59,270 --> 00:36:59,280
into here right 803s is a big level
 

1553
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,349
into here right 803s is a big level
803's right here. If we get through that

1554
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:01,359
803's right here. If we get through that
 

1555
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,710
803's right here. If we get through that
there's a back test of that that we can

1556
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:02,720
there's a back test of that that we can
 

1557
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,630
there's a back test of that that we can
build liquidity out between this or they

1558
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:04,640
build liquidity out between this or they
 

1559
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,470
build liquidity out between this or they
can be extra dirty and have done a 100

1560
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:06,480
can be extra dirty and have done a 100
 

1561
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,870
can be extra dirty and have done a 100
point swipe and reclaim.

1562
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:08,880
point swipe and reclaim.
 

1563
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,030
point swipe and reclaim.
So, longing this at the moment. Small

1564
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,040
So, longing this at the moment. Small
 

1565
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,750
So, longing this at the moment. Small
size. I'm going to use the guy at 54 as

1566
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:13,760
size. I'm going to use the guy at 54 as
 

1567
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,470
size. I'm going to use the guy at 54 as
my stop because he got trapped at 54s.

1568
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:16,480
my stop because he got trapped at 54s.
 

1569
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,790
my stop because he got trapped at 54s.
Here we go. Watching this. It's the

1570
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:18,800
Here we go. Watching this. It's the
 

1571
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,470
Here we go. Watching this. It's the
first time I've been long today. Peeling

1572
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:20,480
first time I've been long today. Peeling
 

1573
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,310
first time I've been long today. Peeling
some off into these 800s in front of

1574
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:22,320

Through the buyers now. This is strong.

1578
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,000
Through the buyers now. This is strong.
 

1579
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,109
Through the buyers now. This is strong.
So, we're watching for previous day

1580
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:29,119
So, we're watching for previous day
 

1581
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,390
So, we're watching for previous day
value air low to see if we find

1582
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:30,400
value air low to see if we find
 

1583
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,470
value air low to see if we find
acceptance back through this now. So,

1584
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:32,480
acceptance back through this now. So,
 

1585
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,550
acceptance back through this now. So,
long from down here. Trimming some into

1586
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:34,560
long from down here. Trimming some into
 

1587
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,950
long from down here. Trimming some into
flow zones through the 83s. We are now

1588
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:36,960
flow zones through the 83s. We are now
 

1589
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,710
flow zones through the 83s. We are now
watching to find if we back test and

1590
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:38,720
watching to find if we back test and
 

1591
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,990
watching to find if we back test and
find acceptance through or not. You can

1592
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:42,000
find acceptance through or not. You can
 

1593
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,150
find acceptance through or not. You can
see where the buyers came in. Right, we

1594
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,160
see where the buyers came in. Right, we
 

1595
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,430
see where the buyers came in. Right, we
want to be careful. This is where the

1596
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:45,440
want to be careful. This is where the
 

1597
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,190
want to be careful. This is where the
buyers came in. Right, we're going to

1598
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:47,200
buyers came in. Right, we're going to
 

1599
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,790
buyers came in. Right, we're going to
sell most of our profits into here. If

1600
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:48,800
sell most of our profits into here. If
 

1601
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,630
sell most of our profits into here. If
we reclaim all this, we've got room to

1602
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:50,640
we reclaim all this, we've got room to
 

1603
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,349
we reclaim all this, we've got room to
go.

1604
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:53,359
go.
 

1605
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,829
go.
So, stuck where those buyers came in.

1606
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:55,839
So, stuck where those buyers came in.
 

1607
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:07,430
So, stuck where those buyers came in.
Peeling most of my profits off there.

1608
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:07,440

 

1609
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,150

Okay, let's see how much we can lift

1610
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,160
Okay, let's see how much we can lift
 

1611
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,349
Okay, let's see how much we can lift
now.

1612
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:13,359

 

1613
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,270

So, I would say sellers are stuck under

1614
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:15,280
So, I would say sellers are stuck under
 

1615
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,710
So, I would say sellers are stuck under
54s. So, as long as buyers protect 54s

1616
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:18,720
54s. So, as long as buyers protect 54s
 

1617
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,870
54s. So, as long as buyers protect 54s
and if they reclaim the 800s, there is

1618
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:20,880
and if they reclaim the 800s, there is
 

1619
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,790
and if they reclaim the 800s, there is
upside shot here. Here's 800s. So, we're

1620
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:24,800
upside shot here. Here's 800s. So, we're
 

1621
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,150
upside shot here. Here's 800s. So, we're
watching for reclaim of previous day

1622
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,160
watching for reclaim of previous day
 

1623
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,470
watching for reclaim of previous day
value area low now

1624
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:30,480

 

1625
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,910

into this gray box. This is the first

1626
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:31,920
into this gray box. This is the first
 

1627
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,589
into this gray box. This is the first
retest of this gray box. So, they can

1628
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:33,599
retest of this gray box. So, they can
 

1629
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,829
retest of this gray box. So, they can
resell up into here. Remember they can

1630
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:35,839
resell up into here. Remember they can
 

1631
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,950
resell up into here. Remember they can
absolutely resell up into here and our

1632
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:38,960
absolutely resell up into here and our
 

1633
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,190
absolutely resell up into here and our
buyers stepping on. This is a big deep

1634
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,200
buyers stepping on. This is a big deep
 

1635
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,190
buyers stepping on. This is a big deep
trap this morning so far and it will

1636
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:43,200
trap this morning so far and it will
 

1637
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,030
trap this morning so far and it will
confirm as a trap if we get over all of

1638
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,040
confirm as a trap if we get over all of
 

1639
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,589
confirm as a trap if we get over all of
this. We can watch VWAP and previous day

1640
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:47,599
this. We can watch VWAP and previous day
 

1641
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:57,190
this. We can watch VWAP and previous day
value area low.

1642
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,200

 

1643
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,349

Come on. Lift it. Lift it. Lift it. Lift

1644
00:38:59,349 --> 00:38:59,359
Come on. Lift it. Lift it. Lift it. Lift
 

1645
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,630
Come on. Lift it. Lift it. Lift it. Lift
it. Watching these flow zones. They

1646
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:00,640
it. Watching these flow zones. They
 

1647
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,069
it. Watching these flow zones. They
might very well resell this area. This

1648
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:02,079
might very well resell this area. This
 

1649
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,310
might very well resell this area. This
is where the big buyers came earlier

1650
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:04,320
is where the big buyers came earlier
 

1651
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,710
is where the big buyers came earlier
where we are now. Uh the next node we

1652
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:06,720
where we are now. Uh the next node we
 

1653
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,870
where we are now. Uh the next node we
got to get through is 8:30. Through 830s

1654
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:08,880
got to get through is 8:30. Through 830s
 

1655
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,950
got to get through is 8:30. Through 830s
we can trade 865s.

1656
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:12,960

 

1657
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,109

So watching 830s they might very well

1658
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:15,119
So watching 830s they might very well
 

1659
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,790
So watching 830s they might very well
reject this. This is where buyers got

1660
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:16,800
reject this. This is where buyers got
 

1661
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,589
reject this. This is where buyers got
caught. I will stay long as as long as

1662
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:19,599
caught. I will stay long as as long as
 

1663
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,670
caught. I will stay long as as long as
we are able to protect 755ish

1664
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:23,680
we are able to protect 755ish
 

1665
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,870
we are able to protect 755ish
under that. I will cut.

1666
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:26,880
under that. I will cut.
 

1667
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,589
under that. I will cut.
There is liquidity lower still. So we

1668
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:29,599
There is liquidity lower still. So we
 

1669
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,510
There is liquidity lower still. So we
haven't pulled back and held yet. So if

1670
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:31,520
haven't pulled back and held yet. So if
 

1671
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,030
haven't pulled back and held yet. So if
they hold anywhere from 76s down to 55s,

1672
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,040
they hold anywhere from 76s down to 55s,
 

1673
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,430
they hold anywhere from 76s down to 55s,
I'll feel good that we might go for a

1674
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:37,440
I'll feel good that we might go for a
 

1675
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,910
I'll feel good that we might go for a
resqueeze here. If they can't hold,

1676
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:39,920
resqueeze here. If they can't hold,
 

1677
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,710
resqueeze here. If they can't hold,
nothing you can do. So there's the tap

1678
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:42,720
nothing you can do. So there's the tap
 

1679
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,910
nothing you can do. So there's the tap
into 76s there or thereabouts.

1680
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:45,920
into 76s there or thereabouts.
 

1681
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,829
into 76s there or thereabouts.
Good hold so far. Back to point of

1682
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:47,839
Good hold so far. Back to point of
 

1683
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,349
Good hold so far. Back to point of
control. We're building out volume down

1684
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:49,359
control. We're building out volume down
 

1685
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,950
control. We're building out volume down
here. We need to find acceptance through

1686
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:50,960
here. We need to find acceptance through
 

1687
00:39:50,960 --> 00:40:02,069
here. We need to find acceptance through
this to drift up into here.

1688
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:02,079

 

1689
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,829

big area here where the buyers got

1690
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:03,839
big area here where the buyers got
 

1691
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,470
big area here where the buyers got
stuck. Can we trade through it? Can we

1692
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:06,480
stuck. Can we trade through it? Can we
 

1693
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:13,270
stuck. Can we trade through it? Can we
start to reclaim

1694
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:13,280

 

1695
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,430

back to 76? Remember 76s to sort of 54s

1696
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:17,440
back to 76? Remember 76s to sort of 54s
 

1697
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,069
back to 76? Remember 76s to sort of 54s
is where buyers will need to hold.

1698
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:20,079
is where buyers will need to hold.
 

1699
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,270
is where buyers will need to hold.
Failing to hold that, we will move

1700
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:21,280
Failing to hold that, we will move
 

1701
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,430
Failing to hold that, we will move
lower.

1702
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:23,440
lower.
 

1703
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,910
lower.
ES back inside its PDC. ES doing a good

1704
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:25,920
ES back inside its PDC. ES doing a good
 

1705
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,670
ES back inside its PDC. ES doing a good
job here. Q's uh slower Microsoft weak

1706
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:29,680
job here. Q's uh slower Microsoft weak
 

1707
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:40,710
job here. Q's uh slower Microsoft weak
today.

1708
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:40,720

 

1709
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,150

To see if we can get back into that gray

1710
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,160
To see if we can get back into that gray
 

1711
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,990
To see if we can get back into that gray
box or not.

1712
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:46,000

 

1713
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,150

Back into these sort of 76s under here.

1714
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
Back into these sort of 76s under here.
 

1715
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,069
Back into these sort of 76s under here.
Probably go 54s for a check. So we have

1716
00:40:50,069 --> 00:40:50,079
Probably go 54s for a check. So we have
 

1717
00:40:50,079 --> 00:41:00,710
Probably go 54s for a check. So we have
to see if they can hold here or not.

1718
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:00,720

 

1719
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,190

76s. So, we've built 76s. Only next

1720
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,200
76s. So, we've built 76s. Only next
 

1721
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,109
76s. So, we've built 76s. Only next
level it can protect now is 54s. Under

1722
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:05,119
level it can protect now is 54s. Under
 

1723
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,630
level it can protect now is 54s. Under
that, there will be a new low of day.

1724
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:06,640
that, there will be a new low of day.
 

1725
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,470
that, there will be a new low of day.
So, coming back down to test those 54s

1726
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:08,480
So, coming back down to test those 54s
 

1727
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,950
So, coming back down to test those 54s
now by the looks of it. Here you go.

1728
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:12,960
now by the looks of it. Here you go.
 

1729
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,390
now by the looks of it. Here you go.
I'm about to be stopped out

1730
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:16,400
I'm about to be stopped out
 

1731
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,910
I'm about to be stopped out
out

1732
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:17,920
out
 

1733
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,510
out
and potentially new low of day here.

1734
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:19,520
and potentially new low of day here.
 

1735
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,430
and potentially new low of day here.
Cannot rule out a new low of day here,

1736
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:21,440
Cannot rule out a new low of day here,
 

1737
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:28,150
Cannot rule out a new low of day here,
folks. cannot rule it out.

1738
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:28,160

 

1739
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,990

If they break under this, then all the

1740
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,000
If they break under this, then all the
 

1741
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,990
If they break under this, then all the
way down here is possible. They break

1742
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,000
way down here is possible. They break
 

1743
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,510
way down here is possible. They break
under this gray box, all the way down

1744
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:33,520
under this gray box, all the way down
 

1745
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,270
under this gray box, all the way down
here. So, I had a go at it. Give it a

1746
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:37,280
here. So, I had a go at it. Give it a
 

1747
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,190
here. So, I had a go at it. Give it a
time to uh settle down for a minute now.

1748
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:41,200
time to uh settle down for a minute now.
 

1749
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,670
time to uh settle down for a minute now.
Staying heavy here, though. QQQ into its

Staying heavy here, though. QQQ into its
 

1751
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,750
Staying heavy here, though. QQQ into its
20day as well. Man, we're right back to

1752
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:45,760
20day as well. Man, we're right back to
 

1753
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,950
20day as well. Man, we're right back to
the mean. This is awful.

1754
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:48,960
the mean. This is awful.
 

1755
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,150
the mean. This is awful.
This is awful. All right. All right.

1756
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,160
This is awful. All right. All right.
 

1757

This is awful. All right. All right.
Well, if they don't hold this node, then

1758
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:52,400
Well, if they don't hold this node, then
 

1759
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,309
Well, if they don't hold this node, then
uh we should drift all the way back down

1760
00:41:54,309 --> 00:41:54,319
uh we should drift all the way back down
 

1761
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,109
uh we should drift all the way back down
to 600. If they've just wicked me out

1762
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:57,119
to 600. If they've just wicked me out
 

1763
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:07,990
to 600. If they've just wicked me out
again, I'm going to be very upset.

1764
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:08,000

 

1765
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,990

Well, you know why you've got that

1766
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:10,000
Well, you know why you've got that
 

1767
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,829
Well, you know why you've got that
wrong? You hate these weird trend days

1768
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:11,839
wrong? You hate these weird trend days
 

1769
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,670
wrong? You hate these weird trend days
with no structure, right? Your your

1770
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:13,680
with no structure, right? Your your
 

1771
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,270
with no structure, right? Your your
first part of you getting that wrong is

1772
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:15,280
first part of you getting that wrong is
 

1773
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,430
first part of you getting that wrong is
the first bit. Trend day. It's We're not

the first bit. Trend day. It's We're not
 

1775
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,910
the first bit. Trend day. It's We're not
in a trend, guys. I don't know how many

1776
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:19,920
in a trend, guys. I don't know how many
 

1777
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,069
in a trend, guys. I don't know how many
times I have to say this on stream. Zoom

1778
00:42:22,069 --> 00:42:22,079
times I have to say this on stream. Zoom
 

1779
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,910
times I have to say this on stream. Zoom
out. Where's the trend? We're in a

1780
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:23,920
out. Where's the trend? We're in a
 

1781
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,910
out. Where's the trend? We're in a
range. We're in a giant range. We've

1782
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:25,920
range. We're in a giant range. We've
 

1783
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,750
range. We're in a giant range. We've
been in a giant range since the 5th of

1784
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:27,760
been in a giant range since the 5th of
 

1785
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,950
been in a giant range since the 5th of
November, right? We're in a giant range.

1786
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:30,960
November, right? We're in a giant range.
 

1787
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,470
November, right? We're in a giant range.
They are protecting these lows. They

1788
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:32,480
They are protecting these lows. They
 

1789
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,470
They are protecting these lows. They
washed me out. Um, from 54s, they traded

1790
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:36,480
washed me out. Um, from 54s, they traded
 

1791
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,190
washed me out. Um, from 54s, they traded
10 points deeper. Buyers are now caught

1792
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:39,200
10 points deeper. Buyers are now caught
 

1793
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,710
10 points deeper. Buyers are now caught
at 85 up to 809. So, I'll wait to see if

1794
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:42,720
at 85 up to 809. So, I'll wait to see if
 

1795
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,270
at 85 up to 809. So, I'll wait to see if
we get back above that. No, I'm not

1796
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:45,280
we get back above that. No, I'm not
 

1797
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,829
we get back above that. No, I'm not
sure, Alli. No, I left the short today.

1798
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:47,839
sure, Alli. No, I left the short today.
 

1799
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,230
sure, Alli. No, I left the short today.
I was waiting to see if we'd offer a

1800
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:50,240
I was waiting to see if we'd offer a
 

1801
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,870
I was waiting to see if we'd offer a
trap long here or here. I took this long

1802
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:52,880
trap long here or here. I took this long
 

1803
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,270
trap long here or here. I took this long
here. I'm out now. I'll wait to see if

1804
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:55,280
here. I'm out now. I'll wait to see if
 

1805
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,710
here. I'm out now. I'll wait to see if
we want to come back into here and

1806
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:56,720
we want to come back into here and
 

1807
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,470
we want to come back into here and
reclaim. If we start offer this squeeze

1808
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:58,480
reclaim. If we start offer this squeeze
 

1809
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,470
reclaim. If we start offer this squeeze
here, I'll look for the longs. If we do

1810
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:00,480
here, I'll look for the longs. If we do
 

1811
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,150
here, I'll look for the longs. If we do
this, there'll be a short back down into

1812
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:02,160
this, there'll be a short back down into
 

1813
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,550
this, there'll be a short back down into
here. I'm watch stalking this now for

1814
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:04,560
here. I'm watch stalking this now for
 

1815
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,270
here. I'm watch stalking this now for
longs. And I think we might very well

1816
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:07,280
longs. And I think we might very well
 

1817
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,950
longs. And I think we might very well
trap today, but we will see. They're

1818
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:08,960
trap today, but we will see. They're
 

1819
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,109
trap today, but we will see. They're
going to have to get back through 85s

1820
00:43:11,109 --> 00:43:11,119
going to have to get back through 85s
 

1821
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:21,670
going to have to get back through 85s
and 810s for me to be interested.

1822
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:21,680

 

1823
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,270

I was willing to play short outside of

1824
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:23,280
I was willing to play short outside of
 

1825
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,430
I was willing to play short outside of
that gray box if we did a nice retest

1826
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:25,440
that gray box if we did a nice retest
 

1827
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,430
that gray box if we did a nice retest
and we didn't. We just didn't. Right. If

1828
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:27,440
and we didn't. We just didn't. Right. If
 

1829
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,589
and we didn't. We just didn't. Right. If
we' done this, I would have been short

1830
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:29,599
we' done this, I would have been short
 

1831
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,510
we' done this, I would have been short
down into here. This was We talked about

1832
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:31,520
down into here. This was We talked about
 

1833
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,750
down into here. This was We talked about
this pre-market, but this I can't short

1834
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:33,760
this pre-market, but this I can't short
 

1835
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,390
this pre-market, but this I can't short
that. I mean, that you can't do anything

1836
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:36,400
that. I mean, that you can't do anything
 

1837
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,030
that. I mean, that you can't do anything
with that. It's like 70 point candle

1838
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:39,040
with that. It's like 70 point candle
 

1839
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,710
with that. It's like 70 point candle
without a retest of anything. There's

1840
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:40,720
without a retest of anything. There's
 

1841
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,550
without a retest of anything. There's
just nothing you can do with it. It's

1842
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:42,560
just nothing you can do with it. It's
 

1843
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,910
just nothing you can do with it. It's
just one of those. That's why I hate

1844
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:43,920
just one of those. That's why I hate
 

1845
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,230
just one of those. That's why I hate
ranges cuz they

1846
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:46,240
ranges cuz they
 

1847
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,750
ranges cuz they
unless you get the very top or very

1848
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:47,760
unless you get the very top or very
 

1849
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,950
unless you get the very top or very
bottom of the range, this is what

1850
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:48,960
bottom of the range, this is what
 

1851
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,270
bottom of the range, this is what
happens.

1852
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:53,280

 

1853
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,950

We're building out a ton of liquidity

1854
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:54,960
We're building out a ton of liquidity
 

1855
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:03,190
We're building out a ton of liquidity
down here. Now,

1856
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:03,200

 

1857
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,710

still building out. This thing is still

1858
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:04,720
still building out. This thing is still
 

1859
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:11,990
still building out. This thing is still
building out.

1860
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:12,000

 

1861
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,990

And it's still got to fill the guy at

1862
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:14,000
And it's still got to fill the guy at
 

1863
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:29,109
And it's still got to fill the guy at
700 164 lot sat down there.

1864
00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:29,119

 

1865
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,870

Delta's in line. There's nothing wrong

1866
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:30,880
Delta's in line. There's nothing wrong
 

1867
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,230
Delta's in line. There's nothing wrong
with the delta. I'm looking at delta on

1868
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:32,240
with the delta. I'm looking at delta on
 

1869
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,430
with the delta. I'm looking at delta on
a five minute. It's uh

1870
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:35,440
a five minute. It's uh
 

1871
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,150
a five minute. It's uh
pretty normal.

1872
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:40,160

 

1873
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,589

Okay, more big sellers coming in.

1874
00:44:41,589 --> 00:44:41,599
Okay, more big sellers coming in.
 

1875
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,109
Okay, more big sellers coming in.
They're trying to get down to 700 by the

1876
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:43,119
They're trying to get down to 700 by the
 

1877
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,510
They're trying to get down to 700 by the
look of it.

1878
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:45,520
look of it.
 

1879
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,870
look of it.
Trying to get down into here. If they

1880
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:46,880
Trying to get down into here. If they
 

1881
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,190
Trying to get down into here. If they
lose this, then we have this all the way

1882
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:49,200
lose this, then we have this all the way
 

1883
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,430
lose this, then we have this all the way
down here. That would be a full rotation

1884
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:51,440
down here. That would be a full rotation
 

1885
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,990
down here. That would be a full rotation
for the second day in a row. Sir,

1886
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:56,000
for the second day in a row. Sir,
 

1887
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,670
for the second day in a row. Sir,
be nice if market makers could make

1888
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:57,680
be nice if market makers could make
 

1889
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,910
be nice if market makers could make
their mind up and move us out of these

1890
00:44:59,910 --> 00:44:59,920
their mind up and move us out of these
 

1891
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,910
their mind up and move us out of these
channels on the daily because I don't

1892
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:01,920
channels on the daily because I don't
 

1893
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,510
channels on the daily because I don't
like trading these edges. So, I'm not

1894
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:05,520
like trading these edges. So, I'm not
 

1895
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,349
like trading these edges. So, I'm not
going to have much to do this year if

1896
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:07,359
going to have much to do this year if
 

1897
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:08,870
going to have much to do this year if
this is all we're going to do. All

1898
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:08,880
this is all we're going to do. All
 

1899
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,630
this is all we're going to do. All
right, back into this gray box. They're

1900
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:10,640
right, back into this gray box. They're
 

1901
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,390
right, back into this gray box. They're
looking for 700. Like I said, there's

1902
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:12,400
looking for 700. Like I said, there's
 

1903
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,670
looking for 700. Like I said, there's
165 lot down here.

1904
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:17,680

 

1905
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,150

Here they come into this guy at 700. If

1906
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:20,160
Here they come into this guy at 700. If
 

1907
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,829
Here they come into this guy at 700. If
they lose this, we have previous week

1908
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:21,839
they lose this, we have previous week
 

1909
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,829
they lose this, we have previous week
close down at 669.

1910
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:25,839
close down at 669.
 

1911
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,069
close down at 669.
Previous week close 669. Previous day

1912
00:45:28,069 --> 00:45:28,079
Previous week close 669. Previous day
 

1913
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,150
Previous week close 669. Previous day
value area low all the way down at 605.

1914
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:30,160
value area low all the way down at 605.
 

1915
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,150
value area low all the way down at 605.
So we would have and then previous week

1916
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:32,160
So we would have and then previous week
 

1917
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,150
So we would have and then previous week
value area low 72. So we would have

1918
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,160
value area low 72. So we would have
 

1919
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,109
value area low 72. So we would have
rotated almost a full week, one full

1920
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:37,119
rotated almost a full week, one full
 

1921
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,349
rotated almost a full week, one full
week yesterday and a full week today as

1922
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:39,359
week yesterday and a full week today as
 

1923
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,870
week yesterday and a full week today as
well. If we get down into these sub600s,

1924
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:42,880
well. If we get down into these sub600s,
 

1925
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,589
well. If we get down into these sub600s,
it's mental. I mean, at least you got

1926
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:45,599
it's mental. I mean, at least you got
 

1927
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,990
it's mental. I mean, at least you got
volatility here. All right, 700

1928
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:48,000
volatility here. All right, 700
 

1929
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,910
volatility here. All right, 700
stacking. 230 lot. They will fill this

1930
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:49,920
stacking. 230 lot. They will fill this
 

1931
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,829
stacking. 230 lot. They will fill this
guy. He's just stacking up here. They

1932
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:51,839
guy. He's just stacking up here. They
 

1933
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,230
guy. He's just stacking up here. They
probably wash through him. Here they go.

1934
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:54,240
probably wash through him. Here they go.
 

1935
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,150
probably wash through him. Here they go.
So, he's just been filled. He's got 100

1936
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:56,160
So, he's just been filled. He's got 100
 

1937
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,430
So, he's just been filled. He's got 100
left. They're going to fill in. There's

1938
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:57,440
left. They're going to fill in. There's
 

1939
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,950
left. They're going to fill in. There's
no way they leave all that. Surely you

1940
00:45:58,950 --> 00:45:58,960
no way they leave all that. Surely you
 

1941
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,349
no way they leave all that. Surely you
don't leave all that. He's rebidding

1942
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:01,359
don't leave all that. He's rebidding
 

1943
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,750
don't leave all that. He's rebidding
here at 700. I cannot imagine they leave

1944
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:03,760
here at 700. I cannot imagine they leave
 

1945
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,589
here at 700. I cannot imagine they leave
all of this. Big big selling coming in

1946
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:05,599
all of this. Big big selling coming in
 

1947
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,069
all of this. Big big selling coming in
down here, folks. and probably going to

1948
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:08,079
down here, folks. and probably going to
 

1949
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,670
down here, folks. and probably going to
get to previous week close if they trade

1950
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:09,680
get to previous week close if they trade
 

1951
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,430
get to previous week close if they trade
under it which was 67 670s

1952
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:13,440
under it which was 67 670s
 

1953
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,589
under it which was 67 670s
this gray line.

1954
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:15,599
this gray line.
 

1955
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,309
this gray line.
So we know massive sellers came in at

1956
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:18,319
So we know massive sellers came in at
 

1957
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:22,309
So we know massive sellers came in at
700. Huge huge huge sellers came in at

1958
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:22,319
700. Huge huge huge sellers came in at
 

1959
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:27,349
700. Huge huge huge sellers came in at
700. Here come the six towards the 670s.

1960
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:27,359

 

1961
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,710

Here's 670s incoming

1962
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:30,720
Here's 670s incoming
 

1963
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,790
Here's 670s incoming
700. the big level if they reclaim that

1964
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:32,800
700. the big level if they reclaim that
 

1965
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,750
700. the big level if they reclaim that
now

1966
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:35,760
now
 

1967
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:44,550
now
and SPY into its 5day

1968
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:44,560

 

1969
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,270

almost into that 670s it's 85s they

1970
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:47,280
almost into that 670s it's 85s they
 

1971
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,870
almost into that 670s it's 85s they
probably should come for 670s now at

1972
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:48,880
probably should come for 670s now at
 

1973
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,430
probably should come for 670s now at
this point I'm kicking myself absolutely

1974
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:51,440
this point I'm kicking myself absolutely
 

1975
00:46:51,440 --> 00:47:00,630
this point I'm kicking myself absolutely
attack

1976
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:00,640

 

1977
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,270

I mean, the daily just looks

1978
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:03,280
I mean, the daily just looks
 

1979
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,750
I mean, the daily just looks
so bad.

1980
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:05,760
so bad.
 

1981
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,309
so bad.
So bad on the daily. It's insane. All

1982
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:08,319
So bad on the daily. It's insane. All
 

1983
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:09,910
So bad on the daily. It's insane. All
right, previous week closed, that gray

1984
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:09,920
right, previous week closed, that gray
 

1985
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,190
right, previous week closed, that gray
line now tagged there or thereabouts.

1986
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:13,200
line now tagged there or thereabouts.
 

1987
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,870
line now tagged there or thereabouts.
There's still liquidity lower. They're

1988
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:14,880
There's still liquidity lower. They're
 

1989
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,910
There's still liquidity lower. They're
still adding liquidity lower right now.

1990
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:17,920
still adding liquidity lower right now.
 

1991
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,870
still adding liquidity lower right now.
This is pretty mad how they're uh

1992
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:20,880
This is pretty mad how they're uh
 

1993
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:28,150
This is pretty mad how they're uh
operating here.

1994
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:28,160

 

1995
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,589

They might come right down into here.

1996
00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:29,599
They might come right down into here.
 

1997
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,069
They might come right down into here.
Edge of current week value. It's mental.

1998
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:34,079
Edge of current week value. It's mental.
 

1999
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,230
Edge of current week value. It's mental.
Oh, should I have faded that pullback?

2000
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:36,240
Oh, should I have faded that pullback?
 

2001
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,550
Oh, should I have faded that pullback?
Maybe. I would have rather faded in

2002
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:38,560
Maybe. I would have rather faded in
 

2003
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,790
Maybe. I would have rather faded in
here. We're missing levels. ES is being

2004
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:40,800
here. We're missing levels. ES is being
 

2005
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,309
here. We're missing levels. ES is being
very, very well behaved by comparison.

2006
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:44,319
very, very well behaved by comparison.
 

2007

very, very well behaved by comparison.
Very, very well behaved.

Don't want to get long in this unless

Don't want to get long in this unless

Don't want to get long in this unless
there's a reaction down here. Not going

2012
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:49,920
there's a reaction down here. Not going
 

2013
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,430
there's a reaction down here. Not going
to trade in no man's land. The reason

2014
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:51,440
to trade in no man's land. The reason
 

2015
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,829
to trade in no man's land. The reason
I'm being patient this morning now just

2016
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:53,839
I'm being patient this morning now just
 

2017
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,230
I'm being patient this morning now just
had that one attack. You have to

2018
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:56,240
had that one attack. You have to
 

2019
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,710
had that one attack. You have to
understand what we are doing here. We

2020
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:58,720
understand what we are doing here. We
 

2021
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,510
understand what we are doing here. We
went straight up. We built liquidity. I

2022
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:01,520
went straight up. We built liquidity. I
 

2023
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,870
went straight up. We built liquidity. I
was waiting to see if they'd trap here

2024
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:02,880
was waiting to see if they'd trap here
 

2025
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,270
was waiting to see if they'd trap here
for the fade. No. I was willing to do a

2026
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:05,280
for the fade. No. I was willing to do a
 

2027
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,109
for the fade. No. I was willing to do a
retest for the fade. No, we've just gone

2028
00:48:07,109 --> 00:48:07,119
retest for the fade. No, we've just gone
 

2029
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,349
retest for the fade. No, we've just gone
straight down. There's not a lot I can

2030
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:09,359
straight down. There's not a lot I can
 

2031
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,109
straight down. There's not a lot I can
do with that, folks. And we're coming

2032
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:11,119
do with that, folks. And we're coming
 

2033
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,910
do with that, folks. And we're coming
back into this node down here now. This

2034
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:13,920
back into this node down here now. This
 

2035
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,309
back into this node down here now. This
edge. If we lose that, then we're just

2036
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:16,319
edge. If we lose that, then we're just
 

2037
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:17,589
edge. If we lose that, then we're just
going to give back everything that we

2038
00:48:17,589 --> 00:48:17,599
going to give back everything that we
 

2039
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,390
going to give back everything that we
did yesterday and more. And if you want

many days I start by telling you we're

00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:31,040
many days I start by telling you we're
 

2051
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,750
many days I start by telling you we're
in sharp, right? And failed breakout,

2052
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:33,760
in sharp, right? And failed breakout,
 

2053
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,510
in sharp, right? And failed breakout,
failed breakdown. This is not a trend.

2054

failed breakdown. This is not a trend.

Any of you are looking for a trend in

Any of you are looking for a trend in

Any of you are looking for a trend in
here, I don't know what you look at when

2058
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:38,640
here, I don't know what you look at when
 

2059
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,549
here, I don't know what you look at when
you look at the screens to identify a

2060
00:48:40,549 --> 00:48:40,559
you look at the screens to identify a
 

2061
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,549
you look at the screens to identify a
trend, but we're certainly not in a

2062
00:48:42,549 --> 00:48:42,559
trend, but we're certainly not in a
 

2063
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,710
trend, but we're certainly not in a
trend. All right. Coming down to

2064
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:44,720
trend. All right. Coming down to
 

2065
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,309
trend. All right. Coming down to
previous week value area low now. Oh,

2066
00:48:48,309 --> 00:48:48,319
previous week value area low now. Oh,
 

2067
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,190
previous week value area low now. Oh,
could I have faded the eights? Probably.

2068
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:51,200
could I have faded the eights? Probably.
 

2069
00:48:51,200 --> 00:49:04,230
could I have faded the eights? Probably.
Probably a could have, would a, should

2070
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:04,240

 

2071
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,230

VIX done to really get going. 17's break

2072
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:06,240
VIX done to really get going. 17's break
 

2073
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,150
VIX done to really get going. 17's break
on VIX will be dangerous. More buyers

2074
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:08,160
on VIX will be dangerous. More buyers
 

2075
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,430
on VIX will be dangerous. More buyers
coming in down here. They might get

2076
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:09,440
coming in down here. They might get
 

2077
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,549
coming in down here. They might get
themselves caught because I don't think

2078
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:10,559
themselves caught because I don't think
 

2079
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,630
themselves caught because I don't think
we're done with it yet. But we're thin

2080
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:12,640
we're done with it yet. But we're thin
 

2081
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,390
we're done with it yet. But we're thin
now all the way back up to here up to

2082
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:14,400
now all the way back up to here up to
 

2083
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:20,549
now all the way back up to here up to
740s.

2084
00:49:20,549 --> 00:49:20,559

 

2085
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,549

So I'll be watching these 600s. There's

2086
00:49:22,549 --> 00:49:22,559
So I'll be watching these 600s. There's
 

2087
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,309
So I'll be watching these 600s. There's
so many imbalances underneath as well

2088
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:26,319
so many imbalances underneath as well
 

2089
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,230
so many imbalances underneath as well
from where we ripped yesterday. There's

2090
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:28,240
from where we ripped yesterday. There's
 

2091
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:39,270
from where we ripped yesterday. There's
so many imbalances down here still.

2092
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:39,280

No bounce to fade. And now we're already

00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:44,079
No bounce to fade. And now we're already
 

2097
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:50,230
No bounce to fade. And now we're already
at target.

2098
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:50,240

 

2099
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,349

Yeah, exactly, Taylor. That's literally

2100
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:53,359
Yeah, exactly, Taylor. That's literally
 

2101
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,829
Yeah, exactly, Taylor. That's literally
exactly it. We've been ranging since

2102
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:55,839
exactly it. We've been ranging since
 

2103
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,549
exactly it. We've been ranging since
November 5th. Basically,

2104
00:49:58,549 --> 00:49:58,559
November 5th. Basically,
 

2105
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,309
November 5th. Basically,
everything since there has just been a

2106
00:50:00,309 --> 00:50:00,319
everything since there has just been a
 

2107
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,030
everything since there has just been a
range build out.

2108
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:03,040
range build out.
 

2109
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,190
range build out.
Okay, so into current week value area

2110
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:05,200
Okay, so into current week value area
 

2111
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,190
Okay, so into current week value area
low developing. Previous week value area

2112
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:07,200
low developing. Previous week value area
 

2113
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:18,549
low developing. Previous week value area
low down here.

2114
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:18,559

 

2115
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,069

Just make sure that's right. Yeah, that

2116
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:20,079
Just make sure that's right. Yeah, that
 

2117
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,230
Just make sure that's right. Yeah, that
is.

2118
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:22,240
is.
 

2119
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,829
is.
So, into the blue box. This would be a

2120
00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:23,839
So, into the blue box. This would be a
 

2121
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,549
So, into the blue box. This would be a
cover point if you took that short from

2122
00:50:26,549 --> 00:50:26,559
cover point if you took that short from
 

2123
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,390
cover point if you took that short from
there. Fair play. That's a That's a big

2124
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:30,400
there. Fair play. That's a That's a big
 

2125
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,150

2127
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,910
trade. That's a big big trade. All
right. We know buyers keep getting stuck

2128
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:33,920
right. We know buyers keep getting stuck
 

2129
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,670
right. We know buyers keep getting stuck
down here into 650s. They're not done

2130
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:35,680
down here into 650s. They're not done
 

2131
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,870
down here into 650s. They're not done
with this, folks. They're coming right

2132
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:36,880
with this, folks. They're coming right
 

2133
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,870
with this, folks. They're coming right
down for that previous week low. There

2134
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:38,880
down for that previous week low. There
 

2135
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,109
down for that previous week low. There
is a ton of imbalances in here like I

2136
00:50:41,109 --> 00:50:41,119
is a ton of imbalances in here like I
 

2137
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,950
is a ton of imbalances in here like I
talked about. So, previous week open

2138
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:42,960
talked about. So, previous week open
 

2139
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,109
talked about. So, previous week open
here into 86s. They are not done with

2140
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:45,119
here into 86s. They are not done with
 

2141
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,109
here into 86s. They are not done with
this. They're just not done with it.

2142
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:49,119
this. They're just not done with it.

Turbo time on the VIX. And I've probably

2148
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:57,839
Turbo time on the VIX. And I've probably
 

2149
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,750
Turbo time on the VIX. And I've probably
lost all opportunity to do something

2150
00:50:59,750 --> 00:50:59,760
lost all opportunity to do something
 

2151
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,309
lost all opportunity to do something
now. Definitely short side. No retest of

this gray box. No retest of this. Just a

2156
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:06,800
straight once they're done with it. At
 

2157
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,710
straight once they're done with it. At
the moment they are selling at like 200

the moment they are selling at like 200
plus points without any form of

2160
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:10,559
plus points without any form of
 

2161
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,630
plus points without any form of
retracement to get involved in. So we're

2162
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:12,640
retracement to get involved in. So we're
 

2163
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,990
retracement to get involved in. So we're
about to hit the last target here.

2164
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:14,000
about to hit the last target here.
 

2165

about to hit the last target here.
Previous week value low. The only thing

2166
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:15,520
Previous week value low. The only thing
 

2167
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,750
Previous week value low. The only thing
you could look at now is 365. So I guess

2168
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:17,760
you could look at now is 365. So I guess
 

2169
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,750
you could look at now is 365. So I guess
there's room for that. But we would now

2170
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:19,760
there's room for that. But we would now
 

2171
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,589
there's room for that. But we would now
be shorting in discount. It's just

2172
00:51:21,589 --> 00:51:21,599
be shorting in discount. It's just
 

2173
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,990
be shorting in discount. It's just
they're taking away my trades right now.

2174
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:24,000
they're taking away my trades right now.
 

2175
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,069
they're taking away my trades right now.

00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:37,750
This is a frustrated man.
Very frustrated man right now.

why I flipping hate ranges when they

Proper structure. Proper structure built

Proper structure. Proper structure built
 

2201

Proper structure. Proper structure built

All right. Into previous week value area
 

2215
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,630
All right. Into previous week value area

Previous week open now tagged. We now

2220
00:52:30,549 --> 00:52:30,559
Previous week open now tagged. We now
 

2221
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,150
Previous week open now tagged. We now
have a liquidity shelf being built out

2222
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:32,160
have a liquidity shelf being built out
 

2223
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,309
have a liquidity shelf being built out
down here. Why does this look so bad

2224
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:34,319
down here. Why does this look so bad
 

2225
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,670
down here. Why does this look so bad
today?

2226
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:37,680

 

2227
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,109

Don't know. But there is a liquidity

2228
00:52:39,109 --> 00:52:39,119
Don't know. But there is a liquidity
 

2229
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,030
Don't know. But there is a liquidity
shelf down here into 59s. I would say

2230
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:41,040
shelf down here into 59s. I would say
 

2231
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,670
shelf down here into 59s. I would say
buyers got trapped 616s and 651s. So

2232
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:43,680
buyers got trapped 616s and 651s. So
 

2233
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,710
buyers got trapped 616s and 651s. So
sellers in control time we're below

00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:46,720
sellers in control time we're below
 

2235

sellers in control time we're below
those areas.

I'm not going to be able to trade. I can

2242
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:56,079
I'm not going to be able to trade. I can
 

2243
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,309
I'm not going to be able to trade. I can
already tell the trades are gone. The

2244
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:58,319
already tell the trades are gone. The
 

2245
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,069
already tell the trades are gone. The
locations have gone. This is going to be

2246
00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:00,079
locations have gone. This is going to be
 

2247
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,069
locations have gone. This is going to be
one of those days I'm going to get

2248
00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:02,079
one of those days I'm going to get
 

2249
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,950
one of those days I'm going to get
nothing. Absolutely nothing.

2250
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:04,960
nothing. Absolutely nothing.
 

2251
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,710

these imbalances. Previous day opens the
 

2257
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:20,790
these imbalances. Previous day opens the
next spot into 30s.

2258
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:20,800

 

2259
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,750

Vix is flying. There is absolutely

2260
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:23,760
Vix is flying. There is absolutely
 

2261
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,950
Vix is flying. There is absolutely
nothing I can do with this.

2262
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:26,960
nothing I can do with this.
 

2263
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:39,349
nothing I can do with this.
Oh my days. My days. my days.

2265
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:49,190

See if they protect 600 here.

2266
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:49,200

 

2267
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,870

Back to 600. If they squeeze through

2268
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:50,880
Back to 600. If they squeeze through
 

2269
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,790
Back to 600. If they squeeze through
this as a lift to 50s potentially.

2270
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:52,800
this as a lift to 50s potentially.
 

2271
00:53:52,800 --> 00:54:03,750
this as a lift to 50s potentially.
Certainly 20s is a level.

2272
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:03,760

 

2273
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,630

Watching 20s here through 20s. If they

2274
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:06,640
Watching 20s here through 20s. If they
 

2275
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:12,950
Watching 20s here through 20s. If they
go through 20s, we're going 50s.

2276
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:12,960

 

2277
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,109

This is a relief. Up we go through the

20s. Piece of this. Can we get to 50s?

2280
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:18,240
20s. Piece of this. Can we get to 50s?
 

2281
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,390
20s. Piece of this. Can we get to 50s?
Here we go. It's where the buyers

2282
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:20,400
Here we go. It's where the buyers
 

2283
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,470
Here we go. It's where the buyers
trapped up here at 50s. So, little scalp

2284
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:22,480
trapped up here at 50s. So, little scalp
 

2285

trapped up here at 50s. So, little scalp
there. It's all I could do, folks.

2286
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:24,960
there. It's all I could do, folks.
 

2287
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,790
there. It's all I could do, folks.
That's all I've got from blue box for a

if we get through 50s, they can lift it
 

2303
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:52,069
if we get through 50s, they can lift it
up through here would be the next spot.

00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,950
did I talk about pre-market? Either
they're going to trap under here and do

2316
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:02,960
they're going to trap under here and do
 

2317
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,670
they're going to trap under here and do
one of these, right? Or we want to see

2318
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:05,680
one of these, right? Or we want to see
 

2319
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,750
one of these, right? Or we want to see
liquidity built out to come down to this

2320
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:07,760
liquidity built out to come down to this
 

2321
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,750
liquidity built out to come down to this
and this, right? And they just didn't

2322
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:09,760
and this, right? And they just didn't
 

2323
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,589
and this, right? And they just didn't
they just didn't offer it to me. They

2324
00:55:11,589 --> 00:55:11,599
they just didn't offer it to me. They
 

2325
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,190
they just didn't offer it to me. They
just didn't offer it. I was ready for

2326
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:13,200
just didn't offer it. I was ready for
 

2327
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,710
just didn't offer it. I was ready for
it. They just didn't offer it.

2328
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:16,720
it. They just didn't offer it.
 

2329
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,790
it. They just didn't offer it.
So, it's just frustrating. That's all it

2330
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:18,800
So, it's just frustrating. That's all it
 

2331
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,470
So, it's just frustrating. That's all it
is. It's not a big deal. It's just

2332
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:20,480
is. It's not a big deal. It's just
 

2333
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,630
is. It's not a big deal. It's just
frustrating.

2334
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:24,640

 

2335
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,630

It's a very dramatic straight down move

2336
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:26,640
It's a very dramatic straight down move
 

2337
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,309
It's a very dramatic straight down move
as well. Might not look like enough, but

2338
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:28,319
as well. Might not look like enough, but
 

2339
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,390
as well. Might not look like enough, but
that's like 200 plus points even from

2340
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:30,400
that's like 200 plus points even from
 

2341
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,109
that's like 200 plus points even from
here to here without any real buildout.

2342
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:33,119
here to here without any real buildout.
 

2343
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,910
here to here without any real buildout.
250 points right into the top of this

2344
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:35,920
250 points right into the top of this
 

2345
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,990
250 points right into the top of this
level then 650. If they lift through

2346
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:38,000
level then 650. If they lift through
 

2347
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,710
level then 650. If they lift through
this, you got value area low into 70s.

2348
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:40,720
this, you got value area low into 70s.
 

2349
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:45,349
this, you got value area low into 70s.
The big level that sellers sold uh is

2350
00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:45,359
The big level that sellers sold uh is
 

2351
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:47,030
The big level that sellers sold uh is
700s.

2352
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:47,040
700s.
 

2353
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:54,069
700s.
There's big big selling into 700s.

2354
00:55:54,069 --> 00:55:54,079

 

2355
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:55,430

Better than nothing. Yeah, I guess it's

2356
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:55,440
Better than nothing. Yeah, I guess it's
 

2357
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,510
Better than nothing. Yeah, I guess it's
better than nothing. It's still It's

2358
00:55:59,510 --> 00:55:59,520
better than nothing. It's still It's

00:56:01,589 --> 00:56:01,599
What you going to do? What you going to
 

2361
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,950
What you going to do? What you going to
do? Not a lot.

2362
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:04,960
do? Not a lot.
 

2363
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,470
do? Not a lot.
Take it on the chin. That's all you can

2364
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:06,480
Take it on the chin. That's all you can
 

2365
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:13,829
Take it on the chin. That's all you can
do. Just take it on the chin.

2366
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:13,839

 

2367
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:15,109

Okay. So, they can't get through the

2368
00:56:15,109 --> 00:56:15,119
Okay. So, they can't get through the
 

2369
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:16,870
Okay. So, they can't get through the
50s. They're reselling this back to that

2370
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:16,880
50s. They're reselling this back to that
 

2371
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,990
50s. They're reselling this back to that
shelf we just had at 600.

2372
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,000
shelf we just had at 600.
 

2373
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,990
shelf we just had at 600.
And if they sell through 600, we still

2374
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:22,000
And if they sell through 600, we still
 

2375
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,750
And if they sell through 600, we still
have imbalances, right? At 62s, at 550s,

2376
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:25,760
have imbalances, right? At 62s, at 550s,
 

2377
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,150
have imbalances, right? At 62s, at 550s,
at 540s, at 530s, there's still

2378
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:28,160
at 540s, at 530s, there's still
 

2379
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,750
at 540s, at 530s, there's still
imbalances and they can still come all

2380
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:29,760
imbalances and they can still come all
 

2381
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,829
imbalances and they can still come all
the way down here.

2382
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:31,839
the way down here.
 

2383
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:33,510
the way down here.
But like I said, I'm not going to short

2384
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:33,520
But like I said, I'm not going to short
 

2385
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,190
But like I said, I'm not going to short
right now because we are right in

2386
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:35,200
right now because we are right in
 

2387
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,750
right now because we are right in
discount, right? We're in discount of

2388
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:37,760
discount, right? We're in discount of
 

2389
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,190
discount, right? We're in discount of
the current week. We're in discount of

2390
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:39,200
the current week. We're in discount of
 

2391
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,549
the current week. We're in discount of
the previous week. I don't want to be

2392
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:40,559
the previous week. I don't want to be
 

2393
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:41,910
the previous week. I don't want to be
short here. I wanted to be short in

2394
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:41,920
short here. I wanted to be short in
 

2395
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,589
short here. I wanted to be short in
premium if it offered me the trade. It

2396
00:56:43,589 --> 00:56:43,599
premium if it offered me the trade. It
 

2397
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,670
premium if it offered me the trade. It
just didn't offer me the trade. Maybe

2398
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:45,680
just didn't offer me the trade. Maybe
 

2399
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:55,030
just didn't offer me the trade. Maybe
mugggin here missed it.

2400
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:55,040

 

2401
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,109

Still going lower this. They still want

2402
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:57,119
Still going lower this. They still want
 

2403
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:05,349
Still going lower this. They still want
lower. They are not done.

2404
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:05,359

 

2405
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,589

I'd say 600 is a big overunder right

2406
00:57:07,589 --> 00:57:07,599
I'd say 600 is a big overunder right
 

2407
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,309
I'd say 600 is a big overunder right
now.

2408
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:10,319
now.
 

2409
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:11,750
now.
There they go. They're going for lower.

2410
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:11,760
There they go. They're going for lower.
 

2411
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,710
There they go. They're going for lower.
They're coming for these imbalances.

2412
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:14,720
They're coming for these imbalances.
 

2413
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,309
They're coming for these imbalances.
There is some excess down here. I think

2414
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:16,319
There is some excess down here. I think
 

2415
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:17,990
There is some excess down here. I think
they're going to increase this excess

2416
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:18,000
they're going to increase this excess
 

2417
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,430
they're going to increase this excess
previous day open maybe into 530s.

2418
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:23,440

 

2419
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,069

Here they come. So, first lot of

2420
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:26,079
Here they come. So, first lot of
 

2421
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,390
Here they come. So, first lot of
imbalances filled. Here they come. 550

2422
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:28,400
imbalances filled. Here they come. 550
 

2423
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,990
imbalances filled. Here they come. 550
is the next imbalance. Then we talked

2424
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:30,000
is the next imbalance. Then we talked
 

2425
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,109
is the next imbalance. Then we talked
about 540s and then 534 and previous day

2426
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:33,119
about 540s and then 534 and previous day
 

2427
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,589
about 540s and then 534 and previous day
open 530s

2428
00:57:35,589 --> 00:57:35,599
open 530s
 

2429
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:37,190
open 530s
and then maybe all the way down in here.

2430
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:37,200
and then maybe all the way down in here.
 

2431
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,630
and then maybe all the way down in here.
You can't rule it out. We're in a big

2432
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:38,640
You can't rule it out. We're in a big
 

2433
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,829
You can't rule it out. We're in a big
big sell day. big big big big big sell

2434
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:41,839

Imbalances is just where the market has

2438
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:47,200
Imbalances is just where the market has
 

2439
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,190
Imbalances is just where the market has
moved too quick. So if we looked left

2440
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:49,200
moved too quick. So if we looked left
 

2441
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,829
moved too quick. So if we looked left
here, see this big flyer from 9:30

yesterday, we're coming back and filling
that in. So all those orders who were

2446
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:55,520
that in. So all those orders who were
 

2447
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,030
that in. So all those orders who were
left there, all the gaps that were left

2448
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:57,040
left there, all the gaps that were left
 

2449
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,390
left there, all the gaps that were left
there, we're filling that in. It's where

2450
00:57:58,390 --> 00:57:58,400
there, we're filling that in. It's where
 

2451
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,630
there, we're filling that in. It's where
price has skipped.

2452
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:00,640
price has skipped.
 

2453
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,589
price has skipped.
Price has skipped through.

2454
00:58:03,589 --> 00:58:03,599
Price has skipped through.
 

2455

Price has skipped through.
Right. Some buyers trying to step up

2456
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:05,040
Right. Some buyers trying to step up
 

2457
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,390
Right. Some buyers trying to step up
here. I still think we probably move

2458
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:06,400
here. I still think we probably move
 

2459
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,309
here. I still think we probably move
lower at this point. Don't think they're

2460
00:58:08,309 --> 00:58:08,319
lower at this point. Don't think they're
 

2461
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:09,750
lower at this point. Don't think they're
done with it.

2462
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:09,760
done with it.
 

2463
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:16,390
done with it.
down here. Maybe

2464
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:16,400

 

2465
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,349

big buyer came in here at 60s, right?

2467
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:22,390
big buyer came in here at 60s, right?
61s. There's a big bar at 61s. So, all

2468
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:22,400
61s. There's a big bar at 61s. So, all
 

2469
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,270
61s. There's a big bar at 61s. So, all
the time he's out of uh placement, let's

2470
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:25,280
the time he's out of uh placement, let's
 

2471
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,750
the time he's out of uh placement, let's
call it. He's in trouble.

2472
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:27,760
call it. He's in trouble.
 

2473
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,829
call it. He's in trouble.
So, if we get back through 61s, then

2474
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:29,839
So, if we get back through 61s, then
 

2475
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,910
So, if we get back through 61s, then
maybe they can visit 70s, but so far

2476
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:31,920
maybe they can visit 70s, but so far
 

2477
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,829
maybe they can visit 70s, but so far
that buyer 61s has been caught. Here's

2478
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:33,839
that buyer 61s has been caught. Here's
 

2479
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:36,549
that buyer 61s has been caught. Here's
the test of that buyer. Still caught so

2480
00:58:36,549 --> 00:58:36,559
the test of that buyer. Still caught so
 

2481
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,789
the test of that buyer. Still caught so
far.

2482
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:38,799
far.
 

2483
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:40,950
far.
Still caught so far. Still caught so

2484
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:40,960
Still caught so far. Still caught so
 

2485
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,789
Still caught so far. Still caught so
far. They're trying to get through him

2486
00:58:42,789 --> 00:58:42,799
far. They're trying to get through him
 

2487
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,710
far. They're trying to get through him
and lift it. Here goes the lift for that

2488
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:44,720
and lift it. Here goes the lift for that
 

2489
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,789
and lift it. Here goes the lift for that
imbalance back to the value area low. We

2490
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:46,799
imbalance back to the value area low. We
 

2491
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:49,270
imbalance back to the value area low. We
might be in here, folks. Let's have a

2492
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:49,280
might be in here, folks. Let's have a
 

2493
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,270
might be in here, folks. Let's have a
look. Can they find acceptance now? Next

2494
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:51,280
look. Can they find acceptance now? Next
 

2495
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,950
look. Can they find acceptance now? Next
level would be to squeeze back up to

2496
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:52,960
level would be to squeeze back up to
 

2497
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,349
level would be to squeeze back up to
600s or 96s. Here we go. Just a small

2498
00:58:57,349 --> 00:58:57,359
600s or 96s. Here we go. Just a small
 

2499
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:02,870
600s or 96s. Here we go. Just a small
counter trend play here through that 60s

2500
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:02,880

 

2501
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,910

and they get up to the 600s,

2502
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:05,920
and they get up to the 600s,
 

2503
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:11,430
and they get up to the 600s,
96s.

2504
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:11,440

 

2505
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,589

back under 61s will mean will mean a new

2506
00:59:13,589 --> 00:59:13,599
back under 61s will mean will mean a new
 

2507
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:17,349
back under 61s will mean will mean a new
low day

2508
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:17,359

 

2509
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:18,789

and they're still adding liquidity at

2510
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:18,799
and they're still adding liquidity at
 

2511
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,950
and they're still adding liquidity at
500s. Okay, they held that well. Can

2512
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:20,960
500s. Okay, they held that well. Can
 

2513
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,510
500s. Okay, they held that well. Can
they lift now to 600s? Very, very

2514
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:23,520
they lift now to 600s? Very, very
 

2515
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,670
they lift now to 600s? Very, very
dangerous play here, but I don't want to

2516
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:25,680
dangerous play here, but I don't want to
 

2517
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:31,430
dangerous play here, but I don't want to
be short at these lows. Here we go.

2518
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:31,440

 

2519
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,549

600's coming. Peel some off in front of

2520
00:59:34,549 --> 00:59:34,559
600's coming. Peel some off in front of
 

2521
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:36,710
600's coming. Peel some off in front of
that.

2522
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:36,720
that.
 

2523
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:42,870
that.
There we go.

2524
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:42,880

 

2525
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,750

There we go. There we go. Lovely. Peel a

2526
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:45,760
There we go. There we go. Lovely. Peel a
 

2527
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,510
There we go. There we go. Lovely. Peel a
bit more. Right. So, if we can lift now,

2528
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:47,520
bit more. Right. So, if we can lift now,
 

2529
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,990
bit more. Right. So, if we can lift now,
we're looking for 36s.

2530
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:50,000
we're looking for 36s.
 

2531
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,589
we're looking for 36s.
They might very well sell this again. We

2532
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:51,599
They might very well sell this again. We
 

2533
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,750
They might very well sell this again. We
got sellside imbalances here at 601 and

2534
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:53,760
got sellside imbalances here at 601 and
 

2535
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,950
got sellside imbalances here at 601 and
611. So, peeling some off

2536
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:56,960
611. So, peeling some off
 

2537
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,950
611. So, peeling some off
and see if we can get through this this

2538
00:59:58,950 --> 00:59:58,960
and see if we can get through this this
 

2539
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,990
and see if we can get through this this
huge move up here on a squeeze if they

2540
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:02,000
huge move up here on a squeeze if they
 

2541
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,150
huge move up here on a squeeze if they
really want to get going. Big if, buts,

2542
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:04,160
really want to get going. Big if, buts,
 

2543
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,549
really want to get going. Big if, buts,
and may. Here's the 600. So this is was

2544
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:06,559
and may. Here's the 600. So this is was
 

2545
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:11,990
and may. Here's the 600. So this is was
the first target

2546
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:12,000

 

2547
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,750

point of control. Now moved down here as

2548
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:13,760
point of control. Now moved down here as
 

2549
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:24,549
point of control. Now moved down here as
well, folks.

2550
01:00:24,549 --> 01:00:24,559

 

2551
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:26,230

Building around the 600. Want to see one

2552
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:26,240
Building around the 600. Want to see one
 

2553
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,470
Building around the 600. Want to see one
more flush be absorbed then I feel

2554
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:28,480
more flush be absorbed then I feel
 

2555
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,630
more flush be absorbed then I feel
pretty good.

2556
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:30,640
pretty good.
 

2557
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,710
pretty good.
No, no flush. Just to resqueeze. They

2558
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:32,720
No, no flush. Just to resqueeze. They
 

2559
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,950
No, no flush. Just to resqueeze. They
keep coming in for these uh imbalances

2560
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:34,960
keep coming in for these uh imbalances
 

2561
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:39,270
keep coming in for these uh imbalances
at 611. So, next lift would be for 50s,

2562
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:39,280
at 611. So, next lift would be for 50s,
 

2563
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,910
at 611. So, next lift would be for 50s,
but I want to see a flush absorbed in

2564
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:41,920
but I want to see a flush absorbed in
 

2565
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:46,230
but I want to see a flush absorbed in
front of uh 560s right now.

2566
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:46,240
front of uh 560s right now.
 

2567
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,710
front of uh 560s right now.
Point of control now is uh just under

2568
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:48,720
Point of control now is uh just under
 

2569
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,910
Point of control now is uh just under
600. So, big battle zone down here. And

2570
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:51,920
600. So, big battle zone down here. And
 

2571
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,910
600. So, big battle zone down here. And
we can potentially squeeze up to 50s

2572
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:53,920
we can potentially squeeze up to 50s
 

2573
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,030
we can potentially squeeze up to 50s
here and then through 50s we can get to

2574
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:57,040
here and then through 50s we can get to
 

2575
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,510
here and then through 50s we can get to
700s. It's still bearish. Remember, the

2576
01:00:59,510 --> 01:00:59,520
700s. It's still bearish. Remember, the
 

2577
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,670
700s. It's still bearish. Remember, the
order flow is very bearish. Just trying

2578
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:01,680
order flow is very bearish. Just trying
 

2579
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,950
order flow is very bearish. Just trying
to play the lift because I don't want to

2580
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:02,960
to play the lift because I don't want to
 

2581
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:10,069
to play the lift because I don't want to
play short down here at these lows.

2582
01:01:10,069 --> 01:01:10,079

 

2583
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,390

Oh, nice, mate. You got 937. Let me have

2584
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:12,400
Oh, nice, mate. You got 937. Let me have
 

2585
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,430
Oh, nice, mate. You got 937. Let me have
a look. 937.

2586
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:17,440

 

2587
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,349

I don't even have Look at the gaps I

2588
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:19,359
I don't even have Look at the gaps I
 

2589
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:21,829
I don't even have Look at the gaps I
have in these charts. Wow.

2590
01:01:21,829 --> 01:01:21,839
have in these charts. Wow.
 

2591
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:23,190
have in these charts. Wow.
So, right at that New York open

2592
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:23,200
So, right at that New York open
 

2593
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,430
So, right at that New York open
basically. Really good, mate. But you

2594
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:25,440
basically. Really good, mate. But you
 

2595
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,349
basically. Really good, mate. But you
you only got 50 points of it. That's

2596
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:27,359
you only got 50 points of it. That's
 

2597
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:32,069
you only got 50 points of it. That's
That's dirty. Sorry about that.

That's dirty. Sorry about that.
 

2599
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:33,829
That's dirty. Sorry about that.
All right, starting to build out a ton

2600
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:33,839
All right, starting to build out a ton
 

2601
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,829
All right, starting to build out a ton
of liquidity down here in this level.

2602
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:35,839
of liquidity down here in this level.
 

2603
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:37,190
of liquidity down here in this level.
This is your overunder. We can still

2604
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:37,200
This is your overunder. We can still
 

2605
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,870
This is your overunder. We can still
break lower. I want you to understand we

If they break under that, I will be out

2634
01:02:12,549 --> 01:02:12,559
If they break under that, I will be out
 

2635
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,470
If they break under that, I will be out

because we will get a new low of day and

Not a bid on the tape here, so we should

Should break. I don't reckon these

01:02:40,789 --> 01:02:40,799
Should break. I don't reckon these
 

2657
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:50,150
Should break. I don't reckon these
passive orders hold up very well.

2658
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:50,160

 

2659
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,150

They're coming for the lows
 

2663
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,349
They're coming for the lows
down into here. possible if we break

2664
01:02:57,349 --> 01:02:57,359
down into here. possible if we break
 

2665
01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:01,030
down into here. possible if we break
this. Now,

2666
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:01,040

 

2667
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,270

there's no lift high enough for me to

2668
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:03,280
there's no lift high enough for me to
 

2669
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:08,789
there's no lift high enough for me to
feel good about shorting at the moment.

2670
01:03:08,789 --> 01:03:08,799

 

2671
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,109

Maybe just me. Just not high enough for

2672
01:03:11,109 --> 01:03:11,119
Maybe just me. Just not high enough for
 

2673
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,510
Maybe just me. Just not high enough for
me to feel good. I need a big shove up.

2674
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:13,520
me to feel good. I need a big shove up.
 

2675
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,109
me to feel good. I need a big shove up.
Good couple hundred points for me to

2676
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:15,119
Good couple hundred points for me to
 

2677
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:16,789
Good couple hundred points for me to
think about shorting back into. All

2678
01:03:16,789 --> 01:03:16,799
think about shorting back into. All
 

2679
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:18,309
think about shorting back into. All
right, next lot of imbalances filled

2680
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:18,319
right, next lot of imbalances filled
 

2681
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:22,390
right, next lot of imbalances filled
again down here.

2682

2683
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,829

All right, so we just tap some of those

2684
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:23,839
All right, so we just tap some of those
 

2685
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:25,430
All right, so we just tap some of those
imbalances straight back to the 60s

2686
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:25,440
imbalances straight back to the 60s
 

2687
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,109
imbalances straight back to the 60s
again. Do they resell the 60s? I'm not

2688
01:03:27,109 --> 01:03:27,119
again. Do they resell the 60s? I'm not
 

2689
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:29,029
again. Do they resell the 60s? I'm not
going to resell the 60s. There's just no

2690
01:03:29,029 --> 01:03:29,039
going to resell the 60s. There's just no
 

2691
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:31,430
going to resell the 60s. There's just no
way I'm selling down here. Far too

2692
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:31,440
way I'm selling down here. Far too
 

2693
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,630
way I'm selling down here. Far too
dangerous. I I think there's a good

2694
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:32,640
dangerous. I I think there's a good
 

2695
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,630
dangerous. I I think there's a good
chance we break lower. I'm just not I

2696
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:34,640
chance we break lower. I'm just not I
 

2697
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,910
chance we break lower. I'm just not I

sellers coming in here at 50s. Buyers

2714

sellers coming in here at 50s. Buyers
 

2715
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,950
sellers coming in here at 50s. Buyers
trapped at 60s. So 50s and 60s big big

2716
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:56,960
trapped at 60s. So 50s and 60s big big
 

2717
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,829
trapped at 60s. So 50s and 60s big big
level now. And they are adding liquidity

2718
01:03:59,829 --> 01:03:59,839

01:04:08,069 --> 01:04:08,079
Previous day open is uh 530. By the way,
 

2725

Previous day open is uh 530. By the way,
ES has already tapped it. Already done

There we go. coming up

2730
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:21,359

 

2731
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:23,910

previous day open now. So it should now

2732
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:23,920
previous day open now. So it should now
 

2733
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,510
previous day open now. So it should now
try and run down into here if they can't

2734
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:25,520
try and run down into here if they can't
 

2735
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:32,230
try and run down into here if they can't
hold previous day open.

2736
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:32,240

 

2737
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,069

Remember 60s is the level where buyers

2738
01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:34,079
Remember 60s is the level where buyers
 

2739
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,910
Remember 60s is the level where buyers
came in. They're currently underwater at

2740
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:35,920
came in. They're currently underwater at
 

2741
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,230
came in. They're currently underwater at
60. Uh 50s is the level where the most

2742
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:38,240
60. Uh 50s is the level where the most
 

2743
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,230
60. Uh 50s is the level where the most
recent seller came in. So back towards

2744
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:40,240
recent seller came in. So back towards
 

2745
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,309
recent seller came in. So back towards
these 60s. If we lift through 60s, then

2746
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:42,319
these 60s. If we lift through 60s, then
 

2747
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:43,990
these 60s. If we lift through 60s, then
we can go back to 600s again. I don't

2748
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:44,000
we can go back to 600s again. I don't
 

2749
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,190
we can go back to 600s again. I don't
know if I'm going to have another go at

2750
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:45,200
know if I'm going to have another go at
 

2751
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,670
know if I'm going to have another go at
this, folks. This feels very heavy on

2752
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:47,680
this, folks. This feels very heavy on
 

2753
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,829
this, folks. This feels very heavy on
the tape. And we've got someone playing

2754
01:04:49,829 --> 01:04:49,839
the tape. And we've got someone playing
 

2755
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:51,510
the tape. And we've got someone playing
games adding liquidity lower and lower

2756
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:51,520
games adding liquidity lower and lower
 

2757
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,430
games adding liquidity lower and lower
and lower and lower and lower each time.

2758
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:53,440
and lower and lower and lower each time.
 

2759
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,630
and lower and lower and lower each time.
So, I don't really want to get caught

2760
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:54,640
So, I don't really want to get caught
 

2761
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,029
So, I don't really want to get caught
the wrong side of it.

2762
01:04:57,029 --> 01:04:57,039
the wrong side of it.
 

2763
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:58,630
the wrong side of it.
Any levels to go short? Yeah, I mean,

2764
01:04:58,630 --> 01:04:58,640
Any levels to go short? Yeah, I mean,
 

2765
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,630
Any levels to go short? Yeah, I mean,
they're all the way up here for me. This

2766
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:00,640
they're all the way up here for me. This
 

2767
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,230
they're all the way up here for me. This
is what I'm saying. I need a lift up. I

2768
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:02,240
is what I'm saying. I need a lift up. I

01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,910
is what I'm saying. I need a lift up. I
want to play a play up here to then

2770
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:03,920
want to play a play up here to then
 

2771
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,150
want to play a play up here to then
reshort down. I don't want to short down

2772
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:06,160
reshort down. I don't want to short down
 

2773
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,589
reshort down. I don't want to short down
at previous week value area low.

2774
01:05:07,589 --> 01:05:07,599
at previous week value area low.
 

2775
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:09,750
at previous week value area low.
Remember, this is deep in discount. It

2776
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:09,760
Remember, this is deep in discount. It
 

2777
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,029
Remember, this is deep in discount. It
seems to be that we're just going to

2778
01:05:11,029 --> 01:05:11,039
seems to be that we're just going to
 

2779
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:12,390
seems to be that we're just going to
keep going lower and lower and lower and

2780
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:12,400
keep going lower and lower and lower and
 

2781
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,309
keep going lower and lower and lower and
lower, but uh I'm definitely not going

2782
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:14,319
lower, but uh I'm definitely not going
 

2783
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,710
lower, but uh I'm definitely not going
to be the guy shorting the previous week

2784
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:16,720
to be the guy shorting the previous week
 

2785
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,750
to be the guy shorting the previous week
value low.

2786
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:19,760
value low.
 

2787
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,190
value low.
So, back to these 60s like we talked

2788
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:21,200
So, back to these 60s like we talked
 

2789
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,710
So, back to these 60s like we talked
about. The buyer keeps getting stuck at

2790
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:22,720
about. The buyer keeps getting stuck at
 

2791
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,069
about. The buyer keeps getting stuck at
these 60s and they cannot get through it

2792
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:26,079
these 60s and they cannot get through it
 

2793
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,990
these 60s and they cannot get through it
and they've just added more liquidity

2794
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:28,000
and they've just added more liquidity
 

2795
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,789
and they've just added more liquidity
again into 25,500.

2796
01:05:30,789 --> 01:05:30,799
again into 25,500.
 

2797
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,150
again into 25,500.
So, it feels like they want to come for

2798
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:32,160
So, it feels like they want to come for
 

2799
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:52,870
So, it feels like they want to come for
500 right now.

2800
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:52,880

 

2801
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,390

See if Vicks pulls back in bases

2802
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:56,400
See if Vicks pulls back in bases
 

2803
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:08,309
See if Vicks pulls back in bases
into 17s here.

2804
01:06:08,309 --> 01:06:08,319

 

2805
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:10,390

60 is still the level still. They can't

2806
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:10,400
60 is still the level still. They can't
 

2807
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,150
60 is still the level still. They can't
get through 60s. Buyers are still stuck

2808
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:12,160
get through 60s. Buyers are still stuck
 

2809
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,910

at these 60s. I've said it a million
 

2811
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,829
at these 60s. I've said it a million
times.

2812
01:06:17,829 --> 01:06:17,839

 

2813
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:21,990

week value low. If we squeeze through

2818
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:24,960
week value low. If we squeeze through
 

2819
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,710
week value low. If we squeeze through
this, I'll think about joining. All

2820
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:26,720
this, I'll think about joining. All
 

2821
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,670
this, I'll think about joining. All
right, small piece joining then. Bucket

2823
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,670
right, small piece joining then. Bucket
into previous week open here. Uh let's

2824
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:31,680
into previous week open here. Uh let's
 

2825
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:37,750
into previous week open here. Uh let's
see if we can go back to VPOX 600.

2826
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:37,760

 

2827
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,190

Can we get into 600 or not?

2828
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:41,200
Can we get into 600 or not?
 

2829
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,510
Can we get into 600 or not?
We are trying. There's a chance of a

2830
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:43,520
We are trying. There's a chance of a
 

2831
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,670
We are trying. There's a chance of a
break here if they start to really start

2832
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:45,680
break here if they start to really start
 

2833
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,829
break here if they start to really start
motoring.

2834
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:47,839
motoring.
 

2835
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:50,230
motoring.
Here's Vpo.

2836
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:50,240
Here's Vpo.
 

2837
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,990
Here's Vpo.
So this is the move into 600 we just

2838
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:52,000
So this is the move into 600 we just
 

2839
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,349
So this is the move into 600 we just
talked about. They've got to get above

2840
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:53,359
talked about. They've got to get above
 

2841
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:54,950
talked about. They've got to get above
all of this, remember, for any of this

2842
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:54,960
all of this, remember, for any of this
 

2843
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,870
all of this, remember, for any of this
to be meaningful. So it's just a scalp

2844
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:56,880
to be meaningful. So it's just a scalp
 

2845
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,750
to be meaningful. So it's just a scalp
until then. The buyer at 500 has stepped

2846
01:06:59,750 --> 01:06:59,760
until then. The buyer at 500 has stepped
 

2847
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,549
until then. The buyer at 500 has stepped
up a little bit into 525. He's added a

2848
01:07:02,549 --> 01:07:02,559
up a little bit into 525. He's added a
 

2849
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:06,470
up a little bit into 525. He's added a
400 lot there now.

2850
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:06,480
400 lot there now.
 

2851
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,470
400 lot there now.
Anything long here is counter trend uh

2852
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:08,480
Anything long here is counter trend uh
 

2853
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,270
Anything long here is counter trend uh
on the day.

2854
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:11,280
on the day.
 

2855
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,510
on the day.
Sellers are stuck under 550 right now.

2856
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:13,520
Sellers are stuck under 550 right now.
 

2857
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,150
Sellers are stuck under 550 right now.
Buyers came in at 560. So you'd want 560

2858
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:16,160
Buyers came in at 560. So you'd want 560
 

2859
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,750
Buyers came in at 560. So you'd want 560
550 to hold if you're going to hold any

2860
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:17,760
550 to hold if you're going to hold any
 

2861
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,190
550 to hold if you're going to hold any
long position here. I'd be very

2862
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:19,200
long position here. I'd be very
 

2863
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,309
long position here. I'd be very
skeptical about holding. Very skeptical.

2864
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:22,319
skeptical about holding. Very skeptical.
 

2865

60s and 50s is the level, right? 60s is

01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:31,199
guys are flashing and pulling. Look at
 

2921
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:32,229
guys are flashing and pulling. Look at
this on the tape. I don't know if

2922
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:32,239
this on the tape. I don't know if
 

2923
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:33,990
this on the tape. I don't know if
anyone's watching the book map. This is

2924
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:34,000
anyone's watching the book map. This is
 

2925
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:40,149
anyone's watching the book map. This is
ridiculous what's going on here.

2926
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:40,159

 

2927
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:42,630

Remember, we are in a uh cell right now

2928
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:42,640
Remember, we are in a uh cell right now
 

2929
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,470
Remember, we are in a uh cell right now
and we are starting to lose this blue

2930
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:44,480
and we are starting to lose this blue
 

2931
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,829
and we are starting to lose this blue
box. We want to be careful because this

2932
01:08:45,829 --> 01:08:45,839
box. We want to be careful because this
 

2933
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:48,630
box. We want to be careful because this
will turn red if we don't can't like

2934
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:48,640
will turn red if we don't can't like
 

2935
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:53,110
will turn red if we don't can't like
reclaim it.

2936
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:53,120

 

2937
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,910

There is a 400 lot at 520. So I'm very

2938
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:55,920
There is a 400 lot at 520. So I'm very
 

2939
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,590
There is a 400 lot at 520. So I'm very
very aware of that. Okay, back to

2940
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:57,600
very aware of that. Okay, back to
 

2941
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,590
very aware of that. Okay, back to
previous week value area low again. VPO

2942
01:08:59,590 --> 01:08:59,600
previous week value area low again. VPO
 

2943
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,070
previous week value area low again. VPO
on the day is up at 600. We really don't

2944
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:02,080
on the day is up at 600. We really don't
 

2945
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,590
on the day is up at 600. We really don't
get too much strength for a counter

2946
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:03,600
get too much strength for a counter
 

2947
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,309
get too much strength for a counter
trend move until we get above 600. And

2948
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:06,319
trend move until we get above 600. And
 

2949
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:09,189
trend move until we get above 600. And
this big seller coming back in here. 123

2950
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:09,199
this big seller coming back in here. 123
 

2951
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:11,349
this big seller coming back in here. 123
lot. He's adding 155 lot. He's adding

2952
01:09:11,349 --> 01:09:11,359
lot. He's adding 155 lot. He's adding
 

2953
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:13,430
lot. He's adding 155 lot. He's adding
another 50 lot. He's trying to force us

2954
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:13,440
another 50 lot. He's trying to force us
 

2955
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,590
another 50 lot. He's trying to force us
down under the 60s to get to the 50s

2956
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:15,600
down under the 60s to get to the 50s
 

2957
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,149
down under the 60s to get to the 50s
that he wants. Um, we all know there's a

2958
01:09:18,149 --> 01:09:18,159
that he wants. Um, we all know there's a
 

2959
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:21,110
that he wants. Um, we all know there's a
400 lot at 520 and I would not be

2960
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:21,120
400 lot at 520 and I would not be
 

2961
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,550
400 lot at 520 and I would not be
surprised if they pull it given what

2962
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:22,560
surprised if they pull it given what
 

2963
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,229
surprised if they pull it given what
I've seen so far this morning.

2964
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:26,239
I've seen so far this morning.
 

2965
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:27,829
I've seen so far this morning.
Could I say what what I'm seeing on

2966
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:27,839
Could I say what what I'm seeing on
 

2967
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:31,189
Could I say what what I'm seeing on
bookmap? Yeah, the horizontal lines of

2968
01:09:31,189 --> 01:09:31,199
bookmap? Yeah, the horizontal lines of
 

2969
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:33,269
bookmap? Yeah, the horizontal lines of
these big orders being literally flashed

2970
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:33,279
these big orders being literally flashed
 

2971
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,430
these big orders being literally flashed
on and pulled and flashed on and pulled

2972
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:35,440
on and pulled and flashed on and pulled
 

2973
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,510
on and pulled and flashed on and pulled
and flashed on and pulled. It's people

2974
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:37,520
and flashed on and pulled. It's people
 

2975
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,309
and flashed on and pulled. It's people
spoofing the tape with big size. It's

2976
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:40,319
spoofing the tape with big size. It's
 

2977
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:41,910
spoofing the tape with big size. It's
not a joke. There you go. It flashed at

2978
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:41,920
not a joke. There you go. It flashed at
 

2979
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,430
not a joke. There you go. It flashed at
80, pulled, and they've all come back on

2980
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:43,440
80, pulled, and they've all come back on
 

2981
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,070
80, pulled, and they've all come back on
the books all of a sudden. At 70, 75,

2982
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:46,080
the books all of a sudden. At 70, 75,
 

2983
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,749
the books all of a sudden. At 70, 75,
80, and 90, they're now trying to lift

2984
01:09:47,749 --> 01:09:47,759
80, and 90, they're now trying to lift
 

2985
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,309
80, and 90, they're now trying to lift
through to get to the 600, and you're

2986
01:09:50,309 --> 01:09:50,319
through to get to the 600, and you're
 

2987
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,590
through to get to the 600, and you're
starting to see it try and pull

2988
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:51,600
starting to see it try and pull
 

2989
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,149
starting to see it try and pull
underneath. So, they're flashing 65, 60,

2990
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:54,159
underneath. So, they're flashing 65, 60,
 

2991
01:09:54,159 --> 01:09:56,149
underneath. So, they're flashing 65, 60,
55. They're trying to step on the tape.

2992
01:09:56,149 --> 01:09:56,159
55. They're trying to step on the tape.
 

2993
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:57,510
55. They're trying to step on the tape.
And now they just pulled a lot. And then

2994
01:09:57,510 --> 01:09:57,520
And now they just pulled a lot. And then
 

2995
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,950
And now they just pulled a lot. And then
they came back on, and then they pulled

2996
01:09:58,950 --> 01:09:58,960
they came back on, and then they pulled
 

2997
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,470
they came back on, and then they pulled
a lot. Now they're back on again. And

2998
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:00,480
a lot. Now they're back on again. And
 

2999
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,750
a lot. Now they're back on again. And
now we're going 80s. Now they're going

3000
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:01,760
now we're going 80s. Now they're going
 

3001
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,910
now we're going 80s. Now they're going
to try and lift to get to 600s. So, they

3002
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:03,920
to try and lift to get to 600s. So, they
 

3003
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:09,510
to try and lift to get to 600s. So, they
are playing games in this area.

3004
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:09,520

 

3005
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,590

strength will come above 600. All right,

3006
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:11,600
strength will come above 600. All right,
 

3007
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,830
strength will come above 600. All right,
strength will come above 600.

3008
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:15,840

 

3009
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,790

But like if we look uh here

3010
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:20,800
But like if we look uh here
 

3011
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,350
But like if we look uh here
all these imbalances upside you can see

3012
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:23,360
all these imbalances upside you can see
 

3013
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,390
all these imbalances upside you can see
they keep trying to hold this right they

3014
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:26,400
they keep trying to hold this right they
 

3015
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,390
they keep trying to hold this right they
keep trying to bid around here. If we

3016
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:28,400
keep trying to bid around here. If we
 

3017
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,310
keep trying to bid around here. If we
can get back above the 600 there is an

3018
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:30,320
can get back above the 600 there is an
 

3019
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,390
can get back above the 600 there is an
imbalance up here to fill and then tons

3020
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:32,400
imbalance up here to fill and then tons
 

3021
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,229
imbalance up here to fill and then tons
higher. So watching this now for

3022
01:10:34,229 --> 01:10:34,239
higher. So watching this now for
 

3023
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,790
higher. So watching this now for
triggers. Here we go. Here's Vpo on the

3024
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:36,800
triggers. Here we go. Here's Vpo on the
 

3025
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,110
triggers. Here we go. Here's Vpo on the
day. Rejected VPO straight away on that

3026
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:39,120
day. Rejected VPO straight away on that
 

3027
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,189
day. Rejected VPO straight away on that
first drive. A break over 600 and we can

3028
01:10:41,189 --> 01:10:41,199
first drive. A break over 600 and we can
 

3029
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:42,950
first drive. A break over 600 and we can
get going. 612s is an important level.

3030
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:42,960
get going. 612s is an important level.
 

3031
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,790
get going. 612s is an important level.
We have an imbalance there. If we get

3032
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:44,800
We have an imbalance there. If we get
 

3033
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,990
We have an imbalance there. If we get
through that, we can really start

3034
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:46,000
through that, we can really start
 

3035
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,149
through that, we can really start
motoring up to sort of 650s through

3036
01:10:48,149 --> 01:10:48,159
motoring up to sort of 650s through
 

3037
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:50,790
motoring up to sort of 650s through
that. We are thin up to 750. So, I'm

3038
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:50,800
that. We are thin up to 750. So, I'm
 

3039
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,950
that. We are thin up to 750. So, I'm
watching because we might there is a

3040
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:52,960
watching because we might there is a
 

3041
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,350
watching because we might there is a
chance there is a chance we've repriced

3042
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:55,360
chance there is a chance we've repriced
 

3043
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,750
chance there is a chance we've repriced
to 750s because we haven't had a bid up

3044
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:57,760
to 750s because we haven't had a bid up
 

3045
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:02,390
to 750s because we haven't had a bid up
yet.

3046
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:02,400

 

3047
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,630

So, they keep testing VPO here into

3048
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:04,640
So, they keep testing VPO here into
 

3049
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,830
So, they keep testing VPO here into
600s. Here we go. Can they lift this now

3050
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:07,840
600s. Here we go. Can they lift this now
 

3051
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,669
600s. Here we go. Can they lift this now
through 600 650 and then go 750s?

3052
01:11:11,669 --> 01:11:11,679
through 600 650 and then go 750s?
 

3053
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:16,070
through 600 650 and then go 750s?
Is 600 600 600 600 600 big big level

3054
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:16,080
Is 600 600 600 600 600 big big level
 

3055
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,750
Is 600 600 600 600 600 big big level
here.

3056
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:17,760
here.
 

3057
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:25,910
here.
Yes, please.

3058
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:25,920

 

3059
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,510

You see this edge here of this blue box

3060
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:27,520
You see this edge here of this blue box
 

3061
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,910
You see this edge here of this blue box
is a massive level. So, what they would

3062
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:29,920
is a massive level. So, what they would
 

3063
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,189
is a massive level. So, what they would
need to do if they're going to lift,

3064
01:11:31,189 --> 01:11:31,199
need to do if they're going to lift,
 

3065
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:32,790
need to do if they're going to lift,
they're going to need to do this. All

3066
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:32,800
they're going to need to do this. All
 

3067
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,870
they're going to need to do this. All
right? Otherwise, this can still be

3068
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:34,880
right? Otherwise, this can still be
 

3069
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,189
right? Otherwise, this can still be
built out to get down into this. This

3070
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:37,199
built out to get down into this. This
 

3071
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:47,590
built out to get down into this. This
what you have to be aware of.

3072
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:47,600

 

3073
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,870

Big level here, folks. Big big big level

3074
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:50,880
Big level here, folks. Big big big level
 

3075
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,229
Big level here, folks. Big big big level
here. Oh, can they build above these

3076
01:11:54,229 --> 01:11:54,239
here. Oh, can they build above these
 

3077
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:59,270
here. Oh, can they build above these
flow zones and start to curl?

3078
01:11:59,270 --> 01:11:59,280

 

3079
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:05,590

Sellers keep coming in here at 90s.

3080
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:05,600

 

3081
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,189

Still haven't filled this 400 lot,

3082
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:07,199
Still haven't filled this 400 lot,
 

3083
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,430
Still haven't filled this 400 lot,
remember at 520. I'm still going to wait

3084
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:09,440
remember at 520. I'm still going to wait
 

3085
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,910
remember at 520. I'm still going to wait
and see if we can break out and above.

3086
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:11,920
and see if we can break out and above.
 

3087
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,390
and see if we can break out and above.
See, this is the problem. No follow

3088
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:14,400
See, this is the problem. No follow
 

3089
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,709
See, this is the problem. No follow
through over 600. This is why we wait.

3090
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:18,719
through over 600. This is why we wait.
 

3091
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:20,790
through over 600. This is why we wait.
Sellers just come flying in here at 80

3092
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:20,800
Sellers just come flying in here at 80
 

3093
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,070
Sellers just come flying in here at 80
now, stacking up 100 lots, trying to

3094
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:24,080
now, stacking up 100 lots, trying to
 

3095
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:27,669
now, stacking up 100 lots, trying to
force us down. I guarantee you, I

3096
01:12:27,669 --> 01:12:27,679
force us down. I guarantee you, I
 

3097
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:29,110
force us down. I guarantee you, I
guarantee it, but I reckon this guy at

3098
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:29,120
guarantee it, but I reckon this guy at
 

3099
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,870
guarantee it, but I reckon this guy at
520 pulls his order. I reckon it's all

3100
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:30,880
520 pulls his order. I reckon it's all
 

3101
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,310
520 pulls his order. I reckon it's all
[\h__\h] and they're going to trade

3102
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:32,320
[\h__\h] and they're going to trade
 

3103
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,149
[\h__\h] and they're going to trade
right down into this. That's what I

3104
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:34,159
right down into this. That's what I
 

3105
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:36,709
right down into this. That's what I
reckon.

3106
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:36,719
reckon.
 

3107
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,790
reckon.
Look at these guys.

3108
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:38,800
Look at these guys.
 

3109
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:57,189
Look at these guys.
What is this down here?

3110
01:12:57,189 --> 01:12:57,199

 

3111
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:59,030

20's coming. There you go. Let's see if

3112
01:12:59,030 --> 01:12:59,040
20's coming. There you go. Let's see if
 

3113
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,590
20's coming. There you go. Let's see if
he spoofs or not, though. Back into

3114
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:01,600
he spoofs or not, though. Back into
 

3115
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,149
he spoofs or not, though. Back into
where these sellers came in at 50s. So,

3116
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:04,159
where these sellers came in at 50s. So,
 

3117
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:06,149
where these sellers came in at 50s. So,
same story. I I would not be surprised

3118
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:06,159
same story. I I would not be surprised
 

3119
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:07,590
same story. I I would not be surprised
to see us come down here at this point.

3120
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:07,600
to see us come down here at this point.
 

3121
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,189
to see us come down here at this point.
I don't like how we're building out

3122
01:13:09,189 --> 01:13:09,199
I don't like how we're building out
 

3123
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:11,030
I don't like how we're building out
liquidity, though. It's very dangerous

3124
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:11,040
liquidity, though. It's very dangerous
 

3125
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,110
liquidity, though. It's very dangerous
how we're building out liquidity, but it

3126
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:13,120
how we're building out liquidity, but it
 

3127
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,709
how we're building out liquidity, but it
would not surprise me to see us break

3128
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:14,719
would not surprise me to see us break
 

3129
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:27,510
would not surprise me to see us break
now.

3130
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:27,520

 

3131
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,590

520s is what they're looking for. Big

3132
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:29,600
520s is what they're looking for. Big
 

3133
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,990
520s is what they're looking for. Big
player there at 520s.

3134
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:32,000
player there at 520s.
 

3135
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,189
player there at 520s.
Let's see. I'm just waiting to see if

3136
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:33,199
Let's see. I'm just waiting to see if
 

3137
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:35,350
Let's see. I'm just waiting to see if
he's real.

3138
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:35,360
he's real.
 

3139
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:38,310
he's real.
Is there anyone underneath him? Yep,

3140
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:38,320
Is there anyone underneath him? Yep,
 

3141
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:42,709
Is there anyone underneath him? Yep,
there is. 520s and 500s.

3142
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:42,719
there is. 520s and 500s.
 

3143
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:44,470
there is. 520s and 500s.
Very bearish, guys. Here's the 20s.

3144
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:44,480
Very bearish, guys. Here's the 20s.
 

3145
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,189
Very bearish, guys. Here's the 20s.
Look. Pulled. Gone.

3146
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:47,199
Look. Pulled. Gone.
 

3147
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:51,990
Look. Pulled. Gone.
[\h__\h] [\h__\h]

3148
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:52,000

 

3149
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:58,229

[\h__\h] Knew it. Just [\h__\h] knew it.

3150
01:13:58,229 --> 01:13:58,239

 

3151
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:01,990

Knew it. Might go 25,000. Uh I don't

3152
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:02,000
Knew it. Might go 25,000. Uh I don't
 

3153
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,550
Knew it. Might go 25,000. Uh I don't
think so, mate. I don't think so. It

3154
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:04,560
think so, mate. I don't think so. It
 

3155
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,870
think so, mate. I don't think so. It
Well, I mean, you're talking about a

3156
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:06,880
Well, I mean, you're talking about a
 

3157
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,270
Well, I mean, you're talking about a
move beyond way beyond two sigma to do

3158
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:09,280
move beyond way beyond two sigma to do
 

3159
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,430
move beyond way beyond two sigma to do
that to do it in one day. I mean, it's

3160
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:11,440
that to do it in one day. I mean, it's
 

3161
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,590
that to do it in one day. I mean, it's
possible. You can't rule it out with how

3162
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:13,600
possible. You can't rule it out with how
 

3163
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,390
possible. You can't rule it out with how
the tape looks, I guess. Um, but I think

3164
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:16,400
the tape looks, I guess. Um, but I think
 

3165
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,310
the tape looks, I guess. Um, but I think
more let's just talk about one level at

3166
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:18,320
more let's just talk about one level at
 

3167
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,470
more let's just talk about one level at
a time before we talk about 25,000. This

3168
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:20,480
a time before we talk about 25,000. This
 

3169
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,630
a time before we talk about 25,000. This
is the next block, right? So, this is

3170
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:22,640
is the next block, right? So, this is
 

3171
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,070
is the next block, right? So, this is
where it wants to trade into at the

3172
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:24,080
where it wants to trade into at the
 

3173
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,310
where it wants to trade into at the
moment. 25,000. You're going to if

3174
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:26,320
moment. 25,000. You're going to if
 

3175
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,229
moment. 25,000. You're going to if
you're looking for 25,000, you're asking

3176
01:14:28,229 --> 01:14:28,239
you're looking for 25,000, you're asking
 

3177
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:31,669
you're looking for 25,000, you're asking
for it to do a huge move.

3178
01:14:31,669 --> 01:14:31,679
for it to do a huge move.
 

3179
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:32,950
for it to do a huge move.
All right? And you're not going to

3180
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:32,960
All right? And you're not going to
 

3181
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,430
All right? And you're not going to
respect.

3182
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:35,440
respect.
 

3183
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:38,470
respect.
Right?

3184
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:38,480

 

3185
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,430

This is the rotation to get to 25,000.

3186
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:41,440
This is the rotation to get to 25,000.
 

3187
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,030
This is the rotation to get to 25,000.
You're asking it to come underneath the

3188
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:43,040
You're asking it to come underneath the
 

3189
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,790
You're asking it to come underneath the
Ballinger bands and sweep everything

3190
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:44,800
Ballinger bands and sweep everything
 

3191
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,510
Ballinger bands and sweep everything
out. It's possible, but it's asking an

3192
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:47,520
out. It's possible, but it's asking an
 

3193
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,790
out. It's possible, but it's asking an
awful lot of it to do that in one day.

3194
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:50,800
awful lot of it to do that in one day.
 

3195
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,310
awful lot of it to do that in one day.
All right, here's the break. So, again,

3196
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:52,320
All right, here's the break. So, again,
 

3197
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,149
All right, here's the break. So, again,
we didn't build nice structure really

3198
01:14:54,149 --> 01:14:54,159
we didn't build nice structure really
 

3199
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:56,310
we didn't build nice structure really
here, but

3200
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:56,320
here, but
 

3201
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,630
here, but
would have liked a squeeze up to be sold

3202
01:14:58,630 --> 01:14:58,640
would have liked a squeeze up to be sold
 

3203
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,390
would have liked a squeeze up to be sold
into for me to get a uh better location

3204
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:02,400
into for me to get a uh better location
 

3205
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,229
into for me to get a uh better location
to get short rather than trying to short

3206
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:04,239
to get short rather than trying to short
 

3207
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,070
to get short rather than trying to short
lows to go lower, but it is what it is.

3208
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:06,080
lows to go lower, but it is what it is.
 

3209
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,830
lows to go lower, but it is what it is.
We are in panic mode right now by the

3210
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:07,840
We are in panic mode right now by the
 

3211
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,709
We are in panic mode right now by the
looks of it.

3212
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:12,719

 

3213
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,709

It's about previous day low. Yeah, right

3214
01:15:14,709 --> 01:15:14,719
It's about previous day low. Yeah, right
 

3215
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,110
It's about previous day low. Yeah, right
here. It's what I keep saying right

3216
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:17,120
here. It's what I keep saying right
 

3217
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:22,709
here. It's what I keep saying right

Okay. Okay, so coming to retest this. If

3250
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:08,800
Okay. Okay, so coming to retest this. If
 

3251
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,550
Okay. Okay, so coming to retest this. If
they stay heavy here, they will reject

3252
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:10,560
they stay heavy here, they will reject
 

3253
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,310
they stay heavy here, they will reject
and come down for this. If they reclaim

3254
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:12,320
and come down for this. If they reclaim
 

3255
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,910
and come down for this. If they reclaim
it, these are your options. Now, if

3256
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:13,920
it, these are your options. Now, if
 

3257
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,270
it, these are your options. Now, if
you're adamant on playing the short, you

3258
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:15,280
you're adamant on playing the short, you
 

3259
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,630
you're adamant on playing the short, you
can look for that. If they reclaim this,

3260
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:16,640
can look for that. If they reclaim this,
 

3261
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,430
can look for that. If they reclaim this,
there is a bigger squeeze up.

3262
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:19,440
there is a bigger squeeze up.
 

3263
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,510
there is a bigger squeeze up.

3267
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,590
Back to the 20-day on ES. So, this is
your key level. Now, we can see this

3268
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:25,600
your key level. Now, we can see this
 

3269
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,030
your key level. Now, we can see this
volume shelf being built out, right?

3270
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:27,040
volume shelf being built out, right?
 

3271
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,270

This is your overunder. Same kind of

3272
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:29,280
This is your overunder. Same kind of
 

3273
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,310
This is your overunder. Same kind of
level. Big squeeze up here, right back

3274
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:32,320
level. Big squeeze up here, right back
 

3275
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,630
level. Big squeeze up here, right back
into it. We have excess now underneath

3276
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:34,640
into it. We have excess now underneath
 

3277
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,709
into it. We have excess now underneath
as well. So same levels we just talked

3278
01:16:36,709 --> 01:16:36,719
as well. So same levels we just talked
 

3279
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:39,430
as well. So same levels we just talked
about right back to the 60s right back

3280
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:39,440
about right back to the 60s right back
 

3281
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,510
about right back to the 60s right back
to this level do they reshort this level

3282
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:41,520
to this level do they reshort this level
 

3283
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,430
to this level do they reshort this level
to come down here or do they get

3284
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:43,440
to come down here or do they get
 

3285
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:47,270
to come down here or do they get
squeezed out now is what we are asking

3286
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:47,280
squeezed out now is what we are asking
 

3287
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,350
squeezed out now is what we are asking
and if they squeeze out after getting

3288
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:49,360
and if they squeeze out after getting
 

3289
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,070
and if they squeeze out after getting
this close and not taking it it's kind

3290
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:52,080
this close and not taking it it's kind
 

3291
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,110
this close and not taking it it's kind

01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:12,950

it's a big lot Nice.

3296
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:12,960

 

3297
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,750

So, so far rejecting this box here. This

3298
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:15,760
So, so far rejecting this box here. This
 

3299
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,070
So, so far rejecting this box here. This
needs to be red now. Sorry. Needs to be

3300
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:18,080
needs to be red now. Sorry. Needs to be
 

3301
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,630
needs to be red now. Sorry. Needs to be
like that. If we trade through it, it

3302
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:20,640
like that. If we trade through it, it
 

3303
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:27,910
like that. If we trade through it, it
will become blue again.

3304
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:27,920

 

3305
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,669

We have imbalances here up to previous

3306
01:17:29,669 --> 01:17:29,679
We have imbalances here up to previous
 

3307
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:31,430
We have imbalances here up to previous
week value area low again. These are

3308
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:31,440
week value area low again. These are
 

3309
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,510
week value area low again. These are
exactly the same levels we traded in

3310
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:33,520
exactly the same levels we traded in
 

3311
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,030
exactly the same levels we traded in
before. Okay, so this is just like

3312
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:35,040
before. Okay, so this is just like
 

3313
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,790
before. Okay, so this is just like
retesting this same level. If you're

3314
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:36,800
retesting this same level. If you're
 

3315
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,310
retesting this same level. If you're
adamant on the short here, you can look

3316
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:38,320
adamant on the short here, you can look
 

3317
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,070
adamant on the short here, you can look
for a short to trade all the way back

3318
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:40,080
for a short to trade all the way back
 

3319
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,390
for a short to trade all the way back
down here. Just remember you are you do

3320
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:42,400
down here. Just remember you are you do
 

3321
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,030
down here. Just remember you are you do
not have location on your side. You do

3322
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:45,040
not have location on your side. You do
 

3323
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:48,229
not have location on your side. You do
not. We have drifted from we've drifted

not. We have drifted from we've drifted
 

3325
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:50,790
not. We have drifted from we've drifted
over 500 points down this morning. I'm

3326
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:50,800
over 500 points down this morning. I'm
 

3327
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:51,910
over 500 points down this morning. I'm
going to watch for the counter trend

3328
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:51,920
going to watch for the counter trend
 

3329
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,110
going to watch for the counter trend
long today. It's the only thing I'm

3330
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:53,120
long today. It's the only thing I'm
 

3331
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,270
long today. It's the only thing I'm
going to be interested in given how much

3332
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:55,280
going to be interested in given how much
 

3333
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,790
going to be interested in given how much
damage we've done to the downside.

3334
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:56,800
damage we've done to the downside.
 

3335
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,550
damage we've done to the downside.
Right, watching previous week value area

3336
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:58,560
Right, watching previous week value area
 

3337
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,110
Right, watching previous week value area
low here to see if they can reclaim

3338
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:01,120
low here to see if they can reclaim
 

3339
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:05,510
low here to see if they can reclaim
ES back to 20day again.

3340
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:05,520

 

3341
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:10,070

I'm going to watch Vpo here as well.

3342
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:10,080
I'm going to watch Vpo here as well.
 

3343
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,310
I'm going to watch Vpo here as well.
So balances now back down to 520s.

3344
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:12,320
So balances now back down to 520s.
 

3345
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,830
So balances now back down to 520s.
That's where the seller came in. So

3346
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:15,840
That's where the seller came in. So
 

3347
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,990
That's where the seller came in. So
I guess there is an argument if they bid

3348
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:18,000
I guess there is an argument if they bid
 

3349
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,590
I guess there is an argument if they bid
if they look for counter trend if they

3350
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:19,600
if they look for counter trend if they
 

3351
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,229
if they look for counter trend if they
bid above 520s there's an argument we

3352
01:18:22,229 --> 01:18:22,239
bid above 520s there's an argument we
 

3353
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:24,870
bid above 520s there's an argument we
can uh squeeze higher but like I said

3354
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:24,880
can uh squeeze higher but like I said
 

3355
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,950
can uh squeeze higher but like I said
counter trend player high hardest trade

3356
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:26,960
counter trend player high hardest trade
 

3357
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,630
counter trend player high hardest trade
in the book the easier trade will be if

3358
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:28,640
in the book the easier trade will be if
 

3359
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,870
in the book the easier trade will be if
we get above 600 relief up to here and

3360
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:30,880
we get above 600 relief up to here and
 

3361
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,790
we get above 600 relief up to here and
then a resell up here somewhere would be

3362
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:32,800
then a resell up here somewhere would be
 

3363
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,470
then a resell up here somewhere would be
really nice.

3364
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:36,480

 

3365
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,229

We're back into this same congested

3366
01:18:38,229 --> 01:18:38,239
We're back into this same congested
 

3367
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:40,550
We're back into this same congested
zone. This sort of 60s and 70s gets

3368
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:40,560
zone. This sort of 60s and 70s gets
 

3369
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:43,030
zone. This sort of 60s and 70s gets
really messy here on the tape. Starting

3370
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:43,040
really messy here on the tape. Starting
 

3371
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,310
really messy here on the tape. Starting
to see some sellers get a little bit

3372
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:44,320
to see some sellers get a little bit
 

3373
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:48,709
to see some sellers get a little bit
caught here at 50s right now.

3374
01:18:48,709 --> 01:18:48,719

 

3375
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:51,270

Buyers will need it above 75 really and

3376
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:51,280
Buyers will need it above 75 really and
 

3377
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:56,630
Buyers will need it above 75 really and
really above 600.

3378
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:56,640

 

3379
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,709

Let's see. Let's see. It would be nice

3380
01:18:58,709 --> 01:18:58,719
Let's see. Let's see. It would be nice
 

3381
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:00,390
Let's see. Let's see. It would be nice
if we can get one trade. If we can get

3382
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:00,400
if we can get one trade. If we can get
 

3383
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,310
if we can get one trade. If we can get
one squeeze up and then be able to fade

3384
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:02,320
one squeeze up and then be able to fade
 

3385
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,149
one squeeze up and then be able to fade
it. It would be nice. One squeeze up and

3386
01:19:04,149 --> 01:19:04,159
it. It would be nice. One squeeze up and
 

3387
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:05,830
it. It would be nice. One squeeze up and
then a fading opportunity up here

3388
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:05,840
then a fading opportunity up here
 

3389
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,950
then a fading opportunity up here
somewhere would be nice. If we can get

3390
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:06,960
somewhere would be nice. If we can get
 

3391
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,030
somewhere would be nice. If we can get
the counter trend, run all these stops

3392
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:09,040
the counter trend, run all these stops
 

3393
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,350
the counter trend, run all these stops
out would be nice. If we can get

3394
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:11,360
out would be nice. If we can get
 

3395
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,630
out would be nice. If we can get
something like this and then we can fade

3396
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:14,640
something like this and then we can fade
 

3397
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,149
something like this and then we can fade
that back down as well. So we can get

3398
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:16,159
that back down as well. So we can get
 

3399
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:17,910
that back down as well. So we can get
this move and maybe that move would be

3400
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:17,920
this move and maybe that move would be
 

3401
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,870
this move and maybe that move would be
good. Would make the day not completely

3402
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:20,880
good. Would make the day not completely
 

3403
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:34,310
good. Would make the day not completely
worthless at that point

3404
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:34,320

 

3405
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,990

back down to these imbalances. Previous

3406
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:36,000
back down to these imbalances. Previous
 

3407
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,310
back down to these imbalances. Previous
days open. Remember 20s was the level

3408
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:38,320
days open. Remember 20s was the level
 

3409
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,990
days open. Remember 20s was the level
where the huge huge seller came in. That

3410
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:42,000
where the huge huge seller came in. That
 

3411
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,310
where the huge huge seller came in. That
is a big overunder right now. I would

3412
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:44,320
is a big overunder right now. I would
 

3413
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:47,430
is a big overunder right now. I would
say in the very immediate future not for

3414
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:47,440
say in the very immediate future not for
 

3415
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:48,870
say in the very immediate future not for
the trend on the day and how we de

3416
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:48,880
the trend on the day and how we de
 

3417
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,709
the trend on the day and how we de
develop but for the very immediate

3418
01:19:50,709 --> 01:19:50,719
develop but for the very immediate
 

3419
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:53,270
develop but for the very immediate
future that 20's level is going to be

3420
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:53,280
future that 20's level is going to be
 

3421
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:56,229
future that 20's level is going to be
massive.

3422
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:56,239
massive.
 

3423
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:58,149
massive.
If we trade under that I would expect a

3424
01:19:58,149 --> 01:19:58,159
If we trade under that I would expect a
 

3425
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:04,470
If we trade under that I would expect a
new low

3426
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:04,480

 

3427
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:11,270

legend. Thank you.

3428
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:11,280

 

3429
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,870

They're trying to protect it so far.

3430
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:12,880
They're trying to protect it so far.
 

3431
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,030
They're trying to protect it so far.
This is a wonky tape, man. It feels like

3432
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:15,040
This is a wonky tape, man. It feels like
 

3433
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,149
This is a wonky tape, man. It feels like
we're going to lift here. They're

3434
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:16,159
we're going to lift here. They're
 

3435
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:17,270
we're going to lift here. They're
trying. They've got to still get through

3436
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:17,280
trying. They've got to still get through
 

3437
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,590
trying. They've got to still get through
the 75s.

3438
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:19,600
the 75s.
 

3439
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,750
the 75s.
So, I guess 20 to 75 is the liquidity

3440
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:21,760
So, I guess 20 to 75 is the liquidity
 

3441
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,189
So, I guess 20 to 75 is the liquidity
build. We are still rejecting this. So,

3442
01:20:23,189 --> 01:20:23,199
build. We are still rejecting this. So,
 

3443
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:24,470
build. We are still rejecting this. So,
those of you who want the short from

3444
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:24,480
those of you who want the short from
 

3445
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,310
those of you who want the short from
here technically. All right.

3446
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:26,320
here technically. All right.
 

3447
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,990
here technically. All right.
Technically, if they fail this, you'd be

3448
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:28,000
Technically, if they fail this, you'd be
 

3449
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,750
Technically, if they fail this, you'd be
a cover point. I'd cover into some into

3450
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:29,760
a cover point. I'd cover into some into
 

3451
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,550
a cover point. I'd cover into some into
20s and then hold if you break 20s to

3452
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:32,560
20s and then hold if you break 20s to
 

3453
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,830
20s and then hold if you break 20s to
see if you can get all the way down into

3454
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:33,840
see if you can get all the way down into
 

3455
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,350
see if you can get all the way down into
here. There. Technically, like we talked

3456
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:35,360
here. There. Technically, like we talked
 

3457
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,350
here. There. Technically, like we talked
about, there is a short here down to

3458
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:37,360
about, there is a short here down to
 

3459
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,270
about, there is a short here down to
20s. If you get under 20s, you can look

3460
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:39,280
20s. If you get under 20s, you can look
 

3461
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:42,870
20s. If you get under 20s, you can look
for down here, but do not uh position

3462
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:42,880
for down here, but do not uh position
 

3463
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,790
for down here, but do not uh position
yourself if I would take some off at

3464
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:44,800
yourself if I would take some off at
 

3465
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,590
yourself if I would take some off at
20s. If it starts to hold 20s just

3466
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:47,600
20s. If it starts to hold 20s just
 

3467
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,270
20s. If it starts to hold 20s just
because of where the buyer is, right?

3468
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:49,280
because of where the buyer is, right?
 

3469
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,910
because of where the buyer is, right?
I'm looking at like this here. We see

3470
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:51,920
I'm looking at like this here. We see
 

3471
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,870
I'm looking at like this here. We see
this huge seller here. See this massive

3472
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:54,880
this huge seller here. See this massive
 

3473
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,430
this huge seller here. See this massive
delta here into 20s. Big big level 400

3474
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:57,440
delta here into 20s. Big big level 400
 

3475
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,790
delta here into 20s. Big big level 400
lot seller came in there. So, he is

3476
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:00,800
lot seller came in there. So, he is
 

3477
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:09,750
lot seller came in there. So, he is
currently out of position, isn't he?

3478
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:09,760

 

3479
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,590

Yeah, initial balance now set. Thanks,

3480
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:11,600
Yeah, initial balance now set. Thanks,
 

3481
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:17,110
Yeah, initial balance now set. Thanks,
Bradley. Almost forgot to say that.

3482
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:17,120

 

3483
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,189

Please, can we just squeeze up? Please.

3484
01:21:19,189 --> 01:21:19,199
Please, can we just squeeze up? Please.
 

3485
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:20,470
Please, can we just squeeze up? Please.
It's not even that I necessarily want

3486
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:20,480
It's not even that I necessarily want
 

3487
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,550
It's not even that I necessarily want
the long, but I just cannot short down

3488
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:22,560
the long, but I just cannot short down
 

3489
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,110
the long, but I just cannot short down
here. If we just go short, short short

3490
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:25,120
here. If we just go short, short short
 

3491
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,030
here. If we just go short, short short
all day long, I don't think I know what

3492
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:27,040
all day long, I don't think I know what
 

3493
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,709
all day long, I don't think I know what
I could have done with this. Maybe could

3494
01:21:28,709 --> 01:21:28,719
I could have done with this. Maybe could
 

3495
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,390
I could have done with this. Maybe could
have sold these flow zones, but I really

3496
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:30,400
have sold these flow zones, but I really
 

3497
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,750
have sold these flow zones, but I really
don't want to be selling. Even though

3498
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:31,760
don't want to be selling. Even though
 

3499
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,110
don't want to be selling. Even though
there's a shelf here, I really don't

3500
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:33,120
there's a shelf here, I really don't
 

3501
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,870
there's a shelf here, I really don't
want to be selling previous wheat value,

3502
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:34,880
want to be selling previous wheat value,
 

3503
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:38,310
want to be selling previous wheat value,
but just feel like it's too risky for my

3504
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:38,320
but just feel like it's too risky for my
 

3505
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,830
but just feel like it's too risky for my
appetite without coming and cleaning

3506
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:39,840
appetite without coming and cleaning
 

3507
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:48,390
appetite without coming and cleaning
some guys out.

3508
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:48,400

 

3509
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,750

This is where the sellers kept coming

3510
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:49,760
This is where the sellers kept coming
 

3511
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:52,470
This is where the sellers kept coming
in. Remember VPO 55s now still

3512
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:52,480
in. Remember VPO 55s now still
 

3513
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,709
in. Remember VPO 55s now still
underneath VPO. Still buyers have no

3514
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:54,719
underneath VPO. Still buyers have no
 

3515
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:58,950
underneath VPO. Still buyers have no
control, but uh sellers 520s is the big

3516
01:21:58,950 --> 01:21:58,960
control, but uh sellers 520s is the big
 

3517
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,070
control, but uh sellers 520s is the big
level here. And they're coming back down

3518
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:00,080
level here. And they're coming back down
 

3519
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:04,790
level here. And they're coming back down
to those 520s again.

3520
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:04,800

 

3521
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,189

Same level 520s.

3522
01:22:07,189 --> 01:22:07,199
Same level 520s.
 

3523
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:09,350
Same level 520s.
Do buyers hold this up here or is it

3524
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:09,360
Do buyers hold this up here or is it

else I can do. Look at these candles,

3676
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:30,960
else I can do. Look at these candles,
 

3677
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,590
else I can do. Look at these candles,
man. Look at these candles.

3678
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:33,600
man. Look at these candles.
 

3679
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,430
man. Look at these candles.
Oh, it's just like yesterday. Yesterday,

3680
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:35,440
Oh, it's just like yesterday. Yesterday,
 

3681
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,950
Oh, it's just like yesterday. Yesterday,
we went straight up. Didn't get the pull

3682
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:36,960
we went straight up. Didn't get the pull
 

3683
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,229
we went straight up. Didn't get the pull
back I wanted to get in today. We've

3684
01:26:38,229 --> 01:26:38,239
back I wanted to get in today. We've
 

3685
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:39,510
back I wanted to get in today. We've
gone straight down. Didn't get the pull

3686
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:39,520
gone straight down. Didn't get the pull
 

3687
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,270
gone straight down. Didn't get the pull
back I wanted to get in. What are you

3688
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:41,280
back I wanted to get in. What are you
 

3689
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:45,189
back I wanted to get in. What are you
going to do?

3690
01:26:45,189 --> 01:26:45,199

 

3691
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:47,110

How do I know it's the same guy? Uh

3692
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:47,120
How do I know it's the same guy? Uh
 

3693
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,550
How do I know it's the same guy? Uh
well, if he's pulling an order and

3694
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:48,560
well, if he's pulling an order and
 

3695
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,950
well, if he's pulling an order and
putting the same size back on, then it

3696
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:50,960
putting the same size back on, then it
 

3697
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:56,070
putting the same size back on, then it
will be the same guy.

3698
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:56,080

 

3699
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,070

Okay, we're coming back to this 20s.

3700
01:26:58,070 --> 01:26:58,080
Okay, we're coming back to this 20s.
 

3701
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,310
Okay, we're coming back to this 20s.
Remember 20s is your big level where the

3702
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:00,320
Remember 20s is your big level where the
 

3703
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,149
Remember 20s is your big level where the
sellers came in. All right, it's a

3704
01:27:02,149 --> 01:27:02,159
sellers came in. All right, it's a
 

3705
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:05,430
sellers came in. All right, it's a
massive, massive, massive level. That's

3706
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:05,440
massive, massive, massive level. That's
 

3707
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:08,390
massive, massive, massive level. That's
a big level. So, if they protect that,

3708
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:08,400
a big level. So, if they protect that,
 

3709
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,830
a big level. So, if they protect that,
they're still in control and they can

3710
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:09,840
they're still in control and they can
 

3711
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:24,229
they're still in control and they can
look for lower.

3712
01:27:24,229 --> 01:27:24,239

 

3713
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,070

What do I think about the IBO squeeze

3714
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:26,080
What do I think about the IBO squeeze
 

3715
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,870
What do I think about the IBO squeeze
back up to VWAP? Um, I mean, it's

3716
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:28,880
back up to VWAP? Um, I mean, it's
 

3717
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,709
back up to VWAP? Um, I mean, it's
possible, mate. Like, this is not what

3718
01:27:30,709 --> 01:27:30,719
possible, mate. Like, this is not what
 

3719
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:33,750
possible, mate. Like, this is not what
you want to see, right, for shorts. So,

3720
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:33,760
you want to see, right, for shorts. So,
 

3721
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,350
you want to see, right, for shorts. So,
it's possible something like this can

3722
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:35,360
it's possible something like this can
 

3723
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,629
it's possible something like this can
happen and they reshort that.

3724
01:27:36,629 --> 01:27:36,639
happen and they reshort that.
 

3725
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:38,950
happen and they reshort that.
Absolutely. Back to the 520s again here,

3726
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:38,960
Absolutely. Back to the 520s again here,
 

3727
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,310
Absolutely. Back to the 520s again here,
guys.

3728
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:42,320

 

3729
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,669

It's just how they're going to make this

3730
01:27:43,669 --> 01:27:43,679
It's just how they're going to make this
 

3731
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:45,110
It's just how they're going to make this
impossible to trade. You can already

3732
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:45,120
impossible to trade. You can already
 

3733
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:46,870
impossible to trade. You can already
tell they're probably going to do like a

3734
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:46,880
tell they're probably going to do like a
 

3735
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:53,669
tell they're probably going to do like a
a rip out of nowhere when they do it.

3736
01:27:53,669 --> 01:27:53,679

 

3737
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:56,550

So, they've now added more size at 485.

3738
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:56,560
So, they've now added more size at 485.
 

3739
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,189
So, they've now added more size at 485.
So, you got 300 lot at 485, you got 800

3740
01:27:59,189 --> 01:27:59,199
So, you got 300 lot at 485, you got 800
 

3741
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:01,910
So, you got 300 lot at 485, you got 800
lot at 470. We're back through the 420s.

3742
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:01,920
lot at 470. We're back through the 420s.
 

3743
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,350
lot at 470. We're back through the 420s.
We're coming towards these imbalances

3744
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:03,360
We're coming towards these imbalances
 

3745
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:06,310
We're coming towards these imbalances
where we just sold down from though.

3746
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:06,320
where we just sold down from though.
 

3747
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,390
where we just sold down from though.
It's very hard to want to be involved

3748
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:08,400
It's very hard to want to be involved
 

3749
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,070
It's very hard to want to be involved
down here cuz we're not basing and

3750
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:10,080
down here cuz we're not basing and
 

3751
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:13,030
down here cuz we're not basing and
holding. We're This won't I don't think

3752
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:13,040
holding. We're This won't I don't think
 

3753
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:16,070
holding. We're This won't I don't think
this will I put this on. I don't think

3754
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:16,080
this will I put this on. I don't think
 

3755
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:17,910
this will I put this on. I don't think
this will hold all day. I think we will

3756
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:17,920
this will hold all day. I think we will
 

3757
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,550
this will hold all day. I think we will
clean these out and then resell down.

3758
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:20,560
clean these out and then resell down.
 

3759
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,910
clean these out and then resell down.
The question is when do we come and

3760
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:21,920
The question is when do we come and
 

3761
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,430
The question is when do we come and
clear all do we come and take previous

3762
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:23,440
clear all do we come and take previous
 

3763
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,830
clear all do we come and take previous
day low first? Do we come and do this

3764
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:25,840
day low first? Do we come and do this
 

3765
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,470
day low first? Do we come and do this
and then this and then this and then

3766
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:28,480
and then this and then this and then
 

3767
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:31,990
and then this and then this and then
that? Maybe. Maybe we do that first.

3768
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:32,000
that? Maybe. Maybe we do that first.
 

3769
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,750
that? Maybe. Maybe we do that first.
Trap more balls and use the liquidity to

3770
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:33,760
Trap more balls and use the liquidity to
 

3771
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,669
Trap more balls and use the liquidity to
go lower. Okay, back through the through

3772
01:28:35,669 --> 01:28:35,679
go lower. Okay, back through the through
 

3773
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:37,030
go lower. Okay, back through the through
the 20s. Then we're going to come back

3774
01:28:37,030 --> 01:28:37,040
the 20s. Then we're going to come back
 

3775
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,990
the 20s. Then we're going to come back
for these 50s and 60s for a test again.

3776
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:40,000
for these 50s and 60s for a test again.
 

3777
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,110
for these 50s and 60s for a test again.
So 50s is now Vpo

3778
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:43,120
So 50s is now Vpo
 

3779
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:46,149
So 50s is now Vpo
right here, right? Get over this and

3780
01:28:46,149 --> 01:28:46,159
right here, right? Get over this and
 

3781
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:48,149
right here, right? Get over this and
this and this squeeze is available and

3782
01:28:48,149 --> 01:28:48,159
this and this squeeze is available and
 

3783
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:50,709
this and this squeeze is available and
then I'd imagine they will resell that.

3784
01:28:50,709 --> 01:28:50,719
then I'd imagine they will resell that.
 

3785
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:53,590
then I'd imagine they will resell that.
I would say we're very thin

3786
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:53,600
I would say we're very thin
 

3787
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,590
I would say we're very thin
up into this, but this is a higher time

3788
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:55,600
up into this, but this is a higher time
 

3789
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:59,270
up into this, but this is a higher time
frame block here. So this is possible,

3790
01:28:59,270 --> 01:28:59,280
frame block here. So this is possible,
 

3791
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:02,229
frame block here. So this is possible,
right? this is possible and then

3792
01:29:02,229 --> 01:29:02,239
right? this is possible and then
 

3793
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:04,310
right? this is possible and then
probably resell it. I don't think

3794
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:04,320
probably resell it. I don't think
 

3795
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,310
probably resell it. I don't think
they'll do this move here. I mean, they

3796
01:29:06,310 --> 01:29:06,320
they'll do this move here. I mean, they
 

3797
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:12,149
they'll do this move here. I mean, they
can be very dirty and do it.

3798
01:29:12,149 --> 01:29:12,159

 

3799
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:17,189

Should we put that back on for you guys?

3800
01:29:17,189 --> 01:29:17,199

 

3801
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:24,229

Okay, VPO up here 55s.

3802
01:29:24,229 --> 01:29:24,239

 

3803
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:25,830

We're back above those 20s again,

3804
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:25,840
We're back above those 20s again,
 

3805
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,629
We're back above those 20s again,
though. We have a buyer side imbalance

3806
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:28,639
though. We have a buyer side imbalance
 

3807
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:30,790
though. We have a buyer side imbalance
here at 20s now. So let's see if they

3808
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:30,800
here at 20s now. So let's see if they
 

3809
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,510
here at 20s now. So let's see if they
can hold this now and lift through point

3810
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:33,520
can hold this now and lift through point
 

3811
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:36,229
can hold this now and lift through point
of control. Get map back up. Man's

3812
01:29:36,229 --> 01:29:36,239
of control. Get map back up. Man's
 

3813
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:37,910
of control. Get map back up. Man's
running slow. There must been a lot of

3814
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:37,920
running slow. There must been a lot of
 

3815
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:41,030
running slow. There must been a lot of
orders gone through this morning.

3816
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:41,040
orders gone through this morning.
 

3817
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:44,390
orders gone through this morning.
Skip data on us. And

3818
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:44,400
Skip data on us. And
 

3819
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:49,189
Skip data on us. And
watching this now

3820
01:29:49,189 --> 01:29:49,199

 

3821
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:52,229

back to these 50s. We get pretty thick

3822
01:29:52,229 --> 01:29:52,239
back to these 50s. We get pretty thick
 

3823
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:54,149
back to these 50s. We get pretty thick
here. You can see it on the SVP. We get

3824
01:29:54,149 --> 01:29:54,159
here. You can see it on the SVP. We get
 

3825
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:58,950
here. You can see it on the SVP. We get
pretty thick up here. Any outliers above

3826
01:29:58,950 --> 01:29:58,960

01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:56,400
lower.
 

3981
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,830
lower.
No. All right. So, they've completely

3982
01:33:57,830 --> 01:33:57,840
No. All right. So, they've completely
 

3983
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,470
No. All right. So, they've completely
removed that 300 lot. So, 300 lot that

3984
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:00,480
removed that 300 lot. So, 300 lot that
 

3985
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:07,189
removed that 300 lot. So, 300 lot that
was uh what was it at like 80s has gone

3986
01:34:07,189 --> 01:34:07,199

 

3987
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:10,310

mega games, man.

3988
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:10,320
mega games, man.
 

3989
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:15,430
mega games, man.
Mega mega mega games.

3990
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:15,440

 

3991
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,350

I will not hold this under 20, guys. I

3992
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:17,360
I will not hold this under 20, guys. I
 

3993
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,110
I will not hold this under 20, guys. I
want to make that clear. I'm looking for

3994
01:34:19,110 --> 01:34:19,120
want to make that clear. I'm looking for
 

3995
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:24,790
want to make that clear. I'm looking for
relief up. I will not hold under 20.

3996
01:34:24,790 --> 01:34:24,800

 

3997
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:36,470

Come on. I need you over 55s and 75s.

3998
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:36,480

 

3999
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,310

It's a battle. It's a battle. I don't

4000
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:38,320
It's a battle. It's a battle. I don't
 

4001
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,830
It's a battle. It's a battle. I don't
want to get flushed on like 100 points

4002
01:34:39,830 --> 01:34:39,840
want to get flushed on like 100 points
 

4003
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:45,430
want to get flushed on like 100 points
plus here. So, here comes the 20 test.

4004
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:45,440

 

4005
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:52,709

going to knock me out on you.

4006
01:34:52,709 --> 01:34:52,719

 

4007
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:54,629

And they're adding 15. Oh, they're

4008
01:34:54,629 --> 01:34:54,639
And they're adding 15. Oh, they're
 

4009
01:34:54,639 --> 01:35:02,149
And they're adding 15. Oh, they're
trying to drag it.

4010
01:35:02,149 --> 01:35:02,159

 

4011
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:03,750

This might be my last go, folks. I've

4012
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:03,760
This might be my last go, folks. I've
 

4013
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,830
This might be my last go, folks. I've
had a couple goes at this. This might be

4014
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:05,840
had a couple goes at this. This might be
 

4015
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:09,350
had a couple goes at this. This might be
my last go. If they swipe 20s, then

4016
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:09,360
my last go. If they swipe 20s, then
 

4017
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:10,790
my last go. If they swipe 20s, then
we've probably got enough built out here

4018
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:10,800
we've probably got enough built out here
 

4019
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,310
we've probably got enough built out here
on the rejection of this point control

4020
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:12,320
on the rejection of this point control
 

4021
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,910
on the rejection of this point control
to move lower. Probably should have just

4022
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:13,920
to move lower. Probably should have just
 

4023
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,229
to move lower. Probably should have just
played protrend lower, but uh I just

4024
01:35:16,229 --> 01:35:16,239
played protrend lower, but uh I just
 

4025
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:18,390
played protrend lower, but uh I just
refused to sell previous week value area

4026
01:35:18,390 --> 01:35:18,400
refused to sell previous week value area
 

4027
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,629
refused to sell previous week value area
low after a 500 point sell. But here we

4028
01:35:20,629 --> 01:35:20,639
low after a 500 point sell. But here we
 

4029
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:23,110
low after a 500 point sell. But here we
go. I'm out of this. And there's a good

4030
01:35:23,110 --> 01:35:23,120
go. I'm out of this. And there's a good
 

4031
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:25,750
go. I'm out of this. And there's a good
chance we continue to fade now. A really

4032
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:25,760
chance we continue to fade now. A really
 

4033
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:27,270
chance we continue to fade now. A really
good chance they could just continue to

4034
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:27,280
good chance they could just continue to
 

4035
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:34,310
good chance they could just continue to
come down here now.

4036
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:34,320

 

4037
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:37,750

[\h__\h] me. No relief. No relief for me to

4038
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:37,760
[\h__\h] me. No relief. No relief for me to
 

4039
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,590
[\h__\h] me. No relief. No relief for me to
get a squeeze, to get a good profits. No

4040
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:39,600
get a squeeze, to get a good profits. No
 

4041
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,110
get a squeeze, to get a good profits. No
relief for me to sell. Just a constant

4042
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:43,120
relief for me to sell. Just a constant
 

4043
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:46,310
relief for me to sell. Just a constant
drift lower. What you going to do?

4044
01:35:46,310 --> 01:35:46,320
drift lower. What you going to do?
 

4045
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,790
drift lower. What you going to do?
Dumping inventory.

4046
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:48,800
Dumping inventory.
 

4047
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:56,629
Dumping inventory.
Dumping inventory.

4048
01:35:56,629 --> 01:35:56,639

 

4049
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:58,229

Bull flag on VIX. What on the five

4050
01:35:58,229 --> 01:35:58,239
Bull flag on VIX. What on the five
 

4051
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:01,990
Bull flag on VIX. What on the five
minute? I mean

4052
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:02,000

 

4053
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,950

I mean it's something. It's holding a

4054
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:04,960
I mean it's something. It's holding a
 

4055
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,470
I mean it's something. It's holding a
bid. I'm not sure I'd call that

4056
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:06,480
bid. I'm not sure I'd call that
 

4057
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,550
bid. I'm not sure I'd call that
necessarily a bull flag, but I mean it's

4058
01:36:08,550 --> 01:36:08,560
necessarily a bull flag, but I mean it's
 

4059
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,070
necessarily a bull flag, but I mean it's
got a chance if it breaks that current

4060
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:10,080
got a chance if it breaks that current
 

4061
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,950
got a chance if it breaks that current
high of day, which was the old close 7.

4062
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:12,960
high of day, which was the old close 7.
 

4063
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,950
high of day, which was the old close 7.
You got to understand 1750 was the close

4064
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:14,960
You got to understand 1750 was the close
 

4065
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,510
You got to understand 1750 was the close
from Friday, right? So, if it gets above

4066
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:17,520
from Friday, right? So, if it gets above
 

4067
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,590
from Friday, right? So, if it gets above
1750, then you've got relief for a gap

4068
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:19,600
1750, then you've got relief for a gap
 

4069
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,590
1750, then you've got relief for a gap
filled to 1835.

4070
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:21,600
filled to 1835.
 

4071
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:26,629
filled to 1835.
But, uh, it's not got above it yet.

4072
01:36:26,629 --> 01:36:26,639
But, uh, it's not got above it yet.
 

4073
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:30,149
But, uh, it's not got above it yet.
Back to these 20s again. Seriously.

4074
01:36:30,149 --> 01:36:30,159
Back to these 20s again. Seriously.
 

4075
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:34,149
Back to these 20s again. Seriously.
Seriously, make your mind up.

4076
01:36:34,149 --> 01:36:34,159
Seriously, make your mind up.
 

4077
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:35,590
Seriously, make your mind up.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean the market will like

4078
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:35,600
Yeah. Yeah, I mean the market will like
 

4079
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,669
Yeah. Yeah, I mean the market will like
Finiz will be red other than RTY. So

4080
01:36:37,669 --> 01:36:37,679
Finiz will be red other than RTY. So
 

4081
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:40,390
Finiz will be red other than RTY. So
we've come back out of tech. We've the

4082
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:40,400
we've come back out of tech. We've the
 

4083
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:43,030
we've come back out of tech. We've the
rotation's ridiculous. We rotated out of

4084
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:43,040
rotation's ridiculous. We rotated out of
 

4085
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,830
rotation's ridiculous. We rotated out of
tech no uh November December into the

4086
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:45,840
tech no uh November December into the
 

4087
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:48,070
tech no uh November December into the
Russell, right? Then we rotated this

4088
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:48,080
Russell, right? Then we rotated this
 

4089
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,990
Russell, right? Then we rotated this
month out of the Russell back into tech.

4090
01:36:49,990 --> 01:36:50,000
month out of the Russell back into tech.
 

4091
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,750
month out of the Russell back into tech.
And then today we're rotating back out

4092
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:51,760
And then today we're rotating back out
 

4093
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:54,790
And then today we're rotating back out
of tech into the Russell. And surprise

4094
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:54,800
of tech into the Russell. And surprise
 

4095
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,030
of tech into the Russell. And surprise
surprise, the metals are getting a bid

4096
01:36:57,030 --> 01:36:57,040
surprise, the metals are getting a bid
 

4097
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,109
surprise, the metals are getting a bid
back up today. So it's just a rotational

4098
01:36:59,109 --> 01:36:59,119
back up today. So it's just a rotational
 

4099
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:01,830
back up today. So it's just a rotational
market. We can see that from where the

4100
01:37:01,830 --> 01:37:01,840
market. We can see that from where the
 

4101
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:04,390
market. We can see that from where the
money's going back into RTY, back into

4102
01:37:04,390 --> 01:37:04,400
money's going back into RTY, back into
 

4103
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,950
money's going back into RTY, back into
the metals. We can also see it in how

4104
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:06,960
the metals. We can also see it in how
 

4105
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,550
the metals. We can also see it in how
we've gone back into a range and failed

4106
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:08,560
we've gone back into a range and failed
 

4107
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,149
we've gone back into a range and failed
to break out. We've reclaimed those 20s

4108
01:37:10,149 --> 01:37:10,159
to break out. We've reclaimed those 20s
 

4109
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:11,510
to break out. We've reclaimed those 20s
again. I don't know if I can be bothered

4110
01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:11,520
again. I don't know if I can be bothered
 

4111
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:14,229
again. I don't know if I can be bothered
to have one more go at this. Can I be

4112
01:37:14,229 --> 01:37:14,239
to have one more go at this. Can I be
 

4113
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:16,470
to have one more go at this. Can I be
bothered? Maybe,

4114
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:16,480
bothered? Maybe,
 

4115
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:20,070
bothered? Maybe,
maybe,

4116
01:37:20,070 --> 01:37:20,080

 

4117
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:24,229

maybe. Oh, really?

4118
01:37:24,229 --> 01:37:24,239
maybe. Oh, really?
 

4119
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:25,750
maybe. Oh, really?
It's always the time when I'm not in it,

4120
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:25,760
It's always the time when I'm not in it,
 

4121
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,229
It's always the time when I'm not in it,
isn't it?

4122
01:37:28,229 --> 01:37:28,239
isn't it?
 

4123
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:30,149
isn't it?
Right, back to 50s again. If we go over

4124
01:37:30,149 --> 01:37:30,159
Right, back to 50s again. If we go over
 

4125
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:32,070
Right, back to 50s again. If we go over
50s, then I'll try and get the trade to

4126
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:32,080
50s, then I'll try and get the trade to
 

4127
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:37,270
50s, then I'll try and get the trade to
75s, I guess.

4128
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:37,280

 

4129
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:40,229

Here we go. Here's VPO.

4130
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:40,239
Here we go. Here's VPO.
 

4131
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:42,390
Here we go. Here's VPO.
See if they go 75s. Here we go. Here's

4132
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,400
See if they go 75s. Here we go. Here's
 

4133

get acceptance back over this, we should

4140
01:37:53,030 --> 01:37:53,040
get acceptance back over this, we should
 

4141
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:56,310
get acceptance back over this, we should
lift to 600. I can't believe it. I I

4142
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:56,320
lift to 600. I can't believe it. I I

4148
01:38:10,709 --> 01:38:10,719

 

4149
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:12,310

I'm in a little piece long here. Seeing

4150
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:12,320
I'm in a little piece long here. Seeing
 

4151
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:15,590
I'm in a little piece long here. Seeing
if we can get back over previous week

4152
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:15,600
if we can get back over previous week
 

4153
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,149
if we can get back over previous week
value area low to get into 600. All

4154
01:38:18,149 --> 01:38:18,159
value area low to get into 600. All
 

4155
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:20,870
value area low to get into 600. All
right. So, I'm long looking to see if we

4156
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:20,880
right. So, I'm long looking to see if we
 

4157
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,310
right. So, I'm long looking to see if we
can get back over this. I've already

4158
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:22,320
can get back over this. I've already
 

4159
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,310
can get back over this. I've already
sold some. All right. The question is

4160
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:24,320
sold some. All right. The question is
 

4161
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:27,189
sold some. All right. The question is
now, can we do this in this node here

4162
01:38:27,189 --> 01:38:27,199
now, can we do this in this node here
 

4163
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:29,270
now, can we do this in this node here
and get to here? So, your next TP and

4164
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:29,280
and get to here? So, your next TP and
 

4165
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,189
and get to here? So, your next TP and
then here and then here would be great.

4166
01:38:31,189 --> 01:38:31,199
then here and then here would be great.
 

4167
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:33,750
then here and then here would be great.
All right. So, I'm long this from here

4168
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:33,760
All right. So, I'm long this from here
 

4169
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,990
All right. So, I'm long this from here
TP1. See if we can get this up here for

4170
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:36,000
TP1. See if we can get this up here for
 

4171
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,070
TP1. See if we can get this up here for
relief. It's counter trend relief

4172
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:38,080
relief. It's counter trend relief
 

4173
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,510
relief. It's counter trend relief
because I think we've built out some

4174
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:39,520
because I think we've built out some
 

4175
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,270
because I think we've built out some
horrible liquidity here that we need to

4176
01:38:41,270 --> 01:38:41,280
horrible liquidity here that we need to
 

4177
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,510
horrible liquidity here that we need to
swipe. And once we've done that, I will

4178
01:38:43,510 --> 01:38:43,520
swipe. And once we've done that, I will
 

4179
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:46,070
swipe. And once we've done that, I will
look to resell it back down. Right. I

4180
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:46,080
look to resell it back down. Right. I
 

4181
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,990
look to resell it back down. Right. I
don't like this is not structure I want

4182
01:38:47,990 --> 01:38:48,000
don't like this is not structure I want
 

4183
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,470
don't like this is not structure I want
to really short. Not without a trap. Not

4184
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:50,480
to really short. Not without a trap. Not
 

4185
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,950
to really short. Not without a trap. Not
if we done that, I can short it. Same as

4186
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:52,960
if we done that, I can short it. Same as
 

4187
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:56,070
if we done that, I can short it. Same as
up here. If we'd done this two leg up,

4188
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:56,080
up here. If we'd done this two leg up,
 

4189
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:57,910
up here. If we'd done this two leg up,
fade that would have been great. Right

4190
01:38:57,910 --> 01:38:57,920
fade that would have been great. Right
 

4191
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,390
fade that would have been great. Right
here we go. 75s then. Let's see. Can we

4192
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:00,400
here we go. 75s then. Let's see. Can we
 

4193
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:04,950
here we go. 75s then. Let's see. Can we
get going to the 600s now?

4194
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:04,960

 

4195
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:08,310

Uh 89 is a big level. 8975

4196
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:08,320
Uh 89 is a big level. 8975
 

4197
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:09,669
Uh 89 is a big level. 8975
just based on what happened earlier

4198
01:39:09,669 --> 01:39:09,679
just based on what happened earlier
 

4199
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:12,470
just based on what happened earlier
today. Big seller there at 8975. So

4200
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:12,480
today. Big seller there at 8975. So
 

4201
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:16,550
today. Big seller there at 8975. So
through 8975 we go 600. Through 600 we

4202
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:16,560
through 8975 we go 600. Through 600 we
 

4203
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:19,109
through 8975 we go 600. Through 600 we
look for an imbalance at 611. through

4204
01:39:19,109 --> 01:39:19,119
look for an imbalance at 611. through
 

4205
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:22,870
look for an imbalance at 611. through
that uh 650s ideally

4206
01:39:22,870 --> 01:39:22,880
that uh 650s ideally
 

4207
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,229
that uh 650s ideally
counter trend. Remember this is a

4208
01:39:24,229 --> 01:39:24,239
counter trend. Remember this is a
 

4209
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:25,910
counter trend. Remember this is a
counter trend long. Hardest trade in the

4210
01:39:25,910 --> 01:39:25,920
counter trend long. Hardest trade in the
 

4211
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:39,189
counter trend long. Hardest trade in the
book we're doing right now.

4212
01:39:39,189 --> 01:39:39,199

 

4213
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:40,790

Come on. We got to get through these

4214
01:39:40,790 --> 01:39:40,800
Come on. We got to get through these
 

4215
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,790
Come on. We got to get through these
75s.

4216
01:39:42,790 --> 01:39:42,800
75s.
 

4217
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,109
75s.
Don't want it back below 50s. Now

4218
01:39:45,109 --> 01:39:45,119
Don't want it back below 50s. Now
 

4219
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:47,669
Don't want it back below 50s. Now
there's a node here. Just going to get

4220
01:39:47,669 --> 01:39:47,679
there's a node here. Just going to get
 

4221
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:50,709
there's a node here. Just going to get
rid of this. And we can do it like this

4222
01:39:50,709 --> 01:39:50,719
rid of this. And we can do it like this
 

4223
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:52,870
rid of this. And we can do it like this
to make it a bit easier. Right. I want

4224
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:52,880
to make it a bit easier. Right. I want
 

4225
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,350
to make it a bit easier. Right. I want
this to hold now. This has to hold for

4226
01:39:55,350 --> 01:39:55,360
this to hold now. This has to hold for
 

4227
01:39:55,360 --> 01:40:00,709
this to hold now. This has to hold for
relief.

4228
01:40:00,709 --> 01:40:00,719

 

4229
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:02,390

Almost there. Almost to the 600s. We're

4230
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:02,400
Almost there. Almost to the 600s. We're
 

4231
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,390
Almost there. Almost to the 600s. We're
looking good here.

4232
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:04,400
looking good here.
 

4233
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,229
looking good here.
Big seller was here earlier at 90. We

4234
01:40:06,229 --> 01:40:06,239
Big seller was here earlier at 90. We
 

4235
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:08,070
Big seller was here earlier at 90. We
got through that seller. Here we go.

4236
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:08,080
got through that seller. Here we go.
 

4237
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:10,310
got through that seller. Here we go.
Come on. 600s. [\h__\h] hell. How many

4238
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:10,320
Come on. 600s. [\h__\h] hell. How many
 

4239
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:11,990
Come on. 600s. [\h__\h] hell. How many
times did this take? Had like four or

4240
01:40:11,990 --> 01:40:12,000
times did this take? Had like four or
 

4241
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,510
times did this take? Had like four or
five goes at this today. 600s. So,

4242
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:15,520
five goes at this today. 600s. So,
 

4243
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,510
five goes at this today. 600s. So,
here's like a 60 70 pointer, I guess.

4244
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:17,520
here's like a 60 70 pointer, I guess.
 

4245
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:18,629
here's like a 60 70 pointer, I guess.
And if we can get through this, we're

4246
01:40:18,629 --> 01:40:18,639
And if we can get through this, we're
 

4247
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:20,629
And if we can get through this, we're
going to get a runner to go through the

4248
01:40:20,629 --> 01:40:20,639
going to get a runner to go through the
 

4249
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:22,470
going to get a runner to go through the
11s. So, trim some into here, please.

4250
01:40:22,470 --> 01:40:22,480
11s. So, trim some into here, please.
 

4251
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:25,109
11s. So, trim some into here, please.
And if we get going, we can get 650s

4252
01:40:25,109 --> 01:40:25,119
And if we get going, we can get 650s
 

4253
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:28,390
And if we get going, we can get 650s
finally. Jesus.

4254

Blasphemy, Alex. Can we get up into

4256
01:40:30,709 --> 01:40:30,719
Blasphemy, Alex. Can we get up into
 

4257
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:34,310
Blasphemy, Alex. Can we get up into
here?

4258
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:34,320

 

4259
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:37,910

Oh my gosh. Am I long? Yes. Like I said,

4260
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:37,920
Oh my gosh. Am I long? Yes. Like I said,
 

4261
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,590
Oh my gosh. Am I long? Yes. Like I said,
I was late to the long. I did say I'm

4262
01:40:39,590 --> 01:40:39,600
I was late to the long. I did say I'm
 

4263
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:42,550
I was late to the long. I did say I'm
going to get in once we get over VPO.

4264
01:40:42,550 --> 01:40:42,560
going to get in once we get over VPO.
 

4265
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,109
going to get in once we get over VPO.
So, long trigger was 50s for me. So, I

4266
01:40:45,109 --> 01:40:45,119
So, long trigger was 50s for me. So, I
 

4267
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:47,669
So, long trigger was 50s for me. So, I
was a bit late to it. If it had done it

4268
01:40:47,669 --> 01:40:47,679
was a bit late to it. If it had done it
 

4269
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:49,350
was a bit late to it. If it had done it
the first time, I'd be up over 100

4270
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:49,360
the first time, I'd be up over 100
 

4271
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,430
the first time, I'd be up over 100
points, but I'm up over 50 points now.

4272
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:51,440
points, but I'm up over 50 points now.
 

4273
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:52,950
points, but I'm up over 50 points now.
And we'll see. We can get 100 point

4274
01:40:52,950 --> 01:40:52,960
And we'll see. We can get 100 point
 

4275
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,870
And we'll see. We can get 100 point
trade here. If we lift through this now,

4276
01:40:54,870 --> 01:40:54,880
trade here. If we lift through this now,
 

4277
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:58,550
trade here. If we lift through this now,
there's a move to 650.

4278
01:40:58,550 --> 01:40:58,560
there's a move to 650.
 

4279
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,070
there's a move to 650.
I'm still holding some. Trying to see if

4280
01:41:00,070 --> 01:41:00,080
I'm still holding some. Trying to see if
 

4281
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:04,229
I'm still holding some. Trying to see if
we can get up to 650.

4282
01:41:04,229 --> 01:41:04,239

 

4283
01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:07,750

Can we get up to 650? Here we go. Nodes

4284
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:07,760
Can we get up to 650? Here we go. Nodes
 

4285
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,830
Can we get up to 650? Here we go. Nodes
here into 20.

4286
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:09,840
here into 20.
 

4287
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:11,189
here into 20.
Don't want them to rinse this all the

4288
01:41:11,189 --> 01:41:11,199
Don't want them to rinse this all the
 

4289
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:12,390
Don't want them to rinse this all the
way back down now. I also want to see

4290
01:41:12,390 --> 01:41:12,400
way back down now. I also want to see
 

4291
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,709
way back down now. I also want to see
them really hold 96s,

4292
01:41:14,709 --> 01:41:14,719
them really hold 96s,
 

4293
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:18,550
them really hold 96s,
92s maybe to get up into this VWAP. If

4294
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:18,560
92s maybe to get up into this VWAP. If
 

4295
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:19,990
92s maybe to get up into this VWAP. If
we get through this VWAP, we're going to

4296
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:20,000
we get through this VWAP, we're going to
 

4297
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,990
we get through this VWAP, we're going to
look for this one up here and then I

4298
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:22,000
look for this one up here and then I
 

4299
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,669
look for this one up here and then I
will get ready to sell. But I know we're

4300
01:41:23,669 --> 01:41:23,679
will get ready to sell. But I know we're
 

4301
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:28,149
will get ready to sell. But I know we're
very thin on structure today.

4302
01:41:28,149 --> 01:41:28,159

 

4303
01:41:28,159 --> 01:41:31,430

So, moving my stop up

4304
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:31,440
So, moving my stop up
 

4305
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,350
So, moving my stop up
ES into VWAP here as well. Just be

4306
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:33,360
ES into VWAP here as well. Just be
 

4307
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,430
ES into VWAP here as well. Just be
prepared. ES is already into its VWAP.

4308
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:35,440
prepared. ES is already into its VWAP.
 

4309
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:37,109
prepared. ES is already into its VWAP.
VIX coming down to that pivot I just

4310
01:41:37,109 --> 01:41:37,119
VIX coming down to that pivot I just
 

4311
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:38,310
VIX coming down to that pivot I just
talked about. It's going to have to hold

4312
01:41:38,310 --> 01:41:38,320
talked about. It's going to have to hold
 

4313
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,229
talked about. It's going to have to hold
that pivot.

4314
01:41:40,229 --> 01:41:40,239
that pivot.
 

4315
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:41,910
that pivot.
If it flushes through that pivot, then

4316
01:41:41,910 --> 01:41:41,920
If it flushes through that pivot, then
 

4317
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,270
If it flushes through that pivot, then
we're going to get a bigger squeeze out

4318
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:43,280
we're going to get a bigger squeeze out
 

4319
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:49,350
we're going to get a bigger squeeze out
here.

4320
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:49,360

 

4321
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,590

So, needs to hold 92s. Definitely has to

4322
01:41:51,590 --> 01:41:51,600
So, needs to hold 92s. Definitely has to
 

4323
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,590
So, needs to hold 92s. Definitely has to
hold 75, but ideally we hold this little

4324
01:41:53,590 --> 01:41:53,600
hold 75, but ideally we hold this little
 

4325
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:56,550
hold 75, but ideally we hold this little
node here into 92s. Ideally, they bid

4326
01:41:56,550 --> 01:41:56,560
node here into 92s. Ideally, they bid
 

4327
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,950
node here into 92s. Ideally, they bid
this node here. But remember, ES just

4328
01:41:58,950 --> 01:41:58,960
this node here. But remember, ES just
 

4329
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,470
this node here. But remember, ES just
came into its view up. So, ES has

4330
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:00,480
came into its view up. So, ES has
 

4331
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:02,229
came into its view up. So, ES has
already tagged this. Just be very aware

4332
01:42:02,229 --> 01:42:02,239
already tagged this. Just be very aware
 

4333
01:42:02,239 --> 01:42:03,669
already tagged this. Just be very aware
of that. You should have trimmed some if

4334
01:42:03,669 --> 01:42:03,679
of that. You should have trimmed some if
 

4335
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:05,590
of that. You should have trimmed some if
you're a long ES

4336
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:05,600
you're a long ES
 

4337
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:18,229
you're a long ES
or at least paid yourself a partial

4338
01:42:18,229 --> 01:42:18,239

 

4339
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:20,229

just under these 92s. This is the level.

4340
01:42:20,229 --> 01:42:20,239
just under these 92s. This is the level.
 

4341
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:21,590
just under these 92s. This is the level.
If it doesn't hold here, it's going to

4342
01:42:21,590 --> 01:42:21,600
If it doesn't hold here, it's going to
 

4343
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,910
If it doesn't hold here, it's going to
test 75s. I won't hold under 75. There's

4344
01:42:23,910 --> 01:42:23,920
test 75s. I won't hold under 75. There's
 

4345
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,910
test 75s. I won't hold under 75. There's
a big imbalance all the way down to 55.

4346
01:42:25,910 --> 01:42:25,920
a big imbalance all the way down to 55.
 

4347
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,870
a big imbalance all the way down to 55.
So here's 7 75. Check under here. I'm

4348
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:28,880
So here's 7 75. Check under here. I'm
 

4349
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:31,590
So here's 7 75. Check under here. I'm
going to leave it. Leave it. I can read.

4350
01:42:31,590 --> 01:42:31,600
going to leave it. Leave it. I can read.
 

4351
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:35,030
going to leave it. Leave it. I can read.
It holds a pull back. Riad

4352
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:35,040
It holds a pull back. Riad
 

4353
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,830
It holds a pull back. Riad
this level here now. Key has to hold

4354
01:42:37,830 --> 01:42:37,840
this level here now. Key has to hold
 

4355
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:41,350
this level here now. Key has to hold
this level now.

4356
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:41,360

 

4357
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:43,750

It's a good hold. So far, it's a good

4358
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:43,760
It's a good hold. So far, it's a good
 

4359
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:48,870
It's a good hold. So far, it's a good
hold.

4360
01:42:48,870 --> 01:42:48,880

 

4361
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,470

Problem is we have imbalances all the

4362
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:50,480
Problem is we have imbalances all the
 

4363
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,149
Problem is we have imbalances all the
way down to 30 if they actually want to

4364
01:42:52,149 --> 01:42:52,159
way down to 30 if they actually want to
 

4365
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:54,310
way down to 30 if they actually want to
go and fill them.

4366
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:54,320
go and fill them.
 

4367
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,149
go and fill them.
But the protren is short. All we've done

4368
01:42:56,149 --> 01:42:56,159
But the protren is short. All we've done
 

4369
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:57,910
But the protren is short. All we've done
is swipe out these stop. Didn't get that

4370
01:42:57,910 --> 01:42:57,920
is swipe out these stop. Didn't get that
 

4371
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:00,470
is swipe out these stop. Didn't get that
far. But ES rejected VW like we talked

4372
01:43:00,470 --> 01:43:00,480
far. But ES rejected VW like we talked
 

4373
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:03,109
far. But ES rejected VW like we talked
about. ES has definitely had a big big

4374
01:43:03,109 --> 01:43:03,119
about. ES has definitely had a big big
 

4375
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:05,669
about. ES has definitely had a big big
rejection of VWAP. We if we hold this

4376
01:43:05,669 --> 01:43:05,679
rejection of VWAP. We if we hold this
 

4377
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:07,510
rejection of VWAP. We if we hold this
blue box, there is a chance for a second

4378
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:07,520
blue box, there is a chance for a second
 

4379
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,149
blue box, there is a chance for a second
leg of relief. If we lose this blue box,

4380
01:43:10,149 --> 01:43:10,159
leg of relief. If we lose this blue box,
 

4381
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:11,750
leg of relief. If we lose this blue box,
then all this was like we talked about

4382
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:11,760
then all this was like we talked about
 

4383
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,910
then all this was like we talked about
was a swipe of this for this. So, what

4384
01:43:13,910 --> 01:43:13,920
was a swipe of this for this. So, what
 

4385
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,910
was a swipe of this for this. So, what
we'd like is something like this. All

4386
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:15,920
we'd like is something like this. All
 

4387
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,910
we'd like is something like this. All
right. But if we see this, then that

4388
01:43:17,910 --> 01:43:17,920
right. But if we see this, then that
 

4389
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,910
right. But if we see this, then that
would be a resell back down. I won't be

4390
01:43:19,910 --> 01:43:19,920
would be a resell back down. I won't be
 

4391
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:21,750
would be a resell back down. I won't be
taking that cell. It's too far into

4392
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:21,760
taking that cell. It's too far into
 

4393
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,790
taking that cell. It's too far into
discount for me to sell. I will sell if

4394
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:24,800
discount for me to sell. I will sell if
 

4395
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:25,990
discount for me to sell. I will sell if
we come all the way back up here

4396
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:26,000
we come all the way back up here
 

4397
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,750
we come all the way back up here
somewhere.

4398
01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:27,760
somewhere.
 

4399
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,350
somewhere.
So, you can read adding this long if

4400
01:43:29,350 --> 01:43:29,360
So, you can read adding this long if
 

4401
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:31,109
So, you can read adding this long if
this starts to hold. if it starts to

4402
01:43:31,109 --> 01:43:31,119
this starts to hold. if it starts to
 

4403
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:35,910
this starts to hold. if it starts to
hold. Uh, where are those sellers? 55s

4404
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:35,920
hold. Uh, where are those sellers? 55s
 

4405
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,149
hold. Uh, where are those sellers? 55s
and 20s. You don't want 20s. It's got to

4406
01:43:38,149 --> 01:43:38,159
and 20s. You don't want 20s. It's got to
 

4407
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:44,870
and 20s. You don't want 20s. It's got to
hold 55s.

4408
01:43:44,870 --> 01:43:44,880

 

4409
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:47,109

So, coming back down for those 55s. This

4410
01:43:47,109 --> 01:43:47,119
So, coming back down for those 55s. This
 

4411
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:50,950
So, coming back down for those 55s. This
Vpo level fair value on the day. ES got

4412
01:43:50,950 --> 01:43:50,960
Vpo level fair value on the day. ES got
 

4413
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,430
Vpo level fair value on the day. ES got
absolutely crushed off VWAP. So, ES

4414
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:53,440
absolutely crushed off VWAP. So, ES
 

4415
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:56,709
absolutely crushed off VWAP. So, ES
doing again the nicer move. If we look

4416
01:43:56,709 --> 01:43:56,719
doing again the nicer move. If we look
 

4417
01:43:56,719 --> 01:44:00,229
doing again the nicer move. If we look
at ES right into its VWAP, swept almost

4418
01:44:00,229 --> 01:44:00,239
at ES right into its VWAP, swept almost
 

4419
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:03,990
at ES right into its VWAP, swept almost
everything. Almost everything.

4420
01:44:03,990 --> 01:44:04,000
everything. Almost everything.
 

4421
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,910
everything. Almost everything.
NQ making it a little bit more tricky

4422
01:44:05,910 --> 01:44:05,920
NQ making it a little bit more tricky
 

4423
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:08,470
NQ making it a little bit more tricky
today.

4424
01:44:08,470 --> 01:44:08,480
today.
 

4425
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:12,470
today.
VPO still holding here so far.

4426
01:44:12,470 --> 01:44:12,480
VPO still holding here so far.
 

4427
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:14,950
VPO still holding here so far.
So they got to get back 75s now for a

4428
01:44:14,950 --> 01:44:14,960
So they got to get back 75s now for a
 

4429
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:18,470
So they got to get back 75s now for a
squeeze

4430
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:18,480

 

4431
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:20,629

with this second leg up. It's possible.

4432
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:20,639
with this second leg up. It's possible.
 

4433
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:23,030
with this second leg up. It's possible.
There's 75s. Can they squeeze and fill

4434
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:23,040
There's 75s. Can they squeeze and fill
 

4435
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,950
There's 75s. Can they squeeze and fill
in some of these imbalances from that

4436
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:24,960
in some of these imbalances from that
 

4437
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:27,270
in some of these imbalances from that
last sell back down? We've got

4438
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:27,280
last sell back down? We've got
 

4439
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:31,669
last sell back down? We've got
imbalances into 85 to 92 and 99 and then

4440
01:44:31,669 --> 01:44:31,679
imbalances into 85 to 92 and 99 and then
 

4441
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:33,189
imbalances into 85 to 92 and 99 and then
right back at the high peak and we can

4442
01:44:33,189 --> 01:44:33,199
right back at the high peak and we can
 

4443
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:35,830
right back at the high peak and we can
get a second leg higher here. Here we

4444
01:44:35,830 --> 01:44:35,840
get a second leg higher here. Here we
 

4445
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,229
get a second leg higher here. Here we
go. Great hold of the blue box. So, I

4446
01:44:38,229 --> 01:44:38,239
go. Great hold of the blue box. So, I
 

4447
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:39,430
go. Great hold of the blue box. So, I
really want to see this back through the

4448
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:39,440
really want to see this back through the
 

4449
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,990
really want to see this back through the
90s now if we're going to get a second

4450
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:42,000
90s now if we're going to get a second
 

4451
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,990
90s now if we're going to get a second
leg. So, sellers will try and defend

4452
01:44:43,990 --> 01:44:44,000
leg. So, sellers will try and defend
 

4453
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,149
leg. So, sellers will try and defend
this in here. Buyers are trying to

4454
01:44:46,149 --> 01:44:46,159
this in here. Buyers are trying to
 

4455
01:44:46,159 --> 01:44:48,470
this in here. Buyers are trying to
absorb here. If we get a second leg,

4456
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:48,480
absorb here. If we get a second leg,
 

4457
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:49,750
absorb here. If we get a second leg,
we're going to get this move here. And

4458
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:49,760
we're going to get this move here. And
 

4459
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,430
we're going to get this move here. And
then I'm going to look to fade that move

4460
01:44:51,430 --> 01:44:51,440
then I'm going to look to fade that move
 

4461
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,990
then I'm going to look to fade that move
up there probably. Here we go. Nice fill

4462
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:54,000
up there probably. Here we go. Nice fill
 

4463
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,189
up there probably. Here we go. Nice fill
of these imbalances.

4464
01:44:57,189 --> 01:44:57,199
of these imbalances.
 

4465
01:44:57,199 --> 01:44:58,709
of these imbalances.
So I'll be take paying yourself. If

4466
01:44:58,709 --> 01:44:58,719
So I'll be take paying yourself. If
 

4467
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:00,229
So I'll be take paying yourself. If
you're long from the blue, you want to

4468
01:45:00,229 --> 01:45:00,239
you're long from the blue, you want to
 

4469
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:01,750
you're long from the blue, you want to
pay yourself some. Why? Because we're

4470
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:01,760
pay yourself some. Why? Because we're
 

4471
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:03,030
pay yourself some. Why? Because we're
counter trend. You want to pay yourself

4472
01:45:03,030 --> 01:45:03,040
counter trend. You want to pay yourself
 

4473
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,709
counter trend. You want to pay yourself
a little bit. Move your stop in the

4474
01:45:04,709 --> 01:45:04,719
a little bit. Move your stop in the
 

4475
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:06,149
a little bit. Move your stop in the
money and then hopefully you get this

4476
01:45:06,149 --> 01:45:06,159
money and then hopefully you get this
 

4477
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:09,350
money and then hopefully you get this
second leg. Hopefully versus this right.

4478
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:09,360
second leg. Hopefully versus this right.
 

4479
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,510
second leg. Hopefully versus this right.

4583
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:57,510
We're just looking for that second leg.
ES still can't get through its VWAP.

4584
01:47:57,510 --> 01:47:57,520
ES still can't get through its VWAP.
 

4585
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:59,189
ES still can't get through its VWAP.
VIX starting to base out in those sort

4586
01:47:59,189 --> 01:47:59,199
VIX starting to base out in those sort
 

4587
01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:01,270
VIX starting to base out in those sort
of 1680s. It can afford to come right

4588
01:48:01,270 --> 01:48:01,280
of 1680s. It can afford to come right
 

4589
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:03,910
of 1680s. It can afford to come right
down into 1664 here, VIX, and find a bid

4590
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:03,920
down into 1664 here, VIX, and find a bid
 

4591
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:05,910
down into 1664 here, VIX, and find a bid
down there. So, just be careful. We're

4592
01:48:05,910 --> 01:48:05,920
down there. So, just be careful. We're
 

4593
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,750
down there. So, just be careful. We're
in an area where the VIX might want to

4594
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:07,760
in an area where the VIX might want to
 

4595
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:10,070
in an area where the VIX might want to
find a bid. If it does find a bid here,

4596
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:10,080
find a bid. If it does find a bid here,
 

4597
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:12,950
find a bid. If it does find a bid here,
then uh this move will finish soon. Here

4598
01:48:12,950 --> 01:48:12,960
then uh this move will finish soon. Here
 

4599
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:16,310
then uh this move will finish soon. Here
we go. Here we go. God, I don't know how

4600
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:16,320
we go. Here we go. God, I don't know how
 

4601
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,390
we go. Here we go. God, I don't know how
many attempts I needed at this. Far too

4602
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:18,400
many attempts I needed at this. Far too
 

4603
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,149
many attempts I needed at this. Far too
many.

4604
01:48:20,149 --> 01:48:20,159
many.
 

4605
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:42,629
many.
Far far far too many attempts.

4606
01:48:42,629 --> 01:48:42,639

 

4607
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:45,430

01:48:45,430 --> 01:48:45,440
630 fib level. Uh, from what swing? Not
 

4609
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:48,310
630 fib level. Uh, from what swing? Not
from not from the open. Or you talking

4610
01:48:48,310 --> 01:48:48,320
from not from the open. Or you talking
 

4611
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:54,149
from not from the open. Or you talking
about a 30 fib?

4612
01:48:54,149 --> 01:48:54,159

 

4613
01:48:54,159 --> 01:48:56,470

New York open.

4614
01:48:56,470 --> 01:48:56,480
New York open.
 

4615
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,229
New York open.
I think we got a chance to get in here,

4616
01:48:58,229 --> 01:48:58,239
I think we got a chance to get in here,
 

4617
01:48:58,239 --> 01:49:00,870
I think we got a chance to get in here,
right? 50% retracement

4618
01:49:00,870 --> 01:49:00,880
right? 50% retracement
 

4619
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:02,470
right? 50% retracement
and it's where the sellers came in this

4620
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:02,480
and it's where the sellers came in this
 

4621
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:03,910
and it's where the sellers came in this
morning. We've got a chance. It's just

4622
01:49:03,910 --> 01:49:03,920
morning. We've got a chance. It's just
 

4623
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:09,430
morning. We've got a chance. It's just
whether they're willing to do it or not.

4624
01:49:09,430 --> 01:49:09,440

 

4625
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,590

We look at this. It's these guys here. I

4626
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:11,600
We look at this. It's these guys here. I
 

4627
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:13,590
We look at this. It's these guys here. I
want to get into these guys up here. And

4628
01:49:13,590 --> 01:49:13,600
want to get into these guys up here. And
 

4629
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,189
want to get into these guys up here. And
then I want to think about, can I resell

4630
01:49:15,189 --> 01:49:15,199
then I want to think about, can I resell
 

4631
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:27,109
then I want to think about, can I resell
that back down once we get up there?

4632
01:49:27,109 --> 01:49:27,119

 

4633
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:28,550

Sorry it took so many attempts this

4634
01:49:28,550 --> 01:49:28,560
Sorry it took so many attempts this
 

4635
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:30,550
Sorry it took so many attempts this
morning, folks. I I don't like picking

4636
01:49:30,550 --> 01:49:30,560
morning, folks. I I don't like picking
 

4637
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:31,830
morning, folks. I I don't like picking
bottoms. It's not something I want to

4638
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:31,840
bottoms. It's not something I want to
 

4639
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,510
bottoms. It's not something I want to
do, but I'm certainly not going to sell

4640
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:33,520
do, but I'm certainly not going to sell
 

4641
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:35,750
do, but I'm certainly not going to sell
underneath previous week value area low.

4642
01:49:35,750 --> 01:49:35,760
underneath previous week value area low.
 

4643
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:52,709
underneath previous week value area low.
Not without it drifting higher first

4644
01:49:52,709 --> 01:49:52,719

 

4645
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:55,910

750 high volume node. Yeah. Up here.

4646
01:49:55,910 --> 01:49:55,920
750 high volume node. Yeah. Up here.
 

4647
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:57,990
750 high volume node. Yeah. Up here.
This remember though on the if we zoom

4648
01:49:57,990 --> 01:49:58,000
This remember though on the if we zoom
 

4649
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,550
This remember though on the if we zoom
out don't just look at today. Remember,

4650
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:00,560
out don't just look at today. Remember,
 

4651
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:03,189
out don't just look at today. Remember,
zoom out.

4652
01:50:03,189 --> 01:50:03,199
zoom out.
 

4653
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:07,990
zoom out.
Uh, where's the developing week? We can

4654
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:08,000
Uh, where's the developing week? We can
 

4655
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,350
Uh, where's the developing week? We can
look at some of these areas here.

4656
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:11,360
look at some of these areas here.
 

4657
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:12,550
look at some of these areas here.
So, this is the one you're talking

4658
01:50:12,550 --> 01:50:12,560
So, this is the one you're talking
 

4659
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:14,709
So, this is the one you're talking
about, I think, JD, but it starts at

4660
01:50:14,709 --> 01:50:14,719
about, I think, JD, but it starts at
 

4661
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:17,109
about, I think, JD, but it starts at
sort of 700 from the previous week. All

4662
01:50:17,109 --> 01:50:17,119
sort of 700 from the previous week. All
 

4663
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:18,310
sort of 700 from the previous week. All
right. And then you've got another one

4664
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:18,320
right. And then you've got another one
 

4665
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,950
right. And then you've got another one
into 750. So,

4666
01:50:20,950 --> 01:50:20,960
into 750. So,
 

4667
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:23,910
into 750. So,
we have to be uh respectful of what

4668
01:50:23,910 --> 01:50:23,920
we have to be uh respectful of what
 

4669
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:26,070
we have to be uh respectful of what
what's happened before before both in

4670
01:50:26,070 --> 01:50:26,080
what's happened before before both in
 

4671
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:29,270
what's happened before before both in
this week and previous weeks. Dave Davis

4672
01:50:29,270 --> 01:50:29,280
this week and previous weeks. Dave Davis
 

4673
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:31,350
this week and previous weeks. Dave Davis
Davis, your analysis is worth way more

4674
01:50:31,350 --> 01:50:31,360
Davis, your analysis is worth way more
 

4675
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:32,870
Davis, your analysis is worth way more
than this. Please keep this stream. It's

4676
01:50:32,870 --> 01:50:32,880
than this. Please keep this stream. It's
 

4677
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,709
than this. Please keep this stream. It's
the best. Thank you, man. Appreciate the

4678
01:50:34,709 --> 01:50:34,719
the best. Thank you, man. Appreciate the
 

4679
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:39,510
the best. Thank you, man. Appreciate the
tip. Very kind of you. The super chat.

4680
01:50:39,510 --> 01:50:39,520
tip. Very kind of you. The super chat.
 

4681
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:42,310
tip. Very kind of you. The super chat.
Do I think you can reenter longs? Um,

4682
01:50:42,310 --> 01:50:42,320
Do I think you can reenter longs? Um,
 

4683
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:43,910
Do I think you can reenter longs? Um,
potentially, but you've just got to

4684
01:50:43,910 --> 01:50:43,920
potentially, but you've just got to
 

4685
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:47,430
potentially, but you've just got to
remember we're in a rotation. Um, as

4686
01:50:47,430 --> 01:50:47,440
remember we're in a rotation. Um, as
 

4687
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,189
remember we're in a rotation. Um, as
long as we hold this, there's potential

4688
01:50:49,189 --> 01:50:49,199
long as we hold this, there's potential
 

4689
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:50,950
long as we hold this, there's potential
to move upside. But what I would say is

4690
01:50:50,950 --> 01:50:50,960
to move upside. But what I would say is
 

4691
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:53,430
to move upside. But what I would say is
we left a low hanging fruit down here.

4692
01:50:53,430 --> 01:50:53,440
we left a low hanging fruit down here.
 

4693
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,750
we left a low hanging fruit down here.
All right, we haven't swept IB. We

4694
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:55,760
All right, we haven't swept IB. We
 

4695
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,990
All right, we haven't swept IB. We
haven't taken previous day low. It's

4696
01:50:57,990 --> 01:50:58,000
haven't taken previous day low. It's
 

4697
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,669
haven't taken previous day low. It's
possible they come back for it. I would

4698
01:50:59,669 --> 01:50:59,679
possible they come back for it. I would
 

4699
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:02,550
possible they come back for it. I would
be, you know, this is a no man's land

4700
01:51:02,550 --> 01:51:02,560
be, you know, this is a no man's land
 

4701
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:05,030
be, you know, this is a no man's land
play right now, right? We were long from

4702
01:51:05,030 --> 01:51:05,040
play right now, right? We were long from
 

4703
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:07,109
play right now, right? We were long from
here or you're long from here. Maybe if

4704
01:51:07,109 --> 01:51:07,119
here or you're long from here. Maybe if
 

4705
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:08,629
here or you're long from here. Maybe if
they hold this, you get a continuation

4706
01:51:08,629 --> 01:51:08,639
they hold this, you get a continuation
 

4707
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:10,229
they hold this, you get a continuation
up into here. But we will probably want

4708
01:51:10,229 --> 01:51:10,239
up into here. But we will probably want
 

4709
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:12,950
up into here. But we will probably want
to be thinking about a short up here. If

4710
01:51:12,950 --> 01:51:12,960
to be thinking about a short up here. If
 

4711
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:15,510
to be thinking about a short up here. If
we if we see buyers get stuck into here,

4712
01:51:15,510 --> 01:51:15,520
we if we see buyers get stuck into here,
 

4713
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:17,109
we if we see buyers get stuck into here,
we probably want to be selling that back

4714
01:51:17,109 --> 01:51:17,119
we probably want to be selling that back
 

4715
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:19,430
we probably want to be selling that back
down because I'm going to assume lots of

4716
01:51:19,430 --> 01:51:19,440
down because I'm going to assume lots of
 

4717
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:21,590
down because I'm going to assume lots of
buyers will chase this late. And if they

4718
01:51:21,590 --> 01:51:21,600
buyers will chase this late. And if they
 

4719
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,669
buyers will chase this late. And if they
chase it late, we'll use their pain. And

4720
01:51:23,669 --> 01:51:23,679
chase it late, we'll use their pain. And
 

4721
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:25,830
chase it late, we'll use their pain. And
if we do take that short, all right, if

4722
01:51:25,830 --> 01:51:25,840
if we do take that short, all right, if
 

4723
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:28,229
if we do take that short, all right, if
we do lift, right, let's say we lift up

4724
01:51:28,229 --> 01:51:28,239
we do lift, right, let's say we lift up
 

4725
01:51:28,239 --> 01:51:30,310
we do lift, right, let's say we lift up
here and we see something like this and

4726
01:51:30,310 --> 01:51:30,320
here and we see something like this and
 

4727
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:32,070
here and we see something like this and
buyers get caught, we will be covering

4728
01:51:32,070 --> 01:51:32,080
buyers get caught, we will be covering
 

4729
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:34,709
buyers get caught, we will be covering
some into these nodes. All right, maybe

4730
01:51:34,709 --> 01:51:34,719
some into these nodes. All right, maybe
 

4731
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:37,109
some into these nodes. All right, maybe
like 30% there, maybe a bit more there,

4732
01:51:37,109 --> 01:51:37,119
like 30% there, maybe a bit more there,
 

4733
01:51:37,119 --> 01:51:40,229
like 30% there, maybe a bit more there,
and then hoping we go lower, but

4734
01:51:40,229 --> 01:51:40,239
and then hoping we go lower, but
 

4735
01:51:40,239 --> 01:51:41,750
and then hoping we go lower, but
protecting our profits because we don't

4736
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:41,760
protecting our profits because we don't
 

4737
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:43,270
protecting our profits because we don't
know at that point, we've built out

4738
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:43,280
know at that point, we've built out
 

4739
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,470
know at that point, we've built out
structure. We're going to have to need

4740
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:44,480
structure. We're going to have to need
 

4741
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:45,830
structure. We're going to have to need
to respect the structure we've built

4742
01:51:45,830 --> 01:51:45,840
to respect the structure we've built
 

4743
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,510
to respect the structure we've built
out.

4744
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:47,520
out.
 

4745
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,510
out.
If we go full reclaim and we don't see

4746
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:49,520
If we go full reclaim and we don't see
 

4747
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:51,189
If we go full reclaim and we don't see
any buyers trapped and we start doing

4748
01:51:51,189 --> 01:51:51,199
any buyers trapped and we start doing
 

4749
01:51:51,199 --> 01:51:52,790
any buyers trapped and we start doing
this then obviously we're not going to

4750
01:51:52,790 --> 01:51:52,800
this then obviously we're not going to
 

4751
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,310
this then obviously we're not going to
short it. Right? We start reclaiming

4752
01:51:54,310 --> 01:51:54,320
short it. Right? We start reclaiming
 

4753
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,950
short it. Right? We start reclaiming
this shelf. We can go right back. This

4754
01:51:56,950 --> 01:51:56,960
this shelf. We can go right back. This
 

4755
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,669
this shelf. We can go right back. This
is a dramatic rem move like here is very

4756
01:51:59,669 --> 01:51:59,679
is a dramatic rem move like here is very
 

4757
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:01,830
is a dramatic rem move like here is very
thin. Like that is look at this. Look

4758
01:52:01,830 --> 01:52:01,840
thin. Like that is look at this. Look
 

4759
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,629
thin. Like that is look at this. Look
how thin we are in here. Right. This is

4760
01:52:04,629 --> 01:52:04,639
how thin we are in here. Right. This is
 

4761
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:06,070
how thin we are in here. Right. This is
what I talked about earlier. There was

4762
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:06,080
what I talked about earlier. There was
 

4763
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,830
what I talked about earlier. There was
no good retest. Like this needed to come

4764
01:52:07,830 --> 01:52:07,840
no good retest. Like this needed to come
 

4765
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:09,910
no good retest. Like this needed to come
a little bit high. ES was much a much

4766
01:52:09,910 --> 01:52:09,920
a little bit high. ES was much a much
 

4767
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:11,910
a little bit high. ES was much a much
better looking chart this morning for

4768
01:52:11,910 --> 01:52:11,920
better looking chart this morning for
 

4769
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:15,270
better looking chart this morning for
the uh short in my mind anyway. in my

Yeah, still rejecting view up. Can't get

Yeah, still rejecting view up. Can't get
 

4783
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:43,510
Yeah, still rejecting view up. Can't get

Thanks for the commentary. I listen
 

4793
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:05,109
Thanks for the commentary. I listen
while I'm looking at my charts. Ah,

4794
01:53:05,109 --> 01:53:05,119
while I'm looking at my charts. Ah,
 

4795
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:08,470
while I'm looking at my charts. Ah,
nice.

4796
01:53:08,470 --> 01:53:08,480

 

4797
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:10,310

Kurt Clouden, best stream I've seen so

4798
01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:10,320
Kurt Clouden, best stream I've seen so
 

4799
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:12,709
Kurt Clouden, best stream I've seen so
far. Thanks, Kurt. Thanks, Kurt.

4800
01:53:12,709 --> 01:53:12,719
far. Thanks, Kurt. Thanks, Kurt.
 

4801
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:14,070
far. Thanks, Kurt. Thanks, Kurt.
Remember, this is a counter trend

4802
01:53:14,070 --> 01:53:14,080
Remember, this is a counter trend
 

4803
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:16,229
Remember, this is a counter trend
squeeze we're in, right? Please remember

4804
01:53:16,229 --> 01:53:16,239
squeeze we're in, right? Please remember
 

4805
01:53:16,239 --> 01:53:18,470
squeeze we're in, right? Please remember
that if they start losing this blue box,

4806
01:53:18,470 --> 01:53:18,480
that if they start losing this blue box,
 

4807
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:20,310
that if they start losing this blue box,
they have unfinished business. If they

4808
01:53:20,310 --> 01:53:20,320
they have unfinished business. If they
 

4809
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,470
they have unfinished business. If they
build out enough liquidity here, they

4810
01:53:22,470 --> 01:53:22,480
build out enough liquidity here, they
 

4811
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:24,870
build out enough liquidity here, they
have unfinished business down here that

4812
01:53:24,870 --> 01:53:24,880
have unfinished business down here that
 

4813
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:27,109
have unfinished business down here that
they can come for.

4814
01:53:27,109 --> 01:53:27,119
they can come for.
 

4815
01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:28,790
they can come for.
We can have a look at the excess at the

4816
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:28,800
We can have a look at the excess at the
 

4817
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:31,750
We can have a look at the excess at the
low.

4818
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:31,760
low.
 

4819
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:34,550
low.
It's not bad. It's actually pretty good.

4820
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:34,560
It's not bad. It's actually pretty good.
 

4821
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:38,070
It's not bad. It's actually pretty good.
That's not bad. That's not too bad. But,

4822
01:53:38,070 --> 01:53:38,080
That's not bad. That's not too bad. But,
 

4823
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:39,430
That's not bad. That's not too bad. But,
you know, they have reasons to move

4824
01:53:39,430 --> 01:53:39,440
you know, they have reasons to move
 

4825
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:42,470
you know, they have reasons to move
lower if they want to. If they do this

4826
01:53:42,470 --> 01:53:42,480
lower if they want to. If they do this
 

4827
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:45,030
lower if they want to. If they do this
move here, they will move lower. Right

4828
01:53:45,030 --> 01:53:45,040
move here, they will move lower. Right
 

4829
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:47,030
move here, they will move lower. Right
now, you're in a counter trend squeeze

4830
01:53:47,030 --> 01:53:47,040
now, you're in a counter trend squeeze
 

4831
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:49,350
now, you're in a counter trend squeeze
relief to potentially come up here. But

4832
01:53:49,350 --> 01:53:49,360
relief to potentially come up here. But
 

4833
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:53,350
relief to potentially come up here. But
remember, ES keeps getting stuck. ES has

4834
01:53:53,350 --> 01:53:53,360
remember, ES keeps getting stuck. ES has
 

4835
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:55,910
remember, ES keeps getting stuck. ES has
already got to VW up. There you go. All

4836
01:53:55,910 --> 01:53:55,920
already got to VW up. There you go. All
 

4837
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:57,510
already got to VW up. There you go. All
right. And it's already swept this guy

4838
01:53:57,510 --> 01:53:57,520
right. And it's already swept this guy
 

4839
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:58,790
right. And it's already swept this guy
out. So, if we think about the

4840
01:53:58,790 --> 01:53:58,800
out. So, if we think about the
 

4841
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,950
out. So, if we think about the
liquidity, ES has knocked these guys

4842
01:54:00,950 --> 01:54:00,960
liquidity, ES has knocked these guys
 

4843
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:02,709
liquidity, ES has knocked these guys
out. ES has done the perfect move that

4844
01:54:02,709 --> 01:54:02,719
out. ES has done the perfect move that
 

4845
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:05,830
out. ES has done the perfect move that
you'd want to see. Like, it's just so

4846
01:54:05,830 --> 01:54:05,840
you'd want to see. Like, it's just so
 

4847
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:09,270
you'd want to see. Like, it's just so
much better. Like this trade here is way

4848
01:54:09,270 --> 01:54:09,280
much better. Like this trade here is way
 

4849
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:11,510
much better. Like this trade here is way
better. Down, down, down, down. Push up.

4850
01:54:11,510 --> 01:54:11,520
better. Down, down, down, down. Push up.
 

4851
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:14,229
better. Down, down, down, down. Push up.
Fail. New York open.

4852
01:54:14,229 --> 01:54:14,239
Fail. New York open.
 

4853
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:16,790
Fail. New York open.
Short. Big slam.

4854
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:16,800
Short. Big slam.
 

4855
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:19,030
Short. Big slam.
You leave all this alone. There's the

4856
01:54:19,030 --> 01:54:19,040
You leave all this alone. There's the
 

4857
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:21,430
You leave all this alone. There's the
squeeze out. There's the target. It's

4858
01:54:21,430 --> 01:54:21,440
squeeze out. There's the target. It's
 

4859
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:23,030
squeeze out. There's the target. It's
hit its target. So the question now is

4860
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:23,040
hit its target. So the question now is
 

4861
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:25,750
hit its target. So the question now is
for ES. If it can't hold this, it will

4862
01:54:25,750 --> 01:54:25,760
for ES. If it can't hold this, it will
 

4863
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:31,189
for ES. If it can't hold this, it will
probably collapse down to this old PC.

4864
01:54:31,189 --> 01:54:31,199

 

4865
01:54:31,199 --> 01:54:34,310

Messy. It's It's messy.

4866
01:54:34,310 --> 01:54:34,320
Messy. It's It's messy.
 

4867
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:35,750
Messy. It's It's messy.
Might be that we're done with this at

4868
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:35,760
Might be that we're done with this at
 

4869
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:37,510
Might be that we're done with this at
this point.

4870
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:37,520
this point.
 

4871
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:42,229
this point.
I'll give it some time at least.

4872
01:54:42,229 --> 01:54:42,239

 

4873
01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:43,830

Yeah, I'm in right now with a runner

4874
01:54:43,830 --> 01:54:43,840
Yeah, I'm in right now with a runner
 

4875
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:45,750
Yeah, I'm in right now with a runner
just versus here. I sold most in this

4876
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:45,760
just versus here. I sold most in this
 

4877
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:47,350
just versus here. I sold most in this
push.

4878
01:54:47,350 --> 01:54:47,360
push.
 

4879
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:49,109
push.
So, just a runner right now. If we start

4880
01:54:49,109 --> 01:54:49,119
So, just a runner right now. If we start
 

4881
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:54,870
So, just a runner right now. If we start
losing this, I'll just cut it again.

4882
01:54:54,870 --> 01:54:54,880

 

4883
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:56,470

We're trying to I'm trying to give it a

4884
01:54:56,470 --> 01:54:56,480
We're trying to I'm trying to give it a
 

4885
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:58,790
We're trying to I'm trying to give it a
chance,

4886
01:54:58,790 --> 01:54:58,800
chance,
 

4887
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:02,070
chance,
but it's very possible it just snaps.

4888
01:55:02,070 --> 01:55:02,080
but it's very possible it just snaps.
 

4889

side of that blue box is my stop.

4894
01:55:19,030 --> 01:55:19,040

If we start losing momentum, um I would

4932
01:56:21,109 --> 01:56:21,119
If we start losing momentum, um I would
 

4933
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:24,950
If we start losing momentum, um I would
say if you look at the pivots,

4934
01:56:24,950 --> 01:56:24,960
say if you look at the pivots,
 

4935
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:26,709
say if you look at the pivots,
yesterday's open, you'd be looking at

4936
01:56:26,709 --> 01:56:26,719
yesterday's open, you'd be looking at
 

4937
01:56:26,719 --> 01:56:31,430
yesterday's open, you'd be looking at
sort of 50s, 50s and 42. So 950, 942. If

4938
01:56:31,430 --> 01:56:31,440
sort of 50s, 50s and 42. So 950, 942. If
 

4939
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,830
sort of 50s, 50s and 42. So 950, 942. If
you lose that, there's a big block into

4940
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:33,840
you lose that, there's a big block into
 

4941
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:36,950
you lose that, there's a big block into
930s. And if you lose that, 910s and if

4942
01:56:36,950 --> 01:56:36,960
930s. And if you lose that, 910s and if
 

4943
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:39,430
930s. And if you lose that, 910s and if
you lose that, 9003s. And if you lose

4944
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:39,440
you lose that, 9003s. And if you lose
 

4945
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:42,790
you lose that, 9003s. And if you lose
that, 864s. Right? So, if you want to

4946
01:56:42,790 --> 01:56:42,800
that, 864s. Right? So, if you want to
 

4947
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:45,270
that, 864s. Right? So, if you want to
put that into the spiders, um you can

4948
01:56:45,270 --> 01:56:45,280
put that into the spiders, um you can
 

4949
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:47,669
put that into the spiders, um you can
see this morning we held 90s or in front

4950
01:56:47,669 --> 01:56:47,679
see this morning we held 90s or in front
 

4951
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:49,350
see this morning we held 90s or in front
of 90s. I imagine there's some gamma

4952
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:49,360
of 90s. I imagine there's some gamma
 

4953
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:51,830
of 90s. I imagine there's some gamma
exposure there. Uh under 90s you're

4954
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:51,840
exposure there. Uh under 90s you're
 

4955
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:55,189
exposure there. Uh under 90s you're
probably looking at uh 87s and under

4956
01:56:55,189 --> 01:56:55,199
probably looking at uh 87s and under
 

4957
01:56:55,199 --> 01:56:57,830
probably looking at uh 87s and under
that you're looking at 85s again. 85s

4958
01:56:57,830 --> 01:56:57,840
that you're looking at 85s again. 85s
 

4959
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:59,830
that you're looking at 85s again. 85s
have been a big level for months and

01:56:59,830 --> 01:56:59,840
have been a big level for months and

flush under this. I can always re-enter.
Remember, we can always reenter. But if

5046
01:59:53,830 --> 01:59:53,840
Remember, we can always reenter. But if
 

5047
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:55,750
Remember, we can always reenter. But if
they flush under this, they'd probably

5048
01:59:55,750 --> 01:59:55,760
they flush under this, they'd probably
 

5049
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:57,189
they flush under this, they'd probably
be looking for these 30s. Remember, the

5050
01:59:57,189 --> 01:59:57,199
be looking for these 30s. Remember, the
 

5051
01:59:57,199 --> 01:59:59,030
be looking for these 30s. Remember, the
20s has been a big level on the tape all

5052
01:59:59,030 --> 01:59:59,040
20s has been a big level on the tape all
 

5053
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:01,109
20s has been a big level on the tape all
day. There's lots of imbalances down

5054
02:00:01,109 --> 02:00:01,119
day. There's lots of imbalances down
 

5055
02:00:01,119 --> 02:00:02,709
day. There's lots of imbalances down
here. So, we're going to come down,

5056
02:00:02,709 --> 02:00:02,719
here. So, we're going to come down,
 

5057
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:04,709
here. So, we're going to come down,
probably fill some of these guys here,

5058
02:00:04,709 --> 02:00:04,719
probably fill some of these guys here,
 

5059
02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:07,030
probably fill some of these guys here,
potentially down into 20s. They can

5060
02:00:07,030 --> 02:00:07,040
potentially down into 20s. They can
 

5061
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:08,470
potentially down into 20s. They can
scoop this. They can trap and scoop

5062
02:00:08,470 --> 02:00:08,480
scoop this. They can trap and scoop
 

5063
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:09,589
scoop this. They can trap and scoop
this, but I don't want to sit through

5064
02:00:09,589 --> 02:00:09,599
this, but I don't want to sit through
 

5065
02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:11,350
this, but I don't want to sit through
the pain. Here we go. So, we're filling

5066
02:00:11,350 --> 02:00:11,360
the pain. Here we go. So, we're filling
 

5067
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:12,709
the pain. Here we go. So, we're filling
some of these imbalances potentially

5068
02:00:12,709 --> 02:00:12,719
some of these imbalances potentially
 

5069
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:14,950
some of these imbalances potentially
down to these 20s now. And this is your

5070
02:00:14,950 --> 02:00:14,960
down to these 20s now. And this is your
 

5071
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:16,550
down to these 20s now. And this is your
big over under. Look at this big sell is

5072
02:00:16,550 --> 02:00:16,560
big over under. Look at this big sell is
 

5073
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:18,550
big over under. Look at this big sell is
still here. 400 lot from earlier, right?

5074
02:00:18,550 --> 02:00:18,560
still here. 400 lot from earlier, right?
 

5075
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:19,990
still here. 400 lot from earlier, right?
So, that delta is still offside. It's

5076
02:00:19,990 --> 02:00:20,000
So, that delta is still offside. It's
 

5077
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,910
So, that delta is still offside. It's
not been paired off at all. So, that's

5078
02:00:21,910 --> 02:00:21,920
not been paired off at all. So, that's
 

5079
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:24,229
not been paired off at all. So, that's
your overunder. I'd say technically

5080
02:00:24,229 --> 02:00:24,239
your overunder. I'd say technically
 

5081
02:00:24,239 --> 02:00:25,350
your overunder. I'd say technically
speaking, all the time we're holding

5082
02:00:25,350 --> 02:00:25,360
speaking, all the time we're holding
 

5083
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:27,589
speaking, all the time we're holding
that. Technically there are sellers

5084
02:00:27,589 --> 02:00:27,599
that. Technically there are sellers
 

5085
02:00:27,599 --> 02:00:29,750
that. Technically there are sellers
trapped under that but uh there are lowh

5086
02:00:29,750 --> 02:00:29,760
trapped under that but uh there are lowh
 

5087
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:31,669
trapped under that but uh there are lowh
hanging fruits to go for under 20 like

5088
02:00:31,669 --> 02:00:31,679
hanging fruits to go for under 20 like
 

5089
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:34,390
hanging fruits to go for under 20 like
we talked about this old low.

5090
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:34,400
we talked about this old low.
 

5091
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:36,950
we talked about this old low.
So a shame we had divergence there with

5092
02:00:36,950 --> 02:00:36,960
So a shame we had divergence there with
 

5093
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:39,589
So a shame we had divergence there with
ES. So those of you who do call it SMT

5094
02:00:39,589 --> 02:00:39,599
ES. So those of you who do call it SMT
 

5095
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:41,750
ES. So those of you who do call it SMT
right there's your divergence on ES that

5096
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:41,760
right there's your divergence on ES that
 

5097
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:44,790
right there's your divergence on ES that
took that pivot out and then faded on NQ

5098
02:00:44,790 --> 02:00:44,800
took that pivot out and then faded on NQ
 

5099
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:47,430
took that pivot out and then faded on NQ
we didn't. NQ's being a pain to trade

5100
02:00:47,430 --> 02:00:47,440
we didn't. NQ's being a pain to trade
 

5101
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:58,229
we didn't. NQ's being a pain to trade
today.

5102
02:00:58,229 --> 02:00:58,239

 

5103
02:00:58,239 --> 02:00:59,910

Don't like the CVD. I mean, we're boxed

5104
02:00:59,910 --> 02:00:59,920
Don't like the CVD. I mean, we're boxed
 

5105
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:02,470
Don't like the CVD. I mean, we're boxed
in really on CVD.

5106
02:01:02,470 --> 02:01:02,480
in really on CVD.
 

5107
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:08,390
in really on CVD.
Did it take that pivot out though?

5108
02:01:08,390 --> 02:01:08,400

 

5109
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:15,990

No, just boxed in.

5110
02:01:15,990 --> 02:01:16,000

 

5111
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,390

Yeah, probably done with that. That was

5112
02:01:18,390 --> 02:01:18,400
Yeah, probably done with that. That was
 

5113
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:20,390
Yeah, probably done with that. That was
That was a couple nice trades there. Not

5114
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:20,400
That was a couple nice trades there. Not
 

5115
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:22,470
That was a couple nice trades there. Not
the best, but uh made some good money on

5116
02:01:22,470 --> 02:01:22,480
the best, but uh made some good money on
 

5117
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:23,669
the best, but uh made some good money on
those.

5118
02:01:23,669 --> 02:01:23,679
those.
 

5119
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:25,350
those.
They lifted pretty aggressively which

5120
02:01:25,350 --> 02:01:25,360
They lifted pretty aggressively which
 

5121
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:32,629
They lifted pretty aggressively which
was good.

5122
02:01:32,629 --> 02:01:32,639

 

5123
02:01:32,639 --> 02:01:36,070

Same level 20s is going to be the level

5124
02:01:36,070 --> 02:01:36,080
Same level 20s is going to be the level
 

5125
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:38,390
Same level 20s is going to be the level
down here. This block here, we're just

5126
02:01:38,390 --> 02:01:38,400
down here. This block here, we're just
 

5127
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:39,589
down here. This block here, we're just
going to do this as gray. We're going to

5128
02:01:39,589 --> 02:01:39,599
going to do this as gray. We're going to
 

5129
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:41,189
going to do this as gray. We're going to
use that as our over under. We can

5130
02:01:41,189 --> 02:01:41,199
use that as our over under. We can
 

5131
02:01:41,199 --> 02:01:42,950
use that as our over under. We can
actually increase this size a bit if you

5132
02:01:42,950 --> 02:01:42,960
actually increase this size a bit if you
 

5133
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:44,550
actually increase this size a bit if you
want. Make it like to here because

5134
02:01:44,550 --> 02:01:44,560
want. Make it like to here because
 

5135
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:45,990
want. Make it like to here because
they've made it a little bit messy. So

5136
02:01:45,990 --> 02:01:46,000
they've made it a little bit messy. So
 

5137
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,830
they've made it a little bit messy. So
if they sell this now, then they're

5138
02:01:47,830 --> 02:01:47,840
if they sell this now, then they're
 

5139
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:49,270
if they sell this now, then they're
going to attack the 20s. If they lose

5140
02:01:49,270 --> 02:01:49,280
going to attack the 20s. If they lose
 

5141
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:50,950
going to attack the 20s. If they lose
the 20s, they're going to attack the IB

5142
02:01:50,950 --> 02:01:50,960
the 20s, they're going to attack the IB
 

5143
02:01:50,960 --> 02:02:00,950
the 20s, they're going to attack the IB
low.

5144
02:02:00,950 --> 02:02:00,960

 

5145
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:02,790

Can I look at gold? I can look at gold

5146
02:02:02,790 --> 02:02:02,800
Can I look at gold? I can look at gold
 

5147
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:12,709
Can I look at gold? I can look at gold
for you. Yeah, I'll have a quick look.

5148
02:02:12,709 --> 02:02:12,719

 

5149
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:14,229

It's getting close to that level I'd be

5150
02:02:14,229 --> 02:02:14,239
It's getting close to that level I'd be
 

5151
02:02:14,239 --> 02:02:16,709
It's getting close to that level I'd be
interested in. All right, so gold no

5152
02:02:16,709 --> 02:02:16,719
interested in. All right, so gold no
 

5153
02:02:16,719 --> 02:02:18,550
interested in. All right, so gold no
different to anything else. All right,

5154
02:02:18,550 --> 02:02:18,560
different to anything else. All right,
 

5155
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:20,390
different to anything else. All right,
everyone freaked out about it all.

5156
02:02:20,390 --> 02:02:20,400
everyone freaked out about it all.
 

5157
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:21,669
everyone freaked out about it all.
Right. Higher time frame structure is

5158
02:02:21,669 --> 02:02:21,679
Right. Higher time frame structure is
 

5159
02:02:21,679 --> 02:02:23,910
Right. Higher time frame structure is
still good. So here's your base. All

5160
02:02:23,910 --> 02:02:23,920
still good. So here's your base. All
 

5161
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:25,830
still good. So here's your base. All
right. That's your like ABCD kind of

5162
02:02:25,830 --> 02:02:25,840
right. That's your like ABCD kind of
 

5163
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:28,390
right. That's your like ABCD kind of
pattern. There's the breakout, right?

5164
02:02:28,390 --> 02:02:28,400
pattern. There's the breakout, right?
 

5165
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:30,390
pattern. There's the breakout, right?
Breakout. There's your pullback. Have

5166
02:02:30,390 --> 02:02:30,400
Breakout. There's your pullback. Have
 

5167
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:32,790
Breakout. There's your pullback. Have
you lost anything? No. All right. So big

5168
02:02:32,790 --> 02:02:32,800
you lost anything? No. All right. So big
 

5169
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:34,390
you lost anything? No. All right. So big
pullback. I know it's dramatic, but

5170
02:02:34,390 --> 02:02:34,400
pullback. I know it's dramatic, but
 

5171
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:36,070
pullback. I know it's dramatic, but
that's a big move up. We expect a big

5172
02:02:36,070 --> 02:02:36,080
that's a big move up. We expect a big
 

5173
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:38,390
that's a big move up. We expect a big
move down. Right. It's start to found a

5174
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:38,400
move down. Right. It's start to found a
 

5175
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:40,790
move down. Right. It's start to found a
bid. What you'll be looking at now, all

5176
02:02:40,790 --> 02:02:40,800
bid. What you'll be looking at now, all
 

5177
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:42,790
bid. What you'll be looking at now, all
right, high time frame, people will be

5178
02:02:42,790 --> 02:02:42,800
right, high time frame, people will be
 

5179
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:44,149
right, high time frame, people will be
looking for is there going to be failure

5180
02:02:44,149 --> 02:02:44,159
looking for is there going to be failure
 

5181
02:02:44,159 --> 02:02:45,830
looking for is there going to be failure
to follow through. So if we do something

5182
02:02:45,830 --> 02:02:45,840
to follow through. So if we do something
 

5183
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:48,470
to follow through. So if we do something
like this, right, we're getting up into

5184
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:48,480
like this, right, we're getting up into
 

5185
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:50,629
like this, right, we're getting up into
those areas. If we were going to put,

5186
02:02:50,629 --> 02:02:50,639
those areas. If we were going to put,
 

5187
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:53,270
those areas. If we were going to put,
you know, some profile on it from the

5188
02:02:53,270 --> 02:02:53,280
you know, some profile on it from the
 

5189
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:54,870
you know, some profile on it from the
high. Let's just do one from the high.

5190
02:02:54,870 --> 02:02:54,880
high. Let's just do one from the high.
 

5191
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:56,310
high. Let's just do one from the high.
See if it will measure out for us. You

5192
02:02:56,310 --> 02:02:56,320
See if it will measure out for us. You
 

5193
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:57,510
See if it will measure out for us. You
going to give us one? No. You're going

5194
02:02:57,510 --> 02:02:57,520
going to give us one? No. You're going
 

5195
02:02:57,520 --> 02:02:59,589
going to give us one? No. You're going
to be a pain. Really? You're going to be

5196
02:02:59,589 --> 02:02:59,599
to be a pain. Really? You're going to be
 

5197
02:02:59,599 --> 02:03:02,470
to be a pain. Really? You're going to be
a pain. Okay.

5198
02:03:02,470 --> 02:03:02,480
a pain. Okay.
 

5199
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:05,109
a pain. Okay.
Hell, man.

5200
02:03:05,109 --> 02:03:05,119
Hell, man.
 

5201
02:03:05,119 --> 02:03:06,790
Hell, man.
Right. I'll be watching some of these

5202
02:03:06,790 --> 02:03:06,800
Right. I'll be watching some of these
 

5203
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:09,350
Right. I'll be watching some of these
nodes. So, we're starting to reclaim. In

5204
02:03:09,350 --> 02:03:09,360
nodes. So, we're starting to reclaim. In
 

5205
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:12,390
nodes. So, we're starting to reclaim. In
fact, let me just do this to that's from

5206
02:03:12,390 --> 02:03:12,400
fact, let me just do this to that's from
 

5207
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:15,750
fact, let me just do this to that's from
the high. Let's do it from the breakout.

5208
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:15,760
the high. Let's do it from the breakout.
 

5209
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:18,709
the high. Let's do it from the breakout.
Not you.

5210
02:03:18,709 --> 02:03:18,719
Not you.
 

5211

Not you.
this guy here. Let's do it from the

5212
02:03:21,189 --> 02:03:21,199
this guy here. Let's do it from the
 

5213
02:03:21,199 --> 02:03:23,430
this guy here. Let's do it from the
breakout here.

5214
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:23,440
breakout here.
 

5215
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:24,870
breakout here.
All right. I'll be watching this. Look

5216
02:03:24,870 --> 02:03:24,880
All right. I'll be watching this. Look
 

5217
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:26,470
All right. I'll be watching this. Look
at this here. I'll be watching this

5218
02:03:26,470 --> 02:03:26,480
at this here. I'll be watching this
 

5219
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:30,470
at this here. I'll be watching this
level here on gold.

5220
02:03:30,470 --> 02:03:30,480

 

5221
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:34,149

All right. Can we trade up into that?

5222
02:03:34,149 --> 02:03:34,159
All right. Can we trade up into that?
 

5223
02:03:34,159 --> 02:03:38,310
All right. Can we trade up into that?
What's that? F five 5,87 to sort of

5224
02:03:38,310 --> 02:03:38,320
What's that? F five 5,87 to sort of
 

5225
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:40,390
What's that? F five 5,87 to sort of
5,100. This kind of level here. Even

5226
02:03:40,390 --> 02:03:40,400
5,100. This kind of level here. Even
 

5227
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:43,510
5,100. This kind of level here. Even
from the 50% up to here. All right.

5228
02:03:43,510 --> 02:03:43,520
from the 50% up to here. All right.
 

5229
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:45,589
from the 50% up to here. All right.
Traders will be looking to see. All

5230
02:03:45,589 --> 02:03:45,599
Traders will be looking to see. All
 

5231
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:47,430
Traders will be looking to see. All
right. Those who are adamant that we are

5232
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:47,440
right. Those who are adamant that we are
 

5233
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:49,270
right. Those who are adamant that we are
done with gold will be looking to see if

5234
02:03:49,270 --> 02:03:49,280
done with gold will be looking to see if
 

5235
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:50,709
done with gold will be looking to see if
there's failure to follow through here.

5236
02:03:50,709 --> 02:03:50,719
there's failure to follow through here.
 

5237
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:53,189
there's failure to follow through here.
That will mean we come up here and that

5238
02:03:53,189 --> 02:03:53,199
That will mean we come up here and that
 

5239
02:03:53,199 --> 02:03:55,189
That will mean we come up here and that
buyers get stuck and they will trade it

5240
02:03:55,189 --> 02:03:55,199
buyers get stuck and they will trade it
 

5241
02:03:55,199 --> 02:03:56,790
buyers get stuck and they will trade it
back down into here. Then they'd be

5242
02:03:56,790 --> 02:03:56,800
back down into here. Then they'd be
 

5243
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,149
back down into here. Then they'd be
covering some here and then they'll be

5244
02:03:58,149 --> 02:03:58,159
covering some here and then they'll be
 

5245
02:03:58,159 --> 02:04:00,070
covering some here and then they'll be
looking to see if that is actually the

5246
02:04:00,070 --> 02:04:00,080
looking to see if that is actually the
 

5247
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:01,910
looking to see if that is actually the
top. They would need to see this break

5248
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:01,920
top. They would need to see this break
 

5249
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:03,830
top. They would need to see this break
down here in continuation. If you don't

5250
02:04:03,830 --> 02:04:03,840
down here in continuation. If you don't
 

5251
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:05,750
down here in continuation. If you don't
see that in gold, they'd be looking to

5252
02:04:05,750 --> 02:04:05,760
see that in gold, they'd be looking to
 

5253
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:08,149
see that in gold, they'd be looking to
base here and then reclaim. So it just

5254
02:04:08,149 --> 02:04:08,159
base here and then reclaim. So it just
 

5255
02:04:08,159 --> 02:04:11,109
base here and then reclaim. So it just
be a squeeze down, a failure to move

5256
02:04:11,109 --> 02:04:11,119
be a squeeze down, a failure to move
 

5257
02:04:11,119 --> 02:04:13,910
be a squeeze down, a failure to move
lower, base out, and then back up. and

5258
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:13,920
lower, base out, and then back up. and
 

5259
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,669
lower, base out, and then back up. and
continuation will be these will be your

5260
02:04:15,669 --> 02:04:15,679
continuation will be these will be your
 

5261
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:17,910
continuation will be these will be your
targets higher time frame. So anything's

5262
02:04:17,910 --> 02:04:17,920
targets higher time frame. So anything's
 

5263
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:19,910
targets higher time frame. So anything's
available right now. I wouldn't be want

5264
02:04:19,910 --> 02:04:19,920
available right now. I wouldn't be want
 

5265
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:21,669
available right now. I wouldn't be want
to be long here. That's for sure. Long

5266
02:04:21,669 --> 02:04:21,679
to be long here. That's for sure. Long
 

5267
02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:23,830
to be long here. That's for sure. Long
off here was good. Short off here, short

5268
02:04:23,830 --> 02:04:23,840
off here was good. Short off here, short
 

5269
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:25,990
off here was good. Short off here, short
of the fail, this move here, failure to

5270
02:04:25,990 --> 02:04:26,000
of the fail, this move here, failure to
 

5271
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,629
of the fail, this move here, failure to
follow through, great short. Failure to

5272
02:04:28,629 --> 02:04:28,639
follow through, great short. Failure to
 

5273
02:04:28,639 --> 02:04:30,310
follow through, great short. Failure to
follow through, great long. But you want

5274
02:04:30,310 --> 02:04:30,320
follow through, great long. But you want
 

5275
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:32,870
follow through, great long. But you want
to be taking profits here, right? And

5276
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:32,880
to be taking profits here, right? And
 

5277
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:35,109
to be taking profits here, right? And
then seeing if it fail fails to follow

5278
02:04:35,109 --> 02:04:35,119
then seeing if it fail fails to follow
 

5279
02:04:35,119 --> 02:04:37,030
then seeing if it fail fails to follow
through again, then you're looking to

5280
02:04:37,030 --> 02:04:37,040
through again, then you're looking to
 

5281
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:39,270
through again, then you're looking to
reshort back down. Hopefully that makes

5282
02:04:39,270 --> 02:04:39,280
reshort back down. Hopefully that makes
 

5283
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:59,910
reshort back down. Hopefully that makes
sense for you.

5284
02:04:59,910 --> 02:04:59,920

 

5285
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:01,589

QQQ might go lower, but you don't think

5286
02:05:01,589 --> 02:05:01,599
QQQ might go lower, but you don't think
 

5287
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:03,109
QQQ might go lower, but you don't think
we see it today. I mean, there's plenty

5288
02:05:03,109 --> 02:05:03,119
we see it today. I mean, there's plenty
 

5289
02:05:03,119 --> 02:05:06,149
we see it today. I mean, there's plenty
of time, guys. There's there's a lot of

5290
02:05:06,149 --> 02:05:06,159
of time, guys. There's there's a lot of
 

5291
02:05:06,159 --> 02:05:08,229
of time, guys. There's there's a lot of
time left for it to go lower if it wants

5292
02:05:08,229 --> 02:05:08,239
time left for it to go lower if it wants
 

5293
02:05:08,239 --> 02:05:11,350
time left for it to go lower if it wants
to. Um,

5294
02:05:11,350 --> 02:05:11,360
to. Um,
 

5295
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:13,510
to. Um,
we just have to understand that we

5296
02:05:13,510 --> 02:05:13,520
we just have to understand that we
 

5297
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:15,109
we just have to understand that we
probably need a liquidity building out

5298
02:05:15,109 --> 02:05:15,119
probably need a liquidity building out
 

5299
02:05:15,119 --> 02:05:17,669
probably need a liquidity building out
phase for a bit. It's been a big move.

5300
02:05:17,669 --> 02:05:17,679
phase for a bit. It's been a big move.
 

5301
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:18,870
phase for a bit. It's been a big move.
All right, let's think about what we've

5302
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:18,880
All right, let's think about what we've
 

5303
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:22,790
All right, let's think about what we've
done. The Sunday gap uh

5304
02:05:22,790 --> 02:05:22,800
done. The Sunday gap uh
 

5305
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:25,430
done. The Sunday gap uh
Sunday gap and fade down Monday morning,

5306
02:05:25,430 --> 02:05:25,440
Sunday gap and fade down Monday morning,
 

5307
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:29,589
Sunday gap and fade down Monday morning,
right? Gap and fade undercut reclaim

5308
02:05:29,589 --> 02:05:29,599
right? Gap and fade undercut reclaim
 

5309
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:31,990
right? Gap and fade undercut reclaim
straight bid up three drives. One we

5310
02:05:31,990 --> 02:05:32,000
straight bid up three drives. One we
 

5311
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,990
straight bid up three drives. One we
talked about this two mark premarket two

5312
02:05:33,990 --> 02:05:34,000
talked about this two mark premarket two
 

5313
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,430
talked about this two mark premarket two
three drives lost backside of that. We

5314
02:05:37,430 --> 02:05:37,440
three drives lost backside of that. We
 

5315
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:39,669
three drives lost backside of that. We
wanted this down to here would have been

5316
02:05:39,669 --> 02:05:39,679
wanted this down to here would have been
 

5317
02:05:39,679 --> 02:05:42,950
wanted this down to here would have been
nice didn't offer it us. Um we're coming

5318
02:05:42,950 --> 02:05:42,960
nice didn't offer it us. Um we're coming
 

5319
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:45,030
nice didn't offer it us. Um we're coming
into previous week's value area low. We

5320
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:45,040
into previous week's value area low. We
 

5321
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:48,390
into previous week's value area low. We
have a big cluster here which we expect

5322
02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:48,400
have a big cluster here which we expect
 

5323
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:50,390
have a big cluster here which we expect
the market to find a bid from. All

5324
02:05:50,390 --> 02:05:50,400
the market to find a bid from. All
 

5325
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:52,229
the market to find a bid from. All
right, we have lots of time to do that.

5326
02:05:52,229 --> 02:05:52,239
right, we have lots of time to do that.
 

5327
02:05:52,239 --> 02:05:54,390
right, we have lots of time to do that.
It might need what would be ideal is a

5328
02:05:54,390 --> 02:05:54,400
It might need what would be ideal is a
 

5329
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:57,030
It might need what would be ideal is a
pullback into here which is then resold

5330
02:05:57,030 --> 02:05:57,040
pullback into here which is then resold
 

5331
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:58,709
pullback into here which is then resold
down into this and then we can see our

5332
02:05:58,709 --> 02:05:58,719
down into this and then we can see our
 

5333
02:05:58,719 --> 02:06:01,189
down into this and then we can see our
buyers are there actually buyers down

5334
02:06:01,189 --> 02:06:01,199
buyers are there actually buyers down
 

5335
02:06:01,199 --> 02:06:03,030
buyers are there actually buyers down
here. Are there actually higher time

5336
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:03,040
here. Are there actually higher time
 

5337
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:04,709
here. Are there actually higher time
frame buyers down here? That is a bit

5338
02:06:04,709 --> 02:06:04,719
frame buyers down here? That is a bit
 

5339
02:06:04,719 --> 02:06:06,310
frame buyers down here? That is a bit
like what we just talked about on gold.

5340
02:06:06,310 --> 02:06:06,320
like what we just talked about on gold.
 

5341
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:08,629
like what we just talked about on gold.
If we fail to follow through up here,

5342
02:06:08,629 --> 02:06:08,639
If we fail to follow through up here,
 

5343
02:06:08,639 --> 02:06:10,390
If we fail to follow through up here,
right? If we now we have these buyers

5344
02:06:10,390 --> 02:06:10,400
right? If we now we have these buyers
 

5345
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:13,350
right? If we now we have these buyers
trapped, we have these buyers trapped.

5346
02:06:13,350 --> 02:06:13,360
trapped, we have these buyers trapped.
 

5347
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:15,510
trapped, we have these buyers trapped.
All right. If we reject all of these and

5348
02:06:15,510 --> 02:06:15,520
All right. If we reject all of these and
 

5349
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:17,750
All right. If we reject all of these and
fail to follow through, we will see

5350
02:06:17,750 --> 02:06:17,760
fail to follow through, we will see
 

5351
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:20,229
fail to follow through, we will see
lower prices in this market. But there's

5352
02:06:20,229 --> 02:06:20,239
lower prices in this market. But there's
 

5353
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:22,149
lower prices in this market. But there's
a big butt.

5354
02:06:22,149 --> 02:06:22,159
a big butt.
 

5355
02:06:22,159 --> 02:06:24,790
a big butt.
We have to be respectful

5356
02:06:24,790 --> 02:06:24,800
We have to be respectful
 

5357
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:26,629
We have to be respectful
of the daily, right? So, if we're going

5358
02:06:26,629 --> 02:06:26,639
of the daily, right? So, if we're going
 

5359
02:06:26,639 --> 02:06:29,109
of the daily, right? So, if we're going
to see failure to follow through, right?

5360
02:06:29,109 --> 02:06:29,119
to see failure to follow through, right?
 

5361
02:06:29,119 --> 02:06:30,629
to see failure to follow through, right?
Good rejection here. We're going to need

5362
02:06:30,629 --> 02:06:30,639
Good rejection here. We're going to need
 

5363
02:06:30,639 --> 02:06:33,270
Good rejection here. We're going to need
to reject somewhere in here and we're

5364
02:06:33,270 --> 02:06:33,280
to reject somewhere in here and we're
 

5365
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:34,709
to reject somewhere in here and we're
going to need to start breaking down

5366
02:06:34,709 --> 02:06:34,719
going to need to start breaking down
 

5367
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:36,550
going to need to start breaking down
underneath these levels. If we start

5368
02:06:36,550 --> 02:06:36,560
underneath these levels. If we start
 

5369
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:38,470
underneath these levels. If we start
breaking down underneath these levels,

5370
02:06:38,470 --> 02:06:38,480
breaking down underneath these levels,
 

5371
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:39,990
breaking down underneath these levels,
we will get this turn down here. this

5372
02:06:39,990 --> 02:06:40,000
we will get this turn down here. this
 

5373
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,589
we will get this turn down here. this
will come back down and instead of

5374
02:06:41,589 --> 02:06:41,599
will come back down and instead of
 

5375
02:06:41,599 --> 02:06:43,109
will come back down and instead of
looking for this here, we will look for

5376
02:06:43,109 --> 02:06:43,119
looking for this here, we will look for
 

5377
02:06:43,119 --> 02:06:44,870
looking for this here, we will look for
this down here into this 200 day which

5378
02:06:44,870 --> 02:06:44,880
this down here into this 200 day which
 

5379
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:48,550
this down here into this 200 day which
is getting very close to this. So

5380
02:06:48,550 --> 02:06:48,560
is getting very close to this. So
 

5381
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:51,830
is getting very close to this. So
this is an area of interest right into

5382
02:06:51,830 --> 02:06:51,840
this is an area of interest right into
 

5383
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:54,629
this is an area of interest right into
here at the moment. Um and then beyond

5384
02:06:54,629 --> 02:06:54,639
here at the moment. Um and then beyond
 

5385
02:06:54,639 --> 02:06:56,950
here at the moment. Um and then beyond
that we can talk about this as a buying

5386
02:06:56,950 --> 02:06:56,960
that we can talk about this as a buying
 

5387
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:58,470
that we can talk about this as a buying
opportunity

5388
02:06:58,470 --> 02:06:58,480
opportunity
 

5389
02:06:58,480 --> 02:07:01,830
opportunity
under that then uh good night. Good

5390
02:07:01,830 --> 02:07:01,840
under that then uh good night. Good
 

5391

night. Uh
 

5393
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:08,629
night. Uh
yeah, these are marking up not too bad.

5394
02:07:08,629 --> 02:07:08,639
yeah, these are marking up not too bad.
 

5395
02:07:08,639 --> 02:07:11,589
yeah, these are marking up not too bad.
30% pullback would be into and around

5396
02:07:11,589 --> 02:07:11,599
30% pullback would be into and around
 

5397
02:07:11,599 --> 02:07:13,990
30% pullback would be into and around
these 200 days. So, anything's possible

5398
02:07:13,990 --> 02:07:14,000
these 200 days. So, anything's possible
 

5399
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,910
these 200 days. So, anything's possible
right now. Uh because we're in that

5400
02:07:15,910 --> 02:07:15,920
right now. Uh because we're in that
 

5401
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:18,310
right now. Uh because we're in that
choppy range, right? And see last week

5402
02:07:18,310 --> 02:07:18,320
choppy range, right? And see last week
 

5403
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:21,350
choppy range, right? And see last week
failed to break out the highs. Uh Mon,

5404
02:07:21,350 --> 02:07:21,360
failed to break out the highs. Uh Mon,
 

5405
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:22,950
failed to break out the highs. Uh Mon,
Sunday, Monday failed to break out the

5406
02:07:22,950 --> 02:07:22,960
Sunday, Monday failed to break out the
 

5407
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:25,430
Sunday, Monday failed to break out the
lows. Most your range is in here. You

5408
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:25,440
lows. Most your range is in here. You
 

5409
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,990
lows. Most your range is in here. You
can see that by here. All right. This is

5410
02:07:27,990 --> 02:07:28,000
can see that by here. All right. This is
 

5411
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,830
can see that by here. All right. This is
the rotation

5412
02:07:29,830 --> 02:07:29,840
the rotation
 

5413
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:31,430
the rotation
until they prove otherwise. They get

5414
02:07:31,430 --> 02:07:31,440
until they prove otherwise. They get
 

5415
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:34,790
until they prove otherwise. They get
this great. They get this great in here.

5416
02:07:34,790 --> 02:07:34,800
this great. They get this great in here.
 

5417
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:45,750
this great. They get this great in here.
Well, Alex hates in here.

5418
02:07:45,750 --> 02:07:45,760

 

5419
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:48,069

Um,

5420
02:07:48,069 --> 02:07:48,079
Um,
 

5421
02:07:48,079 --> 02:07:49,990
Um,
what's BTC doing? Where are we trading

5422
02:07:49,990 --> 02:07:50,000
what's BTC doing? Where are we trading
 

5423
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,069
what's BTC doing? Where are we trading
at? That 77. So, we're getting

5424
02:07:52,069 --> 02:07:52,079
at? That 77. So, we're getting
 

5425
02:07:52,079 --> 02:07:55,589
at? That 77. So, we're getting
interesting on BTC as well.

5426
02:07:55,589 --> 02:07:55,599
interesting on BTC as well.
 

5427
02:07:55,599 --> 02:07:57,510
interesting on BTC as well.
We are

5428
02:07:57,510 --> 02:07:57,520
We are
 

5429
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:00,470
We are
not at a level yet, but we're getting

5430
02:08:00,470 --> 02:08:00,480
not at a level yet, but we're getting
 

5431
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:03,109
not at a level yet, but we're getting
close.

5432
02:08:03,109 --> 02:08:03,119
close.
 

5433
02:08:03,119 --> 02:08:10,470
close.
Have we undercut?

5434
02:08:10,470 --> 02:08:10,480

 

5435
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:13,910

I want to see this get wrecked.

5436
02:08:13,910 --> 02:08:13,920
I want to see this get wrecked.
 

5437
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:18,550
I want to see this get wrecked.
I want to see a mega stop hunt here.

5438
02:08:18,550 --> 02:08:18,560
I want to see a mega stop hunt here.
 

5439
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:23,189
I want to see a mega stop hunt here.
And I want to see a measured move.

5440
02:08:23,189 --> 02:08:23,199
And I want to see a measured move.
 

5441
02:08:23,199 --> 02:08:25,030
And I want to see a measured move.
In terms of percentages, when we think

5442
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:25,040
In terms of percentages, when we think
 

5443
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:27,030
In terms of percentages, when we think
about these dumps that we have after the

5444
02:08:27,030 --> 02:08:27,040
about these dumps that we have after the
 

5445
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:29,430
about these dumps that we have after the
thousand day cycle,

5446
02:08:29,430 --> 02:08:29,440
thousand day cycle,
 

5447
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:35,830
thousand day cycle,
that's a 31%

5448
02:08:35,830 --> 02:08:35,840

 

5449
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:38,709

Yeah, into here would be nice. And that

5450
02:08:38,709 --> 02:08:38,719
Yeah, into here would be nice. And that
 

5451
02:08:38,719 --> 02:08:40,390
Yeah, into here would be nice. And that
give us a 70 overall, which would be

5452
02:08:40,390 --> 02:08:40,400
give us a 70 overall, which would be
 

5453
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:44,709
give us a 70 overall, which would be
ideal. No, not quite.

5454
02:08:44,709 --> 02:08:44,719
ideal. No, not quite.
 

5455
02:08:44,719 --> 02:08:51,430
ideal. No, not quite.
I think it's coming.

5456
02:08:51,430 --> 02:08:51,440

 

5457
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:54,790

I think we're like here.

5458
02:08:54,790 --> 02:08:54,800
I think we're like here.
 

5459
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:58,550
I think we're like here.
See, these are like the 70 70% moves.

5460
02:08:58,550 --> 02:08:58,560
See, these are like the 70 70% moves.
 

5461
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:01,430
See, these are like the 70 70% moves.
There you go. 77% in a bare market

5462
02:09:01,430 --> 02:09:01,440
There you go. 77% in a bare market
 

5463
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:08,790
There you go. 77% in a bare market
cycle. This is not unusual

5464
02:09:08,790 --> 02:09:08,800

 

5465
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:11,270

84%.

5466
02:09:11,270 --> 02:09:11,280
84%.
 

5467
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:13,669
84%.
All right. So, it's possible if they do

5468
02:09:13,669 --> 02:09:13,679
All right. So, it's possible if they do
 

5469
02:09:13,679 --> 02:09:16,709
All right. So, it's possible if they do
a measured move

5470
02:09:16,709 --> 02:09:16,719
a measured move
 

5471
02:09:16,719 --> 02:09:19,430
a measured move
down into here is possible. It might be

5472
02:09:19,430 --> 02:09:19,440
down into here is possible. It might be
 

5473
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:21,109
down into here is possible. It might be
like never possible. It's absolutely

5474
02:09:21,109 --> 02:09:21,119
like never possible. It's absolutely
 

5475
02:09:21,119 --> 02:09:24,470
like never possible. It's absolutely
possible because for

5476
02:09:24,470 --> 02:09:24,480
possible because for
 

5477
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:25,750
possible because for
I don't know if they can measure this

5478
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:25,760
I don't know if they can measure this
 

5479
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:29,990
I don't know if they can measure this
out, but too big. That's probably only

5480
02:09:29,990 --> 02:09:30,000
out, but too big. That's probably only
 

5481
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,589
out, but too big. That's probably only
It's just a golden pocket. It's very

5482
02:09:31,589 --> 02:09:31,599
It's just a golden pocket. It's very
 

5483
02:09:31,599 --> 02:09:34,470
It's just a golden pocket. It's very
doable. So, I'd like to see BTC run

5484
02:09:34,470 --> 02:09:34,480
doable. So, I'd like to see BTC run
 

5485
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:36,550
doable. So, I'd like to see BTC run
these stops and come down anywhere in

5486
02:09:36,550 --> 02:09:36,560
these stops and come down anywhere in
 

5487
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:39,430
these stops and come down anywhere in
here. Just start running stops and then

5488
02:09:39,430 --> 02:09:39,440
here. Just start running stops and then
 

5489
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:41,109
here. Just start running stops and then
see see if we can base out for a bit.

5490
02:09:41,109 --> 02:09:41,119
see see if we can base out for a bit.
 

5491
02:09:41,119 --> 02:09:42,629
see see if we can base out for a bit.
It's It's going to take time, guys.

5492
02:09:42,629 --> 02:09:42,639
It's It's going to take time, guys.
 

5493
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:44,310
It's It's going to take time, guys.
Everyone that's looking for BTC, we have

a th00and day. That's a th00and plus
 

5497
02:09:46,719 --> 02:09:49,990
a th00and day. That's a th00and plus
days, which is normal for BTC,

5498
02:09:49,990 --> 02:09:50,000
days, which is normal for BTC,
 

5499
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:53,270
days, which is normal for BTC,
right? We have a thousand plus days

5500
02:09:53,270 --> 02:09:53,280
right? We have a thousand plus days
 

5501
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:55,589
right? We have a thousand plus days
normal for BTC.

A thousand plus days
 

5505
02:09:57,920 --> 02:09:59,910
A thousand plus days
normal for BTC. And then we normally see

5506
02:09:59,910 --> 02:09:59,920
normal for BTC. And then we normally see
 

5507
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:03,109
normal for BTC. And then we normally see
a 70 plus% pullback, right? Pullbacks,

5508
02:10:03,109 --> 02:10:03,119
a 70 plus% pullback, right? Pullbacks,
 

5509
02:10:03,119 --> 02:10:05,030
a 70 plus% pullback, right? Pullbacks,
pullbacks. We're only just getting

5510
02:10:05,030 --> 02:10:05,040
pullbacks. We're only just getting
 

5511
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:07,510
pullbacks. We're only just getting
started. It started in October. The last

5512
02:10:07,510 --> 02:10:07,520
started. It started in October. The last
 

5513
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:09,589
started. It started in October. The last
one started

5514
02:10:09,589 --> 02:10:09,599
one started
 

5515
02:10:09,599 --> 02:10:13,030
one started
November 21 and finished no. So, it

5516
02:10:13,030 --> 02:10:13,040
November 21 and finished no. So, it
 

5517
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:14,790
November 21 and finished no. So, it
takes a year. So, we can go all the way

5518
02:10:14,790 --> 02:10:14,800
takes a year. So, we can go all the way
 

5519
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:17,030
takes a year. So, we can go all the way
until October

5520
02:10:17,030 --> 02:10:17,040
until October
 

5521
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:21,510
until October
26, which would be like here.

5522
02:10:21,510 --> 02:10:21,520
26, which would be like here.
 

5523
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:23,750
26, which would be like here.
It's very possible that we do some some

5524
02:10:23,750 --> 02:10:23,760
It's very possible that we do some some
 

5525
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:25,109
It's very possible that we do some some
stuff like this. I know everyone's like

5526
02:10:25,109 --> 02:10:25,119
stuff like this. I know everyone's like
 

5527
02:10:25,119 --> 02:10:26,950
stuff like this. I know everyone's like
the market's different, institutions are

5528
02:10:26,950 --> 02:10:26,960
the market's different, institutions are
 

5529
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:29,750
the market's different, institutions are
different now. I don't know. We do that

5530
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:29,760
different now. I don't know. We do that
 

5531
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:31,910
different now. I don't know. We do that
kind of move then I will start buying I

5532
02:10:31,910 --> 02:10:31,920
kind of move then I will start buying I
 

5533
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:34,790
kind of move then I will start buying I
bet. I'm interested now for for a trade

5534
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:34,800
bet. I'm interested now for for a trade
 

5535
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:36,870
bet. I'm interested now for for a trade
if we swipe and and do a fail breakout.

5536
02:10:36,870 --> 02:10:36,880
if we swipe and and do a fail breakout.
 

5537
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:38,229
if we swipe and and do a fail breakout.
I'm interested in a trade, not an

5538
02:10:38,229 --> 02:10:38,239
I'm interested in a trade, not an
 

5539
02:10:38,239 --> 02:10:40,550
I'm interested in a trade, not an
investment. I'm interested in a trade.

5540
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:40,560
investment. I'm interested in a trade.
 

5541
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:55,189
investment. I'm interested in a trade.
We'll see.

5542
02:10:55,189 --> 02:10:55,199

 

5543
02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:57,750

What do you consider to be more

5544
02:10:57,750 --> 02:10:57,760
What do you consider to be more
 

5545
02:10:57,760 --> 02:10:59,589
What do you consider to be more
important levels? High volume nodes or

5546
02:10:59,589 --> 02:10:59,599
important levels? High volume nodes or
 

5547
02:10:59,599 --> 02:11:01,030
important levels? High volume nodes or
low volume nodes depend on the setup.

5548
02:11:01,030 --> 02:11:01,040
low volume nodes depend on the setup.
 

5549
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:02,709
low volume nodes depend on the setup.
High volume nodes obviously is an area

5550
02:11:02,709 --> 02:11:02,719
High volume nodes obviously is an area
 

5551
02:11:02,719 --> 02:11:04,550
High volume nodes obviously is an area
of liquidity being built up. That is

5552
02:11:04,550 --> 02:11:04,560
of liquidity being built up. That is
 

5553
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:06,390
of liquidity being built up. That is
important level for to use as an

5554
02:11:06,390 --> 02:11:06,400
important level for to use as an
 

5555
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:08,310
important level for to use as an
overunder. So like we're starting to get

5556
02:11:08,310 --> 02:11:08,320
overunder. So like we're starting to get
 

5557
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:10,950
overunder. So like we're starting to get
stuck here. When we leave these a high

5558
02:11:10,950 --> 02:11:10,960
stuck here. When we leave these a high
 

5559
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:13,430
stuck here. When we leave these a high
volume node, we look to trade through a

5560
02:11:13,430 --> 02:11:13,440
volume node, we look to trade through a
 

5561
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:15,350
volume node, we look to trade through a
low volume node. Low volume nodes can

5562
02:11:15,350 --> 02:11:15,360
low volume node. Low volume nodes can
 

5563
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:17,750
low volume node. Low volume nodes can
act as like resistance or support. So

5564
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:17,760
act as like resistance or support. So
 

5565
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:19,830
act as like resistance or support. So
why? Because it's thin and then sell

5566
02:11:19,830 --> 02:11:19,840
why? Because it's thin and then sell
 

5567
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:22,629
why? Because it's thin and then sell
that back down from there. Um, but I

5568
02:11:22,629 --> 02:11:22,639
that back down from there. Um, but I
 

5569
02:11:22,639 --> 02:11:24,629
that back down from there. Um, but I
like tra I like trading from high volume

5570
02:11:24,629 --> 02:11:24,639
like tra I like trading from high volume
 

5571
02:11:24,639 --> 02:11:26,390
like tra I like trading from high volume
to high volume, right? So, if you see

5572
02:11:26,390 --> 02:11:26,400
to high volume, right? So, if you see
 

5573
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:28,790
to high volume, right? So, if you see
all the things that I mark out, if we

5574
02:11:28,790 --> 02:11:28,800
all the things that I mark out, if we
 

5575
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:30,629
all the things that I mark out, if we
think about the higher volume nodes on

5576
02:11:30,629 --> 02:11:30,639
think about the higher volume nodes on
 

5577
02:11:30,639 --> 02:11:34,149
think about the higher volume nodes on
the hourly charts, gray box, gray box,

5578
02:11:34,149 --> 02:11:34,159
the hourly charts, gray box, gray box,
 

5579
02:11:34,159 --> 02:11:36,550
the hourly charts, gray box, gray box,
blue box, there was a gray box down

5580
02:11:36,550 --> 02:11:36,560
blue box, there was a gray box down
 

5581
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:38,149
blue box, there was a gray box down
here. So, we trade from high volume to

5582
02:11:38,149 --> 02:11:38,159
here. So, we trade from high volume to
 

5583
02:11:38,159 --> 02:11:39,910
here. So, we trade from high volume to
high volume. High volume to high volume,

5584
02:11:39,910 --> 02:11:39,920
high volume. High volume to high volume,
 

5585
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:42,149
high volume. High volume to high volume,
high volume possibly to high volume,

5586
02:11:42,149 --> 02:11:42,159
high volume possibly to high volume,
 

5587
02:11:42,159 --> 02:11:44,390
high volume possibly to high volume,
right? So, I use that as my key levels

5588
02:11:44,390 --> 02:11:44,400
right? So, I use that as my key levels
 

5589
02:11:44,400 --> 02:11:47,109
right? So, I use that as my key levels
to trade to. And then you can use lower

5590
02:11:47,109 --> 02:11:47,119
to trade to. And then you can use lower
 

5591
02:11:47,119 --> 02:11:49,589
to trade to. And then you can use lower
volume nodes like this right here as

5592
02:11:49,589 --> 02:11:49,599
volume nodes like this right here as
 

5593
02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:58,550
volume nodes like this right here as
like potential trap plays.

5594
02:11:58,550 --> 02:11:58,560

 

5595
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:00,069

Watching my live is like a trading

5596
02:12:00,069 --> 02:12:00,079
Watching my live is like a trading
 

5597
02:12:00,079 --> 02:12:03,510
Watching my live is like a trading
course. Yeah, it is. I try and explain

5598
02:12:03,510 --> 02:12:03,520
course. Yeah, it is. I try and explain
 

5599
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:05,910
course. Yeah, it is. I try and explain
box to box is previous week low down

5600
02:12:05,910 --> 02:12:05,920
box to box is previous week low down
 

5601
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:11,669
box to box is previous week low down
here. Uh yeah, just under it. Yeah, 365.

5602
02:12:11,669 --> 02:12:11,679

 

5603
02:12:11,679 --> 02:12:13,270

Um,

5604
02:12:13,270 --> 02:12:13,280
Um,
 

5605
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:14,709
Um,
is that previous like week low or is

5606
02:12:14,709 --> 02:12:14,719
is that previous like week low or is
 

5607
02:12:14,719 --> 02:12:19,030
is that previous like week low or is
that previous day low?

5608
02:12:19,030 --> 02:12:19,040

 

5609
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:21,589

Uh,

5610
02:12:21,589 --> 02:12:21,599
Uh,
 

5611
02:12:21,599 --> 02:12:23,109
Uh,
um,

5612
02:12:23,109 --> 02:12:23,119
um,
 

5613
02:12:23,119 --> 02:12:25,189
um,
yeah, it's previous week low. You're

5614
02:12:25,189 --> 02:12:25,199
yeah, it's previous week low. You're
 

5615
02:12:25,199 --> 02:12:26,629
yeah, it's previous week low. You're
right. It's previous week low. Yeah,

5616
02:12:26,629 --> 02:12:26,639
right. It's previous week low. Yeah,
 

5617
02:12:26,639 --> 02:12:30,149
right. It's previous week low. Yeah,
365. Uh, lower bold today is 320 on the

5618
02:12:30,149 --> 02:12:30,159
365. Uh, lower bold today is 320 on the
 

5619
02:12:30,159 --> 02:12:31,910
365. Uh, lower bold today is 320 on the
daily.

5620
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:31,920
daily.
 

5621
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:33,189
daily.
Market's now gone to sleep. It's

5622
02:12:33,189 --> 02:12:33,199
Market's now gone to sleep. It's
 

5623
02:12:33,199 --> 02:12:34,310
Market's now gone to sleep. It's
digesting, but you can see we're

5624
02:12:34,310 --> 02:12:34,320
digesting, but you can see we're
 

5625
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:35,589
digesting, but you can see we're
starting to roll over here. So, there's

5626
02:12:35,589 --> 02:12:35,599
starting to roll over here. So, there's
 

5627
02:12:35,599 --> 02:12:37,589
starting to roll over here. So, there's
a good chance here. So they've done this

5628
02:12:37,589 --> 02:12:37,599
a good chance here. So they've done this
 

5629
02:12:37,599 --> 02:12:41,350
a good chance here. So they've done this
like multi-

5630
02:12:41,350 --> 02:12:41,360

 

5631
02:12:41,360 --> 02:12:43,189

squeeze up, run the stops, and you're

5632
02:12:43,189 --> 02:12:43,199
squeeze up, run the stops, and you're
 

5633
02:12:43,199 --> 02:12:44,950
squeeze up, run the stops, and you're
starting to see them use this liquidity

5634
02:12:44,950 --> 02:12:44,960
starting to see them use this liquidity
 

5635
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:46,790
starting to see them use this liquidity
now back to the 20s. This same level,

5636
02:12:46,790 --> 02:12:46,800
now back to the 20s. This same level,
 

5637
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:49,270
now back to the 20s. This same level,
remember 20s. And if they lose that,

5638
02:12:49,270 --> 02:12:49,280
remember 20s. And if they lose that,
 

5639
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:51,189
remember 20s. And if they lose that,
then you can make potentially lower day

5640
02:12:51,189 --> 02:12:51,199
then you can make potentially lower day
 

5641
02:12:51,199 --> 02:12:53,350
then you can make potentially lower day
in a swipe down. 20s is a big level

5642
02:12:53,350 --> 02:12:53,360
in a swipe down. 20s is a big level
 

5643
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:59,430
in a swipe down. 20s is a big level
though.

5644
02:12:59,430 --> 02:12:59,440

 

5645
02:12:59,440 --> 02:13:01,750

So here we are into the 20s and if we

5646
02:13:01,750 --> 02:13:01,760
So here we are into the 20s and if we
 

5647
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:03,109
So here we are into the 20s and if we
get acceptance lower here, then you

5648
02:13:03,109 --> 02:13:03,119
get acceptance lower here, then you
 

5649
02:13:03,119 --> 02:13:05,990
get acceptance lower here, then you
expect a new low of day.

5650
02:13:05,990 --> 02:13:06,000
expect a new low of day.
 

5651
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,350
expect a new low of day.
There were some sellers caught at the

5652
02:13:07,350 --> 02:13:07,360
There were some sellers caught at the
 

5653
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:11,669
There were some sellers caught at the
500s.

5654
02:13:11,669 --> 02:13:11,679

 

5655
02:13:11,679 --> 02:13:12,870

They're getting very aggressive with

5656
02:13:12,870 --> 02:13:12,880
They're getting very aggressive with
 

5657
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:15,109
They're getting very aggressive with
this.

5658
02:13:15,109 --> 02:13:15,119
this.
 

5659
02:13:15,119 --> 02:13:17,589
this.
So imbalance here just above 500s. I

5660
02:13:17,589 --> 02:13:17,599
So imbalance here just above 500s. I
 

5661
02:13:17,599 --> 02:13:19,350
So imbalance here just above 500s. I
would expect this will come and test the

5662
02:13:19,350 --> 02:13:19,360
would expect this will come and test the
 

5663
02:13:19,360 --> 02:13:22,709
would expect this will come and test the
500s and under that fresh lows. So you

5664
02:13:22,709 --> 02:13:22,719
500s and under that fresh lows. So you
 

5665
02:13:22,719 --> 02:13:23,990
500s and under that fresh lows. So you
can see this is why we said you don't

5666
02:13:23,990 --> 02:13:24,000
can see this is why we said you don't
 

5667
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:25,430
can see this is why we said you don't
want to hold. If it can't hold this,

5668
02:13:25,430 --> 02:13:25,440
want to hold. If it can't hold this,
 

5669
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:27,990
want to hold. If it can't hold this,
this is likely you remember I drew this

5670
02:13:27,990 --> 02:13:28,000
this is likely you remember I drew this
 

5671
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,589
this is likely you remember I drew this
out. we talked about ideally we would

5672
02:13:29,589 --> 02:13:29,599
out. we talked about ideally we would
 

5673
02:13:29,599 --> 02:13:30,790
out. we talked about ideally we would
have done this which is what we did on

5674
02:13:30,790 --> 02:13:30,800
have done this which is what we did on
 

5675
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:33,669
have done this which is what we did on
NQ and then we've lost this and this is

5676
02:13:33,669 --> 02:13:33,679
NQ and then we've lost this and this is
 

5677
02:13:33,679 --> 02:13:35,189
NQ and then we've lost this and this is
your short back down and this is the

5678
02:13:35,189 --> 02:13:35,199
your short back down and this is the
 

5679
02:13:35,199 --> 02:13:37,750
your short back down and this is the
continuation lower so if you're in this

5680
02:13:37,750 --> 02:13:37,760
continuation lower so if you're in this
 

5681
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:41,910
continuation lower so if you're in this
short IB low is a target and then this

5682
02:13:41,910 --> 02:13:41,920
short IB low is a target and then this
 

5683
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:44,550
short IB low is a target and then this
block down here very very possible right

5684
02:13:44,550 --> 02:13:44,560
block down here very very possible right
 

5685
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:53,189
block down here very very possible right
now this built liquidity to move lower

5686
02:13:53,189 --> 02:13:53,199

 

5687
02:13:53,199 --> 02:13:55,030

can I do this for the full day I mean I

5688
02:13:55,030 --> 02:13:55,040
can I do this for the full day I mean I
 

5689
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:57,189
can I do this for the full day I mean I
could but I'm not going to be exhausted

5690
02:13:57,189 --> 02:13:57,199
could but I'm not going to be exhausted
 

5691
02:13:57,199 --> 02:13:59,750
could but I'm not going to be exhausted
Good.

5692
02:13:59,750 --> 02:13:59,760
Good.
 

5693
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:01,510
Good.
What are my settings for the anchor? Uh

5694
02:14:01,510 --> 02:14:01,520
What are my settings for the anchor? Uh
 

5695
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:03,990
What are my settings for the anchor? Uh
9:30. Starts at the 9:30. I use ticks

5696
02:14:03,990 --> 02:14:04,000
9:30. Starts at the 9:30. I use ticks
 

5697
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,550
9:30. Starts at the 9:30. I use ticks
per row. Two ticks per row. Um I can

5698
02:14:06,550 --> 02:14:06,560
per row. Two ticks per row. Um I can
 

5699
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:08,229
per row. Two ticks per row. Um I can
bring it up for you. Ticks per row. Two

5700
02:14:08,229 --> 02:14:08,239
bring it up for you. Ticks per row. Two
 

5701
02:14:08,239 --> 02:14:11,030
bring it up for you. Ticks per row. Two
ticks per row. And I have it a width of

5702
02:14:11,030 --> 02:14:11,040
ticks per row. And I have it a width of
 

5703
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:12,390
ticks per row. And I have it a width of
20. That's all you need to change.

5704
02:14:12,390 --> 02:14:12,400
20. That's all you need to change.
 

5705
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:14,629
20. That's all you need to change.
Everything else is standard other than

5706
02:14:14,629 --> 02:14:14,639
Everything else is standard other than
 

5707
02:14:14,639 --> 02:14:22,950
Everything else is standard other than
the color obviously.

5708
02:14:22,950 --> 02:14:22,960

 

5709
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:24,709

So back down to these 500s. This is

5710
02:14:24,709 --> 02:14:24,719
So back down to these 500s. This is
 

5711
02:14:24,719 --> 02:14:25,910
So back down to these 500s. This is
where there were some sellers caught

5712
02:14:25,910 --> 02:14:25,920
where there were some sellers caught
 

5713
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:27,910
where there were some sellers caught
here a little bit earlier, but um we've

5714
02:14:27,910 --> 02:14:27,920
here a little bit earlier, but um we've
 

5715
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:30,310
here a little bit earlier, but um we've
been very very heavy unless they're

5716
02:14:30,310 --> 02:14:30,320
been very very heavy unless they're
 

5717
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:31,669
been very very heavy unless they're
going to protect these. Uh by the way,

5718
02:14:31,669 --> 02:14:31,679
going to protect these. Uh by the way,
 

5719
02:14:31,679 --> 02:14:33,350
going to protect these. Uh by the way,
you have divergence. ES just took out

5720
02:14:33,350 --> 02:14:33,360
you have divergence. ES just took out
 

5721
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:35,189
you have divergence. ES just took out
low of day and initial balance low. So

5722
02:14:35,189 --> 02:14:35,199
low of day and initial balance low. So
 

5723
02:14:35,199 --> 02:14:38,229
low of day and initial balance low. So
you do have divergence here just to make

5724
02:14:38,229 --> 02:14:38,239
you do have divergence here just to make
 

5725
02:14:38,239 --> 02:14:40,629
you do have divergence here just to make
it really hard. So ENQ couldn't take out

5726
02:14:40,629 --> 02:14:40,639
it really hard. So ENQ couldn't take out
 

5727
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:42,310
it really hard. So ENQ couldn't take out
the high and couldn't take out the low.

5728
02:14:42,310 --> 02:14:42,320
the high and couldn't take out the low.
 

5729
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:45,910
the high and couldn't take out the low.
Like

5730
02:14:45,910 --> 02:14:45,920

 

5731
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:49,830

they're being very dirty with it.

5732
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:49,840
they're being very dirty with it.
 

5733
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:51,910
they're being very dirty with it.

Blue EMA. Uh, these are the flow zones.
They're all rolling fibs. So, this is uh

5746
02:15:08,629 --> 02:15:08,639
They're all rolling fibs. So, this is uh
 

5747
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:13,669
They're all rolling fibs. So, this is uh
7289. These are 21 344 I think. Top of

5748
02:15:13,669 --> 02:15:13,679
7289. These are 21 344 I think. Top of
 

5749
02:15:13,679 --> 02:15:18,709
7289. These are 21 344 I think. Top of
my memory.

5751
02:15:18,719 --> 02:15:20,390

VIX starting to get going. So it held

5752
02:15:20,390 --> 02:15:20,400
VIX starting to get going. So it held
 

5753
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:23,750
VIX starting to get going. So it held
that base um on the VIX. Remember we

5754
02:15:23,750 --> 02:15:23,760
that base um on the VIX. Remember we
 

5755
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:25,669
that base um on the VIX. Remember we
talked about that base being held into

5756
02:15:25,669 --> 02:15:25,679
talked about that base being held into
 

5757
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:30,950
talked about that base being held into
sort of 17 807 sorry 1680 1675. It's now

02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:32,709
sort of 17 807 sorry 1680 1675. It's now
back up to high of day. If VIX starts

5760
02:15:32,709 --> 02:15:32,719
back up to high of day. If VIX starts
 

5761
02:15:32,719 --> 02:15:34,870
back up to high of day. If VIX starts
squeezing here it has gap fill potential

5762
02:15:34,870 --> 02:15:34,880
squeezing here it has gap fill potential
 

5763
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:47,270
squeezing here it has gap fill potential
to 1831 today.

02:19:29,509 --> 02:19:29,519
minute chart. you're going to be like,
 

5835
02:19:29,519 --> 02:19:30,629
minute chart. you're going to be like,
why does he want to use it on a one

5836
02:19:30,629 --> 02:19:30,639
why does he want to use it on a one
 

5837
02:19:30,639 --> 02:19:33,110
why does he want to use it on a one
minute chart? Just in case I do

minute chart? Just in case I do
 

5839
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:34,870
minute chart? Just in case I do
something stupid like come to the chart

5840
02:19:34,870 --> 02:19:34,880
something stupid like come to the chart
 

5841
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:37,429
something stupid like come to the chart
and not realize that the ATR is massive

5842
02:19:37,429 --> 02:19:37,439
and not realize that the ATR is massive
 

5843
02:19:37,439 --> 02:19:40,709
and not realize that the ATR is massive
on the day. If I see ATR, which is 30,

5844
02:19:40,709 --> 02:19:40,719
on the day. If I see ATR, which is 30,
 

5845
02:19:40,719 --> 02:19:43,429
on the day. If I see ATR, which is 30,
40, 50, 60 points per M1, and it's

5846
02:19:43,429 --> 02:19:43,439
40, 50, 60 points per M1, and it's
 

5847
02:19:43,439 --> 02:19:44,709
40, 50, 60 points per M1, and it's
staying up there, then I need to

5848
02:19:44,709 --> 02:19:44,719
staying up there, then I need to
 

5849
02:19:44,719 --> 02:19:47,030
staying up there, then I need to
seriously size down and that's what I

5850
02:19:47,030 --> 02:19:47,040
seriously size down and that's what I
 

5851
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:49,110
seriously size down and that's what I
use it just to like analyze my size. I

5852
02:19:49,110 --> 02:19:49,120
use it just to like analyze my size. I
 

5853

and VIX still starting to really get
 

5929
02:22:12,240 --> 02:22:13,830
and VIX still starting to really get
going. So, if we can break through these

5930
02:22:13,830 --> 02:22:13,840
going. So, if we can break through these
 

5931
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:15,670
going. So, if we can break through these
55s and get aggressive, we should trade

5932
02:22:15,670 --> 02:22:15,680
55s and get aggressive, we should trade
 

5933
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:20,230
55s and get aggressive, we should trade
up to sort of 18. What's that gap, Phil?

If we protect that level, then this

6090
02:27:13,670 --> 02:27:13,680
If we protect that level, then this
 

6091
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:16,710

seller 754
 

6093
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:19,030
seller 754
delta will remain stuck. All right? So

02:27:19,030 --> 02:27:19,040
delta will remain stuck. All right? So
 

6095
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:21,270
delta will remain stuck. All right? So
buyers will want to protect into here

6096

buyers will want to protect into here
 

6097

buyers will want to protect into here
and try and bid back up. If they're

6098
02:27:22,870 --> 02:27:22,880
and try and bid back up. If they're
 

6099
02:27:22,880 --> 02:27:25,270
and try and bid back up. If they're
unable to do that and this seller gets

6100
02:27:25,270 --> 02:27:25,280
unable to do that and this seller gets
 

6101
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:26,950
unable to do that and this seller gets
back in control, we will trade lower.

6102
02:27:26,950 --> 02:27:26,960
back in control, we will trade lower.
 

6103
02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:29,510
back in control, we will trade lower.

protect this, it's possible you can see
 

6107
02:27:30,960 --> 02:27:32,790
protect this, it's possible you can see
this imbalance holding. If it's

6108
02:27:32,790 --> 02:27:32,800
this imbalance holding. If it's
 

6109
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:34,389
this imbalance holding. If it's
imbalance that you would not see on any

6110
02:27:34,389 --> 02:27:34,399

6111
02:27:34,399 --> 02:27:36,150
imbalance that you would not see on any
other chart, it is holding. We just

6112
02:27:36,150 --> 02:27:36,160
other chart, it is holding. We just
 

6113
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:37,590
other chart, it is holding. We just
filled this imbalance. If they protect

6114
02:27:37,590 --> 02:27:37,600
filled this imbalance. If they protect
 

6115
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:39,349
filled this imbalance. If they protect
this seller here, all right, then we

6116
02:27:39,349 --> 02:27:39,359
this seller here, all right, then we
 

6117
02:27:39,359 --> 02:27:40,630
this seller here, all right, then we
will use his pain to try and lift

6118

02:27:42,309 --> 02:27:42,319
higher. That's the kind of thing I look
 

6121
02:27:42,319 --> 02:27:43,830
higher. That's the kind of thing I look
at on a lower time frame. If you're

6122
02:27:43,830 --> 02:27:43,840
at on a lower time frame. If you're
 

6123
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:46,150
at on a lower time frame. If you're
talking about like delta, you would need

6124
02:27:46,150 --> 02:27:46,160
talking about like delta, you would need
 

6125
02:27:46,160 --> 02:27:48,870
talking about like delta, you would need
like a different as in delta formed, you

6126
02:27:48,870 --> 02:27:48,880
like a different as in delta formed, you
 

6127
02:27:48,880 --> 02:27:50,389
like a different as in delta formed, you
would need a different indicator like

6128
02:27:50,389 --> 02:27:50,399
would need a different indicator like
 

6129
02:27:50,399 --> 02:27:52,950

6141
02:28:02,880 --> 02:28:06,230
I use it on bookmap? I would use this
here, right? Volume profile delta. If we

6142
02:28:06,230 --> 02:28:06,240
here, right? Volume profile delta. If we
 

6143
02:28:06,240 --> 02:28:08,710
here, right? Volume profile delta. If we
have a look at the low of day or if we

6144
02:28:08,710 --> 02:28:08,720
have a look at the low of day or if we
 

6145

lot that I kept saying to you today,
 

6149
02:28:12,800 --> 02:28:15,270
lot that I kept saying to you today,
520, right? 520 was a huge level we've

6150
02:28:15,270 --> 02:28:15,280
520, right? 520 was a huge level we've
 

6151
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:17,750
520, right? 520 was a huge level we've
talked about. If we scroll up here and

6152
02:28:17,750 --> 02:28:17,760
talked about. If we scroll up here and
 

6153
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:19,670
talked about. If we scroll up here and
come to 520, you will see right here

6154
02:28:19,670 --> 02:28:19,680
come to 520, you will see right here
 

6155
02:28:19,680 --> 02:28:23,270
come to 520, you will see right here
there was a 415 lot offside. 520 415 lot

6156
02:28:23,270 --> 02:28:23,280
there was a 415 lot offside. 520 415 lot
 

6157
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:25,190
there was a 415 lot offside. 520 415 lot
offside. So that means at some point

6158
02:28:25,190 --> 02:28:25,200
offside. So that means at some point
 

6159
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:29,190
offside. So that means at some point
today 415 lots were sold at the market,

6160
02:28:29,190 --> 02:28:29,200
today 415 lots were sold at the market,
 

6161
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:32,309
today 415 lots were sold at the market,
right? A market order sell. So if we get

6162
02:28:32,309 --> 02:28:32,319
right? A market order sell. So if we get
 

6163
02:28:32,319 --> 02:28:34,550
right? A market order sell. So if we get
back above them, then you have those

6164
02:28:34,550 --> 02:28:34,560
back above them, then you have those
 

6165
02:28:34,560 --> 02:28:40,230
back above them, then you have those
sellers and everyone below stuck.

6166
02:28:40,230 --> 02:28:40,240

 

6167
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:43,990

Uh it's a third party app that I use um

6168
02:28:43,990 --> 02:28:44,000
Uh it's a third party app that I use um
 

6169
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:49,510
Uh it's a third party app that I use um
for that. It is uh called Twin Peaks.

6170
02:28:49,510 --> 02:28:49,520
for that. It is uh called Twin Peaks.
 

6171
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:51,830
for that. It is uh called Twin Peaks.
Twin Peaks, but it's basically delta

6172
02:28:51,830 --> 02:28:51,840
Twin Peaks, but it's basically delta
 

6173
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:53,750
Twin Peaks, but it's basically delta
volume. It's basically the same volume

6174
02:28:53,750 --> 02:28:53,760
volume. It's basically the same volume
 

6175
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:57,750
volume. It's basically the same volume
profile delta, but it's shown as like a

6176
02:28:57,750 --> 02:28:57,760
profile delta, but it's shown as like a
 

6177
02:28:57,760 --> 02:29:00,710
profile delta, but it's shown as like a
um a profile rather than as a number as

6178
02:29:00,710 --> 02:29:00,720
um a profile rather than as a number as
 

6179
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:03,270
um a profile rather than as a number as
I have it here. So you can see also on

6180
02:29:03,270 --> 02:29:03,280
I have it here. So you can see also on
 

6181
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:05,670
I have it here. So you can see also on
bookmap you can see here at 500 you can

6182
02:29:05,670 --> 02:29:05,680
bookmap you can see here at 500 you can
 

6183
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:08,790
bookmap you can see here at 500 you can
see there's a 258 lot standing out at

6184
02:29:08,790 --> 02:29:08,800

There is no substitute for time. There

6212
02:29:47,429 --> 02:29:47,439
There is no substitute for time. There
 

6213
02:29:47,439 --> 02:29:50,550
There is no substitute for time. There
just isn't. the the 10,000 hour rule.

just isn't. the the 10,000 hour rule.
 

6215
02:29:50,560 --> 02:29:52,870
just isn't. the the 10,000 hour rule.
It's real, right? Once you've got your

6216
02:29:52,870 --> 02:29:52,880
It's real, right? Once you've got your
 

6217
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:54,710
It's real, right? Once you've got your
method, once you understand what you're

02:29:54,710 --> 02:29:54,720
method, once you understand what you're
 

6219
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:56,870
method, once you understand what you're
trying to learn, it's just about going

6220
02:29:56,870 --> 02:29:56,880
trying to learn, it's just about going
 

6221
02:29:56,880 --> 02:29:58,630
trying to learn, it's just about going
back and learning it and looking at the

6222
02:29:58,630 --> 02:29:58,640
back and learning it and looking at the
 

6223
02:29:58,640 --> 02:30:00,070
back and learning it and looking at the
same thing and the same thing and the

6224
02:30:00,070 --> 02:30:00,080
same thing and the same thing and the
 

6225
02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:02,070
same thing and the same thing and the
same thing. Can you spot the people who

6226
02:30:02,070 --> 02:30:02,080
same thing. Can you spot the people who
 

6227
02:30:02,080 --> 02:30:04,309
same thing. Can you spot the people who
are trapped? Can you spot the key levels

6228
02:30:04,309 --> 02:30:04,319
are trapped? Can you spot the key levels
 

6229
02:30:04,319 --> 02:30:06,309
are trapped? Can you spot the key levels
that we want want to trade into? Can you

6230
02:30:06,309 --> 02:30:06,319
that we want want to trade into? Can you
 

6231
02:30:06,319 --> 02:30:09,110
that we want want to trade into? Can you
use their pain to trade the other way

6232
02:30:09,110 --> 02:30:09,120
use their pain to trade the other way
 

6233
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:11,510
use their pain to trade the other way
from them? Can you see a signal of a

6234
02:30:11,510 --> 02:30:11,520
from them? Can you see a signal of a
 

6235
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:19,349
from them? Can you see a signal of a
whale in the market? Can you join it?

6236
02:30:19,349 --> 02:30:19,359

 

6237
02:30:19,359 --> 02:30:23,270

Takes time, guys. It really takes time.

6238
02:30:23,270 --> 02:30:23,280
Takes time, guys. It really takes time.
 

6239
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:26,469
Takes time, guys. It really takes time.
Okay, so you can see right now 520 and

6240
02:30:26,469 --> 02:30:26,479
Okay, so you can see right now 520 and
 

6241
02:30:26,479 --> 02:30:28,630
Okay, so you can see right now 520 and
500 rotation,

6242
02:30:28,630 --> 02:30:28,640
500 rotation,
 

6243
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:30,550
500 rotation,
right? No close under 500. We know

6244
02:30:30,550 --> 02:30:30,560
right? No close under 500. We know
 

6245
02:30:30,560 --> 02:30:34,150
right? No close under 500. We know
there's a seller stuck at 500

6246
02:30:34,150 --> 02:30:34,160
there's a seller stuck at 500
 

6247
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:37,910
there's a seller stuck at 500
and and 520. All right, 500 and 520

6248
02:30:37,910 --> 02:30:37,920
and and 520. All right, 500 and 520
 

6249
02:30:37,920 --> 02:30:39,750
and and 520. All right, 500 and 520
rotation. This is the buildout. So

6250
02:30:39,750 --> 02:30:39,760
rotation. This is the buildout. So
 

6251
02:30:39,760 --> 02:30:41,510
rotation. This is the buildout. So
through here, we lift to here. Under

6252
02:30:41,510 --> 02:30:41,520
through here, we lift to here. Under
 

6253
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:43,590
through here, we lift to here. Under
here, we jump, run these stops, and

6254
02:30:43,590 --> 02:30:43,600
here, we jump, run these stops, and
 

6255
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:44,710
here, we jump, run these stops, and
probably come down into here. This is

6256
02:30:44,710 --> 02:30:44,720
probably come down into here. This is
 

6257
02:30:44,720 --> 02:30:46,150
probably come down into here. This is
the buildout. Remember the protrend

6258
02:30:46,150 --> 02:30:46,160
the buildout. Remember the protrend
 

6259
02:30:46,160 --> 02:30:47,830
the buildout. Remember the protrend
currently is down. We caught the counter

6260
02:30:47,830 --> 02:30:47,840
currently is down. We caught the counter
 

6261
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:49,190
currently is down. We caught the counter
trend squeeze up. I missed all the

6262
02:30:49,190 --> 02:30:49,200
trend squeeze up. I missed all the
 

6263
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:51,030
trend squeeze up. I missed all the
shorts today unfortunately. Couldn't get

6264
02:30:51,030 --> 02:30:51,040
shorts today unfortunately. Couldn't get
 

6265
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:52,630
shorts today unfortunately. Couldn't get
a short trigger. I even this I would

6266
02:30:52,630 --> 02:30:52,640
a short trigger. I even this I would
 

6267
02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:53,910
a short trigger. I even this I would
have liked it a little bit higher.

6268
02:30:53,910 --> 02:30:53,920
have liked it a little bit higher.
 

6269
02:30:53,920 --> 02:30:55,910
have liked it a little bit higher.
Arguably I could have taken this short

6270
02:30:55,910 --> 02:30:55,920
Arguably I could have taken this short
 

6271
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:57,030
Arguably I could have taken this short
here. I knew it was very high

6272
02:30:57,030 --> 02:30:57,040
here. I knew it was very high
 

6273
02:30:57,040 --> 02:30:58,790
here. I knew it was very high
probability but it just goes against my

6274
02:30:58,790 --> 02:30:58,800
probability but it just goes against my
 

6275
02:30:58,800 --> 02:31:01,190
probability but it just goes against my
rules of trading near lower of days. All

6276
02:31:01,190 --> 02:31:01,200
rules of trading near lower of days. All
 

6277
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:03,830
rules of trading near lower of days. All
right. Much rather see this base and

6278
02:31:03,830 --> 02:31:03,840
right. Much rather see this base and
 

6279
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:05,830
right. Much rather see this base and
squeeze out and then offer a short

6280
02:31:05,830 --> 02:31:05,840
squeeze out and then offer a short
 

6281
02:31:05,840 --> 02:31:07,030
squeeze out and then offer a short
somewhere up here. It would be much

6282
02:31:07,030 --> 02:31:07,040
somewhere up here. It would be much
 

6283
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:08,630
somewhere up here. It would be much
better. Oh, don't move that. I'm going

6284
02:31:08,630 --> 02:31:08,640
better. Oh, don't move that. I'm going
 

6285
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:11,349
better. Oh, don't move that. I'm going
to need that. Okay. So, back to the 20s

6286
02:31:11,349 --> 02:31:11,359
to need that. Okay. So, back to the 20s
 

6287
02:31:11,359 --> 02:31:13,030
to need that. Okay. So, back to the 20s
again.

6288
02:31:13,030 --> 02:31:13,040
again.
 

6289
02:31:13,040 --> 02:31:15,110
again.
You can see this rotation over and over

6290
02:31:15,110 --> 02:31:15,120
You can see this rotation over and over
 

6291
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:20,550
You can see this rotation over and over
and over again.

6292
02:31:20,550 --> 02:31:20,560

 

6293
02:31:20,560 --> 02:31:22,630

I've been a member for almost a year now

6294
02:31:22,630 --> 02:31:22,640
I've been a member for almost a year now
 

6295
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:24,230
I've been a member for almost a year now
and I'm still learning every day. Thanks

6296
02:31:24,230 --> 02:31:24,240
and I'm still learning every day. Thanks
 

6297
02:31:24,240 --> 02:31:25,590
and I'm still learning every day. Thanks
so much for the value, Alex. You're

6298
02:31:25,590 --> 02:31:25,600
so much for the value, Alex. You're
 

6299
02:31:25,600 --> 02:31:27,590
so much for the value, Alex. You're
welcome. You're welcome. So, um I feel

6300
02:31:27,590 --> 02:31:27,600
welcome. You're welcome. So, um I feel
 

6301
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:29,270
welcome. You're welcome. So, um I feel
bad today, guys, because we wanted the

6302
02:31:29,270 --> 02:31:29,280
bad today, guys, because we wanted the
 

6303
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:31,270
bad today, guys, because we wanted the
short. We talked, if you go back to the

6304
02:31:31,270 --> 02:31:31,280
short. We talked, if you go back to the
 

6305
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:33,429
short. We talked, if you go back to the
stream, we wanted the short under here

6306
02:31:33,429 --> 02:31:33,439
stream, we wanted the short under here
 

6307
02:31:33,439 --> 02:31:35,429
stream, we wanted the short under here
if it retested. We wanted the short

6308
02:31:35,429 --> 02:31:35,439
if it retested. We wanted the short
 

6309
02:31:35,439 --> 02:31:37,590
if it retested. We wanted the short
under here if it retested. I feel bad

6310
02:31:37,590 --> 02:31:37,600
under here if it retested. I feel bad
 

6311
02:31:37,600 --> 02:31:40,309
under here if it retested. I feel bad
guys that, you know, after last week of

6312
02:31:40,309 --> 02:31:40,319
guys that, you know, after last week of
 

6313
02:31:40,319 --> 02:31:42,550
guys that, you know, after last week of
having multiple amazing days, all we

6314
02:31:42,550 --> 02:31:42,560
having multiple amazing days, all we
 

6315
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:44,469
having multiple amazing days, all we
needed was this to come up here or this

6316
02:31:44,469 --> 02:31:44,479
needed was this to come up here or this
 

6317
02:31:44,479 --> 02:31:46,870
needed was this to come up here or this
to build out a bit nicer. And the same

6318
02:31:46,870 --> 02:31:46,880
to build out a bit nicer. And the same
 

6319
02:31:46,880 --> 02:31:49,910
to build out a bit nicer. And the same
here, this to just do this, right? I

6320
02:31:49,910 --> 02:31:49,920
here, this to just do this, right? I
 

6321
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:52,150
here, this to just do this, right? I
don't like chasing these kind of moves.

6322
02:31:52,150 --> 02:31:52,160
don't like chasing these kind of moves.
 

6323
02:31:52,160 --> 02:31:53,670
don't like chasing these kind of moves.
Look how aggressive that is. We move

6324
02:31:53,670 --> 02:31:53,680
Look how aggressive that is. We move
 

6325
02:31:53,680 --> 02:31:57,830
Look how aggressive that is. We move
from almost 800 to 550 in one, two,

6326
02:31:57,830 --> 02:31:57,840
from almost 800 to 550 in one, two,
 

6327
02:31:57,840 --> 02:32:03,110
from almost 800 to 550 in one, two,
three, four, five, six minutes. I mean,

6328
02:32:03,110 --> 02:32:03,120

 

6329
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:05,750

very hard, very hard when we do that to

6330
02:32:05,750 --> 02:32:05,760
very hard, very hard when we do that to
 

6331
02:32:05,760 --> 02:32:09,190
very hard, very hard when we do that to
be involved.

6332
02:32:09,190 --> 02:32:09,200

 

6333
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:10,309

What are the clouds again? They're

6334
02:32:10,309 --> 02:32:10,319
What are the clouds again? They're
 

6335
02:32:10,319 --> 02:32:12,710
What are the clouds again? They're
called the flow flow zones. They're just

6336
02:32:12,710 --> 02:32:12,720
called the flow flow zones. They're just
 

6337
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:14,389
called the flow flow zones. They're just
roll. If you just do rolling fibs,

6338
02:32:14,389 --> 02:32:14,399
roll. If you just do rolling fibs,
 

6339
02:32:14,399 --> 02:32:18,469
roll. If you just do rolling fibs,
they're just rolling fibs.

6340
02:32:18,469 --> 02:32:18,479

 

6341
02:32:18,479 --> 02:32:20,710

So, this this is my momentum cloud. This

6342
02:32:20,710 --> 02:32:20,720
So, this this is my momentum cloud. This
 

6343
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:22,870
So, this this is my momentum cloud. This
is showing you current momentum. This is

6344
02:32:22,870 --> 02:32:22,880
is showing you current momentum. This is
 

6345
02:32:22,880 --> 02:32:25,190
is showing you current momentum. This is
deep pullback. This is based on fibs.

6346
02:32:25,190 --> 02:32:25,200
deep pullback. This is based on fibs.
 

6347
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:26,710
deep pullback. This is based on fibs.
Deep pullback. So, you can see we came

6348
02:32:26,710 --> 02:32:26,720
Deep pullback. So, you can see we came
 

6349
02:32:26,720 --> 02:32:28,630
Deep pullback. So, you can see we came
into the deep pullback. We failed. We

6350
02:32:28,630 --> 02:32:28,640
into the deep pullback. We failed. We
 

6351
02:32:28,640 --> 02:32:30,389
into the deep pullback. We failed. We
came into momentum, we failed. We

6352
02:32:30,389 --> 02:32:30,399
came into momentum, we failed. We
 

6353
02:32:30,399 --> 02:32:31,670
came into momentum, we failed. We
flipped the clouds here this morning

6354
02:32:31,670 --> 02:32:31,680
flipped the clouds here this morning
 

6355
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:33,510
flipped the clouds here this morning
after being a big pump and then

6356
02:32:33,510 --> 02:32:33,520
after being a big pump and then
 

6357
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:35,830
after being a big pump and then
sideways. So, big pump and then

6358
02:32:35,830 --> 02:32:35,840
sideways. So, big pump and then
 

6359
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:38,070
sideways. So, big pump and then
sideways. And we're repricing this whole

6360
02:32:38,070 --> 02:32:38,080
sideways. And we're repricing this whole
 

6361
02:32:38,080 --> 02:32:40,150
sideways. And we're repricing this whole
move from yesterday, which now means

6362
02:32:40,150 --> 02:32:40,160
move from yesterday, which now means
 

6363
02:32:40,160 --> 02:32:42,790
move from yesterday, which now means
we've left all these players trapped.

6364
02:32:42,790 --> 02:32:42,800
we've left all these players trapped.
 

6365
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:45,270
we've left all these players trapped.
Have we revisited it? No. The revisit

6366
02:32:45,270 --> 02:32:45,280
Have we revisited it? No. The revisit
 

6367
02:32:45,280 --> 02:32:46,950
Have we revisited it? No. The revisit
would have been here and we would have

6368
02:32:46,950 --> 02:32:46,960
would have been here and we would have
 

6369
02:32:46,960 --> 02:32:48,870
would have been here and we would have
played that down. We just didn't revisit

6370
02:32:48,870 --> 02:32:48,880
played that down. We just didn't revisit
 

6371
02:32:48,880 --> 02:32:51,349
played that down. We just didn't revisit
it. It's annoying. Very, very, very

6372
02:32:51,349 --> 02:32:51,359
it. It's annoying. Very, very, very
 

6373
02:32:51,359 --> 02:33:02,950
it. It's annoying. Very, very, very
annoying when the market does this.

6374
02:33:02,950 --> 02:33:02,960

 

6375
02:33:02,960 --> 02:33:04,469

more of your confidence level and

6376
02:33:04,469 --> 02:33:04,479
more of your confidence level and
 

6377
02:33:04,479 --> 02:33:06,150
more of your confidence level and
understanding all the dynamics of the

6378
02:33:06,150 --> 02:33:06,160
understanding all the dynamics of the
 

6379
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:07,910
understanding all the dynamics of the
market. Your skill is next level. I'm

6380
02:33:07,910 --> 02:33:07,920
market. Your skill is next level. I'm
 

6381
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:09,670
market. Your skill is next level. I'm
trying to absorb as much as you can as I

6382
02:33:09,670 --> 02:33:09,680
trying to absorb as much as you can as I
 

6383
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:11,750
trying to absorb as much as you can as I
can. Just keep showing up, man. I've

6384
02:33:11,750 --> 02:33:11,760
can. Just keep showing up, man. I've
 

6385
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:14,309
can. Just keep showing up, man. I've
been doing this a long time. A long

6386
02:33:14,309 --> 02:33:14,319
been doing this a long time. A long
 

6387
02:33:14,319 --> 02:33:17,270
been doing this a long time. A long
time. I'd say my trading has signific

6388
02:33:17,270 --> 02:33:17,280
time. I'd say my trading has signific
 

6389
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:18,870
time. I'd say my trading has signific
got significantly better the last few

6390
02:33:18,870 --> 02:33:18,880
got significantly better the last few
 

6391
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:22,150
got significantly better the last few
years, but there's still so much room

6392
02:33:22,150 --> 02:33:22,160
years, but there's still so much room
 

6393
02:33:22,160 --> 02:33:24,710
years, but there's still so much room
for me to improve as a trader. It's

6394
02:33:24,710 --> 02:33:24,720
for me to improve as a trader. It's
 

6395
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:27,030
for me to improve as a trader. It's
insane. I think long as we're never

6396
02:33:27,030 --> 02:33:27,040
insane. I think long as we're never
 

6397
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:29,750
insane. I think long as we're never
arrogant in the market or at all in life

6398
02:33:29,750 --> 02:33:29,760
arrogant in the market or at all in life
 

6399
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:31,830
arrogant in the market or at all in life
and just understand that, you know,

6400
02:33:31,830 --> 02:33:31,840
and just understand that, you know,
 

6401
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:33,830
and just understand that, you know,
we're here for a short time on this

6402
02:33:33,830 --> 02:33:33,840
we're here for a short time on this
 

6403
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:36,389
we're here for a short time on this
earth, our job is to learn as much as we

6404
02:33:36,389 --> 02:33:36,399
earth, our job is to learn as much as we
 

6405

can and be better at what we do. Whether

6406
02:33:38,710 --> 02:33:38,720
can and be better at what we do. Whether
 

6407
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:41,750
can and be better at what we do. Whether
that be your job, whether that be as a

6408
02:33:41,750 --> 02:33:41,760
that be your job, whether that be as a
 

6409
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:44,550
that be your job, whether that be as a
partner to someone, as a mother or

6410
02:33:44,550 --> 02:33:44,560
partner to someone, as a mother or

being, we can always do better, right?

6416
02:33:51,670 --> 02:33:51,680
being, we can always do better, right?
 

6417
02:33:51,680 --> 02:33:53,670
being, we can always do better, right?
We can always do better. You never stop

6418
02:33:53,670 --> 02:33:53,680
We can always do better. You never stop
 

6419
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:55,349
We can always do better. You never stop
learning. And the moment you think that

6420
02:33:55,349 --> 02:33:55,359
learning. And the moment you think that
 

6421
02:33:55,359 --> 02:33:57,429
learning. And the moment you think that
you know it all, well, you will be

6422
02:33:57,429 --> 02:33:57,439
you know it all, well, you will be
 

6423
02:33:57,439 --> 02:33:59,750
you know it all, well, you will be
humbled. Whether it's by the market or

6424
02:33:59,750 --> 02:33:59,760
humbled. Whether it's by the market or
 

6425
02:33:59,760 --> 02:34:02,230
humbled. Whether it's by the market or
by someone else,

6426
02:34:02,230 --> 02:34:02,240
by someone else,
 

6427
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:04,630
by someone else,
still the rotation. 500 to 520. Still

6428
02:34:04,630 --> 02:34:04,640
still the rotation. 500 to 520. Still
 

6429
02:34:04,640 --> 02:34:07,190
still the rotation. 500 to 520. Still
the rotation.

6430
02:34:07,190 --> 02:34:07,200
the rotation.
 

6431
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:11,110
the rotation.
Nothing's changed here.

6432
02:34:11,110 --> 02:34:11,120

 

6433
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:12,710

Did I have a down phase in this game?

6434
02:34:12,710 --> 02:34:12,720
Did I have a down phase in this game?
 

6435
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:16,389
Did I have a down phase in this game?
Oh, yeah. I got absolutely

6436
02:34:16,389 --> 02:34:16,399
Oh, yeah. I got absolutely
 

6437
02:34:16,399 --> 02:34:18,870
Oh, yeah. I got absolutely
cooked.

6438
02:34:18,870 --> 02:34:18,880
cooked.
 

6439
02:34:18,880 --> 02:34:21,910
cooked.
More like cucked uh during the early

6440
02:34:21,910 --> 02:34:21,920
More like cucked uh during the early
 

6441
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:25,030
More like cucked uh during the early
days of COVID. Oh yeah. So during those

6442
02:34:25,030 --> 02:34:25,040
days of COVID. Oh yeah. So during those
 

6443
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:29,429
days of COVID. Oh yeah. So during those
days I was playing um

6444
02:34:29,429 --> 02:34:29,439
days I was playing um
 

6445
02:34:29,439 --> 02:34:34,070
days I was playing um
two to max three standard deviation

6446
02:34:34,070 --> 02:34:34,080
two to max three standard deviation
 

6447
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:36,710
two to max three standard deviation
shorts on small caps. All right. So back

6448
02:34:36,710 --> 02:34:36,720
shorts on small caps. All right. So back
 

6449
02:34:36,720 --> 02:34:38,630
shorts on small caps. All right. So back
in the day a small cap would normally

6450
02:34:38,630 --> 02:34:38,640
in the day a small cap would normally
 

6451
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:41,030
in the day a small cap would normally
move two to three standard deviations

6452
02:34:41,030 --> 02:34:41,040
move two to three standard deviations
 

6453
02:34:41,040 --> 02:34:42,870
move two to three standard deviations
prior to COVID. That's what you'd see.

6454
02:34:42,870 --> 02:34:42,880
prior to COVID. That's what you'd see.
 

6455
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:44,309
prior to COVID. That's what you'd see.
So you'd see a news release in the

6456
02:34:44,309 --> 02:34:44,319
So you'd see a news release in the
 

6457
02:34:44,319 --> 02:34:46,630
So you'd see a news release in the
morning. So news release would come out

6458
02:34:46,630 --> 02:34:46,640
morning. So news release would come out
 

6459
02:34:46,640 --> 02:34:49,270
morning. So news release would come out
and it'd say this company's cured

6460
02:34:49,270 --> 02:34:49,280
and it'd say this company's cured
 

6461
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:52,150
and it'd say this company's cured
cancer. All right. and it would be up, I

6462
02:34:52,150 --> 02:34:52,160
cancer. All right. and it would be up, I
 

6463
02:34:52,160 --> 02:34:55,110
cancer. All right. and it would be up, I
don't know, 100%, 200%, and it would be

6464
02:34:55,110 --> 02:34:55,120
don't know, 100%, 200%, and it would be
 

6465
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:58,070
don't know, 100%, 200%, and it would be
past a two standard deviation, right?

6466
02:34:58,070 --> 02:34:58,080
past a two standard deviation, right?
 

6467
02:34:58,080 --> 02:34:59,429
past a two standard deviation, right?
And you'd be like, "All right, well,

6468
02:34:59,429 --> 02:34:59,439
And you'd be like, "All right, well,
 

6469
02:34:59,439 --> 02:35:01,429
And you'd be like, "All right, well,
that's [\h__\h] This thing is covered

6470
02:35:01,429 --> 02:35:01,439
that's [\h__\h] This thing is covered
 

6471
02:35:01,439 --> 02:35:04,150
that's [\h__\h] This thing is covered
in warrants. They've got so many people

6472
02:35:04,150 --> 02:35:04,160
in warrants. They've got so many people
 

6473
02:35:04,160 --> 02:35:05,670
in warrants. They've got so many people
stuck in this. I'm going to short it."

6474
02:35:05,670 --> 02:35:05,680
stuck in this. I'm going to short it."
 

6475
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:07,190
stuck in this. I'm going to short it."
And it worked for a very, very, very,

6476
02:35:07,190 --> 02:35:07,200
And it worked for a very, very, very,
 

6477
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:09,670
And it worked for a very, very, very,
very, very long time. And then COVID

6478
02:35:09,670 --> 02:35:09,680
very, very long time. And then COVID
 

6479
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:11,990
very, very long time. And then COVID
happened. And then retail got stimulus

6480
02:35:11,990 --> 02:35:12,000
happened. And then retail got stimulus
 

6481
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:13,990
happened. And then retail got stimulus
checks. And then we stopped going two

6482
02:35:13,990 --> 02:35:14,000
checks. And then we stopped going two
 

6483
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:15,750
checks. And then we stopped going two
and three standard deviations. And we

6484
02:35:15,750 --> 02:35:15,760
and three standard deviations. And we
 

6485
02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:19,590
and three standard deviations. And we
started going four, five, six, seven,

6486
02:35:19,590 --> 02:35:19,600
started going four, five, six, seven,
 

6487
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:22,630
started going four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, 10 standard deviations. And

6488
02:35:22,630 --> 02:35:22,640
eight, nine, 10 standard deviations. And
 

6489
02:35:22,640 --> 02:35:26,550
eight, nine, 10 standard deviations. And
Alex goting cooked in that numerous

6490
02:35:26,550 --> 02:35:26,560
Alex goting cooked in that numerous
 

6491
02:35:26,560 --> 02:35:29,750
Alex goting cooked in that numerous
times. And it wasn't prop firm. I lost

6492
02:35:29,750 --> 02:35:29,760
times. And it wasn't prop firm. I lost
 

6493
02:35:29,760 --> 02:35:32,389
times. And it wasn't prop firm. I lost
$20,000 more than once on some of those

6494
02:35:32,389 --> 02:35:32,399
$20,000 more than once on some of those
 

6495
02:35:32,399 --> 02:35:34,230
$20,000 more than once on some of those
moves, right? So, I got absolutely

6496
02:35:34,230 --> 02:35:34,240
moves, right? So, I got absolutely
 

6497
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:37,830
moves, right? So, I got absolutely
wrecked and I had to really

6498
02:35:37,830 --> 02:35:37,840
wrecked and I had to really
 

6499
02:35:37,840 --> 02:35:40,070
wrecked and I had to really
get off the mark. or not market to like

6500
02:35:40,070 --> 02:35:40,080
get off the mark. or not market to like
 

6501
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:43,429
get off the mark. or not market to like
really reanalyze my trading,

6502
02:35:43,429 --> 02:35:43,439
really reanalyze my trading,
 

6503
02:35:43,439 --> 02:35:46,230
really reanalyze my trading,
work out what was uh

6504
02:35:46,230 --> 02:35:46,240
work out what was uh
 

6505
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:48,230
work out what was uh
not working, where I'd gone wrong. I had

6506
02:35:48,230 --> 02:35:48,240
not working, where I'd gone wrong. I had
 

6507
02:35:48,240 --> 02:35:49,990
not working, where I'd gone wrong. I had
to scrap that whole way of trading. I

6508
02:35:49,990 --> 02:35:50,000
to scrap that whole way of trading. I
 

6509
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,150
to scrap that whole way of trading. I
had to stop picking tops, although you

6510
02:35:52,150 --> 02:35:52,160
had to stop picking tops, although you
 

6511
02:35:52,160 --> 02:35:54,469
had to stop picking tops, although you
have to really pick tops on um small

6512
02:35:54,469 --> 02:35:54,479
have to really pick tops on um small
 

6513
02:35:54,479 --> 02:35:55,750
have to really pick tops on um small
caps because you don't have much room to

6514
02:35:55,750 --> 02:35:55,760
caps because you don't have much room to
 

6515
02:35:55,760 --> 02:35:57,429
caps because you don't have much room to
play with. But I started playing more

6516
02:35:57,429 --> 02:35:57,439
play with. But I started playing more
 

6517
02:35:57,439 --> 02:35:58,790
play with. But I started playing more
failed follow-through. And then I

6518
02:35:58,790 --> 02:35:58,800
failed follow-through. And then I
 

6519
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:00,710
failed follow-through. And then I
started developing like an EMA system to

6520
02:36:00,710 --> 02:36:00,720
started developing like an EMA system to
 

6521
02:36:00,720 --> 02:36:03,190
started developing like an EMA system to
try and help and yada yada yada yada.

6522
02:36:03,190 --> 02:36:03,200
try and help and yada yada yada yada.
 

6523
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:04,550
try and help and yada yada yada yada.
All right, but don't don't think I

6524
02:36:04,550 --> 02:36:04,560
All right, but don't don't think I
 

6525
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:07,270
All right, but don't don't think I
didn't lose. I'd lost a lot of money. A

6526
02:36:07,270 --> 02:36:07,280
didn't lose. I'd lost a lot of money. A
 

6527
02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:09,510
didn't lose. I'd lost a lot of money. A
lot of money.

6528
02:36:09,510 --> 02:36:09,520
lot of money.
 

6529
02:36:09,520 --> 02:36:11,910
lot of money.
Am I looking long? Not yet. Not yet.

6530
02:36:11,910 --> 02:36:11,920
Am I looking long? Not yet. Not yet.
 

6531
02:36:11,920 --> 02:36:13,270
Am I looking long? Not yet. Not yet.
We've had We've had the long relief,

6532
02:36:13,270 --> 02:36:13,280
We've had We've had the long relief,
 

6533
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:14,469
We've had We've had the long relief,
right? We've had the long relief. We're

6534
02:36:14,469 --> 02:36:14,479
right? We've had the long relief. We're
 

6535
02:36:14,479 --> 02:36:16,070
right? We've had the long relief. We're
just in a There's nothing to do yet.

6536
02:36:16,070 --> 02:36:16,080
just in a There's nothing to do yet.
 

6537
02:36:16,080 --> 02:36:18,550
just in a There's nothing to do yet.
Look, we're in a rotation 20 to 500. We

6538
02:36:18,550 --> 02:36:18,560
Look, we're in a rotation 20 to 500. We
 

6539
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:20,230
Look, we're in a rotation 20 to 500. We
just talked about it, right? We're in a

6540
02:36:20,230 --> 02:36:20,240
just talked about it, right? We're in a
 

6541
02:36:20,240 --> 02:36:23,270
just talked about it, right? We're in a
rotation here to here and sellers can

6542
02:36:23,270 --> 02:36:23,280
rotation here to here and sellers can
 

6543
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:25,190
rotation here to here and sellers can
still protect this. All right. This

6544
02:36:25,190 --> 02:36:25,200
still protect this. All right. This
 

6545
02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:27,190
still protect this. All right. This
still has lowhanging fruit down here to

6546
02:36:27,190 --> 02:36:27,200
still has lowhanging fruit down here to
 

6547
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:30,469
still has lowhanging fruit down here to
come and take. Um if we get back above

6548
02:36:30,469 --> 02:36:30,479
come and take. Um if we get back above
 

6549
02:36:30,479 --> 02:36:32,230
come and take. Um if we get back above
all of this, all right, then we can

6550
02:36:32,230 --> 02:36:32,240
all of this, all right, then we can
 

6551
02:36:32,240 --> 02:36:34,150
all of this, all right, then we can
think about that relief, right, to come

6552
02:36:34,150 --> 02:36:34,160
think about that relief, right, to come
 

6553
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:36,230
think about that relief, right, to come
and run these out. But you want to be

6554
02:36:36,230 --> 02:36:36,240
and run these out. But you want to be
 

6555
02:36:36,240 --> 02:36:38,309
and run these out. But you want to be
careful right now picking picking bots

6556
02:36:38,309 --> 02:36:38,319
careful right now picking picking bots
 

6557
02:36:38,319 --> 02:36:39,990
careful right now picking picking bots
down here, right? Because the main move

6558
02:36:39,990 --> 02:36:40,000
down here, right? Because the main move
 

6559
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:41,910
down here, right? Because the main move
is in a sell, right? There's the sell.

6560
02:36:41,910 --> 02:36:41,920
is in a sell, right? There's the sell.
 

6561
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:43,270
is in a sell, right? There's the sell.
There's the first pullback. You could

6562
02:36:43,270 --> 02:36:43,280
There's the first pullback. You could
 

6563
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:45,270
There's the first pullback. You could
argue that that's pathetic. That's the

6564
02:36:45,270 --> 02:36:45,280
argue that that's pathetic. That's the
 

6565
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:47,830
argue that that's pathetic. That's the
first pullback. All right. And they've

6566
02:36:47,830 --> 02:36:47,840
first pullback. All right. And they've
 

6567
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:49,429
first pullback. All right. And they've
sold it. I think they want to run these

6568
02:36:49,429 --> 02:36:49,439
sold it. I think they want to run these
 

6569
02:36:49,439 --> 02:36:51,030
sold it. I think they want to run these
stops and come down into here like we've

6570
02:36:51,030 --> 02:36:51,040
stops and come down into here like we've
 

6571
02:36:51,040 --> 02:36:52,790
stops and come down into here like we've
talked about, which is what you're

6572
02:36:52,790 --> 02:36:52,800
talked about, which is what you're
 

6573
02:36:52,800 --> 02:36:57,990
talked about, which is what you're
starting to see.

6574
02:36:57,990 --> 02:36:58,000

 

6575
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:02,790

When did I get into futures? Uh

6576
02:37:02,790 --> 02:37:02,800

 

6577
02:37:02,800 --> 02:37:05,670

maybe four years ago. Three years ago,

6578
02:37:05,670 --> 02:37:05,680
maybe four years ago. Three years ago,
 

6579
02:37:05,680 --> 02:37:07,510
maybe four years ago. Three years ago,
what are we now? 2026. Three years

6580
02:37:07,510 --> 02:37:07,520
what are we now? 2026. Three years
 

6581
02:37:07,520 --> 02:37:10,309
what are we now? 2026. Three years
maybe. Three years ago, I moved from

6582
02:37:10,309 --> 02:37:10,319
maybe. Three years ago, I moved from
 

6583
02:37:10,319 --> 02:37:12,309
maybe. Three years ago, I moved from
small caps to midcaps, from midcaps to

6584
02:37:12,309 --> 02:37:12,319
small caps to midcaps, from midcaps to
 

6585
02:37:12,319 --> 02:37:14,230
small caps to midcaps, from midcaps to
large caps, from large caps to ETFs.

6586
02:37:14,230 --> 02:37:14,240
large caps, from large caps to ETFs.
 

6587
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:16,309
large caps, from large caps to ETFs.
That that was my journey, right? And

6588
02:37:16,309 --> 02:37:16,319
That that was my journey, right? And
 

6589
02:37:16,319 --> 02:37:18,070
That that was my journey, right? And
then I moved to futures. I still trade

6590
02:37:18,070 --> 02:37:18,080
then I moved to futures. I still trade
 

6591
02:37:18,080 --> 02:37:21,110
then I moved to futures. I still trade
large caps and ETFs. That's still my a

6592
02:37:21,110 --> 02:37:21,120
large caps and ETFs. That's still my a
 

6593
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:24,710
large caps and ETFs. That's still my a
big source of income for me,

6594
02:37:24,710 --> 02:37:24,720
big source of income for me,
 

6595
02:37:24,720 --> 02:37:29,830
big source of income for me,
but I do that as a swing position.

6596
02:37:29,830 --> 02:37:29,840

 

6597
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:31,429

We like the lowhanging fruits. Yes, we

6598
02:37:31,429 --> 02:37:31,439
We like the lowhanging fruits. Yes, we
 

6599
02:37:31,439 --> 02:37:45,349
We like the lowhanging fruits. Yes, we
do. We do like the low hanging fruits.

6600
02:37:45,349 --> 02:37:45,359

 

6601
02:37:45,359 --> 02:37:46,950

What's the fib cloud? These are my

6602
02:37:46,950 --> 02:37:46,960
What's the fib cloud? These are my
 

6603
02:37:46,960 --> 02:37:48,950
What's the fib cloud? These are my
clouds. This is everything you see here

6604
02:37:48,950 --> 02:37:48,960
clouds. This is everything you see here
 

6605
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:52,469
clouds. This is everything you see here
is from my system, right?

6606
02:37:52,469 --> 02:37:52,479
is from my system, right?
 

6607
02:37:52,479 --> 02:37:55,429
is from my system, right?
Flow zone system pro.

6608
02:37:55,429 --> 02:37:55,439
Flow zone system pro.
 

6609
02:37:55,439 --> 02:37:59,270
Flow zone system pro.
So, it's clouds uh its GlobeEx levels,

6610
02:37:59,270 --> 02:37:59,280
So, it's clouds uh its GlobeEx levels,
 

6611
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:02,469
So, it's clouds uh its GlobeEx levels,
its opening range, its initial balance,

6612
02:38:02,469 --> 02:38:02,479
its opening range, its initial balance,
 

6613
02:38:02,479 --> 02:38:07,429
its opening range, its initial balance,
its uh multi-time frame trend, it's uh

6614
02:38:07,429 --> 02:38:07,439
its uh multi-time frame trend, it's uh
 

6615
02:38:07,439 --> 02:38:08,950
its uh multi-time frame trend, it's uh
daily and weekly levels. All right,

6616
02:38:08,950 --> 02:38:08,960
daily and weekly levels. All right,
 

6617
02:38:08,960 --> 02:38:11,030
daily and weekly levels. All right,
here's the lift back to 20s again. So,

6618
02:38:11,030 --> 02:38:11,040
here's the lift back to 20s again. So,
 

6619
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:12,950
here's the lift back to 20s again. So,
still in this rotation until they decide

6620
02:38:12,950 --> 02:38:12,960
still in this rotation until they decide
 

6621
02:38:12,960 --> 02:38:13,990
still in this rotation until they decide
what they're going to do with it.

6622
02:38:13,990 --> 02:38:14,000
what they're going to do with it.
 

6623
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:15,910
what they're going to do with it.
Nothing has changed.

6624
02:38:15,910 --> 02:38:15,920
Nothing has changed.
 

6625
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:22,870
Nothing has changed.
Still, we build.

6626
02:38:22,870 --> 02:38:22,880

 

6627
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:24,710

Do I talk about swing positions in the

6628
02:38:24,710 --> 02:38:24,720
Do I talk about swing positions in the
 

6629
02:38:24,720 --> 02:38:26,790
Do I talk about swing positions in the
course? I don't think I really do. Uh

6630
02:38:26,790 --> 02:38:26,800
course? I don't think I really do. Uh
 

6631
02:38:26,800 --> 02:38:29,030
course? I don't think I really do. Uh
maybe in the foundation course the the

6632
02:38:29,030 --> 02:38:29,040
maybe in the foundation course the the
 

6633
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:31,270
maybe in the foundation course the the
principles are exactly the same. But if

6634
02:38:31,270 --> 02:38:31,280
principles are exactly the same. But if
 

6635
02:38:31,280 --> 02:38:33,750
principles are exactly the same. But if
you do the 20hour course, what I do have

6636
02:38:33,750 --> 02:38:33,760
you do the 20hour course, what I do have
 

6637
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:36,630
you do the 20hour course, what I do have
is a swing position right here. So like

6638
02:38:36,630 --> 02:38:36,640
is a swing position right here. So like
 

6639
02:38:36,640 --> 02:38:38,870
is a swing position right here. So like
my swing investments are in here, right?

6640
02:38:38,870 --> 02:38:38,880
my swing investments are in here, right?
 

6641
02:38:38,880 --> 02:38:40,389
my swing investments are in here, right?
So when I'm looking at stuff, you can

6642
02:38:40,389 --> 02:38:40,399
So when I'm looking at stuff, you can
 

6643
02:38:40,399 --> 02:38:44,150
So when I'm looking at stuff, you can
see talking about them here like UU and

6644
02:38:44,150 --> 02:38:44,160
see talking about them here like UU and
 

6645
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:45,910
see talking about them here like UU and
US

6646
02:38:45,910 --> 02:38:45,920
US
 

6647
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:47,830
US
uh found a bid here this morning. So I'm

6648

uh found a bid here this morning. So I'm
 

6649
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:50,230
uh found a bid here this morning. So I'm
interested in this versus 20s. You can

6650
02:38:50,230 --> 02:38:50,240
interested in this versus 20s. You can
 

6651
02:38:50,240 --> 02:38:52,790
interested in this versus 20s. You can
see right I'll show you. We found a bid

6652
02:38:52,790 --> 02:38:52,800
see right I'll show you. We found a bid
 

6653
02:38:52,800 --> 02:38:54,309
see right I'll show you. We found a bid
on the back test. All right. I've

6654
02:38:54,309 --> 02:38:54,319
on the back test. All right. I've
 

6655
02:38:54,319 --> 02:38:56,630
on the back test. All right. I've
alerted everyone to this. We found a bid

6656
02:38:56,630 --> 02:38:56,640
alerted everyone to this. We found a bid
 

6657
02:38:56,640 --> 02:38:59,349
alerted everyone to this. We found a bid
on the back test of 20s. So, we broke

6658
02:38:59,349 --> 02:38:59,359
on the back test of 20s. So, we broke
 

6659
02:38:59,359 --> 02:39:01,990
on the back test of 20s. So, we broke
out. It's the same thing, right? We

6660
02:39:01,990 --> 02:39:02,000
out. It's the same thing, right? We
 

6661
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,870
out. It's the same thing, right? We
broke out. We come back. We have 20s.

6662
02:39:04,870 --> 02:39:04,880
broke out. We come back. We have 20s.
 

6663
02:39:04,880 --> 02:39:06,630
broke out. We come back. We have 20s.
Can we get up back into here? If you

6664
02:39:06,630 --> 02:39:06,640
Can we get up back into here? If you
 

6665
02:39:06,640 --> 02:39:10,309
Can we get up back into here? If you
look at what I said, I got my eye on UU.

6666
02:39:10,309 --> 02:39:10,319
look at what I said, I got my eye on UU.
 

6667
02:39:10,319 --> 02:39:13,910
look at what I said, I got my eye on UU.
If if holds 20s, same with US AR. If

6668
02:39:13,910 --> 02:39:13,920
If if holds 20s, same with US AR. If
 

6669
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:15,510
If if holds 20s, same with US AR. If
pullback holds yesterday's investment

6670
02:39:15,510 --> 02:39:15,520
pullback holds yesterday's investment
 

6671
02:39:15,520 --> 02:39:17,030
pullback holds yesterday's investment
from the government, you can see it

6672
02:39:17,030 --> 02:39:17,040
from the government, you can see it
 

6673
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:18,309
from the government, you can see it
here. And then I think I might have

6674
02:39:18,309 --> 02:39:18,319
here. And then I think I might have
 

6675
02:39:18,319 --> 02:39:20,309
here. And then I think I might have
rementioned it yesterday. Here you go.

6676
02:39:20,309 --> 02:39:20,319
rementioned it yesterday. Here you go.
 

6677
02:39:20,319 --> 02:39:23,830
rementioned it yesterday. Here you go.
So, uh,

6678
02:39:23,830 --> 02:39:23,840
So, uh,
 

6679
02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:25,349
So, uh,
these are both starting to come in now.

6680
02:39:25,349 --> 02:39:25,359
these are both starting to come in now.
 

6681
02:39:25,359 --> 02:39:26,950
these are both starting to come in now.
So, going to watch how we react here.

6682
02:39:26,950 --> 02:39:26,960
So, going to watch how we react here.
 

6683
02:39:26,960 --> 02:39:29,270
So, going to watch how we react here.
So, looking for longs on these now to

6684
02:39:29,270 --> 02:39:29,280
So, looking for longs on these now to
 

6685
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:30,870
So, looking for longs on these now to
see if we can continue this and take

6686
02:39:30,870 --> 02:39:30,880
see if we can continue this and take
 

6687
02:39:30,880 --> 02:39:32,550
see if we can continue this and take
this out. Right. So, this is a macro

6688
02:39:32,550 --> 02:39:32,560
this out. Right. So, this is a macro
 

6689
02:39:32,560 --> 02:39:34,389
this out. Right. So, this is a macro
event and it's a swing position. There

6690
02:39:34,389 --> 02:39:34,399
event and it's a swing position. There
 

6691
02:39:34,399 --> 02:39:35,990
event and it's a swing position. There
you go. There's a free There's a freebie

6692
02:39:35,990 --> 02:39:36,000
you go. There's a free There's a freebie

02:40:18,950 --> 02:40:18,960
structure and what we're looking at,
 

6731
02:40:18,960 --> 02:40:21,349
structure and what we're looking at,
that all comes from the 20our course. If

6732
02:40:21,349 --> 02:40:21,359
that all comes from the 20our course. If
 

6733
02:40:21,359 --> 02:40:22,790
that all comes from the 20our course. If
you do the orderflow course and you

6734
02:40:22,790 --> 02:40:22,800
you do the orderflow course and you
 

6735
02:40:22,800 --> 02:40:24,150
you do the orderflow course and you
haven't done the 20our course, there's a

6736
02:40:24,150 --> 02:40:24,160
haven't done the 20our course, there's a
 

6737
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:25,429
haven't done the 20our course, there's a
chance that you might trade a different

6738
02:40:25,429 --> 02:40:25,439
chance that you might trade a different
 

6739
02:40:25,439 --> 02:40:26,870
chance that you might trade a different
way to the traders who have done the

6740
02:40:26,870 --> 02:40:26,880
way to the traders who have done the
 

6741
02:40:26,880 --> 02:40:29,110
way to the traders who have done the
20our course. And if you put all of that

6742
02:40:29,110 --> 02:40:29,120
20our course. And if you put all of that
 

6743
02:40:29,120 --> 02:40:30,790
20our course. And if you put all of that
in one community in a Discord, what

6744
02:40:30,790 --> 02:40:30,800
in one community in a Discord, what
 

6745
02:40:30,800 --> 02:40:32,389
in one community in a Discord, what
means is you've got people taking the

6746
02:40:32,389 --> 02:40:32,399
means is you've got people taking the
 

6747
02:40:32,399 --> 02:40:34,309
means is you've got people taking the
other side of trades and then it can

6748
02:40:34,309 --> 02:40:34,319
other side of trades and then it can
 

6749
02:40:34,319 --> 02:40:35,750
other side of trades and then it can
sort of rattle you in your position

6750
02:40:35,750 --> 02:40:35,760
sort of rattle you in your position
 

6751
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:36,870
sort of rattle you in your position
where you think, "Oh, I'm not going to

6752
02:40:36,870 --> 02:40:36,880
where you think, "Oh, I'm not going to
 

6753
02:40:36,880 --> 02:40:38,150
where you think, "Oh, I'm not going to
take that now." And then it goes away

6754
02:40:38,150 --> 02:40:38,160
take that now." And then it goes away
 

6755
02:40:38,160 --> 02:40:39,830
take that now." And then it goes away
and you get frustrated. So the only

6756
02:40:39,830 --> 02:40:39,840
and you get frustrated. So the only
 

6757
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:42,150
and you get frustrated. So the only
reason is I want everyone to be able to

6758
02:40:42,150 --> 02:40:42,160
reason is I want everyone to be able to
 

6759
02:40:42,160 --> 02:40:47,190
reason is I want everyone to be able to
support each other.

6760
02:40:47,190 --> 02:40:47,200

 

6761
02:40:47,200 --> 02:40:49,990

Is ATR the best way to consider stop

6762
02:40:49,990 --> 02:40:50,000
Is ATR the best way to consider stop
 

6763
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,710
Is ATR the best way to consider stop
limit size or key levels? Hard 80 tick

6764
02:40:52,710 --> 02:40:52,720
limit size or key levels? Hard 80 tick
 

6765
02:40:52,720 --> 02:40:55,750
limit size or key levels? Hard 80 tick
stop biting me. Yeah. So ATR will help

6766
02:40:55,750 --> 02:40:55,760
stop biting me. Yeah. So ATR will help
 

6767
02:40:55,760 --> 02:40:57,750
stop biting me. Yeah. So ATR will help
you understand the potential move. So

6768
02:40:57,750 --> 02:40:57,760
you understand the potential move. So
 

6769
02:40:57,760 --> 02:40:59,830
you understand the potential move. So
like the spikes today we've traded like

6770
02:40:59,830 --> 02:40:59,840
like the spikes today we've traded like
 

6771
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:01,750
like the spikes today we've traded like
up to 80 points ATR. I'd say your

6772
02:41:01,750 --> 02:41:01,760
up to 80 points ATR. I'd say your
 

6773
02:41:01,760 --> 02:41:04,790
up to 80 points ATR. I'd say your
average on the day is about 31. Your

6774
02:41:04,790 --> 02:41:04,800
average on the day is about 31. Your
 

6775
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:07,110
average on the day is about 31. Your
your stops should be when the where the

6776
02:41:07,110 --> 02:41:07,120
your stops should be when the where the
 

6777
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:09,670
your stops should be when the where the
trade is no longer valid, right? Where

6778
02:41:09,670 --> 02:41:09,680
trade is no longer valid, right? Where
 

6779
02:41:09,680 --> 02:41:11,670
trade is no longer valid, right? Where
the trade is no longer valid. So for

6780
02:41:11,670 --> 02:41:11,680
the trade is no longer valid. So for
 

6781
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:14,150
the trade is no longer valid. So for
example,

6782
02:41:14,150 --> 02:41:14,160
example,
 

6783
02:41:14,160 --> 02:41:16,469
example,
you can use volume. So if you were short

6784
02:41:16,469 --> 02:41:16,479
you can use volume. So if you were short
 

6785
02:41:16,479 --> 02:41:17,990
you can use volume. So if you were short
here on the breakdown, your stop should

6786
02:41:17,990 --> 02:41:18,000
here on the breakdown, your stop should
 

6787
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,230
here on the breakdown, your stop should
be the other side of this volume. So if

6788
02:41:20,230 --> 02:41:20,240
be the other side of this volume. So if
 

6789
02:41:20,240 --> 02:41:21,349
be the other side of this volume. So if
you took this one, you would have got

6790
02:41:21,349 --> 02:41:21,359
you took this one, you would have got
 

6791
02:41:21,359 --> 02:41:23,270
you took this one, you would have got
stopped out. But if you had another go,

6792
02:41:23,270 --> 02:41:23,280
stopped out. But if you had another go,
 

6793
02:41:23,280 --> 02:41:24,790
stopped out. But if you had another go,
you would have got it. And we're almost

6794
02:41:24,790 --> 02:41:24,800
you would have got it. And we're almost
 

6795
02:41:24,800 --> 02:41:26,950
you would have got it. And we're almost
at that low now. And if we run these

6796
02:41:26,950 --> 02:41:26,960
at that low now. And if we run these
 

6797
02:41:26,960 --> 02:41:28,710
at that low now. And if we run these
stops, you're looking to cover into

6798
02:41:28,710 --> 02:41:28,720
stops, you're looking to cover into
 

6799
02:41:28,720 --> 02:41:31,030
stops, you're looking to cover into
here, right? So you can use, for

6800
02:41:31,030 --> 02:41:31,040
here, right? So you can use, for
 

6801
02:41:31,040 --> 02:41:33,030
here, right? So you can use, for
example, key levels. You can use volume

6802
02:41:33,030 --> 02:41:33,040
example, key levels. You can use volume
 

6803
02:41:33,040 --> 02:41:34,469
example, key levels. You can use volume
for protection, right? So, if you're

6804
02:41:34,469 --> 02:41:34,479
for protection, right? So, if you're
 

6805
02:41:34,479 --> 02:41:36,070
for protection, right? So, if you're
short here, you can put your stop the

6806
02:41:36,070 --> 02:41:36,080
short here, you can put your stop the
 

6807
02:41:36,080 --> 02:41:37,910
short here, you can put your stop the
other side of it. Here you go. So, TP1

6808
02:41:37,910 --> 02:41:37,920
other side of it. Here you go. So, TP1
 

6809
02:41:37,920 --> 02:41:40,070
other side of it. Here you go. So, TP1
now hit. So, congratulations those that

6810
02:41:40,070 --> 02:41:40,080
now hit. So, congratulations those that
 

6811
02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:41,830
now hit. So, congratulations those that
took this this IB low now here. And then

6812
02:41:41,830 --> 02:41:41,840
took this this IB low now here. And then
 

6813
02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:43,670
took this this IB low now here. And then
you're looking for a drift now into this

6814
02:41:43,670 --> 02:41:43,680
you're looking for a drift now into this
 

6815
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:45,510
you're looking for a drift now into this
blue box and potentially all the way

6816
02:41:45,510 --> 02:41:45,520
blue box and potentially all the way
 

6817
02:41:45,520 --> 02:41:47,349
blue box and potentially all the way
down into here. But you should be

6818
02:41:47,349 --> 02:41:47,359
down into here. But you should be
 

6819
02:41:47,359 --> 02:41:48,870
down into here. But you should be
covering some of your position. They are

6820
02:41:48,870 --> 02:41:48,880
covering some of your position. They are
 

6821
02:41:48,880 --> 02:41:50,389
covering some of your position. They are
adding liquidity lower. So, there's a

6822
02:41:50,389 --> 02:41:50,399
adding liquidity lower. So, there's a
 

6823
02:41:50,399 --> 02:41:52,550
adding liquidity lower. So, there's a
good chance we can continue to drift

6824
02:41:52,550 --> 02:41:52,560
good chance we can continue to drift
 

6825
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:55,030
good chance we can continue to drift
lower here. SPY still has levels it can

6826
02:41:55,030 --> 02:41:55,040
lower here. SPY still has levels it can
 

6827
02:41:55,040 --> 02:41:56,710
lower here. SPY still has levels it can
go and hit as well. But, we are coming

6828
02:41:56,710 --> 02:41:56,720
go and hit as well. But, we are coming
 

6829
02:41:56,720 --> 02:41:59,030
go and hit as well. But, we are coming
into big big levels of interest across

6830
02:41:59,030 --> 02:41:59,040
into big big levels of interest across
 

6831
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:05,910
into big big levels of interest across
the market here, folks.

6832
02:42:05,910 --> 02:42:05,920

 

6833
02:42:05,920 --> 02:42:08,870

Uh, I've got a feeler. Um, is it Jay?

6834
02:42:08,870 --> 02:42:08,880
Uh, I've got a feeler. Um, is it Jay?
 

6835
02:42:08,880 --> 02:42:11,510
Uh, I've got a feeler. Um, is it Jay?
Jay, I've got a feeler on US long that I

6836
02:42:11,510 --> 02:42:11,520
Jay, I've got a feeler on US long that I
 

6837
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:13,990
Jay, I've got a feeler on US long that I
put on this morning. Um, and I'm looking

6838
02:42:13,990 --> 02:42:14,000
put on this morning. Um, and I'm looking
 

6839
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:15,590
put on this morning. Um, and I'm looking
if it starts to base and hold, I'm going

6840
02:42:15,590 --> 02:42:15,600
if it starts to base and hold, I'm going
 

6841
02:42:15,600 --> 02:42:17,349
if it starts to base and hold, I'm going
to add more position size in there.

6842
02:42:17,349 --> 02:42:17,359
to add more position size in there.
 

6843
02:42:17,359 --> 02:42:19,830
to add more position size in there.
Unfortunately, it came out with news

6844
02:42:19,830 --> 02:42:19,840
Unfortunately, it came out with news
 

6845
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:21,510
Unfortunately, it came out with news
this morning before I got the chance to

6846
02:42:21,510 --> 02:42:21,520
this morning before I got the chance to
 

6847
02:42:21,520 --> 02:42:23,510
this morning before I got the chance to
put it on. So, I think there was there

6848
02:42:23,510 --> 02:42:23,520
put it on. So, I think there was there
 

6849
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:26,790
put it on. So, I think there was there
was Trump news on metals again to today.

6850
02:42:26,790 --> 02:42:26,800
was Trump news on metals again to today.
 

6851
02:42:26,800 --> 02:42:30,550
was Trump news on metals again to today.
Um, so I am I am long US, but I'm not

6852
02:42:30,550 --> 02:42:30,560
Um, so I am I am long US, but I'm not
 

6853
02:42:30,560 --> 02:42:32,710
Um, so I am I am long US, but I'm not
positioned into big size yet. So I'm

6854
02:42:32,710 --> 02:42:32,720
positioned into big size yet. So I'm
 

6855
02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:35,349
positioned into big size yet. So I'm
just waiting. Uu, I haven't actually

6856
02:42:35,349 --> 02:42:35,359
just waiting. Uu, I haven't actually
 

6857
02:42:35,359 --> 02:42:38,389
just waiting. Uu, I haven't actually
looked at uranium since this, but I'd

6858
02:42:38,389 --> 02:42:38,399
looked at uranium since this, but I'd
 

6859
02:42:38,399 --> 02:42:39,990
looked at uranium since this, but I'd
imagine the same thing. Yeah. So dips

6860
02:42:39,990 --> 02:42:40,000
imagine the same thing. Yeah. So dips
 

6861
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:41,830
imagine the same thing. Yeah. So dips
holding 20. Remember the the call was

6862
02:42:41,830 --> 02:42:41,840
holding 20. Remember the the call was
 

6863
02:42:41,840 --> 02:42:44,550
holding 20. Remember the the call was
for dips to hold 20 on the swing. Boom.

6864
02:42:44,550 --> 02:42:44,560
for dips to hold 20 on the swing. Boom.
 

6865
02:42:44,560 --> 02:42:46,790
for dips to hold 20 on the swing. Boom.
There you go. Right. Literally perfect.

6866
02:42:46,790 --> 02:42:46,800
There you go. Right. Literally perfect.
 

6867
02:42:46,800 --> 02:42:48,309
There you go. Right. Literally perfect.
So we didn't buy up here once we saw the

6868
02:42:48,309 --> 02:42:48,319
So we didn't buy up here once we saw the
 

6869
02:42:48,319 --> 02:42:51,030
So we didn't buy up here once we saw the
breakout to 28. We said if but if dips

6870
02:42:51,030 --> 02:42:51,040
breakout to 28. We said if but if dips
 

6871
02:42:51,040 --> 02:42:52,950
breakout to 28. We said if but if dips
hold 20, we'll get long. So, I'd now be

6872
02:42:52,950 --> 02:42:52,960
hold 20, we'll get long. So, I'd now be
 

6873
02:42:52,960 --> 02:42:55,030
hold 20, we'll get long. So, I'd now be
looking for dips down into anywhere down

6874
02:42:55,030 --> 02:42:55,040
looking for dips down into anywhere down
 

6875
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:56,950
looking for dips down into anywhere down
into here and I'll start to accumulate a

6876
02:42:56,950 --> 02:42:56,960
into here and I'll start to accumulate a
 

6877
02:42:56,960 --> 02:42:59,670
into here and I'll start to accumulate a
long position for a a hold back towards

6878
02:42:59,670 --> 02:42:59,680
long position for a a hold back towards
 

6879
02:42:59,680 --> 02:43:04,950
long position for a a hold back towards
alltime highs in these. Right.

6880
02:43:04,950 --> 02:43:04,960

 

6881
02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:06,550

I think you might be in Discord, Jay.

6882
02:43:06,550 --> 02:43:06,560
I think you might be in Discord, Jay.
 

6883
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:07,830
I think you might be in Discord, Jay.
So, maybe that's helped you. All right.

6884
02:43:07,830 --> 02:43:07,840
So, maybe that's helped you. All right.
 

6885
02:43:07,840 --> 02:43:09,270
So, maybe that's helped you. All right.
So, just be careful here, guys, because

6886
02:43:09,270 --> 02:43:09,280
So, just be careful here, guys, because
 

6887
02:43:09,280 --> 02:43:11,190
So, just be careful here, guys, because
we've just hunted those stops. You're

6888
02:43:11,190 --> 02:43:11,200
we've just hunted those stops. You're
 

6889
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:12,870
we've just hunted those stops. You're
back into this same volume shelf here as

6890
02:43:12,870 --> 02:43:12,880
back into this same volume shelf here as
 

6891
02:43:12,880 --> 02:44:05,429
back into this same volume shelf here as
your over under

6892
02:44:05,429 --> 02:44:05,439

 

6893
02:44:05,439 --> 02:44:07,429

starting to come and retest this same

6894
02:44:07,429 --> 02:44:07,439
starting to come and retest this same
 

6895
02:44:07,439 --> 02:44:09,190
starting to come and retest this same
level. So, if we start a pop above 20s

6896
02:44:09,190 --> 02:44:09,200
level. So, if we start a pop above 20s
 

6897
02:44:09,200 --> 02:44:11,110
level. So, if we start a pop above 20s
now, there might be relief back up to

6898
02:44:11,110 --> 02:44:11,120
now, there might be relief back up to
 

6899
02:44:11,120 --> 02:44:13,190
now, there might be relief back up to
50s, but it's up to you if you really

6900
02:44:13,190 --> 02:44:13,200
50s, but it's up to you if you really
 

6901
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:15,990
50s, but it's up to you if you really
want to dangle dangle down here or not.

6902
02:44:15,990 --> 02:44:16,000
want to dangle dangle down here or not.
 

6903
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,469
want to dangle dangle down here or not.
You know, 5 minutes until lunch. We'll

6904
02:44:18,469 --> 02:44:18,479
You know, 5 minutes until lunch. We'll
 

6905
02:44:18,479 --> 02:44:19,910
You know, 5 minutes until lunch. We'll
do a course giveaway as soon as we hit

6906
02:44:19,910 --> 02:44:19,920
do a course giveaway as soon as we hit
 

6907
02:44:19,920 --> 02:44:23,510
do a course giveaway as soon as we hit
lunch.

6908
02:44:23,510 --> 02:44:23,520

 

6909
02:44:23,520 --> 02:44:25,670

I like TPO because the volume gives you

6910
02:44:25,670 --> 02:44:25,680
I like TPO because the volume gives you
 

6911
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:28,790
I like TPO because the volume gives you
a clue as to when the auction is over.

6912
02:44:28,790 --> 02:44:28,800
a clue as to when the auction is over.
 

6913
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:31,110
a clue as to when the auction is over.
For instance, we have a volume of 163 at

6914
02:44:31,110 --> 02:44:31,120
For instance, we have a volume of 163 at
 

6915
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:33,429
For instance, we have a volume of 163 at
the low period. So, we will drive lower

6916
02:44:33,429 --> 02:44:33,439
the low period. So, we will drive lower
 

6917
02:44:33,439 --> 02:44:36,630
the low period. So, we will drive lower
as there's so much volume.

6918
02:44:36,630 --> 02:44:36,640
as there's so much volume.
 

6919
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:39,110
as there's so much volume.
T for me TPO is more useful for seeing

6920
02:44:39,110 --> 02:44:39,120
T for me TPO is more useful for seeing
 

6921
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:42,389
T for me TPO is more useful for seeing
time spent than volume.

6922
02:44:42,389 --> 02:44:42,399
time spent than volume.
 

6923
02:44:42,399 --> 02:44:44,710
time spent than volume.
What do hunting stops do? Pair off

6924
02:44:44,710 --> 02:44:44,720
What do hunting stops do? Pair off
 

6925
02:44:44,720 --> 02:44:46,790
What do hunting stops do? Pair off
liquidity.

6926
02:44:46,790 --> 02:44:46,800
liquidity.
 

6927
02:44:46,800 --> 02:44:48,150
liquidity.
Pair off liquidity. So, you got to think

6928
02:44:48,150 --> 02:44:48,160
Pair off liquidity. So, you got to think
 

6929
02:44:48,160 --> 02:44:51,110
Pair off liquidity. So, you got to think
the big boys in the market. If you want

6930
02:44:51,110 --> 02:44:51,120
the big boys in the market. If you want
 

6931
02:44:51,120 --> 02:44:53,110
the big boys in the market. If you want
to be a big big buyer in the market,

6932
02:44:53,110 --> 02:44:53,120
to be a big big buyer in the market,
 

6933
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:54,870
to be a big big buyer in the market,
let's talk about a market maker or a

6934
02:44:54,870 --> 02:44:54,880
let's talk about a market maker or a
 

6935
02:44:54,880 --> 02:44:57,429
let's talk about a market maker or a
bank. All right, so let's say someone

6936
02:44:57,429 --> 02:44:57,439
bank. All right, so let's say someone
 

6937
02:44:57,439 --> 02:45:00,950
bank. All right, so let's say someone
wants to buy a,000 lot. All right, they

6938
02:45:00,950 --> 02:45:00,960
wants to buy a,000 lot. All right, they
 

6939
02:45:00,960 --> 02:45:02,870
wants to buy a,000 lot. All right, they
can't just come in and buy a thousand

6940
02:45:02,870 --> 02:45:02,880
can't just come in and buy a thousand
 

6941
02:45:02,880 --> 02:45:05,510
can't just come in and buy a thousand
lot, right? They need if they want to

6942
02:45:05,510 --> 02:45:05,520
lot, right? They need if they want to
 

6943
02:45:05,520 --> 02:45:08,150
lot, right? They need if they want to
buy this one's the buyer, this guy's the

6944
02:45:08,150 --> 02:45:08,160
buy this one's the buyer, this guy's the
 

6945
02:45:08,160 --> 02:45:10,230
buy this one's the buyer, this guy's the
buyer. They need what? They need someone

6946
02:45:10,230 --> 02:45:10,240
buyer. They need what? They need someone
 

6947
02:45:10,240 --> 02:45:13,349
buyer. They need what? They need someone
who's willing to sell a thousand lot,

6948
02:45:13,349 --> 02:45:13,359
who's willing to sell a thousand lot,
 

6949
02:45:13,359 --> 02:45:15,429
who's willing to sell a thousand lot,
right? And they won't always have that

6950
02:45:15,429 --> 02:45:15,439
right? And they won't always have that
 

6951
02:45:15,439 --> 02:45:17,990
right? And they won't always have that
ability to do that. So what's the best

6952
02:45:17,990 --> 02:45:18,000
ability to do that. So what's the best
 

6953
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:21,110
ability to do that. So what's the best
way of doing it? Well, if lots of buyers

6954
02:45:21,110 --> 02:45:21,120
way of doing it? Well, if lots of buyers
 

6955
02:45:21,120 --> 02:45:24,309
way of doing it? Well, if lots of buyers
have come in here and bid up and they

6956
02:45:24,309 --> 02:45:24,319
have come in here and bid up and they
 

6957
02:45:24,319 --> 02:45:27,030
have come in here and bid up and they
just got stopped out there, then in this

6958
02:45:27,030 --> 02:45:27,040
just got stopped out there, then in this
 

6959
02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:28,870
just got stopped out there, then in this
stopout, if their stop is here, what

6960
02:45:28,870 --> 02:45:28,880
stopout, if their stop is here, what
 

6961
02:45:28,880 --> 02:45:30,710
stopout, if their stop is here, what
happens? If you're a market buyer or if

6962
02:45:30,710 --> 02:45:30,720
happens? If you're a market buyer or if
 

6963
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:32,710
happens? If you're a market buyer or if
you've been a buyer in this market here

6964
02:45:32,710 --> 02:45:32,720
you've been a buyer in this market here
 

6965
02:45:32,720 --> 02:45:35,030
you've been a buyer in this market here
and you stop out, you become a seller.

6966
02:45:35,030 --> 02:45:35,040
and you stop out, you become a seller.
 

6967
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:37,429
and you stop out, you become a seller.
So then you get your thousand lot sell

6968
02:45:37,429 --> 02:45:37,439
So then you get your thousand lot sell
 

6969
02:45:37,439 --> 02:45:39,429
So then you get your thousand lot sell
and the guy can limit order in a

6970
02:45:39,429 --> 02:45:39,439
and the guy can limit order in a
 

6971
02:45:39,439 --> 02:45:41,910
and the guy can limit order in a
thousand lot buy and get filled without

6972
02:45:41,910 --> 02:45:41,920
thousand lot buy and get filled without
 

6973
02:45:41,920 --> 02:45:43,750
thousand lot buy and get filled without
it affecting the market, right? And

6974
02:45:43,750 --> 02:45:43,760
it affecting the market, right? And
 

6975
02:45:43,760 --> 02:45:46,070
it affecting the market, right? And
that's just an example, but that is why

6976
02:45:46,070 --> 02:45:46,080
that's just an example, but that is why
 

6977
02:45:46,080 --> 02:45:48,870
that's just an example, but that is why
they hunt stops because they can use the

6978
02:45:48,870 --> 02:45:48,880
they hunt stops because they can use the
 

6979
02:45:48,880 --> 02:45:51,030
they hunt stops because they can use the
stops to pair off to get the directional

6980
02:45:51,030 --> 02:45:51,040
stops to pair off to get the directional
 

6981
02:45:51,040 --> 02:45:53,590
stops to pair off to get the directional
move that they want. Remember, the

6982
02:45:53,590 --> 02:45:53,600
move that they want. Remember, the
 

6983
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:55,510
move that they want. Remember, the
market will not move unless there's both

6984
02:45:55,510 --> 02:45:55,520
market will not move unless there's both
 

6985
02:45:55,520 --> 02:45:58,150
market will not move unless there's both
a buyer and a seller. It will not move

6986
02:45:58,150 --> 02:45:58,160
a buyer and a seller. It will not move
 

6987
02:45:58,160 --> 02:45:59,670
a buyer and a seller. It will not move
otherwise. And you need an aggressive

6988
02:45:59,670 --> 02:45:59,680
otherwise. And you need an aggressive
 

6989
02:45:59,680 --> 02:46:01,750
otherwise. And you need an aggressive
buyer and a passive seller or an

6990
02:46:01,750 --> 02:46:01,760
buyer and a passive seller or an
 

6991
02:46:01,760 --> 02:46:03,190
buyer and a passive seller or an
aggressive seller and a passive buyer.

6992
02:46:03,190 --> 02:46:03,200
aggressive seller and a passive buyer.
 

6993
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:04,469
aggressive seller and a passive buyer.
If you've just got two passive

6994
02:46:04,469 --> 02:46:04,479
If you've just got two passive
 

6995
02:46:04,479 --> 02:46:06,469
If you've just got two passive
participants, that would mean that you

6996
02:46:06,469 --> 02:46:06,479
participants, that would mean that you
 

6997
02:46:06,479 --> 02:46:08,309
participants, that would mean that you
have, you know, a limit order here, a

6998
02:46:08,309 --> 02:46:08,319
have, you know, a limit order here, a
 

6999
02:46:08,319 --> 02:46:09,910
have, you know, a limit order here, a
limit order here, spread in the middle,

7000
02:46:09,910 --> 02:46:09,920
limit order here, spread in the middle,
 

7001
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:13,670
limit order here, spread in the middle,
no one is going to pair off.

7002
02:46:13,670 --> 02:46:13,680
no one is going to pair off.
 

7003
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:15,750
no one is going to pair off.
No one's going to pair off. All right,

7004
02:46:15,750 --> 02:46:15,760
No one's going to pair off. All right,
 

7005
02:46:15,760 --> 02:46:17,990
No one's going to pair off. All right,
back towards these 20s again. So, the

7006
02:46:17,990 --> 02:46:18,000
back towards these 20s again. So, the
 

7007
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:21,349
back towards these 20s again. So, the
same thing over and over and over and

7008
02:46:21,349 --> 02:46:21,359
same thing over and over and over and
 

7009
02:46:21,359 --> 02:46:34,309
same thing over and over and over and
over. Nothing is changing.

7010
02:46:34,309 --> 02:46:34,319

 

7011
02:46:34,319 --> 02:46:37,429

649 on ES is not the low. That's my

7012
02:46:37,429 --> 02:46:37,439
649 on ES is not the low. That's my
 

7013
02:46:37,439 --> 02:46:39,670
649 on ES is not the low. That's my
prediction. Okay. I'm not watching ES,

7014
02:46:39,670 --> 02:46:39,680
prediction. Okay. I'm not watching ES,
 

7015
02:46:39,680 --> 02:46:41,990
prediction. Okay. I'm not watching ES,
but you might well be right. I mean, I

7016
02:46:41,990 --> 02:46:42,000
but you might well be right. I mean, I
 

7017
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:45,429
but you might well be right. I mean, I
would say uh SPY to 690 and obviously

7018
02:46:45,429 --> 02:46:45,439
would say uh SPY to 690 and obviously
 

7019
02:46:45,439 --> 02:46:48,070
would say uh SPY to 690 and obviously
that old weekly low down at 8940 is on

7020
02:46:48,070 --> 02:46:48,080
that old weekly low down at 8940 is on
 

7021
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:53,510
that old weekly low down at 8940 is on
SPY is possible still.

7022
02:46:53,510 --> 02:46:53,520

 

7023
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:55,590

Did I take any trades today? I did. Uh

7024
02:46:55,590 --> 02:46:55,600
Did I take any trades today? I did. Uh
 

7025
02:46:55,600 --> 02:46:57,990
Did I take any trades today? I did. Uh
the main one was this long here. I had a

7026
02:46:57,990 --> 02:46:58,000
the main one was this long here. I had a
 

7027
02:46:58,000 --> 02:46:59,670
the main one was this long here. I had a
few attempts at it. I was like long here

7028
02:46:59,670 --> 02:46:59,680
few attempts at it. I was like long here
 

7029
02:46:59,680 --> 02:47:01,269
few attempts at it. I was like long here
to here, long here to here. And I

7030
02:47:01,269 --> 02:47:01,279
to here, long here to here. And I
 

7031
02:47:01,279 --> 02:47:03,590
to here, long here to here. And I
finally, where did I come in? Was it a

7032
02:47:03,590 --> 02:47:03,600
finally, where did I come in? Was it a
 

7033
02:47:03,600 --> 02:47:05,429
finally, where did I come in? Was it a
reclaim of 30s or 50s? I can't remember.

7034
02:47:05,429 --> 02:47:05,439
reclaim of 30s or 50s? I can't remember.
 

7035
02:47:05,439 --> 02:47:07,429
reclaim of 30s or 50s? I can't remember.
Here to here. And then a little piece of

7036
02:47:07,429 --> 02:47:07,439
Here to here. And then a little piece of
 

7037
02:47:07,439 --> 02:47:09,429
Here to here. And then a little piece of
that and then that was it. I wanted to

7038
02:47:09,429 --> 02:47:09,439
that and then that was it. I wanted to
 

7039
02:47:09,439 --> 02:47:11,110
that and then that was it. I wanted to
get up into here and then fade it back

7040
02:47:11,110 --> 02:47:11,120
get up into here and then fade it back
 

7041
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:13,269
get up into here and then fade it back
down. Missed the shorts today. Wanted

7042
02:47:13,269 --> 02:47:13,279
down. Missed the shorts today. Wanted
 

7043
02:47:13,279 --> 02:47:15,030
down. Missed the shorts today. Wanted
the shorts. Was prepared for them.

7044
02:47:15,030 --> 02:47:15,040
the shorts. Was prepared for them.
 

7045
02:47:15,040 --> 02:47:16,550
the shorts. Was prepared for them.
Didn't get the retest of the level I

7046
02:47:16,550 --> 02:47:16,560
Didn't get the retest of the level I
 

7047
02:47:16,560 --> 02:47:20,710
Didn't get the retest of the level I
wanted unfortunately.

7048
02:47:20,710 --> 02:47:20,720

 

7049
02:47:20,720 --> 02:47:22,309

Alex, do you have a particular time of

7050
02:47:22,309 --> 02:47:22,319
Alex, do you have a particular time of
 

7051
02:47:22,319 --> 02:47:24,469
Alex, do you have a particular time of
day for trading in the afternoon session

7052
02:47:24,469 --> 02:47:24,479
day for trading in the afternoon session
 

7053
02:47:24,479 --> 02:47:25,990
day for trading in the afternoon session
or is it based on price, action,

7054
02:47:25,990 --> 02:47:26,000
or is it based on price, action,
 

7055
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:27,269
or is it based on price, action,
location? I would say definitely on

7056
02:47:27,269 --> 02:47:27,279
location? I would say definitely on
 

7057
02:47:27,279 --> 02:47:29,990
location? I would say definitely on
price action, location. Uh try and avoid

7058
02:47:29,990 --> 02:47:30,000
price action, location. Uh try and avoid
 

7059
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:31,830
price action, location. Uh try and avoid
lunch, but sometimes lunch is good. It

7060
02:47:31,830 --> 02:47:31,840
lunch, but sometimes lunch is good. It
 

7061
02:47:31,840 --> 02:47:33,190
lunch, but sometimes lunch is good. It
really depends on the volume and what's

7062
02:47:33,190 --> 02:47:33,200
really depends on the volume and what's
 

7063
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:39,990
really depends on the volume and what's
moving the market.

7064
02:47:39,990 --> 02:47:40,000

 

7065
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:41,750

Same for you. Yeah, it was it was

7066
02:47:41,750 --> 02:47:41,760
Same for you. Yeah, it was it was
 

7067
02:47:41,760 --> 02:47:43,190
Same for you. Yeah, it was it was
annoying today. It was annoying. All

7068
02:47:43,190 --> 02:47:43,200
annoying today. It was annoying. All
 

7069
02:47:43,200 --> 02:47:45,030
annoying today. It was annoying. All
right, back to these 20s again for the

7070
02:47:45,030 --> 02:47:45,040
right, back to these 20s again for the
 

7071
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:47,110
right, back to these 20s again for the
millionth time today. So, if they lift

7072
02:47:47,110 --> 02:47:47,120
millionth time today. So, if they lift
 

7073
02:47:47,120 --> 02:47:48,870
millionth time today. So, if they lift
through 20s, they will try and lift to

7074
02:47:48,870 --> 02:47:48,880
through 20s, they will try and lift to
 

7075
02:47:48,880 --> 02:47:50,790
through 20s, they will try and lift to
50s again. All right, if they fail the

7076
02:47:50,790 --> 02:47:50,800
50s again. All right, if they fail the
 

7077
02:47:50,800 --> 02:47:52,469
50s again. All right, if they fail the
20 rotation, they will come back down to

7078
02:47:52,469 --> 02:47:52,479
20 rotation, they will come back down to
 

7079
02:47:52,479 --> 02:47:54,550
20 rotation, they will come back down to
these lows again. So, nothing's changed.

7080
02:47:54,550 --> 02:47:54,560
these lows again. So, nothing's changed.
 

7081
02:47:54,560 --> 02:47:56,389
these lows again. So, nothing's changed.
So, I'd say buyers will want to protect

7082
02:47:56,389 --> 02:47:56,399
So, I'd say buyers will want to protect
 

7083
02:47:56,399 --> 02:47:58,070
So, I'd say buyers will want to protect
sort of tens here. And if they can

7084
02:47:58,070 --> 02:47:58,080
sort of tens here. And if they can
 

7085
02:47:58,080 --> 02:47:59,510
sort of tens here. And if they can
protect tens, they can potentially get a

7086
02:47:59,510 --> 02:47:59,520
protect tens, they can potentially get a
 

7087
02:47:59,520 --> 02:48:02,150
protect tens, they can potentially get a
move up to 50s. And then you we'll see

7088
02:48:02,150 --> 02:48:02,160
move up to 50s. And then you we'll see
 

7089
02:48:02,160 --> 02:48:03,830
move up to 50s. And then you we'll see
if they get going. Otherwise, we can

7090
02:48:03,830 --> 02:48:03,840
if they get going. Otherwise, we can
 

7091
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:05,670
if they get going. Otherwise, we can
just keep trading lower. We're just in a

7092
02:48:05,670 --> 02:48:05,680
just keep trading lower. We're just in a
 

7093
02:48:05,680 --> 02:48:08,550
just keep trading lower. We're just in a
20 to 500 rotation, but we did wick the

7094
02:48:08,550 --> 02:48:08,560
20 to 500 rotation, but we did wick the
 

7095
02:48:08,560 --> 02:48:10,790
20 to 500 rotation, but we did wick the
low, which is a good sign for buyers,

7096
02:48:10,790 --> 02:48:10,800
low, which is a good sign for buyers,
 

7097
02:48:10,800 --> 02:48:13,830
low, which is a good sign for buyers,
but again into these 20s. Big big level.

7098
02:48:13,830 --> 02:48:13,840
but again into these 20s. Big big level.
 

7099
02:48:13,840 --> 02:48:15,990
but again into these 20s. Big big level.
We've talked about it all day. It's a

7100
02:48:15,990 --> 02:48:16,000
We've talked about it all day. It's a
 

7101
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,630
We've talked about it all day. It's a
huge level where we had like a 400 lot

7102
02:48:18,630 --> 02:48:18,640
huge level where we had like a 400 lot
 

7103
02:48:18,640 --> 02:48:20,150
huge level where we had like a 400 lot
seller earlier in the day. So there you

7104
02:48:20,150 --> 02:48:20,160
seller earlier in the day. So there you
 

7105
02:48:20,160 --> 02:48:21,990
seller earlier in the day. So there you
go. They just resold the 20s again. Back

7106
02:48:21,990 --> 02:48:22,000
go. They just resold the 20s again. Back
 

7107
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,309
go. They just resold the 20s again. Back
down to these 500s. Rotation, rotation,

7108
02:48:24,309 --> 02:48:24,319
down to these 500s. Rotation, rotation,
 

7109
02:48:24,319 --> 02:48:27,190
down to these 500s. Rotation, rotation,
rotation, rotation. Nothing's changing.

7110
02:48:27,190 --> 02:48:27,200
rotation, rotation. Nothing's changing.
 

7111
02:48:27,200 --> 02:48:36,389
rotation, rotation. Nothing's changing.
Absolutely nothing's changing.

7112
02:48:36,389 --> 02:48:36,399

 

7113
02:48:36,399 --> 02:48:38,230

Yeah, exactly, Julian. Yesterday just

7114
02:48:38,230 --> 02:48:38,240
Yeah, exactly, Julian. Yesterday just
 

7115
02:48:38,240 --> 02:48:39,990
Yeah, exactly, Julian. Yesterday just
straight straight rip, wasn't it?

7116
02:48:39,990 --> 02:48:40,000
straight straight rip, wasn't it?
 

7117
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:41,269
straight straight rip, wasn't it?
Straight up yesterday, straight down

7118
02:48:41,269 --> 02:48:41,279
Straight up yesterday, straight down
 

7119
02:48:41,279 --> 02:48:43,910
Straight up yesterday, straight down
today to repric it all. It's uh it's

7120
02:48:43,910 --> 02:48:43,920
today to repric it all. It's uh it's
 

7121
02:48:43,920 --> 02:48:45,590
today to repric it all. It's uh it's
tough when it does it. It's tough. It's

7122
02:48:45,590 --> 02:48:45,600
tough when it does it. It's tough. It's
 

7123
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:47,830
tough when it does it. It's tough. It's
fine if you're already positioned.

7124
02:48:47,830 --> 02:48:47,840
fine if you're already positioned.
 

7125
02:48:47,840 --> 02:48:50,389
fine if you're already positioned.
I'd say the best sell of the day really

7126
02:48:50,389 --> 02:48:50,399
I'd say the best sell of the day really
 

7127
02:48:50,399 --> 02:48:54,150
I'd say the best sell of the day really
was like 8:00 a.m. this morning. that uh

7128
02:48:54,150 --> 02:48:54,160
was like 8:00 a.m. this morning. that uh
 

7129
02:48:54,160 --> 02:48:57,030
was like 8:00 a.m. this morning. that uh
we pulled back at 8 8 till 7 a.m. and

7130
02:48:57,030 --> 02:48:57,040
we pulled back at 8 8 till 7 a.m. and
 

7131
02:48:57,040 --> 02:48:58,950
we pulled back at 8 8 till 7 a.m. and
then we pushed up 8:00 a.m. and we

7132
02:48:58,950 --> 02:48:58,960
then we pushed up 8:00 a.m. and we
 

7133
02:48:58,960 --> 02:49:02,070
then we pushed up 8:00 a.m. and we
failed uh to make a new high. So, we set

7134
02:49:02,070 --> 02:49:02,080
failed uh to make a new high. So, we set
 

7135
02:49:02,080 --> 02:49:04,230
failed uh to make a new high. So, we set
that lower high here. I can get you

7136
02:49:04,230 --> 02:49:04,240
that lower high here. I can get you
 

7137
02:49:04,240 --> 02:49:07,990
that lower high here. I can get you
guys. Where is it? We set that lower I

7138
02:49:07,990 --> 02:49:08,000

7139
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:09,510
guys. Where is it? We set that lower I
can't find you guys now. We set that

7140
02:49:09,510 --> 02:49:09,520
can't find you guys now. We set that
 

7141
02:49:09,520 --> 02:49:11,110
can't find you guys now. We set that
lower high up here on an hourly after

7142
02:49:11,110 --> 02:49:11,120
lower high up here on an hourly after
 

7143
02:49:11,120 --> 02:49:13,269
lower high up here on an hourly after
three drives. So, I wasn't at my desk

7144
02:49:13,269 --> 02:49:13,279
three drives. So, I wasn't at my desk
 

7145
02:49:13,279 --> 02:49:15,590
three drives. So, I wasn't at my desk
here. So, one, two, three lower high.

7146
02:49:15,590 --> 02:49:15,600
here. So, one, two, three lower high.
 

7147
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:17,110
here. So, one, two, three lower high.
Failed to make a new high. That was the

7148
02:49:17,110 --> 02:49:17,120
Failed to make a new high. That was the
 

7149
02:49:17,120 --> 02:49:19,750
Failed to make a new high. That was the
break. But since then, not much we can

7150
02:49:19,750 --> 02:49:19,760
break. But since then, not much we can
 

7151
02:49:19,760 --> 02:49:21,590
break. But since then, not much we can
do with that on an hourly, honestly.

7152
02:49:21,590 --> 02:49:21,600
do with that on an hourly, honestly.
 

7153
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:40,550
do with that on an hourly, honestly.
Pretty tough. Pretty tough.

be correct. Previous week low still
 

7197
02:50:53,920 --> 02:50:57,030

Alex, what functionalities does city

7344
02:55:10,870 --> 02:55:10,880
Alex, what functionalities does city
 

7345
02:55:10,880 --> 02:55:13,429
Alex, what functionalities does city
footprint provide to you that you really

7346
02:55:13,429 --> 02:55:13,439
footprint provide to you that you really
 

7347
02:55:13,439 --> 02:55:15,030
footprint provide to you that you really
like? Well, other than the standard

7348
02:55:15,030 --> 02:55:15,040
like? Well, other than the standard
 

7349
02:55:15,040 --> 02:55:17,190
like? Well, other than the standard
footprint and the order, uh, I really I

7350
02:55:17,190 --> 02:55:17,200
footprint and the order, uh, I really I
 

7351
02:55:17,200 --> 02:55:19,269
footprint and the order, uh, I really I
just like the delta on the side. I

7352
02:55:19,269 --> 02:55:19,279
just like the delta on the side. I
 

7353
02:55:19,279 --> 02:55:21,830
just like the delta on the side. I
really like the delta on the side of it.

7354
02:55:21,830 --> 02:55:21,840
really like the delta on the side of it.
 

7355
02:55:21,840 --> 02:55:25,590
really like the delta on the side of it.
And it's very customizable. So I have uh

7356
02:55:25,590 --> 02:55:25,600
And it's very customizable. So I have uh
 

7357
02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:27,110
And it's very customizable. So I have uh
cumulative delta on the bottom but I

7358
02:55:27,110 --> 02:55:27,120
cumulative delta on the bottom but I
 

7359
02:55:27,120 --> 02:55:28,870
cumulative delta on the bottom but I
have the delta profile on the side. Here

7360
02:55:28,870 --> 02:55:28,880
have the delta profile on the side. Here
 

7361
02:55:28,880 --> 02:55:30,630
have the delta profile on the side. Here
you go. So snapping down lower. So

7362
02:55:30,630 --> 02:55:30,640
you go. So snapping down lower. So
 

7363
02:55:30,640 --> 02:55:33,269
you go. So snapping down lower. So
rejected 20s again then rejected to

7364
02:55:33,269 --> 02:55:33,279
rejected 20s again then rejected to
 

7365
02:55:33,279 --> 02:55:36,389
rejected 20s again then rejected to
reclaim 500s here. Now lows and low

7366
02:55:36,389 --> 02:55:36,399
reclaim 500s here. Now lows and low
 

7367
02:55:36,399 --> 02:55:38,070
reclaim 500s here. Now lows and low
hanging fruits continues to be down

7368
02:55:38,070 --> 02:55:38,080
hanging fruits continues to be down
 

7369
02:55:38,080 --> 02:55:39,830
hanging fruits continues to be down
here. This can continue to move lower if

7370
02:55:39,830 --> 02:55:39,840
here. This can continue to move lower if
 

7371
02:55:39,840 --> 02:55:41,910
here. This can continue to move lower if
it wants during lunch. It looks like

7372
02:55:41,910 --> 02:55:41,920
it wants during lunch. It looks like
 

7373
02:55:41,920 --> 02:55:44,550
it wants during lunch. It looks like
they are still not done with it. They

7374
02:55:44,550 --> 02:55:44,560
they are still not done with it. They
 

7375
02:55:44,560 --> 02:55:47,429
they are still not done with it. They
are just forcing this thing lower and

7376
02:55:47,429 --> 02:55:47,439
are just forcing this thing lower and
 

7377
02:55:47,439 --> 02:55:52,469
are just forcing this thing lower and
lower and lower at the moment.

7378
02:55:52,469 --> 02:55:52,479

 

7379
02:55:52,479 --> 02:55:54,389

And this bids down here at 450s. Maybe

7380
02:55:54,389 --> 02:55:54,399
And this bids down here at 450s. Maybe
 

7381
02:55:54,399 --> 02:55:56,790
And this bids down here at 450s. Maybe
they come all the way down there.

7382
02:55:56,790 --> 02:55:56,800
they come all the way down there.
 

7383
02:55:56,800 --> 02:55:58,150
they come all the way down there.
How long did it take me to come

7384
02:55:58,150 --> 02:55:58,160
How long did it take me to come
 

7385
02:55:58,160 --> 02:55:59,910
How long did it take me to come
profitable? Uh swings were profitable

7386
02:55:59,910 --> 02:55:59,920
profitable? Uh swings were profitable
 

7387
02:55:59,920 --> 02:56:01,590

fairly quickly. Day trading took some

7388
02:56:01,590 --> 02:56:01,600
fairly quickly. Day trading took some
 

7389
02:56:01,600 --> 02:56:03,429
fairly quickly. Day trading took some
time. I was really doing well in small

7390
02:56:03,429 --> 02:56:03,439
time. I was really doing well in small
 

7391
02:56:03,439 --> 02:56:07,110
time. I was really doing well in small
caps, like I said, until uh COVID and

7392
02:56:07,110 --> 02:56:07,120
caps, like I said, until uh COVID and
 

7393
02:56:07,120 --> 02:56:09,030
caps, like I said, until uh COVID and
then that that knocked me off for a

7394
02:56:09,030 --> 02:56:09,040
then that that knocked me off for a
 

7395
02:56:09,040 --> 02:56:15,750
then that that knocked me off for a
little bit.

7396
02:56:15,750 --> 02:56:15,760

 

7397
02:56:15,760 --> 02:56:25,830

Scott, you make me laugh.

7398
02:56:25,830 --> 02:56:25,840

 

7399
02:56:25,840 --> 02:56:27,429

Alex, you think it would come down to

7400
02:56:27,429 --> 02:56:27,439
Alex, you think it would come down to
 

7401
02:56:27,439 --> 02:56:31,030
Alex, you think it would come down to
200, which was overnight Sunday?

7402
02:56:31,030 --> 02:56:31,040
200, which was overnight Sunday?
 

7403
02:56:31,040 --> 02:56:33,590
200, which was overnight Sunday?
Um,

7404
02:56:33,590 --> 02:56:33,600
Um,
 

7405
02:56:33,600 --> 02:56:36,070
Um,
it's possible.

7406
02:56:36,070 --> 02:56:36,080
it's possible.
 

7407
02:56:36,080 --> 02:56:38,230
it's possible.
It's possible. Uh, but you need to

7408
02:56:38,230 --> 02:56:38,240
It's possible. Uh, but you need to
 

7409
02:56:38,240 --> 02:56:39,830
It's possible. Uh, but you need to
respect where we are. There's a lot of

7410
02:56:39,830 --> 02:56:39,840
respect where we are. There's a lot of
 

7411
02:56:39,840 --> 02:56:41,830
respect where we are. There's a lot of
volume on the current developing week

7412
02:56:41,830 --> 02:56:41,840
volume on the current developing week
 

7413
02:56:41,840 --> 02:56:45,269
volume on the current developing week
where we are right now. A lot. Right. So

7414
02:56:45,269 --> 02:56:45,279
where we are right now. A lot. Right. So
 

7415
02:56:45,279 --> 02:56:48,710
where we are right now. A lot. Right. So
if we get under that there's a node from

7416
02:56:48,710 --> 02:56:48,720
if we get under that there's a node from
 

7417
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:51,110
if we get under that there's a node from
uh the week dating back to Monday the

7418
02:56:51,110 --> 02:56:51,120
uh the week dating back to Monday the
 

7419
02:56:51,120 --> 02:56:53,190
uh the week dating back to Monday the
19th of Jan. We have to respect the

7420
02:56:53,190 --> 02:56:53,200
19th of Jan. We have to respect the
 

7421
02:56:53,200 --> 02:56:55,030
19th of Jan. We have to respect the
levels right. So there's a node dating

7422
02:56:55,030 --> 02:56:55,040
levels right. So there's a node dating
 

7423
02:56:55,040 --> 02:56:59,110
levels right. So there's a node dating
back to 19th of sort of 450s. Under 450s

7424
02:56:59,110 --> 02:56:59,120
back to 19th of sort of 450s. Under 450s
 

7425
02:56:59,120 --> 02:57:00,870
back to 19th of sort of 450s. Under 450s
we have like a little bit of a gap. We

7426
02:57:00,870 --> 02:57:00,880
we have like a little bit of a gap. We
 

7427
02:57:00,880 --> 02:57:05,110
we have like a little bit of a gap. We
get a bit thin into 400s. 400s is really

7428
02:57:05,110 --> 02:57:05,120
get a bit thin into 400s. 400s is really
 

7429
02:57:05,120 --> 02:57:08,150
get a bit thin into 400s. 400s is really
thick all the way down to 120. It's

7430
02:57:08,150 --> 02:57:08,160
thick all the way down to 120. It's
 

7431
02:57:08,160 --> 02:57:10,630
thick all the way down to 120. It's
really really thick from that week of

But all we've really done, if you think
 

7441
02:57:21,120 --> 02:57:22,710
But all we've really done, if you think

We drove higher yesterday. We've
 

7445
02:57:24,640 --> 02:57:27,190
We drove higher yesterday. We've
repriced it today. Nothing's actually

7446
02:57:27,190 --> 02:57:27,200
repriced it today. Nothing's actually
 

7447
02:57:27,200 --> 02:57:29,510
repriced it today. Nothing's actually
changed. We're still in range to come

7448
02:57:29,510 --> 02:57:29,520
changed. We're still in range to come
 

7449
02:57:29,520 --> 02:57:31,349
changed. We're still in range to come
back for previous week low. Is it

7450
02:57:31,349 --> 02:57:31,359
back for previous week low. Is it
 

7451
02:57:31,359 --> 02:57:33,110
back for previous week low. Is it
possible this week? Yes. But what we'd

7452
02:57:33,110 --> 02:57:33,120
possible this week? Yes. But what we'd
 

7453
02:57:33,120 --> 02:57:34,630
possible this week? Yes. But what we'd
need to see is more liquidity being

7454
02:57:34,630 --> 02:57:34,640
need to see is more liquidity being
 

7455
02:57:34,640 --> 02:57:37,349
need to see is more liquidity being
built out on a higher time frame. Um,

7456
02:57:37,349 --> 02:57:37,359
built out on a higher time frame. Um,
 

7457
02:57:37,359 --> 02:57:38,950
built out on a higher time frame. Um,
and we'd need to do it long enough that

7458
02:57:38,950 --> 02:57:38,960
and we'd need to do it long enough that
 

7459
02:57:38,960 --> 02:57:40,870
and we'd need to do it long enough that
the Ballinger bands can offer expansion

7460
02:57:40,870 --> 02:57:40,880
the Ballinger bands can offer expansion
 

7461
02:57:40,880 --> 02:57:43,429
the Ballinger bands can offer expansion
because at the moment we are so tight,

02:58:17,510 --> 02:58:17,520
So, there's there's there's not a lot
 

7489
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:19,349
So, there's there's there's not a lot
here. We will get out of this at some

7490
02:58:19,349 --> 02:58:19,359
here. We will get out of this at some
 

7491
02:58:19,359 --> 02:58:21,269
here. We will get out of this at some
point. We cannot keep rotating,

7492
02:58:21,269 --> 02:58:21,279
point. We cannot keep rotating,
 

7493
02:58:21,279 --> 02:58:23,349
point. We cannot keep rotating,
rotating, rotating, rotating, failing,

7494
02:58:23,349 --> 02:58:23,359
rotating, rotating, rotating, failing,
 

7495
02:58:23,359 --> 02:58:24,469
rotating, rotating, rotating, failing,
failing, failing, failing, fail.

7496
02:58:24,469 --> 02:58:24,479
failing, failing, failing, fail.
 

7497
02:58:24,479 --> 02:58:40,070
failing, failing, failing, fail.
Eventually, something's going to change.

7498
02:58:40,070 --> 02:58:40,080

 

7499
02:58:40,080 --> 02:58:41,510

All right. Any questions, folks, before
I get out of there.

7502
02:58:45,990 --> 02:58:46,000

 

7503
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:50,070

I'd be very careful um about looking for

02:58:50,070 --> 02:58:50,080
I'd be very careful um about looking for
 

7505
02:58:50,080 --> 02:58:52,309
I'd be very careful um about looking for
any more shorts now. All right. So, you

7506
02:58:52,309 --> 02:58:52,319
any more shorts now. All right. So, you
 

7507
02:58:52,319 --> 02:58:55,910
any more shorts now. All right. So, you
had the short opportunity here and here

7508
02:58:55,910 --> 02:58:55,920
had the short opportunity here and here
 

7509
02:58:55,920 --> 02:58:58,469
had the short opportunity here and here
down to this. That's your TP1 hit. If

7510
02:58:58,469 --> 02:58:58,479
down to this. That's your TP1 hit. If
 

7511
02:58:58,479 --> 02:59:00,790
down to this. That's your TP1 hit. If
you get down to here, great. Be very

reclaiming this, this can happen. It can

7520
02:59:09,269 --> 02:59:09,279
reclaiming this, this can happen. It can
 

7521
02:59:09,279 --> 02:59:11,670
reclaiming this, this can happen. It can
offer relief. Look how thin we were. All

02:59:13,349 --> 02:59:13,359
right. It can offer relief. It doesn't
 

7525
02:59:13,359 --> 02:59:14,790
right. It can offer relief. It doesn't
happen have to happen today. It can

So you can use this same kind of node

7962
03:09:27,030 --> 03:09:27,040

Still low hanging fruit below. But we've

7978
03:09:46,389 --> 03:09:46,399
Still low hanging fruit below. But we've
 

7979
03:09:46,399 --> 03:09:48,630
Still low hanging fruit below. But we've
just held that gray box. So they might

7980
03:09:48,630 --> 03:09:48,640
just held that gray box. So they might
 

7981
03:09:48,640 --> 03:09:51,030
just held that gray box. So they might
try and attack reattack these 80s. If

7982
03:09:51,030 --> 03:09:51,040
try and attack reattack these 80s. If
 

7983
03:09:51,040 --> 03:09:52,710
try and attack reattack these 80s. If
they fail that gray box we will trade

7984
03:09:52,710 --> 03:09:52,720
they fail that gray box we will trade
 

7985
03:09:52,720 --> 03:09:55,510
they fail that gray box we will trade
lower. We will trade lower. If they fell

7986
03:09:55,510 --> 03:09:55,520
lower. We will trade lower. If they fell
 

7987
03:09:55,520 --> 03:09:58,230
lower. We will trade lower. If they fell
this gray box, we will trade back down

7988
03:09:58,230 --> 03:09:58,240
this gray box, we will trade back down
 

7989
03:09:58,240 --> 03:10:00,469
this gray box, we will trade back down
into this. Just be a repric to sell

7990
03:10:00,469 --> 03:10:00,479
into this. Just be a repric to sell
 

7991
03:10:00,479 --> 03:10:06,309
into this. Just be a repric to sell
into.

7992
03:10:06,309 --> 03:10:06,319

 

7993
03:10:06,319 --> 03:10:13,510

Such a heavy tape today. Insane.

7994
03:10:13,510 --> 03:10:13,520

 

7995
03:10:13,520 --> 03:10:15,190

Back down to the 400s. Losing the gray

7996
03:10:15,190 --> 03:10:15,200
Back down to the 400s. Losing the gray
 

7997
03:10:15,200 --> 03:10:16,950
Back down to the 400s. Losing the gray
box. So, I would expect them to trade

7998
03:10:16,950 --> 03:10:16,960
box. So, I would expect them to trade
 

7999
03:10:16,960 --> 03:10:18,870
box. So, I would expect them to trade
lower at this point. They've done the

8000
03:10:18,870 --> 03:10:18,880
lower at this point. They've done the
 

8001
03:10:18,880 --> 03:10:23,830
lower at this point. They've done the
hard job. Repric, sold into it.

8003
03:10:23,840 --> 03:10:25,429

It's the hard thing for day traders when

03:10:25,429 --> 03:10:25,439
It's the hard thing for day traders when
 

8005
03:10:25,439 --> 03:10:27,349
It's the hard thing for day traders when
they're moving it this much. It makes it

8006
03:10:27,349 --> 03:10:27,359
they're moving it this much. It makes it
 

8007
03:10:27,359 --> 03:10:30,950
they're moving it this much. It makes it
really hard to hold on to positions. Uh

8008
03:10:30,950 --> 03:10:30,960
really hard to hold on to positions. Uh
 

8009
03:10:30,960 --> 03:10:32,870
really hard to hold on to positions. Uh
because you can get caught so quickly

8010
03:10:32,870 --> 03:10:32,880
because you can get caught so quickly
 

8011
03:10:32,880 --> 03:10:36,309
because you can get caught so quickly

like when they rip it 80 points if you
 

8013

guys were short. You don't like you've
 

8015
03:10:38,160 --> 03:10:39,830
guys were short. You don't like you've
got to take some profits when they do

8016
03:10:39,830 --> 03:10:39,840
got to take some profits when they do
 

8017
03:10:39,840 --> 03:10:42,070
got to take some profits when they do
those moves. You know what I mean? They

8018
03:10:42,070 --> 03:10:42,080
those moves. You know what I mean? They
 

8019
03:10:42,080 --> 03:10:43,590
those moves. You know what I mean? They
might just dump this now like even

8020
03:10:43,590 --> 03:10:43,600
might just dump this now like even
 

8021
03:10:43,600 --> 03:10:45,269
might just dump this now like even
further having knocked you guys out by

8022
03:10:45,269 --> 03:10:45,279
further having knocked you guys out by
 

8023
03:10:45,279 --> 03:10:47,269

Still got an imbalance up to 64 which
 

8075
03:13:23,120 --> 03:13:24,710
Still got an imbalance up to 64 which
they can fill. If it starts reclaiming

8076
03:13:24,710 --> 03:13:24,720
they can fill. If it starts reclaiming
 

8077
03:13:24,720 --> 03:13:27,510
they can fill. If it starts reclaiming
IB, I'd be very very worried about big

03:13:27,510 --> 03:13:27,520
IB, I'd be very very worried about big
 

8079

holding gray box back up towards IB
 

8083
03:13:42,640 --> 03:13:46,309
holding gray box back up towards IB
then. So 5560 to 65 is the imbalances.

8084
03:13:46,309 --> 03:13:46,319
then. So 5560 to 65 is the imbalances.
 

8085
03:13:46,319 --> 03:13:48,950
then. So 5560 to 65 is the imbalances.
Back up we go through that. Watch IB now

8086
03:13:48,950 --> 03:13:48,960
Back up we go through that. Watch IB now
 

8087

Back up we go through that. Watch IB now

03:14:11,040 --> 03:14:12,870
fruit, which would be really dirty.
Really, really dirty. But SPY did hit

8106
03:14:12,870 --> 03:14:12,880
Really, really dirty. But SPY did hit
 

8107
03:14:12,880 --> 03:14:15,110
Really, really dirty. But SPY did hit
it. It's one thing to note, SPY did hit

8108
03:14:15,110 --> 03:14:15,120
it. It's one thing to note, SPY did hit
 

8109
03:14:15,120 --> 03:14:16,710
it. It's one thing to note, SPY did hit
that previous day, uh, previous week

8110
03:14:16,710 --> 03:14:16,720
that previous day, uh, previous week
 

8111
03:14:16,720 --> 03:14:20,790
that previous day, uh, previous week
low. So, divergence with the ETF. spy

8112
03:14:20,790 --> 03:14:20,800
low. So, divergence with the ETF. spy
 

8113
03:14:20,800 --> 03:14:22,710
low. So, divergence with the ETF. spy
did come and take it out right here and

8114
03:14:22,710 --> 03:14:22,720
did come and take it out right here and
 

8115
03:14:22,720 --> 03:14:28,070
did come and take it out right here and
it's reclaiming it.

8116
03:14:28,070 --> 03:14:28,080

 

8117
03:14:28,080 --> 03:14:29,670

So, I'd probably be done with a short if

8118
03:14:29,670 --> 03:14:29,680
So, I'd probably be done with a short if
 

8119
03:14:29,680 --> 03:14:31,590
So, I'd probably be done with a short if
I was you guys. Doesn't mean it can't

8120
03:14:31,590 --> 03:14:31,600
I was you guys. Doesn't mean it can't
 

8121
03:14:31,600 --> 03:14:33,190
I was you guys. Doesn't mean it can't
trade lower unless you if you're

8122
03:14:33,190 --> 03:14:33,200
trade lower unless you if you're
 

8123
03:14:33,200 --> 03:14:34,710
trade lower unless you if you're
positioned way up here. Obviously, it's

8124
03:14:34,710 --> 03:14:34,720
positioned way up here. Obviously, it's
 

8125
03:14:34,720 --> 03:14:37,269
positioned way up here. Obviously, it's
different, but if you took that uh wash

8126
03:14:37,269 --> 03:14:37,279
different, but if you took that uh wash
 

8127
03:14:37,279 --> 03:14:46,870
different, but if you took that uh wash
down, be very very careful.

8128
03:14:46,870 --> 03:14:46,880

 

8129
03:14:46,880 --> 03:14:48,389

Right off the previous week low on the

8130
03:14:48,389 --> 03:14:48,399
Right off the previous week low on the
 

8131
03:14:48,399 --> 03:14:52,710
Right off the previous week low on the
spy. Yeah, not on uh not on the Q's

8132
03:14:52,710 --> 03:14:52,720
spy. Yeah, not on uh not on the Q's
 

8133
03:14:52,720 --> 03:14:54,469
spy. Yeah, not on uh not on the Q's
though.

8134
03:14:54,469 --> 03:14:54,479
though.
 

8135
03:14:54,479 --> 03:14:58,309
though.
On the spy but not on the Q's.

8136
03:14:58,309 --> 03:14:58,319
On the spy but not on the Q's.
 

8137
03:14:58,319 --> 03:15:00,309
On the spy but not on the Q's.
VIX failing that level as well after

8138
03:15:00,309 --> 03:15:00,319
VIX failing that level as well after
 

8139
03:15:00,319 --> 03:15:02,630
VIX failing that level as well after
that gap fill. So we have nailed what we

8140
03:15:02,630 --> 03:15:02,640
that gap fill. So we have nailed what we
 

8141
03:15:02,640 --> 03:15:04,389
that gap fill. So we have nailed what we
called on the VIX today. That's really

8142
03:15:04,389 --> 03:15:04,399
called on the VIX today. That's really
 

8143
03:15:04,399 --> 03:15:09,910
called on the VIX today. That's really
really good.

8144
03:15:09,910 --> 03:15:09,920

 

8145
03:15:09,920 --> 03:15:11,510

Morgan, where did you close your short?

8146
03:15:11,510 --> 03:15:11,520
Morgan, where did you close your short?
 

8147
03:15:11,520 --> 03:15:15,590
Morgan, where did you close your short?
Morgan,

8148
03:15:15,590 --> 03:15:15,600

 

8149
03:15:15,600 --> 03:15:17,030

they're lifting again into these

8150
03:15:17,030 --> 03:15:17,040
they're lifting again into these
 

8151
03:15:17,040 --> 03:15:24,389
they're lifting again into these
imbalances

8152
03:15:24,389 --> 03:15:24,399

 

8153
03:15:24,399 --> 03:15:27,030

into these imbalances towards that value

8154
03:15:27,030 --> 03:15:27,040
into these imbalances towards that value
 

8155
03:15:27,040 --> 03:15:29,030
into these imbalances towards that value
area low and IB high. So they're coming

8156
03:15:29,030 --> 03:15:29,040
area low and IB high. So they're coming
 

8157
03:15:29,040 --> 03:15:30,870
area low and IB high. So they're coming
towards this. Do they reject this level

8158
03:15:30,870 --> 03:15:30,880
towards this. Do they reject this level
 

8159
03:15:30,880 --> 03:15:33,670
towards this. Do they reject this level
now? Is is your question, right? If they

8160
03:15:33,670 --> 03:15:33,680
now? Is is your question, right? If they
 

8161
03:15:33,680 --> 03:15:35,510
now? Is is your question, right? If they
reclaim this, there's a big squeeze to

8162
03:15:35,510 --> 03:15:35,520
reclaim this, there's a big squeeze to
 

8163
03:15:35,520 --> 03:15:37,190
reclaim this, there's a big squeeze to
come and run all of this out. Just be

8164
03:15:37,190 --> 03:15:37,200
come and run all of this out. Just be
 

8165
03:15:37,200 --> 03:15:39,510
come and run all of this out. Just be
careful. If they reclaim this is a big

8166
03:15:39,510 --> 03:15:39,520
careful. If they reclaim this is a big
 

8167
03:15:39,520 --> 03:15:41,910
careful. If they reclaim this is a big
squeeze. I'd say 500s would be the level

8168
03:15:41,910 --> 03:15:41,920
squeeze. I'd say 500s would be the level
 

8169
03:15:41,920 --> 03:15:44,229
squeeze. I'd say 500s would be the level
and then up into that same block again.

8170
03:15:44,229 --> 03:15:44,239
and then up into that same block again.
 

8171
03:15:44,239 --> 03:15:47,429
and then up into that same block again.
So, I'd be watching

8172
03:15:47,429 --> 03:15:47,439
So, I'd be watching
 

8173
03:15:47,439 --> 03:15:50,229
So, I'd be watching
these levels now, the remainder of the

8174
03:15:50,229 --> 03:15:50,239
these levels now, the remainder of the
 

8175
03:15:50,239 --> 03:15:52,389
these levels now, the remainder of the
session. If this slows down, I'm going

8176
03:15:52,389 --> 03:15:52,399
session. If this slows down, I'm going
 

8177
03:15:52,399 --> 03:15:53,910
session. If this slows down, I'm going
to get off, guys. I'm just I'm willing

8178
03:15:53,910 --> 03:15:53,920
to get off, guys. I'm just I'm willing
 

8179
03:15:53,920 --> 03:15:55,590
to get off, guys. I'm just I'm willing
to sit here while it's moving, but not

8180
03:15:55,590 --> 03:15:55,600
to sit here while it's moving, but not
 

8181
03:15:55,600 --> 03:16:03,510
to sit here while it's moving, but not
not other than that.

8182
03:16:03,510 --> 03:16:03,520

 

8183
03:16:03,520 --> 03:16:05,590

Took it at 558,

8184
03:16:05,590 --> 03:16:05,600
Took it at 558,
 

8185
03:16:05,600 --> 03:16:08,550
Took it at 558,
closed at 500. Took it at 558. So here's

8186
03:16:08,550 --> 03:16:08,560
closed at 500. Took it at 558. So here's
 

8187
03:16:08,560 --> 03:16:12,469
closed at 500. Took it at 558. So here's
the IB guys

8188
03:16:12,469 --> 03:16:12,479

 

8189
03:16:12,479 --> 03:16:14,870

rejecting value area low so far. Not

8190
03:16:14,870 --> 03:16:14,880
rejecting value area low so far. Not
 

8191
03:16:14,880 --> 03:16:17,190
rejecting value area low so far. Not
quite to IB. So big rejection there.

8192
03:16:17,190 --> 03:16:17,200
quite to IB. So big rejection there.
 

8193
03:16:17,200 --> 03:16:18,950
quite to IB. So big rejection there.
Sellers stepping in there. This is where

8194
03:16:18,950 --> 03:16:18,960
Sellers stepping in there. This is where
 

8195
03:16:18,960 --> 03:16:21,349
Sellers stepping in there. This is where
they sold from earlier. Remember if we

8196
03:16:21,349 --> 03:16:21,359
they sold from earlier. Remember if we
 

8197
03:16:21,359 --> 03:16:22,870
they sold from earlier. Remember if we
get through this then I'd imagine we get

8198
03:16:22,870 --> 03:16:22,880
get through this then I'd imagine we get
 

8199
03:16:22,880 --> 03:16:25,990
get through this then I'd imagine we get
to 500.

8200
03:16:25,990 --> 03:16:26,000
to 500.
 

8201
03:16:26,000 --> 03:16:27,590
to 500.
This can be a two leg that they resell.

8202
03:16:27,590 --> 03:16:27,600
This can be a two leg that they resell.
 

8203
03:16:27,600 --> 03:16:29,750
This can be a two leg that they resell.
Remember? So buyers will want to hold

8204
03:16:29,750 --> 03:16:29,760
Remember? So buyers will want to hold
 

8205
03:16:29,760 --> 03:16:33,349
Remember? So buyers will want to hold
431s. They can't hold 431s new lows.

8206
03:16:33,349 --> 03:16:33,359
431s. They can't hold 431s new lows.
 

8207
03:16:33,359 --> 03:16:35,510
431s. They can't hold 431s new lows.
This can be a two-leg

8208
03:16:35,510 --> 03:16:35,520
This can be a two-leg
 

8209
03:16:35,520 --> 03:16:37,030
This can be a two-leg
retest

8210
03:16:37,030 --> 03:16:37,040

8212
03:16:39,910 --> 03:16:39,920
which is sold or they can reclaim this
 

8213
03:16:39,920 --> 03:16:41,830
which is sold or they can reclaim this

8214
03:16:41,830 --> 03:16:41,840
and squeeze to here and then here.
 

8215
03:16:41,840 --> 03:16:43,349
and squeeze to here and then here.
That's the opportunity in the market

8216
03:16:43,349 --> 03:16:43,359
That's the opportunity in the market
 

8217
03:16:43,359 --> 03:16:52,870
That's the opportunity in the market
right now.

8218
03:16:52,870 --> 03:16:52,880

 

8219
03:16:52,880 --> 03:16:54,469

If I sat on alert looking for a long way

8220
03:16:54,469 --> 03:16:54,479
If I sat on alert looking for a long way
 

8221
03:16:54,479 --> 03:16:58,469
If I sat on alert looking for a long way
where would I want it?

8222
03:16:58,469 --> 03:16:58,479

 

8223
03:16:58,479 --> 03:17:00,469

It's quite hard to to want that right

8224
03:17:00,469 --> 03:17:00,479
It's quite hard to to want that right
 

8225
03:17:00,479 --> 03:17:02,790
It's quite hard to to want that right
now.

8226
03:17:02,790 --> 03:17:02,800
now.
 

8227
03:17:02,800 --> 03:17:05,269
now.
You'd want a rec.

8228
03:17:05,269 --> 03:17:05,279
You'd want a rec.
 

8229
03:17:05,279 --> 03:17:07,110
You'd want a rec.
What's made it hard is this. They've

8230
03:17:07,110 --> 03:17:07,120
What's made it hard is this. They've
 

8231
03:17:07,120 --> 03:17:11,269
What's made it hard is this. They've
made this so thick and messy that like

8232
03:17:11,269 --> 03:17:11,279
made this so thick and messy that like
 

8233
03:17:11,279 --> 03:17:12,630
made this so thick and messy that like
where are you going to long really? You

8234
03:17:12,630 --> 03:17:12,640
where are you going to long really? You
 

8235
03:17:12,640 --> 03:17:14,389
where are you going to long really? You
want to get above that and leave all

8236
03:17:14,389 --> 03:17:14,399
want to get above that and leave all
 

8237
03:17:14,399 --> 03:17:16,389
want to get above that and leave all
this. And I feel like they're going to

8238
03:17:16,389 --> 03:17:16,399
this. And I feel like they're going to
 

8239
03:17:16,399 --> 03:17:19,510
this. And I feel like they're going to
struggle to get above that today. We're

8240
03:17:19,510 --> 03:17:19,520
struggle to get above that today. We're
 

8241
03:17:19,520 --> 03:17:22,229
struggle to get above that today. We're
in a the move is downside. They're

8242
03:17:22,229 --> 03:17:22,239
in a the move is downside. They're
 

8243
03:17:22,239 --> 03:17:24,389
in a the move is downside. They're
selling every they're selling absolutely

8244
03:17:24,389 --> 03:17:24,399
selling every they're selling absolutely
 

8245
03:17:24,399 --> 03:17:27,030
selling every they're selling absolutely
everything. So I' don't think you can

8246
03:17:27,030 --> 03:17:27,040
everything. So I' don't think you can
 

8247
03:17:27,040 --> 03:17:28,950
everything. So I' don't think you can
set an alert. Like maybe yeah, maybe if

8248
03:17:28,950 --> 03:17:28,960
set an alert. Like maybe yeah, maybe if
 

8249
03:17:28,960 --> 03:17:31,110
set an alert. Like maybe yeah, maybe if
you come above 578, but like what's your

8250
03:17:31,110 --> 03:17:31,120
you come above 578, but like what's your
 

8251
03:17:31,120 --> 03:17:32,309
you come above 578, but like what's your
risk going to be at that point? That's

8252
03:17:32,309 --> 03:17:32,319
risk going to be at that point? That's
 

8253
03:17:32,319 --> 03:17:36,790
risk going to be at that point? That's
what's going to make it really hard.

8254
03:17:36,790 --> 03:17:36,800

 

8255
03:17:36,800 --> 03:17:39,510

Okay. Huh.

8256
03:17:39,510 --> 03:17:39,520
Okay. Huh.
 

8257
03:17:39,520 --> 03:17:41,910
Okay. Huh.
All right.

8258
03:17:41,910 --> 03:17:41,920
All right.
 

8259
03:17:41,920 --> 03:17:46,309
All right.
Yeah.

8260
03:17:46,309 --> 03:17:46,319

 

8261
