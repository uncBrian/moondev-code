morning team.

2
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
morning team.
 

3
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,270
morning team.
Good morning everyone. How are we doing?

4
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
Good morning everyone. How are we doing?
 

5
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,790
Good morning everyone. How are we doing?
Hopefully you had a great afternoon

6
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
Hopefully you had a great afternoon
 

7
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,310
Hopefully you had a great afternoon
session. Hopefully some of you held that

8
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
session. Hopefully some of you held that
 

9
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,990
session. Hopefully some of you held that
short through the afternoon and maybe

10
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
short through the afternoon and maybe
 

11
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,110
short through the afternoon and maybe
even some of you recognized those trap

12
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
even some of you recognized those trap
 

13
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,070
even some of you recognized those trap
traders at the lows and took that

14
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
traders at the lows and took that
 

15
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,150
traders at the lows and took that
squeeze back up for the end of day cover

16
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
squeeze back up for the end of day cover
 

17
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,150
squeeze back up for the end of day cover
rally. Where did that squeeze happen?

18
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
rally. Where did that squeeze happen?
 

19
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,310
rally. Where did that squeeze happen?
Well, surprise surprise. Here it is. The

20
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
Well, surprise surprise. Here it is. The
 

21
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,070
Well, surprise surprise. Here it is. The
lower Ballinger band. How many times did

22
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
lower Ballinger band. How many times did
 

23
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,670
lower Ballinger band. How many times did
we go over that? All right. No

24
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
we go over that? All right. No
 

25
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,590
we go over that? All right. No
acceptance above, none below. Still

26
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
acceptance above, none below. Still
 

27
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,629
acceptance above, none below. Still
boxed in. Nothing's changed. There is

28
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
boxed in. Nothing's changed. There is
 

29
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,350
boxed in. Nothing's changed. There is
the possibility today of a continuation.

30
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
the possibility today of a continuation.
 

31
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,710
the possibility today of a continuation.
All right. because we've had a failed

32
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
All right. because we've had a failed
 

33
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,110
All right. because we've had a failed
breakout, right? Failed to break out,

34
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
breakout, right? Failed to break out,
 

35
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,950
breakout, right? Failed to break out,
failed to hold games, pulled all the way

36
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
failed to hold games, pulled all the way
 

37
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,950
failed to hold games, pulled all the way
down, pumped back up, have left these

38
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
down, pumped back up, have left these
 

39
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,350
down, pumped back up, have left these
traders trapped after that gap fill.

40
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
traders trapped after that gap fill.
 

41
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,350
traders trapped after that gap fill.
It's possible we see a continuation.

42
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
It's possible we see a continuation.
 

43
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,870
It's possible we see a continuation.
What's the big problem? Well, we

44
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
What's the big problem? Well, we
 

45
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,790
What's the big problem? Well, we
probably need to build out some

46
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
probably need to build out some
 

47
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,270
probably need to build out some
liquidity down here so that we've got

48
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
liquidity down here so that we've got
 

49
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,309
liquidity down here so that we've got
some shorts to uh get into and we've got

50
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
some shorts to uh get into and we've got
 

51
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,870
some shorts to uh get into and we've got
some buyers to use for the stop run and

52
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880
some buyers to use for the stop run and
 

53
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,550
some buyers to use for the stop run and
we need this Ballinger band to start

54
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
we need this Ballinger band to start
 

55
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,029
we need this Ballinger band to start
opening up. But maybe we have a day

56
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,039
opening up. But maybe we have a day
 

57
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,870
opening up. But maybe we have a day
where we come a little bit outside. So,

58
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
where we come a little bit outside. So,
 

59
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,189
where we come a little bit outside. So,
we're watching these uh yesterday's lows

60
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
we're watching these uh yesterday's lows
 

61
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,550
we're watching these uh yesterday's lows
and the ones from the week before one or

62
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
and the ones from the week before one or
 

63
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,070
and the ones from the week before one or
two 225s and and into sort of 200s,

64
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
two 225s and and into sort of 200s,
 

65
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,230
two 225s and and into sort of 200s,
right? We're watching that. If we start

66
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
right? We're watching that. If we start
 

67
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,230
right? We're watching that. If we start
to see an acceptance below that, it is

68
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
to see an acceptance below that, it is
 

69
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,070
to see an acceptance below that, it is
not the ideal location for the short. As

70
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
not the ideal location for the short. As
 

71
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,430
not the ideal location for the short. As
we know, the ideal location for the

72
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
we know, the ideal location for the
 

73
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,150
we know, the ideal location for the
short was up here or even on a pop up

74
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
short was up here or even on a pop up
 

75
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,230
short was up here or even on a pop up
here today to fade back down. So, we

76
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
here today to fade back down. So, we
 

77
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,309
here today to fade back down. So, we
want to be very very careful shorting

78
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
want to be very very careful shorting
 

79
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,390
want to be very very careful shorting
the lows of a rotation, don't we? So,

80
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
the lows of a rotation, don't we? So,
 

81
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,749
the lows of a rotation, don't we? So,
we're going to have to need to see

82
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
we're going to have to need to see
 

83
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,590
we're going to have to need to see
buyers stuck. The easiest way would be a

84
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:57,600
buyers stuck. The easiest way would be a
 

85
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,309
buyers stuck. The easiest way would be a
push that fails or a dunk underneath

86
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
push that fails or a dunk underneath
 

87
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,710
push that fails or a dunk underneath
that fails to reclaim. That's a riskier

88
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
that fails to reclaim. That's a riskier
 

89
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,469
that fails to reclaim. That's a riskier
trade given what we've got with the

90
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
trade given what we've got with the
 

91
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,309
trade given what we've got with the
Ballinger bands. But we will have to be

92
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
Ballinger bands. But we will have to be
 

93
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,390
Ballinger bands. But we will have to be
aware of it in case it plays out. If we

94
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
aware of it in case it plays out. If we
 

95
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,710
aware of it in case it plays out. If we
are going to just dip and hold again,

96
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
are going to just dip and hold again,
 

97
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,710
are going to just dip and hold again,
which would be just like here and here

98
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
which would be just like here and here
 

99
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,629
which would be just like here and here
and here and here. All right, it would

100
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
and here and here. All right, it would
 

101
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,430
and here and here. All right, it would
be a range rotation back to the 20-day.

102
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,440
be a range rotation back to the 20-day.
 

103
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,870
be a range rotation back to the 20-day.
So, those are the possibilities. This

104
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
So, those are the possibilities. This
 

105
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,390
So, those are the possibilities. This
morning, we're either going to see that

106
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
morning, we're either going to see that
 

107
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,110
morning, we're either going to see that
continuation or the rotation back up. I

108
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
continuation or the rotation back up. I
 

109
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,469
continuation or the rotation back up. I
guess the other possibility which we

110
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
guess the other possibility which we
 

111
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,710
guess the other possibility which we
should talk about is just an inside bar.

112
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:26,720
should talk about is just an inside bar.
 

113
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,070
should talk about is just an inside bar.
All right, which just builds liquidity

114
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
All right, which just builds liquidity
 

115
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,749
All right, which just builds liquidity
down here and we don't do much. It's

116
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
down here and we don't do much. It's
 

117
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,629
down here and we don't do much. It's
also possible we have news 945 10:00 and

118
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
also possible we have news 945 10:00 and
 

119
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,629
also possible we have news 945 10:00 and
we have uh mag earnings tonight. So

120
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:34,639
we have uh mag earnings tonight. So
 

121
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,589
we have uh mag earnings tonight. So
things to be aware of folks. All right,

122
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599
things to be aware of folks. All right,
 

123
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,150
things to be aware of folks. All right,
let's have a look at the uh hourly

124
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
let's have a look at the uh hourly
 

125
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,629
let's have a look at the uh hourly
chart. Find some clues from here. I'm

126
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
chart. Find some clues from here. I'm
 

127
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,150
chart. Find some clues from here. I'm
going to move this up so it's a bit

128
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
going to move this up so it's a bit
 

129
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,990
going to move this up so it's a bit
bigger for you guys to see. This is the

130
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000
bigger for you guys to see. This is the
 

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,749
bigger for you guys to see. This is the
developing week profile. Anyone that's

132
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
developing week profile. Anyone that's
 

133
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,270
developing week profile. Anyone that's
new to stream, this right here is

134
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
new to stream, this right here is
 

135
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,430
new to stream, this right here is
developing week. This is the previous

136
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
developing week. This is the previous
 

137
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,710
developing week. This is the previous
week. So the easiest location to be

138
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
week. So the easiest location to be
 

139
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,869
week. So the easiest location to be
short would actually be a drive up into

140
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:56,879
short would actually be a drive up into
 

141
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,629
short would actually be a drive up into
here. All right, sort of just in front

142
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
here. All right, sort of just in front
 

143
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,950
here. All right, sort of just in front
of 600's. A little stop hunt above there

144
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
of 600's. A little stop hunt above there
 

145
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,629
of 600's. A little stop hunt above there
and a failure. That would be a great

146
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
and a failure. That would be a great
 

147
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,710
and a failure. That would be a great
location to short. That would be a two

148
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
location to short. That would be a two
 

149
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,189
location to short. That would be a two
leg that we could short into looking to

150
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
leg that we could short into looking to
 

151
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,029
leg that we could short into looking to
retest these lows. It doesn't look like

152
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
retest these lows. It doesn't look like
 

153
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,550
retest these lows. It doesn't look like
we're going to get it. It looks at the

154
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
we're going to get it. It looks at the
 

155
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,990
we're going to get it. It looks at the
moment like they've done it overnight.

156
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
moment like they've done it overnight.
 

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,909
moment like they've done it overnight.
There's your first leg into the close.

158
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:13,919
There's your first leg into the close.
 

159
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,350
There's your first leg into the close.
There's the second leg. There's the

160
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
There's the second leg. There's the
 

161
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,510
There's the second leg. There's the
failure to make a new high. And maybe

162
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
failure to make a new high. And maybe
 

163
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,670
failure to make a new high. And maybe
versus sort of 420s they're going to

164
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
versus sort of 420s they're going to
 

165
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,990
versus sort of 420s they're going to
rotate this down. I don't know. So

166
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
rotate this down. I don't know. So
 

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,790
rotate this down. I don't know. So
ideally we get a morning drive which we

168
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
ideally we get a morning drive which we
 

169
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,469
ideally we get a morning drive which we
can sell into. I'm not convinced we're

170
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
can sell into. I'm not convinced we're
 

171
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,990
can sell into. I'm not convinced we're
going to get it but that would be the

172
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
going to get it but that would be the
 

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,629
going to get it but that would be the
most ideal circumstance. Right? If we

174
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
most ideal circumstance. Right? If we
 

175
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,389
most ideal circumstance. Right? If we
don't do that what are the other levels

176
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
don't do that what are the other levels
 

177
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,509
don't do that what are the other levels
I'm looking at? Why is someone's been on

178
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
I'm looking at? Why is someone's been on
 

179
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,949
I'm looking at? Why is someone's been on
my keyboard? There is chocolate on my

180
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
my keyboard? There is chocolate on my
 

181
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,909
my keyboard? There is chocolate on my
keyboard. Right. If we if we don't do

182
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
keyboard. Right. If we if we don't do
 

183
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,310
keyboard. Right. If we if we don't do
that then what I'll be looking for is

184
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
that then what I'll be looking for is
 

185
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,670
that then what I'll be looking for is
this developing point of control

186
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
this developing point of control
 

187
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,110
this developing point of control
previous day value area low. So

188
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
previous day value area low. So
 

189
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,990
previous day value area low. So
somewhere into here 377s up to sort of

190
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
somewhere into here 377s up to sort of
 

191
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,389
somewhere into here 377s up to sort of
420ish. This area here is currently

192
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:50,399
420ish. This area here is currently
 

193
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,870
420ish. This area here is currently
blue. Can we turn this Well, I'm going

194
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
blue. Can we turn this Well, I'm going
 

195
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,230
blue. Can we turn this Well, I'm going
to put it gray for now, but could we

196
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
to put it gray for now, but could we
 

197
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,550
to put it gray for now, but could we
turn it into a red block and then sell

198
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
turn it into a red block and then sell
 

199
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,790
turn it into a red block and then sell
down from that? So, sort of 3 380s

200
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
down from that? So, sort of 3 380s
 

201
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,670
down from that? So, sort of 3 380s
into 420s. All right, that kind of level

202
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:03,680
into 420s. All right, that kind of level
 

203
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,990
into 420s. All right, that kind of level
here. Could we push up, fail, and sell

204
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,000
here. Could we push up, fail, and sell
 

205
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,910
here. Could we push up, fail, and sell
that back down? We will be covering some

206
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:07,920
that back down? We will be covering some
 

207
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,310
that back down? We will be covering some
into previous low swing points. All

208
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
into previous low swing points. All
 

209
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,070
into previous low swing points. All
right, we're going to, you know, we're

210
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
right, we're going to, you know, we're
 

211
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,910
right, we're going to, you know, we're
going to respect those low swing points,

212
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
going to respect those low swing points,
 

213
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,790
going to respect those low swing points,
aren't we? Let's put this back to gray.

214
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
aren't we? Let's put this back to gray.
 

215
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,070
aren't we? Let's put this back to gray.
Right. If we miss that opportunity, all

216
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
Right. If we miss that opportunity, all
 

217
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,350
Right. If we miss that opportunity, all
right, we're going to have to be careful

218
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
right, we're going to have to be careful
 

219
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,269
right, we're going to have to be careful
about this. If we miss this opportunity,

220
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
about this. If we miss this opportunity,
 

221
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,110
about this. If we miss this opportunity,
if this doesn't set up and this doesn't

222
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
if this doesn't set up and this doesn't
 

223
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,470
if this doesn't set up and this doesn't
set up, we want to be very careful

224
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
set up, we want to be very careful
 

225
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,550
set up, we want to be very careful
getting short down here. All right, lots

226
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
getting short down here. All right, lots
 

227
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,389
getting short down here. All right, lots
of guys that have ripped us up from here

228
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
of guys that have ripped us up from here
 

229
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,310
of guys that have ripped us up from here
before. So, if you're going to be short

230
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
before. So, if you're going to be short
 

231
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,509
before. So, if you're going to be short
down here, you're really going to need

232
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
down here, you're really going to need
 

233
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,750
down here, you're really going to need
it to fail under everything and back

234
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,760
it to fail under everything and back
 

235
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,990
it to fail under everything and back
test and stay heavy. You do not want to

236
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
test and stay heavy. You do not want to
 

237
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,030
test and stay heavy. You do not want to
just join in um trying to chase that

238
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,040
just join in um trying to chase that
 

239
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,710
just join in um trying to chase that
momentum because momentum might be good,

240
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
momentum because momentum might be good,
 

241
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,630
momentum because momentum might be good,
but the location here will be terrible.

242
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
but the location here will be terrible.
 

243
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,990
but the location here will be terrible.
Remember, the lower Ballinger band on

244
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
Remember, the lower Ballinger band on
 

245
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,230
Remember, the lower Ballinger band on
the daily is down here. Let's talk about

246
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
the daily is down here. Let's talk about
 

247
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,670
the daily is down here. Let's talk about
the other way, right? If if we're going

248
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680
the other way, right? If if we're going
 

249
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,509
the other way, right? If if we're going
to come down here, maybe we sweep, maybe

250
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
to come down here, maybe we sweep, maybe
 

251
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,870
to come down here, maybe we sweep, maybe
we don't, and we hold and we go back

252
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
we don't, and we hold and we go back
 

253
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,110
we don't, and we hold and we go back
into rotation, then we'd be looking like

254
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
into rotation, then we'd be looking like
 

255
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,670
into rotation, then we'd be looking like
this yesterday for those dips with

256
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
this yesterday for those dips with
 

257
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,670
this yesterday for those dips with
sellers caught at the lows or that move

258
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,680
sellers caught at the lows or that move
 

259
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,150
sellers caught at the lows or that move
back up again. We would have to sell

260
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
back up again. We would have to sell
 

261
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,910
back up again. We would have to sell
some into these key levels. So, the same

262
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:03,920
some into these key levels. So, the same
 

263
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,430
some into these key levels. So, the same
level we're looking to fade, we'd have

264
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
level we're looking to fade, we'd have
 

265
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,350
level we're looking to fade, we'd have
to take a partial on and then hopefully

266
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360
to take a partial on and then hopefully
 

267
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,550
to take a partial on and then hopefully
we could get into 500s and maybe even

268
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
we could get into 500s and maybe even
 

269
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,350
we could get into 500s and maybe even
600s. I will tell you now, where will

270
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,360
600s. I will tell you now, where will
 

271
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,150
600s. I will tell you now, where will
this get squeezy? A base above this. All

272
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,160
this get squeezy? A base above this. All
 

273
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,829
this get squeezy? A base above this. All
right, 600 to 650. If they base in here

274
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:19,839
right, 600 to 650. If they base in here
 

275
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,310
right, 600 to 650. If they base in here
and they start breaking 650, you can see

276
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
and they start breaking 650, you can see
 

277
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,710
and they start breaking 650, you can see
how thin we are all the way back up to

278
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
how thin we are all the way back up to
 

279
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,910
how thin we are all the way back up to
800. So, a base of 600 to 650, a break

280
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
800. So, a base of 600 to 650, a break
 

281
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,630
800. So, a base of 600 to 650, a break
of 650, and then I would expect a move

282
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:30,640
of 650, and then I would expect a move
 

283
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,630
of 650, and then I would expect a move
to 800. That would be the squeeze move.

284
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
to 800. That would be the squeeze move.
 

285
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,550
to 800. That would be the squeeze move.
All right. So, whether that happens or

286
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
All right. So, whether that happens or
 

287
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,790
All right. So, whether that happens or
not, we don't know because we know we

288
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
not, we don't know because we know we
 

289
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,069
not, we don't know because we know we
were very thin down, very thin up, very

290
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
were very thin down, very thin up, very
 

291
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,350
were very thin down, very thin up, very
thin down. All right. So maybe they want

292
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
thin down. All right. So maybe they want
 

293
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,670
thin down. All right. So maybe they want
to repric this back up and then reade

294
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
to repric this back up and then reade
 

295
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,150
to repric this back up and then reade
it. We don't know folks. Who knows what

296
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
it. We don't know folks. Who knows what
 

297
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,590
it. We don't know folks. Who knows what
these lot are doing. We're in a massive

298
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
these lot are doing. We're in a massive
 

299
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,949
these lot are doing. We're in a massive
rotation. We got to be careful. Um edge

300
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
rotation. We got to be careful. Um edge
 

301
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,190
rotation. We got to be careful. Um edge
or is slightly more to the downside

302
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
or is slightly more to the downside
 

303
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,949
or is slightly more to the downside
given the momentum yesterday. But we

304
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
given the momentum yesterday. But we
 

305
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,190
given the momentum yesterday. But we
just got to be aware that every single

306
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
just got to be aware that every single
 

307
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,710
just got to be aware that every single
time we come into here, right, we can't

308
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
time we come into here, right, we can't
 

309
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,350
time we come into here, right, we can't
find acceptance lower. All right, look

310
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
find acceptance lower. All right, look
 

311
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,190
find acceptance lower. All right, look
at all this. These are remember these

312
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
at all this. These are remember these
 

313
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,829
at all this. These are remember these
are weekly profiles. every single time

314
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
are weekly profiles. every single time
 

315
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,190
are weekly profiles. every single time
we come down here, we can't find

316
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,200
we come down here, we can't find
 

317
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,630
we come down here, we can't find
acceptance. But like I've talked about,

318
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
acceptance. But like I've talked about,
 

319
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,269
acceptance. But like I've talked about,
if we start to find acceptance, if they

320
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
if we start to find acceptance, if they
 

321
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,350
if we start to find acceptance, if they
are going to deem that all of this

322
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
are going to deem that all of this
 

323
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,509
are going to deem that all of this
volume is way too high in price and they

324
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
volume is way too high in price and they
 

325
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,870
volume is way too high in price and they
want to go risk off, then we're going to

326
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
want to go risk off, then we're going to
 

327
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,350
want to go risk off, then we're going to
have months and months and months worth

328
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,360
have months and months and months worth
 

329
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,350
have months and months and months worth
of volume trapped above and that would

330
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
of volume trapped above and that would
 

331
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,750
of volume trapped above and that would
be a nice trade if that happens. All

332
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760
be a nice trade if that happens. All
 

333
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,030
be a nice trade if that happens. All
right, move this down. We can have a

334
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
right, move this down. We can have a
 

335
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,470
right, move this down. We can have a
quick look at what happened overnight.

336
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
quick look at what happened overnight.
 

337
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,550
quick look at what happened overnight.
Make sure you can see enough. Not too

338
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
Make sure you can see enough. Not too
 

339
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,910
Make sure you can see enough. Not too
much really. Globex basically went

340
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:35,920
much really. Globex basically went
 

341
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,150
much really. Globex basically went
sideways. All right, so Asia definitely

342
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
sideways. All right, so Asia definitely
 

343
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,069
sideways. All right, so Asia definitely
went sideways. There's the pump after

344
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
went sideways. There's the pump after
 

345
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,630
went sideways. There's the pump after
the trap, right into the low. There's

346
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
the trap, right into the low. There's
 

347
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,110
the trap, right into the low. There's
the pump after the trap. Asia popped up

348
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
the pump after the trap. Asia popped up
 

349
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,190
the pump after the trap. Asia popped up
into Mr. 200. Failed the 200 on London.

350
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
into Mr. 200. Failed the 200 on London.
 

351
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,350
into Mr. 200. Failed the 200 on London.
Back for a retest. Failed it again.

352
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
Back for a retest. Failed it again.
 

353
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,790
Back for a retest. Failed it again.
We're just watching this previous day

354
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
We're just watching this previous day
 

355
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,389
We're just watching this previous day
low down here. I'd be watching this move

356
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
low down here. I'd be watching this move
 

357
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,710
low down here. I'd be watching this move
into 180s because we didn't Oh, it's

358
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
into 180s because we didn't Oh, it's
 

359
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,190
into 180s because we didn't Oh, it's
it's uh sorry, it's from Monday. It's

360
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,200
it's uh sorry, it's from Monday. It's
 

361
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,110
it's uh sorry, it's from Monday. It's
the Monday Sunday open. We didn't clear

362
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
the Monday Sunday open. We didn't clear
 

363
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,630
the Monday Sunday open. We didn't clear
that out yesterday. So, so far it's

364
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:02,640
that out yesterday. So, so far it's
 

365
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,190
that out yesterday. So, so far it's
protected. So, we're watching that.

366
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
protected. So, we're watching that.
 

367
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,670
protected. So, we're watching that.
Okay, let's have a go up here and we

368
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
Okay, let's have a go up here and we
 

369
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,910
Okay, let's have a go up here and we
will get into ES and some of the ETFs.

370
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:09,920
will get into ES and some of the ETFs.
 

371
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,190
will get into ES and some of the ETFs.
You're going to be looking at very, very

372
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
You're going to be looking at very, very
 

373
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,670
You're going to be looking at very, very
similar stuff right now across the

374
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
similar stuff right now across the
 

375
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,230
similar stuff right now across the
broader market.

376
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
broader market.
 

377
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,069
broader market.
All right, big fail here. We got very,

378
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:18,079
All right, big fail here. We got very,
 

379
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,670
All right, big fail here. We got very,
very close to taking out the highs like

380
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,680
very close to taking out the highs like
 

381
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,750
very close to taking out the highs like
we talked about. All right, they came

382
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
we talked about. All right, they came
 

383
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,750
we talked about. All right, they came
right up into these highs and they

384
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:23,760
right up into these highs and they
 

385
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,030
right up into these highs and they
stuffed it and you can see right now

386
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
stuffed it and you can see right now
 

387
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,190
stuffed it and you can see right now
we're right at that point of control.

388
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
we're right at that point of control.
 

389
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,350
we're right at that point of control.
Right, so not much doing here. Uh,

390
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360
Right, so not much doing here. Uh,
 

391
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,750
Right, so not much doing here. Uh,
relative strength I would say on ES

392
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
relative strength I would say on ES
 

393
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,710
relative strength I would say on ES
right now.

394
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
right now.
 

395
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,990
right now.
Right. And if we think about this sort

396
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
Right. And if we think about this sort
 

397
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,310
Right. And if we think about this sort
of range here, we're right in the

398
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320
of range here, we're right in the
 

399
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,150
of range here, we're right in the
middle, aren't we? All right. We did see

400
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
middle, aren't we? All right. We did see
 

401
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,910
middle, aren't we? All right. We did see
rotation yesterday. If you had a look at

402
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
rotation yesterday. If you had a look at
 

403
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,069
rotation yesterday. If you had a look at
the sectors, you saw rotation yesterday

404
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
the sectors, you saw rotation yesterday
 

405
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,750
the sectors, you saw rotation yesterday
back into healthcare, back into

406
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:43,760
back into healthcare, back into
 

407
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,150
back into healthcare, back into
defensive kind of names, back into

408
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,160
defensive kind of names, back into
 

409
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,389
defensive kind of names, back into
finance names. All right, out of tech

410
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
finance names. All right, out of tech
 

411
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,790
finance names. All right, out of tech
into those. So that's why the ES is

412
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:50,800
into those. So that's why the ES is
 

413
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,550
into those. So that's why the ES is
holding up better. All right, a broader

414
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:52,560
holding up better. All right, a broader
 

415
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,430
holding up better. All right, a broader
market. Remember 500 stocks in here that

416
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
market. Remember 500 stocks in here that
 

417
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,910
market. Remember 500 stocks in here that
we're looking at, only 100 in ENQ and

418
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:57,920
we're looking at, only 100 in ENQ and
 

419
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,710
we're looking at, only 100 in ENQ and
very tech heavy in NQ. So, so far

420
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
very tech heavy in NQ. So, so far
 

421
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,350
very tech heavy in NQ. So, so far
holding up okay on ES. All right,

422
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:03,360
holding up okay on ES. All right,
 

423
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,030
holding up okay on ES. All right,
relative strength there. But again, we

424
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
relative strength there. But again, we
 

425
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,430
relative strength there. But again, we
can see we keep getting stuck. We cannot

426
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
can see we keep getting stuck. We cannot
 

427
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,670
can see we keep getting stuck. We cannot
get above that 7,000 and base. All

428
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:09,680
get above that 7,000 and base. All
 

429
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,750
get above that 7,000 and base. All
right, that's the big problem right now.

430
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760
right, that's the big problem right now.
 

431
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,269
right, that's the big problem right now.
So, very similar thing. Are we going to

432
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,279
So, very similar thing. Are we going to
 

433
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,910
So, very similar thing. Are we going to
flush down and clean all of this out?

434
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
flush down and clean all of this out?
 

435
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,150
flush down and clean all of this out?
Right, this is our first big sell.

436
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
Right, this is our first big sell.
 

437
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,470
Right, this is our first big sell.
That's your bounce. We expect a retest

438
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
That's your bounce. We expect a retest
 

439
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,230
That's your bounce. We expect a retest
down here. So, that's probably what

440
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
down here. So, that's probably what
 

441
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,269
down here. So, that's probably what
we're going to be looking for this

442
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
we're going to be looking for this
 

443
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,430
we're going to be looking for this
morning. We can have a look at the ETFs

444
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:25,440
morning. We can have a look at the ETFs
 

445
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,710
morning. We can have a look at the ETFs
to make it a little bit simpler. There

446
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,720
to make it a little bit simpler. There
 

447
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,870
to make it a little bit simpler. There
you go. SPY ETF. If we go from that high

448
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880
you go. SPY ETF. If we go from that high
 

449
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,389
you go. SPY ETF. If we go from that high
to low, it's probably done a 50%

450
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
to low, it's probably done a 50%
 

451
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,350
to low, it's probably done a 50%
retracement already there, almost to 61.

452
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:33,360
retracement already there, almost to 61.
 

453
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,670
retracement already there, almost to 61.
So, looking good here. It's uh into its

454
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,680
So, looking good here. It's uh into its
 

455
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,430
So, looking good here. It's uh into its
gap. So, if we start losing the gap,

456
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
gap. So, if we start losing the gap,
 

457
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,949
gap. So, if we start losing the gap,
then we're going to look for this attack

458
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
then we're going to look for this attack
 

459
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,710
then we're going to look for this attack
down here. And you must be paying

460
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:40,720
down here. And you must be paying
 

461
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,870
down here. And you must be paying
yourself into this because if they set a

462
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
yourself into this because if they set a
 

463
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,949
yourself into this because if they set a
higher low there and want to come up for

464
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:44,959
higher low there and want to come up for
 

465
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,350
higher low there and want to come up for
a second leg, they can before they

466
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
a second leg, they can before they
 

467
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,509
a second leg, they can before they
resell it. Okay? So, we're protective if

468
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
resell it. Okay? So, we're protective if
 

469
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,269
resell it. Okay? So, we're protective if
we get that move there. If we get this

470
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:51,279
we get that move there. If we get this
 

471
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,110
we get that move there. If we get this
morning drive, then as long as these

472
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
morning drive, then as long as these
 

473
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,949
morning drive, then as long as these
buyers up here stay stuck, we will be

474
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
buyers up here stay stuck, we will be
 

475
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,030
buyers up here stay stuck, we will be
selling into it. Same thing on the cues,

476
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
selling into it. Same thing on the cues,
 

477
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,389
selling into it. Same thing on the cues,
right? Exactly the same. You can see the

478
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
right? Exactly the same. You can see the
 

479
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,389
right? Exactly the same. You can see the
relative weakness. Nowhere near a 50%

480
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:00,399
relative weakness. Nowhere near a 50%
 

481
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,150
relative weakness. Nowhere near a 50%
push. All right, if we think about this

482
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
push. All right, if we think about this
 

483
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,829
push. All right, if we think about this
from high to low, nowhere near up here

484
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:05,839
from high to low, nowhere near up here
 

485
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,509
from high to low, nowhere near up here
like the ES, right? So that's the

486
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
like the ES, right? So that's the
 

487
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,350
like the ES, right? So that's the
broadening market into the ES where

488
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,360
broadening market into the ES where
 

489
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,069
broadening market into the ES where
we're seeing weakness in tech. So Q's

490
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
we're seeing weakness in tech. So Q's
 

491
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,069
we're seeing weakness in tech. So Q's
looking for this. If we get very lucky,

492
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
looking for this. If we get very lucky,
 

493
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,750
looking for this. If we get very lucky,
they'll pop up somewhere into here and

494
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:15,760
they'll pop up somewhere into here and
 

495
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,269
they'll pop up somewhere into here and
we can fade that back down. But the

496
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:17,279
we can fade that back down. But the
 

497
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,509
we can fade that back down. But the
moment looks very heavy. Dixie continues

498
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:19,519
moment looks very heavy. Dixie continues
 

499
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,590
moment looks very heavy. Dixie continues
to try and find a bid. All right, it's

500
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:21,600
to try and find a bid. All right, it's
 

501
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,430
to try and find a bid. All right, it's
starting to try and find a bid. If we do

502
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:23,440
starting to try and find a bid. If we do
 

503
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,110
starting to try and find a bid. If we do
this here, you can see this old beauty

504
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120
this here, you can see this old beauty
 

505
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,870
this here, you can see this old beauty
that we look for. All right, a bit of a

506
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:28,880
that we look for. All right, a bit of a
 

507
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,710
that we look for. All right, a bit of a
quasi there. All right, can it get back

508
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:30,720
quasi there. All right, can it get back
 

509
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,629
quasi there. All right, can it get back
into here is the question on the Dixie?

510
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
into here is the question on the Dixie?
 

511
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,870
into here is the question on the Dixie?
I don't know. Uh, we can talk about

512
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:34,880
I don't know. Uh, we can talk about
 

513
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,189
I don't know. Uh, we can talk about
gold. We're doing that move. We're doing

514
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199
gold. We're doing that move. We're doing
 

515
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,790
gold. We're doing that move. We're doing
that move. All right, there's the high.

516
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,800
that move. All right, there's the high.
 

517
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,350
that move. All right, there's the high.
There's the flush. Do we get failure to

518
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360
There's the flush. Do we get failure to
 

519
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,069
There's the flush. Do we get failure to
follow through? This is the key question

520
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
follow through? This is the key question
 

521
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,910
follow through? This is the key question
now on gold and silver. Do the metals

522
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
now on gold and silver. Do the metals
 

523
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,509
now on gold and silver. Do the metals
fail to follow through and get a resell

524
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
fail to follow through and get a resell
 

525
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,910
fail to follow through and get a resell
or do they reclaim base and go for new

526
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
or do they reclaim base and go for new
 

527
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,990
or do they reclaim base and go for new
highs? These are all the opportunities.

528
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
highs? These are all the opportunities.
 

529
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,590
highs? These are all the opportunities.
Same on silver. We talked about this for

530
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:53,600
Same on silver. We talked about this for
 

531
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,870
Same on silver. We talked about this for
the last few days. All right, there's

532
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
the last few days. All right, there's
 

533
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,430
the last few days. All right, there's
the drive down. Buyers are stuck above

534
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
the drive down. Buyers are stuck above
 

535
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,990
the drive down. Buyers are stuck above
here. We can do this to this. We're

536
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
here. We can do this to this. We're
 

537
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,590
here. We can do this to this. We're
looking for something into here. Even if

538
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
looking for something into here. Even if
 

539
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,150
looking for something into here. Even if
you wanted to measure out some volume

540
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,160
you wanted to measure out some volume
 

541
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,710
you wanted to measure out some volume
for all of this, where are you? You

542
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
for all of this, where are you? You
 

543
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,069
for all of this, where are you? You
could use the same kind of thing. It's

544
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
could use the same kind of thing. It's
 

545
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,670
could use the same kind of thing. It's
very rough, but to give you an idea. All

546
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:09,680
very rough, but to give you an idea. All
 

547
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,910
very rough, but to give you an idea. All
right, we're looking you're into this

548
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:11,920
right, we're looking you're into this
 

549
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,030
right, we're looking you're into this
thin level. So, anywhere short from 91

550
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,040
thin level. So, anywhere short from 91
 

551
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,509
thin level. So, anywhere short from 91
up to 99 is possible on silver for a

552
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:17,519
up to 99 is possible on silver for a
 

553
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,430
up to 99 is possible on silver for a
swing position. If it starts reclaiming,

554
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,440
swing position. If it starts reclaiming,
 

555
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,870
swing position. If it starts reclaiming,
night, don't touch it. VIX. All right,

556
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:22,880
night, don't touch it. VIX. All right,
 

557
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,710
night, don't touch it. VIX. All right,
we can see still sort of in this messy

558
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
we can see still sort of in this messy
 

559
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,790
we can see still sort of in this messy
channel that's still producing higher

560
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
channel that's still producing higher
 

561
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,629
channel that's still producing higher
lows, higher lows, higher lows, and it's

562
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:28,639
lows, higher lows, higher lows, and it's
 

563
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,310
lows, higher lows, higher lows, and it's
trying to base to get out of this. So,

564
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,320
trying to base to get out of this. So,
 

565
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,990
trying to base to get out of this. So,
we're watching VIX today. I can give you

566
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
we're watching VIX today. I can give you
 

567
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,590
we're watching VIX today. I can give you
some slightly more accurate levels here

568
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
some slightly more accurate levels here
 

569
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,389
some slightly more accurate levels here
if we zoom in. Right, watching VIX here.

570
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
if we zoom in. Right, watching VIX here.
 

571
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,350
if we zoom in. Right, watching VIX here.
If it starts breaking 1826s, right, then

572
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
If it starts breaking 1826s, right, then
 

573
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,870
If it starts breaking 1826s, right, then
we're going to look for a retest towards

574
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
we're going to look for a retest towards
 

575
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,949
we're going to look for a retest towards
these 19s. Obviously, a breakout over

576
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:42,959
these 19s. Obviously, a breakout over
 

577
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,790
these 19s. Obviously, a breakout over
that is problematic. You can see this

578
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
that is problematic. You can see this
 

579
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,230
that is problematic. You can see this
channel. I know it's rough, but every

580
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
channel. I know it's rough, but every
 

581
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,990
channel. I know it's rough, but every
time we come outside of this channel,

582
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
time we come outside of this channel,
 

583
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,230
time we come outside of this channel,
we're not then reholding. All right,

584
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,240
we're not then reholding. All right,
 

585
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,749
we're not then reholding. All right,
we're not reholding. So, if we break

586
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
we're not reholding. So, if we break
 

587
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,949
we're not reholding. So, if we break
this on VIX, maybe we get going

588
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:54,959
this on VIX, maybe we get going
 

589
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,949
this on VIX, maybe we get going
and uh we will see. If we start dropping

590
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
and uh we will see. If we start dropping
 

591
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,910
and uh we will see. If we start dropping
under here on VIX and rotating,

592
00:15:59,910 --> 00:15:59,920
under here on VIX and rotating,
 

593
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,670
under here on VIX and rotating,
then the market probably finds a bid

594
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
then the market probably finds a bid
 

595
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,670
then the market probably finds a bid
today for that rotation up. I would be

596
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680
today for that rotation up. I would be
 

597
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,069
today for that rotation up. I would be
very aware today about a big divergence

598
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079
very aware today about a big divergence
 

599
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,069
very aware today about a big divergence
kind of day. If we see that, I wonder if

600
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:08,079
kind of day. If we see that, I wonder if
 

601
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,550
kind of day. If we see that, I wonder if
they sell tech regardless. Um, let's

602
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
they sell tech regardless. Um, let's
 

603
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,990
they sell tech regardless. Um, let's
have a quick look at the mag. We are

604
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
have a quick look at the mag. We are
 

605
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,949
have a quick look at the mag. We are
running out of time. I'm going to have

606
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:12,959
running out of time. I'm going to have
 

607
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,550
running out of time. I'm going to have
to be very, very quick here. All right,

608
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:14,560
to be very, very quick here. All right,
 

609
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,230
to be very, very quick here. All right,
Apple had some positive data come out

610
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
Apple had some positive data come out
 

611
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,790
Apple had some positive data come out

right, back down into this area. So,
 

639
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,269

this is a breakout retest. Do they reby

642
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:53,839
this is a breakout retest. Do they reby
 

643
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,430
this is a breakout retest. Do they reby
that back up? That's the big question

644
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,440
that back up? That's the big question
 

645
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,189
that back up? That's the big question
right now. I'm still long in that small

646
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,199
right now. I'm still long in that small
 

647
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,430
right now. I'm still long in that small
position. Microsoft, that looks

648
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
position. Microsoft, that looks
 

649
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,590
position. Microsoft, that looks
terrible. That looks terrible. Uh that's

650

terrible. That looks terrible. Uh that's
going to start perking my interest soon

652
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
going to start perking my interest soon
 

653
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,949
going to start perking my interest soon
as we come into this kind of area here.

654
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
as we come into this kind of area here.
 

655
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,390
as we come into this kind of area here.
All right, they're going risk off on

656
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:08,400
All right, they're going risk off on
 

657
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,789
All right, they're going risk off on
tech. If we start coming sliding under

658
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
tech. If we start coming sliding under
 

659
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,549
tech. If we start coming sliding under
here, I will start bidding back up. I

660
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
here, I will start bidding back up. I
 

661
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,230
here, I will start bidding back up. I
will consider some here, but if we slide

662
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240
will consider some here, but if we slide
 

663
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,390
will consider some here, but if we slide
under longterm, I will start bidding

664
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,400
under longterm, I will start bidding
 

665
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,150
under longterm, I will start bidding
some back up because that is a

666
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,160
some back up because that is a
 

667
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,470
some back up because that is a
overexaggerated move at this point. I

668
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,480
overexaggerated move at this point. I
 

669
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,990
overexaggerated move at this point. I
know everyone's saying it's doomsday.

670
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
know everyone's saying it's doomsday.
 

671
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,750
know everyone's saying it's doomsday.
It's the end of AI. It's the end of

672
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:23,760
It's the end of AI. It's the end of
 

673
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,549
It's the end of AI. It's the end of
tech. But that's 26% down already

674
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:26,559
tech. But that's 26% down already
 

675
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,549
tech. But that's 26% down already
without a pullback. So, we will see. If

676
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:28,559
without a pullback. So, we will see. If
 

677
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,150
without a pullback. So, we will see. If
we slide too much more, I'll start

678
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,160
we slide too much more, I'll start
 

679
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,990
we slide too much more, I'll start
getting interested. Nvidia still in this

680
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
getting interested. Nvidia still in this
 

681
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,230
getting interested. Nvidia still in this
range at the highs, right? Just going

682
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
range at the highs, right? Just going
 

683
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,990
range at the highs, right? Just going
sideways. We've got a peak high,

684
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
sideways. We've got a peak high,
 

685
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,310
sideways. We've got a peak high,
possible blowoff top on that peak

686
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,320
possible blowoff top on that peak
 

687
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,950
possible blowoff top on that peak
formation high. Um, but we are sideways

688
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:40,960
formation high. Um, but we are sideways
 

689
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,070
formation high. Um, but we are sideways
ever since. It is gapping down today. Is

690
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,080
ever since. It is gapping down today. Is
 

691
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,470
ever since. It is gapping down today. Is
that right? Let me see. No, we're flat.

692
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:46,480
that right? Let me see. No, we're flat.
 

693
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,669
that right? Let me see. No, we're flat.
Flat on Nvidia. Tesla. I mean, that

694
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:49,679
Flat on Nvidia. Tesla. I mean, that
 

695
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,350
Flat on Nvidia. Tesla. I mean, that
looks like one of the worst traders I've

696
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
looks like one of the worst traders I've
 

697
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,190
looks like one of the worst traders I've
seen. Unless you're a range trader. I

698
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,200
seen. Unless you're a range trader. I
 

699
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,190
seen. Unless you're a range trader. I
mean, it continues to just do this,

700
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
mean, it continues to just do this,
 

701
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,430
mean, it continues to just do this,
right? Until it loses some of this.

702
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
right? Until it loses some of this.
 

703
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,750
right? Until it loses some of this.
Those 420s have been key for well, must

704
00:17:59,750 --> 00:17:59,760
Those 420s have been key for well, must
 

705
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,549
Those 420s have been key for well, must
be the best part of a year now. So,

706
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559
be the best part of a year now. So,
 

707
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,190
be the best part of a year now. So,
that's it folks. That is it for this

708
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,200

00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880
morning. We have about four minutes
 

711
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,230
morning. We have about four minutes
left. We can have a look at some broad

712
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
left. We can have a look at some broad
 

713
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,870
left. We can have a look at some broad
names. Um in um Netflix started to

714
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:10,880
names. Um in um Netflix started to
 

715
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,310
names. Um in um Netflix started to
undercut yesterday. Remember this is

716
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,320
undercut yesterday. Remember this is
 

717
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,750
undercut yesterday. Remember this is
perking my interest. I've got a small

718
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:13,760
perking my interest. I've got a small
 

719
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,870
perking my interest. I've got a small
piece on this uh long by the way. Just a

720
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:16,880
piece on this uh long by the way. Just a
 

721
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,470
piece on this uh long by the way. Just a
feeler to keep me interested. I'm

722
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
feeler to keep me interested. I'm
 

723
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,870
feeler to keep me interested. I'm
watching really for it to come down into

724
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:20,880
watching really for it to come down into
 

725
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,590
watching really for it to come down into
here somewhere into here. Ideally this

726
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
here somewhere into here. Ideally this
 

727
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,230
here somewhere into here. Ideally this
high here and even if it really wants to

728
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,240
high here and even if it really wants to
 

729
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,470
high here and even if it really wants to
drift and be ridiculous then I'll scoop

730
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480
drift and be ridiculous then I'll scoop
 

731
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,310
drift and be ridiculous then I'll scoop
some up. This is uh we're talking about

732
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,320
some up. This is uh we're talking about
 

733
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,789
some up. This is uh we're talking about
a 3 to five year swing here. Right guys?

734
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
a 3 to five year swing here. Right guys?
 

735
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,390
a 3 to five year swing here. Right guys?
I'm not talking about a trade. I'm

736
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,400
I'm not talking about a trade. I'm
 

737
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,310
I'm not talking about a trade. I'm
talking about a big swing position. So

738
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:36,320
talking about a big swing position. So
 

739
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,070
talking about a big swing position. So
if we come down into this or even this

740
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,080
if we come down into this or even this
 

741
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:45,029
if we come down into this or even this
it will perk my interest

742
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039

 

743
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,390

and I did start long in these as we

744
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:48,400
and I did start long in these as we
 

745
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,870
and I did start long in these as we
talked about yesterday. Uu looking for

746
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880
talked about yesterday. Uu looking for
 

747
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,190
talked about yesterday. Uu looking for
that breakout and hold over 20s which it

748
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
that breakout and hold over 20s which it
 

749
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,270
that breakout and hold over 20s which it
did and USA is also same kind of thing.

750
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
did and USA is also same kind of thing.
 

751
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,870
did and USA is also same kind of thing.
Hold over 20s looking for that

752
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:58,880
Hold over 20s looking for that
 

753
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,549
Hold over 20s looking for that
continuation breakout. So I've got small

754
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:00,559
continuation breakout. So I've got small
 

755
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,549
continuation breakout. So I've got small
starters on there. If we start to build

756
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:02,559
starters on there. If we start to build
 

757
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,470
starters on there. If we start to build
build and build this uh sort of right

758
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,480
build and build this uh sort of right
 

759
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,270
build and build this uh sort of right
shoulder in here now. Hello. All right.

760
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
shoulder in here now. Hello. All right.
 

761
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,029
shoulder in here now. Hello. All right.
I will start to build a position. If we

762
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,039
I will start to build a position. If we
 

763
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,590
I will start to build a position. If we
start to hold this right shoulder. Um

764
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
start to hold this right shoulder. Um
 

765
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,470
start to hold this right shoulder. Um

trying to show up here. So, I'm going to
watch that same area where I got in for

924
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:48,559
watch that same area where I got in for
 

925
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,669
watch that same area where I got in for
that 300 break on a retest. I do not

926
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,679
that 300 break on a retest. I do not
 

927
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,029
that 300 break on a retest. I do not
want that to be reclaimed. Already

928
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:53,039
want that to be reclaimed. Already
 

929
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,270
want that to be reclaimed. Already
paying myself nicely. That is a great

930
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:55,280
paying myself nicely. That is a great
 

931
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,950
paying myself nicely. That is a great
start to the day. Beautiful 50 point

932
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:58,960
start to the day. Beautiful 50 point
 

933
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,029
start to the day. Beautiful 50 point
plus.

934
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039
plus.
 

935
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:08,789
plus.
Can we get down to previous days low?

936
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:08,799

 

937
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,950

Once that big buyer got washed, it

938
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:10,960
Once that big buyer got washed, it
 

939
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,470
Once that big buyer got washed, it
became easier. They are bidding down

940
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:12,480
became easier. They are bidding down
 

941
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,430
became easier. They are bidding down
towards 22 225s to 200. So, we should

942
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:15,440
towards 22 225s to 200. So, we should
 

943
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,909
towards 22 225s to 200. So, we should
get it here, folks. Here we go. Here we

944
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:17,919
get it here, folks. Here we go. Here we

You got to love it when they're kind to

964
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:40,640
You got to love it when they're kind to
 

965
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,870
You got to love it when they're kind to
us in the market.

966
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:42,880
us in the market.
 

967
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,950
us in the market.
Let's go.

Let's go.
 

969
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,350
Let's go.
still looking for previous day low and

970
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,360
still looking for previous day low and
 

971
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,390
still looking for previous day low and
under that uh we have more liquidity as

972
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
under that uh we have more liquidity as
 

973
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,789
under that uh we have more liquidity as
well. So we just previous day low and

974
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
well. So we just previous day low and
 

975
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,710
well. So we just previous day low and
then this green line down here. These

976
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:54,720
then this green line down here. These
 

977
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,710
then this green line down here. These
are the two final cover points but I'm

978
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:56,720
are the two final cover points but I'm
 

979
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,549
are the two final cover points but I'm
going to make sure and paid myself no

980
00:23:58,549 --> 00:23:58,559
going to make sure and paid myself no
 

981
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,310
going to make sure and paid myself no
matter what. They are adding liquidity

982
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,320
matter what. They are adding liquidity
 

983
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,590
matter what. They are adding liquidity
down here. I do think we have another

984
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:01,600
down here. I do think we have another
 

985
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,950
down here. I do think we have another
attempt down. They might just want to

986
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
attempt down. They might just want to
 

987
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,750
attempt down. They might just want to
drift up towards 300 first before they

988
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:05,760
drift up towards 300 first before they
 

989
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,310
drift up towards 300 first before they
come back down there. So 280 to 300 will

990
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,320
come back down there. So 280 to 300 will
 

991
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,029
come back down there. So 280 to 300 will
be a key level they come. So, just a

992
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:11,039
be a key level they come. So, just a
 

993
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,110
be a key level they come. So, just a
small size left on this to see if we can

994
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,120
small size left on this to see if we can
 

995
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,669
small size left on this to see if we can
get down. Watching this 300 test now. If

996
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:15,679
get down. Watching this 300 test now. If
 

997
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,590
get down. Watching this 300 test now. If
they rip back through this, I'll be out.

998
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,600
they rip back through this, I'll be out.
 

999
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,190
they rip back through this, I'll be out.
They can force a squeeze right back to

1000
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
They can force a squeeze right back to
 

1001
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,750
They can force a squeeze right back to
350. But this is the 300 level.

1002
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:23,760

 

1003
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,350

Watching this very careful whether I

1004
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,360
Watching this very careful whether I
 

1005
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,510
Watching this very careful whether I
take this off or not on the runner.

1006
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:27,520
take this off or not on the runner.
 

1007
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:33,269
take this off or not on the runner.
Still holding pretty firm here so far.

1008
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:33,279

 

1009
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,029

Very thin above this. Remember, that's a

1010
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:35,039
Very thin above this. Remember, that's a
 

1011
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,549
Very thin above this. Remember, that's a
nice rejection. Can we get a

1012
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:36,559
nice rejection. Can we get a
 

1013
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,110
nice rejection. Can we get a
continuation now? Can we get down? There

1014
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
continuation now? Can we get down? There
 

1015
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,230
continuation now? Can we get down? There
we go. Come on, baby.

1027
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,149
Can I sing to it? What do I have to do
to make this come down? Come to papa.

1047
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,750

Back to 300 then. Oh, if they reclaim

1048
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:29,760
Back to 300 then. Oh, if they reclaim
 

1049
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,990
Back to 300 then. Oh, if they reclaim
this I will cut the runners which will

1050
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,000
this I will cut the runners which will
 

1051
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,070
this I will cut the runners which will
be a shame. I tell you what, there must

1052
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,080
be a shame. I tell you what, there must
 

1053
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,070
be a shame. I tell you what, there must
be a little lag because I am on a copy

1054
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,080
be a little lag because I am on a copy
 

1055

trader and these are not all together.

1056
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:37,840
trader and these are not all together.
 

1057
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,590
trader and these are not all together.
These are all PAs and you can see

1058
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,600
These are all PAs and you can see
 

1059
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,870
These are all PAs and you can see
there's a little bit of lag between

1060
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:40,880
there's a little bit of lag between
 

1061
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,310
there's a little bit of lag between
them. Back to 300. 300 is is the level.

1062
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,320
them. Back to 300. 300 is is the level.
 

1063
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,029
them. Back to 300. 300 is is the level.
Above 300, they can squeeze to probably

1064
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:47,039
Above 300, they can squeeze to probably
 

1065
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,510
Above 300, they can squeeze to probably
325 and even 350, but as long as we hold

1066
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:51,520
325 and even 350, but as long as we hold
 

1067
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,350
325 and even 350, but as long as we hold
here, we look good. Remember, we are at

1068
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:53,360
here, we look good. Remember, we are at
 

1069
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,110
here, we look good. Remember, we are at
the lower Ballinger band. So, we want to

1070
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,120
the lower Ballinger band. So, we want to
 

1071
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,549
the lower Ballinger band. So, we want to
be careful. We've talked about this on

1072
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:56,559
be careful. We've talked about this on
 

1073
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,350
be careful. We've talked about this on
the daily. This is a question right now

1074
00:25:59,350 --> 00:25:59,360
the daily. This is a question right now
 

1075
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,669
the daily. This is a question right now
as if we can expand. Can we do almost

1076
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:01,679
as if we can expand. Can we do almost
 

1077
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,750
as if we can expand. Can we do almost
like a black swan type event here?

1078
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:03,760
like a black swan type event here?
 

1079
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,070
like a black swan type event here?
Right, when we have a look at this right

1080
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,080
Right, when we have a look at this right
 

1081
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,230
Right, when we have a look at this right
here, you can see we are defending right

1082
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:08,240
here, you can see we are defending right
 

1083
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,470
here, you can see we are defending right
now value on the current developing

1084
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:10,480
now value on the current developing
 

1085
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,549
now value on the current developing
week. We are looking to sweep this low

1086
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:12,559
week. We are looking to sweep this low
 

1087
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,549
week. We are looking to sweep this low
and get into this low and cover into

1088
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:14,559
and get into this low and cover into
 

1089
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,630
and get into this low and cover into
this. If we get under this, the lower

1090
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:16,640
this. If we get under this, the lower
 

1091
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,630
this. If we get under this, the lower
Ballinger band is like right here where

1092
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:18,640
Ballinger band is like right here where
 

1093
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,310
Ballinger band is like right here where
we keep bouncing off under this. We have

1094
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:20,320
we keep bouncing off under this. We have
 

1095
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,350
we keep bouncing off under this. We have
a shot all the way down to here. 25,000

1096
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,360
a shot all the way down to here. 25,000
 

1097
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,830
a shot all the way down to here. 25,000
basically

1098
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:27,840
basically
 

1099
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,549
basically
25,000. No matter what, we are locking

1100
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:30,559
25,000. No matter what, we are locking
 

1101
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:39,190
25,000. No matter what, we are locking
in money.

Web also down. If you're logged in when
 

1109
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,830
Web also down. If you're logged in when
it went down, it still works. If you

1110
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:47,840
it went down, it still works. If you
 

1111
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,510
it went down, it still works. If you
weren't, you can't log in. I'm really

1115
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,310
sorry to hear that, guys. That's uh
that's got to be frustrating. All right.

1116
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,320
that's got to be frustrating. All right.
 

1117
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,070
that's got to be frustrating. All right.
Out here on the runners watching this

1118
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,080
Out here on the runners watching this
 

1119
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,149
Out here on the runners watching this
now as we come back into 25s, right?

1120
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:56,159
now as we come back into 25s, right?
 

1121
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,310
now as we come back into 25s, right?
They can reject 25s to 50s. Otherwise,

1122
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320
They can reject 25s to 50s. Otherwise,
 

1123
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,909
They can reject 25s to 50s. Otherwise,
they can rip this back up. If this is

1124
00:26:59,909 --> 00:26:59,919
they can rip this back up. If this is
 

1125
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,510
they can rip this back up. If this is
going to be another failed, make sure

1126
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,520
going to be another failed, make sure
 

1127
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,269
going to be another failed, make sure
I've got you on the right channel. Uh,

1128
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:03,279
I've got you on the right channel. Uh,
 

1129
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,789
I've got you on the right channel. Uh,
if we fail to sweep these lows,

1130
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:04,799
if we fail to sweep these lows,
 

1131
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,070
if we fail to sweep these lows,
remember, we can rip this straight back

1132
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,080
remember, we can rip this straight back
 

1133
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,990
remember, we can rip this straight back
up to this box, which is where I was

1134
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,000
up to this box, which is where I was
 

1135
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,350
up to this box, which is where I was
first interested in short, but I took

1136
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,360
first interested in short, but I took
 

1137
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,630
first interested in short, but I took
the 300 break right around here. So,

1138
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:12,640
the 300 break right around here. So,
 

1139
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,310
the 300 break right around here. So,
reclaim here. We'll watch these same

1140
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:14,320
reclaim here. We'll watch these same
 

1141
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,830
reclaim here. We'll watch these same
levels. I'll give you a little readout

1142
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:15,840
levels. I'll give you a little readout
 

1143
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,470
levels. I'll give you a little readout
on the mag. Tesla 0.03% down. So,

1144
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
on the mag. Tesla 0.03% down. So,
 

1145
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,510
on the mag. Tesla 0.03% down. So,
basically flat. Nvidia 0.75% down.

1146
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:21,520
basically flat. Nvidia 0.75% down.

right. Back to previous day value area

1156
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:35,279
right. Back to previous day value area
 

1157
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,470
right. Back to previous day value area
low. So they've ripped this back up

1158
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:36,480
low. So they've ripped this back up
 

1159
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,470
low. So they've ripped this back up
through the 300 on the squeeze. Back to

You can see the rotation here. It's very

1168
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:47,200
You can see the rotation here. It's very
 

1169
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,909
You can see the rotation here. It's very
very very aggressive today. Very very

1170

very very aggressive today. Very very
 

1171
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,990
very very aggressive today. Very very
violent the way we're moving. Uh VIX

violent the way we're moving. Uh VIX
 

1173
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,710
violent the way we're moving. Uh VIX
just rejected that pivot at 1830s that

1174
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:54,720
just rejected that pivot at 1830s that
 

1175
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,310

we talked about pre-market come back

1176
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,320
we talked about pre-market come back
 

1177
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,590
we talked about pre-market come back
down to its PDC. So rotation definitely

1178
00:27:59,590 --> 00:27:59,600
down to its PDC. So rotation definitely
 

1179
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,070
down to its PDC. So rotation definitely
taking place right now. I am still what

1180
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,080
taking place right now. I am still what
 

1181
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,909
taking place right now. I am still what
is going on bookmap? Can you start

1182
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:03,919
is going on bookmap? Can you start
 

1183
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,389
is going on bookmap? Can you start
following price instead of being a dick?

1184
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:06,399
following price instead of being a dick?
 

1185
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,549
following price instead of being a dick?
Thank you.

1186

So still rejecting that New York open.

1188
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:10,559
So still rejecting that New York open.
 

1189
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,710
So still rejecting that New York open.
Um I would say over New York open there

1190
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:12,720
Um I would say over New York open there
 

1191
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,590
Um I would say over New York open there
is potential for a squeeze up to 513s if

1192
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:15,600
is potential for a squeeze up to 513s if
 

1193
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,029
is potential for a squeeze up to 513s if
we're going to play both sides. I'm

1194
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:17,039
we're going to play both sides. I'm
 

1195
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,669
we're going to play both sides. I'm
still short biased technically, but you

1196
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:19,679
still short biased technically, but you
 

1197
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,430
still short biased technically, but you
know, up here would be a very nice short

1198
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:21,440
know, up here would be a very nice short
 

1199
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,710
know, up here would be a very nice short
location. If they want to come and run

1200
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:22,720
location. If they want to come and run
 

1201
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,710
location. If they want to come and run
all these stops and come up here, this

1202
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:24,720
all these stops and come up here, this
 

1203
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,669
all these stops and come up here, this
is where I'd love to get short.

1204
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:27,679
is where I'd love to get short.
 

1205
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,269
is where I'd love to get short.
So, flat now and just waiting. I'm not

1206
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:29,279
So, flat now and just waiting. I'm not
 

1207
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,630
So, flat now and just waiting. I'm not
going to play this long on a return

1208
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:30,640
going to play this long on a return
 

1209
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,470
going to play this long on a return
unless I really see it start to base and

1210
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:32,480
unless I really see it start to base and
 

1211
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,669
unless I really see it start to base and
hold far too early. But, uh, ES holding

1212
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:35,679
hold far too early. But, uh, ES holding
 

1213
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,669
hold far too early. But, uh, ES holding
up pretty well here this morning.

1214
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:37,679
up pretty well here this morning.
 

1215
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,190
up pretty well here this morning.
Relative strength in the ES. If you look

1216
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:39,200
Relative strength in the ES. If you look
 

1217
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,389
Relative strength in the ES. If you look
at the broader market, ES 0.08% up. Uh,

1218
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:42,399
at the broader market, ES 0.08% up. Uh,
 

1219
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,710
at the broader market, ES 0.08% up. Uh,
ENQ half a percent down. So, we have

1220
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:44,720
ENQ half a percent down. So, we have
 

1221
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,230
ENQ half a percent down. So, we have
weakness in tech. Like I said, wouldn't

1222
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,240
weakness in tech. Like I said, wouldn't
 

1223
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,669
weakness in tech. Like I said, wouldn't
surprise me if we have a very big

1224
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:47,679
surprise me if we have a very big
 

1225
00:28:47,679 --> 00:29:04,149
surprise me if we have a very big
divergent day today

1226
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:04,159

 

1227
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,149

30 ATR. Yeah, I mean it was actually

1228
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:06,159
30 ATR. Yeah, I mean it was actually
 

1229
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,070
30 ATR. Yeah, I mean it was actually
higher than that. It was actually at an

1230
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,080
higher than that. It was actually at an
 

1231
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:16,549
higher than that. It was actually at an
87 on an M1 ATR.

1232
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:16,559

 

1233
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,630

huge amounts of orders at 620. Let me

1234
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:18,640
huge amounts of orders at 620. Let me
 

1235
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,110
huge amounts of orders at 620. Let me
have a look what you guys are saying.

1236
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,120
have a look what you guys are saying.
 

1237
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,710
have a look what you guys are saying.
Zoom right out.

1238
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:26,720

 

1239
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,310

Wouldn't say huge, but there are some

1240
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:28,320
Wouldn't say huge, but there are some
 

1241
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,230
Wouldn't say huge, but there are some
orders up there. Yeah, it's where we got

1242
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:30,240
orders up there. Yeah, it's where we got
 

1243
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,950
orders up there. Yeah, it's where we got
thick, isn't it? Before I wouldn't say

1244
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:32,960
thick, isn't it? Before I wouldn't say
 

1245
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,230
thick, isn't it? Before I wouldn't say
huge. We still can't get through that

1246
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,240
huge. We still can't get through that
 

1247
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,870
huge. We still can't get through that
New York open right now. We can't get

1248
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:36,880
New York open right now. We can't get
 

1249
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,230
New York open right now. We can't get
through the New York open right now.

1250
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,240

 

1251
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,590

They will have to trigger through that

1252
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:43,600
They will have to trigger through that
 

1253
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,389
They will have to trigger through that
to get any form of squeeze upside into

1254
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:46,399
to get any form of squeeze upside into
 

1255
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,149
to get any form of squeeze upside into
this. And at the moment they keep

1256
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:48,159
this. And at the moment they keep
 

1257
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,549
this. And at the moment they keep
getting stuck up there. Absolutely

1258
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:50,559
getting stuck up there. Absolutely
 

1259
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,350
getting stuck up there. Absolutely
getting stuck up there at the moment.

1260
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,360

 

1261
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,310

ES is through it. VIX just found a bid

1262
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
ES is through it. VIX just found a bid
 

1263
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,310
ES is through it. VIX just found a bid
on PDC.

1264
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:00,320
on PDC.
 

1265
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,549
on PDC.
So my bias is technically still short.

1266
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:02,559
So my bias is technically still short.
 

1267
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,750
So my bias is technically still short.
Until we get over all of this, uh I

1268
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:05,760
Until we get over all of this, uh I
 

1269
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,950
Until we get over all of this, uh I
still think there's a chance to come and

1270
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:06,960
still think there's a chance to come and
 

1271
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,630
still think there's a chance to come and
clean up the lows. If we get over all of

1272
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:08,640
clean up the lows. If we get over all of
 

1273
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,909
clean up the lows. If we get over all of
it, there might be a squeeze up and

1274
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:09,919
it, there might be a squeeze up and
 

1275
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,510
it, there might be a squeeze up and
there might be a short further further

1276
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:11,520
there might be a short further further
 

1277
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,590
there might be a short further further
up later on in the day. But we'll just

1278
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:13,600
up later on in the day. But we'll just
 

1279
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,950
up later on in the day. But we'll just
see. Like like I said, I've made my

1280
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:14,960
see. Like like I said, I've made my
 

1281
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,549
see. Like like I said, I've made my
money. You've seen it on the screen.

1282
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,559
money. You've seen it on the screen.
 

1283
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,470
money. You've seen it on the screen.
Waiting now to see what the next setup

1284
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:18,480
Waiting now to see what the next setup
 

1285
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,230
Waiting now to see what the next setup
brings. I still think we can clean up

1286
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:20,240
brings. I still think we can clean up
 

1287
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,389
brings. I still think we can clean up
all of this. It's a lot of stops down

1288
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:22,399
all of this. It's a lot of stops down
 

1289
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:29,830
all of this. It's a lot of stops down
here now been left.

1290
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:29,840

 

1291
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,870

Lots of you sound like you're having

1292
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:30,880
Lots of you sound like you're having
 

1293
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,549
Lots of you sound like you're having
lots of issues. It sounds like CME

1294
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:32,559
lots of issues. It sounds like CME
 

1295
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,070
lots of issues. It sounds like CME
issues. Honestly, if you guys are having

1296
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,080
issues. Honestly, if you guys are having
 

1297
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,990
issues. Honestly, if you guys are having
trade issues and rhythmic issues and

1298
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,000
trade issues and rhythmic issues and
 

1299
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,630
trade issues and rhythmic issues and
bookmat was slow and I'm getting a few

1300
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:38,640
bookmat was slow and I'm getting a few
 

1301
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,029
bookmat was slow and I'm getting a few
sort of spready orders. Sounds like CME

1302
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:41,039
sort of spready orders. Sounds like CME
 

1303
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,549
sort of spready orders. Sounds like CME
are having issues to me.

1304
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:44,559
are having issues to me.
 

1305
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,149
are having issues to me.
Okay, can these guys make up their mind?

1306
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:46,159
Okay, can these guys make up their mind?
 

1307
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,510
Okay, can these guys make up their mind?
Let's get some volume on here.

1308
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:49,520
Let's get some volume on here.
 

1309
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,510
Let's get some volume on here.
Traded for a few minutes.

1310
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:53,520

 

1311
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,029

See, at the moment, we can't get over

1312
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:55,039
See, at the moment, we can't get over
 

1313
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,110
See, at the moment, we can't get over
this New York open and get up into this

1314
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,120
this New York open and get up into this
 

1315
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,950
this New York open and get up into this
this GlobeEx session and we have not

1316
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:58,960
this GlobeEx session and we have not
 

1317
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,389
this GlobeEx session and we have not
cleaned up all these stops. So, we're

1318
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:00,399
cleaned up all these stops. So, we're
 

1319
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,029
cleaned up all these stops. So, we're
just in the rotation. We have protected

1320
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:03,039
just in the rotation. We have protected
 

1321
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,830
just in the rotation. We have protected
yet again so far. If I take you over to

1322
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:05,840
yet again so far. If I take you over to
 

1323
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,350
yet again so far. If I take you over to
the daily yet again, we have protected

1324
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:09,360
the daily yet again, we have protected
 

1325
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,029
the daily yet again, we have protected
this right here, haven't we? All right.

1326
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:11,039
this right here, haven't we? All right.
 

1327
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,029
this right here, haven't we? All right.
So, three lots of uh dips down here

1328
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:13,039
So, three lots of uh dips down here
 

1329
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,269
So, three lots of uh dips down here
holding the edge of this value area from

1330
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:15,279
holding the edge of this value area from
 

1331
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,430
holding the edge of this value area from
this high. All right. And the Ballinger

1332
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:17,440
this high. All right. And the Ballinger
 

1333
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,269
this high. All right. And the Ballinger
band, we keep protecting that. I'd say

1334
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:19,279
band, we keep protecting that. I'd say
 

1335
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,549
band, we keep protecting that. I'd say
underneath 178, it gets very very thin

1336
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:22,559
underneath 178, it gets very very thin
 

1337
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,549
underneath 178, it gets very very thin
very very quickly. All right. So, it's a

1338
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:24,559
very very quickly. All right. So, it's a
 

1339
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,549
very very quickly. All right. So, it's a
big level for them to keep trying to

1340
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:26,559
big level for them to keep trying to
 

1341
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,470
big level for them to keep trying to
protect.

1342
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:30,480

 

1343
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,310

We might need to build up liquidity for

1344
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:32,320
We might need to build up liquidity for
 

1345
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,789
We might need to build up liquidity for
a session or two. It might very possible

1346
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:34,799
a session or two. It might very possible
 

1347
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,430
a session or two. It might very possible
we have to do that. Are we in a trend

1348
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:37,440
we have to do that. Are we in a trend
 

1349
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,789
we have to do that. Are we in a trend
day? Uh no, we not yet. I I think we

1350
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:40,799
day? Uh no, we not yet. I I think we
 

1351
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,470
day? Uh no, we not yet. I I think we
could develop one. It could be a kind of

1352
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:42,480
could develop one. It could be a kind of
 

1353
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,070
could develop one. It could be a kind of
black swan event kind of day, but we

1354
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,080
black swan event kind of day, but we
 

1355
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,710
black swan event kind of day, but we
will see. We will see. And they might

1356
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:46,720
will see. We will see. And they might
 

1357
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,470
will see. We will see. And they might
well build liquidity for a session or

1358
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:48,480
well build liquidity for a session or
 

1359
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,549
well build liquidity for a session or
two, wait for the earnings and then dunk

1360
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:50,559
two, wait for the earnings and then dunk
 

1361
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,029
two, wait for the earnings and then dunk
it. I am watching this again around this

1362
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:53,039
it. I am watching this again around this
 

1363
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,190
it. I am watching this again around this
300 level. That's where uh point of

1364
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,200
300 level. That's where uh point of
 

1365
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,310
300 level. That's where uh point of
control now is for me based on delta and

1366
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:58,320
control now is for me based on delta and
 

1367
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,710
control now is for me based on delta and
they are starting to sell into this

1368
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:00,720
they are starting to sell into this
 

1369
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,630
they are starting to sell into this
level again. If they don't rebid this,

1370
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:02,640
level again. If they don't rebid this,
 

1371
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,549
level again. If they don't rebid this,
this market is likely to get heavy. So

1372
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:04,559
this market is likely to get heavy. So
 

1373
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,950
this market is likely to get heavy. So
I'm watching this 300 again. We have

1374
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:06,960
I'm watching this 300 again. We have
 

1375
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,190
I'm watching this 300 again. We have
some buildup of liquidity down at 72s,

1376
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,200
some buildup of liquidity down at 72s,
 

1377
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,950
some buildup of liquidity down at 72s,
272s.

1378
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:10,960
272s.
 

1379
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,710
272s.
So watching this, they're still bidding

1380
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:12,720
So watching this, they're still bidding
 

1381
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,310
So watching this, they're still bidding
in and around here. It's where that big

1382
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:14,320
in and around here. It's where that big
 

1383
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,830
in and around here. It's where that big
seller came in this morning. So it's a

1384
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:15,840
seller came in this morning. So it's a
 

1385
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,389
seller came in this morning. So it's a
huge huge level. If they start losing

1386
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:18,399
huge huge level. If they start losing
 

1387
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,470
huge huge level. If they start losing
this, it's possible we go back towards

1388
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:20,480
this, it's possible we go back towards
 

1389
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,389
this, it's possible we go back towards
that low of day there. I will respect

1390
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:22,399
that low of day there. I will respect
 

1391
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,950
that low of day there. I will respect
80s and 72s though and we have a node

1392
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:24,960
80s and 72s though and we have a node
 

1393
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,070
80s and 72s though and we have a node
here at sort of 37s to 40s. So 300 to

1394
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,080
here at sort of 37s to 40s. So 300 to
 

1395
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,870
here at sort of 37s to 40s. So 300 to
40s current rotation over that potential

1396
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:30,880
40s current rotation over that potential
 

1397
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,750
40s current rotation over that potential
squeeze through the New York open and uh

1398
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:33,760
squeeze through the New York open and uh
 

1399
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,070
squeeze through the New York open and uh
VWAP. So here they go back to the 40s.

1400
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,080
VWAP. So here they go back to the 40s.
 

1401
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,509
VWAP. So here they go back to the 40s.
Can they get through the 50s to New York

1402
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:37,519
Can they get through the 50s to New York
 

1403
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,909
Can they get through the 50s to New York
open? Yes. So they held 300 back to the

1404
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:39,919
open? Yes. So they held 300 back to the
 

1405
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,149
open? Yes. So they held 300 back to the
40s back towards trying to get to this

1406
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:42,159
40s back towards trying to get to this
 

1407
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,990
40s back towards trying to get to this
gray box in the New York open. This is a

1408
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:44,000
gray box in the New York open. This is a
 

1409
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,310
gray box in the New York open. This is a
very thick level. I want to remind you

1410
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:46,320
very thick level. I want to remind you
 

1411
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,470
very thick level. I want to remind you
this is not just like a random gray box.

1412
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:48,480
this is not just like a random gray box.
 

1413
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,630
this is not just like a random gray box.
All right. the developing profile with

1414
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:50,640
All right. the developing profile with
 

1415
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,190
All right. the developing profile with
the point of control. We can see this is

1416
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:53,200
the point of control. We can see this is
 

1417
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,230
the point of control. We can see this is
our contested level. Okay, shorts under

1418
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:56,240
our contested level. Okay, shorts under
 

1419
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,509
our contested level. Okay, shorts under
here all the time they're holding this,

1420
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:57,519
here all the time they're holding this,
 

1421
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,190
here all the time they're holding this,
they're looking for this. If buyers get

1422
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,200
they're looking for this. If buyers get
 

1423
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,549
they're looking for this. If buyers get
above this, they're looking for that

1424
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:00,559
above this, they're looking for that
 

1425
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,470
above this, they're looking for that
rotation. And above here, I would

1426
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:02,480
rotation. And above here, I would
 

1427
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,750
rotation. And above here, I would
imagine shorts will try and come back

1428
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:03,760
imagine shorts will try and come back
 

1429
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,509
imagine shorts will try and come back
in. If buyers hold this, there's a

1430
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:05,519
in. If buyers hold this, there's a
 

1431
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,029
in. If buyers hold this, there's a
gigantic squeeze. All right? So, we have

1432
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:07,039
gigantic squeeze. All right? So, we have
 

1433
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,830
gigantic squeeze. All right? So, we have
to be willing to play both sides. We

1434
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:09,840
to be willing to play both sides. We
 

1435
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,750
to be willing to play both sides. We
have to be willing to play both sides

1436
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:11,760
have to be willing to play both sides
 

1437
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,990
have to be willing to play both sides
based on what has been built out in

1438
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,000
based on what has been built out in
 

1439
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,310
based on what has been built out in
front of us. It's not cuz I don't know

00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,320
front of us. It's not cuz I don't know
 

1441
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,070
front of us. It's not cuz I don't know
what I'm doing. It's because this is

what I'm doing. It's because this is
 

1443

New York open over that potential

1460
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:54,640
New York open over that potential
 

1461
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,669
New York open over that potential
squeeze. Uh gapill would be to 453 if it

1462
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:57,679
squeeze. Uh gapill would be to 453 if it
 

1463
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,029
squeeze. Uh gapill would be to 453 if it
wants to be an efficient market. I will

1464
00:33:59,029 --> 00:33:59,039
wants to be an efficient market. I will
 

1465
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,630
wants to be an efficient market. I will
not be playing the longs for this first

1466
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:00,640
not be playing the longs for this first
 

1467
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,669
not be playing the longs for this first
drive up. I can tell you that now. No

1468
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:03,679
drive up. I can tell you that now. No
 

1469
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,430

way. No way am I doing that today. And

1470
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:07,440
way. No way am I doing that today. And
 

1471
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,510
way. No way am I doing that today. And
already locked in some great money this

1472
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:09,520
already locked in some great money this
 

1473
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,950
already locked in some great money this
morning.

1474
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:12,960

 

1475
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,270

Another global trade issue, guys. I'm so

1476
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:15,280
Another global trade issue, guys. I'm so
 

1477
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,950
Another global trade issue, guys. I'm so
sorry. I mean, it's got to be so

1478
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:16,960
sorry. I mean, it's got to be so
 

1479
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,510
sorry. I mean, it's got to be so
frustrating, hasn't it? It's got to be

1480
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:19,520
frustrating, hasn't it? It's got to be
 

1481
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,430
frustrating, hasn't it? It's got to be
so frustrating. But, you know, maybe

1482
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:21,440
so frustrating. But, you know, maybe
 

1483
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,790
so frustrating. But, you know, maybe
trade your cash accounts. If you've got

1484
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:22,800
trade your cash accounts. If you've got
 

1485
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,349
trade your cash accounts. If you've got
a cash account, even if it's a ETF based

1486
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:27,359
a cash account, even if it's a ETF based
 

1487
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,030
a cash account, even if it's a ETF based
account, you could trade Q's. If you

1488
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,040
account, you could trade Q's. If you
 

1489
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,710
account, you could trade Q's. If you
didn't have a futures based account, you

1490
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:30,720
didn't have a futures based account, you
 

1491
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,669
didn't have a futures based account, you
could trade Q's or SQ or TQ if you

1492
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:33,679
could trade Q's or SQ or TQ if you
 

1493
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,669
could trade Q's or SQ or TQ if you
wanted to be triple leveraged in it.

1494
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:37,679
wanted to be triple leveraged in it.
 

1495
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,990
wanted to be triple leveraged in it.
Or use another provider. You could

1496
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,000
Or use another provider. You could
 

1497
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,069
Or use another provider. You could
always get a rhythmic account setup or

1498
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:42,079
always get a rhythmic account setup or
 

1499
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:51,990
always get a rhythmic account setup or
Motive Wave or something else.

1500
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,000

 

1501
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,510

I don't think it's too often. I think I

1502
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:53,520
I don't think it's too often. I think I
 

1503
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,149
I don't think it's too often. I think I
I can remember twice in the last two or

1504
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:56,159
I can remember twice in the last two or
 

1505
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,270
I can remember twice in the last two or
three years that we've had this. It's

1506
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:57,280
three years that we've had this. It's
 

1507
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,030
three years that we've had this. It's
just that they've been close together.

1508
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,040
just that they've been close together.
 

1509
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,790
just that they've been close together.
If they start happening too regularly,

1510
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:00,800
If they start happening too regularly,
 

1511
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,150
If they start happening too regularly,
though, it'll be a problem. All right,

1512
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,160
though, it'll be a problem. All right,
 

1513
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,710
though, it'll be a problem. All right,
we just failed that New York open again.

1514
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:04,720
we just failed that New York open again.
 

1515
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,910
we just failed that New York open again.
Right, this thing is struggling to get

1516
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:07,920
Right, this thing is struggling to get
 

1517
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,310
Right, this thing is struggling to get
through that. Struggling to get through

1518
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:10,320
through that. Struggling to get through
 

1519
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,750
through that. Struggling to get through
that.

1520
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:13,760

 

1521
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,510

And it's back into this shelf at these

1522
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:15,520
And it's back into this shelf at these
 

1523
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,630
And it's back into this shelf at these
40s again. So 40s to uh

1524
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:20,640
40s again. So 40s to uh
 

1525
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,470
40s again. So 40s to uh
to 80s is the rotation. If they lose

1526
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:22,480
to 80s is the rotation. If they lose
 

1527
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,310
to 80s is the rotation. If they lose
40s, we're coming back for 300. If we

1528
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:24,320
40s, we're coming back for 300. If we
 

1529
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,829
40s, we're coming back for 300. If we
lose 300, we're probably going back for

1530
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:25,839
lose 300, we're probably going back for
 

1531
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,109
lose 300, we're probably going back for
the lows and a big snap. So watching

1532
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:29,119
the lows and a big snap. So watching
 

1533
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,510
the lows and a big snap. So watching
this, this level here is big. This is

1534
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:31,520
this, this level here is big. This is
 

1535
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,470
this, this level here is big. This is
300. You can see it. This is kind of

1536
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:34,480
300. You can see it. This is kind of
 

1537
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,790
300. You can see it. This is kind of
sentiment right now. So you can see this

1538
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:36,800
sentiment right now. So you can see this
 

1539
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,390
sentiment right now. So you can see this
here and this node here being developed

1540
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:38,400
here and this node here being developed
 

1541
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,870
here and this node here being developed
to sort of 40s up to this higher 80s.

1542
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:40,880
to sort of 40s up to this higher 80s.
 

1543
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,310
to sort of 40s up to this higher 80s.
They lose 40s, they're going to come

1544
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:42,320
They lose 40s, they're going to come
 

1545
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,630
They lose 40s, they're going to come
300. they lose that we probably break

1546
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:44,640
300. they lose that we probably break
 

1547
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,310
300. they lose that we probably break
down into this if they lose that. Big

1548
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:46,320
down into this if they lose that. Big
 

1549
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,710
down into this if they lose that. Big
ifs, but uh if they did, that's what we

1550
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:48,720
ifs, but uh if they did, that's what we
 

1551
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,390
ifs, but uh if they did, that's what we
would expect.

1552
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:54,400

 

1553
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,910

Can't even connect your regular account

1554
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:55,920
Can't even connect your regular account
 

1555
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,790
Can't even connect your regular account
to Ninja. That seems odd.

1556
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:58,800
to Ninja. That seems odd.
 

1557
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,470
to Ninja. That seems odd.
That seems odd. Mine are working so I

1558
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:02,480
That seems odd. Mine are working so I
 

1559
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,870
That seems odd. Mine are working so I
haven't got that problem. Let me just

1560
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:04,880
haven't got that problem. Let me just
 

1561
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,910
haven't got that problem. Let me just
Sorry, guys. We're blowing up my phone.

1562
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:11,920

 

1563
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,710

They never learn. It's like this is the

1564
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:14,720
They never learn. It's like this is the
 

1565
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,870
They never learn. It's like this is the
time I work.

1566
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:16,880
time I work.
 

1567
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,710
time I work.
Yeah. They want to ring and call me and

1568
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:18,720
Yeah. They want to ring and call me and
 

1569
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,670
Yeah. They want to ring and call me and
text me at this time. Right. Here we go.

1570
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:21,680
text me at this time. Right. Here we go.
 

1571
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,550
text me at this time. Right. Here we go.
Back to these 40s again.

1572
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:24,560
Back to these 40s again.
 

1573
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,310
Back to these 40s again.
Back down. If we lose this back down to

1574
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:26,320
Back down. If we lose this back down to
 

1575
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,310
Back down. If we lose this back down to
the 300. So, watching this now. If they

1576
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:28,320
the 300. So, watching this now. If they
 

1577
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,829
the 300. So, watching this now. If they
start losing this and I see follow

1578
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:29,839
start losing this and I see follow
 

1579
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,589
start losing this and I see follow
through, then I think there's a

1580
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:31,599
through, then I think there's a
 

1581
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,190
through, then I think there's a
potential low day move here. So, we're

1582
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,200
potential low day move here. So, we're
 

1583
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,390
potential low day move here. So, we're
watching point of control into 300 here.

1584
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:36,400
watching point of control into 300 here.
 

1585
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,390
watching point of control into 300 here.
Here we go.

1586
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:38,400
Here we go.
 

1587
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,270
Here we go.
Back towards this 300. And can we get

1588
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,280
Back towards this 300. And can we get
 

1589
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,270
Back towards this 300. And can we get
follow through underneath this now? 40s

1590
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:43,280
follow through underneath this now? 40s
 

1591
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,670
follow through underneath this now? 40s
to 300. Here's 300. We got a small piece

1592
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:45,680
to 300. Here's 300. We got a small piece
 

1593
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,710
to 300. Here's 300. We got a small piece
on in case we fail underneath this. Here

1594
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:48,720
on in case we fail underneath this. Here
 

1595
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,950
on in case we fail underneath this. Here
we go. Under the 300. Want to see this

1596
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:50,960
we go. Under the 300. Want to see this
 

1597
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,950
we go. Under the 300. Want to see this
stay heavy on a rejection and then we

1598
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:52,960
stay heavy on a rejection and then we
 

1599
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,109
stay heavy on a rejection and then we
can go low of day.

1600
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:55,119
can go low of day.
 

1601
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,750
can go low of day.
Not staying heavy yet. So just 40 to 300

So, want to see if we retest 30s and
stay heavy and then snap uh 300s and go

1612
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,240
stay heavy and then snap uh 300s and go
 

1613

low of day.
 

1615
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,270
low of day.
So, can we retest 30s and stay heavy and

1616
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:15,280
So, can we retest 30s and stay heavy and
 

1617
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,430
So, can we retest 30s and stay heavy and
then snap 300 and go low of day. If we

1618
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:17,440
then snap 300 and go low of day. If we
 

1619
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,510
then snap 300 and go low of day. If we
reclaim 40s then uh there's no trade

1620
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:19,520
reclaim 40s then uh there's no trade
 

1621
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,870
reclaim 40s then uh there's no trade
downside here. News coming here as well.

Another lot of news coming in uh how

1624
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:25,280
Another lot of news coming in uh how
 

1625
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,230

1627
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,030
long? 15 minutes now.
Okay. It's still basing around this 300

1628
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,040
Okay. It's still basing around this 300
 

1629
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,109
Okay. It's still basing around this 300
this gray box. So the opportunities here

1630
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:33,119
this gray box. So the opportunities here
 

1631
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,310
this gray box. So the opportunities here
will either be the uh a straight fade

1632
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:36,320
will either be the uh a straight fade
 

1633
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,910
will either be the uh a straight fade
underneath or this this this this is an

1634
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:39,920
underneath or this this this this is an
 

1635
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,790
underneath or this this this this is an
opportunity or I guess this to here and

1636
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:42,800
opportunity or I guess this to here and
 

1637
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,630
opportunity or I guess this to here and
then reade that back down. Those are the

1638
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:44,640
then reade that back down. Those are the
 

1639
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,109
then reade that back down. Those are the
opportunities.

1640
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:47,119
opportunities.
 

1641
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,190
opportunities.
Here's the move back towards the 30s. We

1642
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,200
Here's the move back towards the 30s. We
 

1643
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,310
Here's the move back towards the 30s. We
only got to 24s.

1644
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:52,320
only got to 24s.
 

1645
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,990
only got to 24s.
Still think this got liquidity lower to

1646
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:54,000
Still think this got liquidity lower to
 

1647
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,910
Still think this got liquidity lower to
clean up. The ES holding up pretty well.

1648
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:55,920
clean up. The ES holding up pretty well.

up towards highs, which is great for me
 

1671
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,230
up towards highs, which is great for me
because I'm still swing long. Um that

1672
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:22,240
because I'm still swing long. Um that
 

1673
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,069
because I'm still swing long. Um that
might be because of uh what came out

1674
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:24,079
might be because of uh what came out
 

1675
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,109
might be because of uh what came out

1681
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,630
So, out of all the tech, obviously it
doesn't have big AI

1682
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:36,640
doesn't have big AI
 

1683
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,790
doesn't have big AI
um what would you call it? Exposure,

1685
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:45,349
um what would you call it? Exposure,
let's call it.

1686
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:45,359

 

1687
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,670

it's a global outage, it will not make a

1698
00:38:59,430 --> 00:38:59,440
it's a global outage, it will not make a
 

1699
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,030
it's a global outage, it will not make a
difference. If you're trading prop, you

1700
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,040
difference. If you're trading prop, you
 

1701
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,390
difference. If you're trading prop, you
will be okay. All right, back down to

00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:02,400
will be okay. All right, back down to
 

1703
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,990
will be okay. All right, back down to
these 300s. We still can't get through

1704
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,000
these 300s. We still can't get through
 

1705
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,230
these 300s. We still can't get through
this 40 that we just talked about. This

1706
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,240
this 40 that we just talked about. This
 

1707
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,630
this 40 that we just talked about. This
is still possible here. It's very, very

1708
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:08,640
is still possible here. It's very, very
 

1709
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,870
is still possible here. It's very, very
whippy between 40 and 300. They cannot

1710
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:10,880
whippy between 40 and 300. They cannot
 

1711
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,870
whippy between 40 and 300. They cannot
make their mind up here. So, here to

1712
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:12,880
make their mind up here. So, here to
 

1713
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,310
make their mind up here. So, here to
here is the liquidity through here.

1714
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:14,320
here is the liquidity through here.
 

1715
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,630
here is the liquidity through here.
Here, stop hunt through this gap. Fill

1716
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:16,640
Here, stop hunt through this gap. Fill
 

1717
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,750
Here, stop hunt through this gap. Fill
possible. I'm not going to trade the

1718
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:17,760
possible. I'm not going to trade the
 

1719
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,670
possible. I'm not going to trade the
long. Like I said, if we lose this, I'll

1720
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:19,680
long. Like I said, if we lose this, I'll
 

1721
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,710
long. Like I said, if we lose this, I'll
be interested.

1722
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:22,720
be interested.
 

1723
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,990
be interested.
So big squeeze all the way back up

1724
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,000
So big squeeze all the way back up
 

1725
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,829
So big squeeze all the way back up
based on absolutely nothing other than

1726
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:27,839
based on absolutely nothing other than
 

1727
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,030
based on absolutely nothing other than
ES catching a bid and then rotating the

1728
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,040
ES catching a bid and then rotating the
 

1729
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,670
ES catching a bid and then rotating the
300 to 40s back to the high of day. If

1730
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:33,680
300 to 40s back to the high of day. If
 

1731
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,109
300 to 40s back to the high of day. If
they can't pop these stops, it's going

1732
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:35,119
they can't pop these stops, it's going
 

1733
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,829
they can't pop these stops, it's going
to be pretty pathetic at this point.

1734
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:39,839

 

1735
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,069

Seriously, you got to go and run the
 

1741
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,349
Seriously, you got to go and run the
stops out one side. You can't do

00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:55,359
stops out one side. You can't do

be that we do an inside day and just
 

1779
00:40:44,560 --> 00:41:07,910
be that we do an inside day and just

1781
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,950

This thing is stuck now. Stuck in this

1788
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:17,359
This thing is stuck now. Stuck in this
 

1789
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,589
This thing is stuck now. Stuck in this
value. Tight value now. 70 to 95. Pretty

1790
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:21,599
value. Tight value now. 70 to 95. Pretty
 

1791
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,390
value. Tight value now. 70 to 95. Pretty
tight here. Pretty tight here. Let's see

1792
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:24,400
tight here. Pretty tight here. Let's see
 

1793
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:36,950
tight here. Pretty tight here. Let's see
what they do.

1794
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:36,960

 

1795
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,829

feel like they're going to wash it. They

1796
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:39,839
feel like they're going to wash it. They
 

1797
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,990
feel like they're going to wash it. They
cannot break the highs, but you just it

1798
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:42,000
cannot break the highs, but you just it
 

1799
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,910
cannot break the highs, but you just it
would be much better if they clean one

1800
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:43,920
would be much better if they clean one
 

1801
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,030
would be much better if they clean one
side out. Back to the 300 again. So, we

1802
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:47,040
side out. Back to the 300 again. So, we
 

1803
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,750
side out. Back to the 300 again. So, we
are not breaking this New York open and

1804
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:49,760
are not breaking this New York open and
 

1805
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,430
are not breaking this New York open and
VWAP and getting above here. We're still

1806
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:51,440
VWAP and getting above here. We're still
 

1807
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,990
VWAP and getting above here. We're still
in a ro small rotation here. Under 300,

1808
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,000
in a ro small rotation here. Under 300,
 

1809
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,750
in a ro small rotation here. Under 300,
low of day is possible. I've said it so

1810
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:55,760
low of day is possible. I've said it so
 

1811
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,589
low of day is possible. I've said it so
many times. Under 300, low of days. Back

1812
00:41:57,589 --> 00:41:57,599
many times. Under 300, low of days. Back
 

1813
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,349
many times. Under 300, low of days. Back
to the point of control. Here we go.

1814
00:41:59,349 --> 00:41:59,359
to the point of control. Here we go.
 

1815
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,349
to the point of control. Here we go.
Back to these 300. So, if they don't

1816
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:01,359
Back to these 300. So, if they don't
 

1817
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,190
Back to these 300. So, if they don't
save this now, I would imagine low of

1818
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:03,200
save this now, I would imagine low of
 

1819
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,790
save this now, I would imagine low of
day.

1820
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:04,800
day.
 

1821
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,790
day.
Very, very possible.

1822
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:08,800

 

1823
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,950

Here we go, folks.

1824
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:12,960

 

1825
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,309

If they stay heavy, 300 to 317 is kind

1826
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:16,319
If they stay heavy, 300 to 317 is kind
 

1827
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:17,589
If they stay heavy, 300 to 317 is kind
of the level where the sellers came in

1828
00:42:17,589 --> 00:42:17,599
of the level where the sellers came in
 

1829
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,950
of the level where the sellers came in
at. They stay heavy there, I would

1830
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:18,960
at. They stay heavy there, I would
 

1831
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,150
at. They stay heavy there, I would
imagine, low of day. If they don't stay

1832
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,160
imagine, low of day. If they don't stay
 

1833
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,670
imagine, low of day. If they don't stay
heavy, obviously we go straight back to

00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:21,680
heavy, obviously we go straight back to
 

1835
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,750
heavy, obviously we go straight back to
the 40s again. You can see we're very

1836
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:23,760
the 40s again. You can see we're very
 

1837
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,270
the 40s again. You can see we're very
tight in this rotation. If we lose this

1838
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:25,280
tight in this rotation. If we lose this
 

1839
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,829
tight in this rotation. If we lose this
gray box, I will assume that we're going

gray box, I will assume that we're going
 

1841

1977
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,510
down to low of day. In fact, ES just
wicked low of day. Come on, ENQ. Don't

wicked low of day. Come on, ENQ. Don't
 

1979
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,270
wicked low of day. Come on, ENQ. Don't
do me like that. Massive divergence. ES

1980
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:25,280
do me like that. Massive divergence. ES
 

1981

do me like that. Massive divergence. ES
just wicked low of day. I'm glad I got a

just wicked low of day. I'm glad I got a
 

1983
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,430
just wicked low of day. I'm glad I got a

Right. Watching this for rejection of

Right. Watching this for rejection of

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,150
Right. Watching this for rejection of
300. Got to stay heavy versus 300 here.

1988
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:36,160
300. Got to stay heavy versus 300 here.

Worst case scenario, 320. But really, we

Worst case scenario, 320. But really, we
 

1991
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,069
Worst case scenario, 320. But really, we
want to stay heavy versus gray box.

1992
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:40,079
want to stay heavy versus gray box.
 

1993
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,589
want to stay heavy versus gray box.
These are still recover points. Still

1994
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:41,599
These are still recover points. Still
 

1995
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,309
These are still recover points. Still
holding this. Got one left on. Let this

1996
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:44,319
holding this. Got one left on. Let this
 

1997
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,069
holding this. Got one left on. Let this
work now.

1998
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:48,079

 

1999
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:56,309

Let this work now. Back to the 300. Oh,

2000
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:56,319

 

2001
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,790

ES has done me dirty there. It's a

2002
00:45:58,790 --> 00:45:58,800
ES has done me dirty there. It's a
 

2003
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,470
ES has done me dirty there. It's a
divergence there with ES. I still think

2004
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:00,480
divergence there with ES. I still think
 

2005
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,470
divergence there with ES. I still think
we're going to get the move, but ES has

2006
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:02,480
we're going to get the move, but ES has
 

2007
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,150
we're going to get the move, but ES has
done me dirty there. Big fail. Washed

2008
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:04,160
done me dirty there. Big fail. Washed
 

2009
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,069
done me dirty there. Big fail. Washed
the low of day and found a bid. That is

2010
00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:06,079
the low of day and found a bid. That is
 

2011
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,309
the low of day and found a bid. That is
dirty. That ENQ will not do it with it

2012
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:08,319
dirty. That ENQ will not do it with it
 

2013
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:09,990
dirty. That ENQ will not do it with it
when we've got relative weakness. You

2014
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:10,000
when we've got relative weakness. You
 

2015
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,710

probably squeeze to 40s, but all the

probably squeeze to 40s, but all the
 

2031
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,750

time we're holding that. It's not too

2032
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:29,760
time we're holding that. It's not too
 

2033
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,710
time we're holding that. It's not too
bad.

45s that we talked about. It just came
 

2041
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,589
45s that we talked about. It just came
right up to 40. Very, very volatile.

What a beauty. What an absolute beauty.
So protective. Now we don't want this to

2280
00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:49,599
So protective. Now we don't want this to
 

2281
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,030
So protective. Now we don't want this to
reclaim here. You can move your stop

2282
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:51,040
reclaim here. You can move your stop
 

2283
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,390
reclaim here. You can move your stop
down if you want to try and hold this

2284
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:52,400
down if you want to try and hold this
 

2285
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,390
down if you want to try and hold this
all day. Uh you can move your stop down

2286
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:54,400
all day. Uh you can move your stop down
 

2287
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,190
all day. Uh you can move your stop down
and try and protect sort of 250s. But uh

2288
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:57,200
and try and protect sort of 250s. But uh
 

2289
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,950
and try and protect sort of 250s. But uh
this is your lowhanging fruit trade.

2290
00:51:58,950 --> 00:51:58,960
this is your lowhanging fruit trade.
 

2291
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,190
this is your lowhanging fruit trade.
It's happened. We never reclaimed. Okay.

2292
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:01,200
It's happened. We never reclaimed. Okay.
 

2293
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,870
It's happened. We never reclaimed. Okay.
So here was the thesis today. If we

2294
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:02,880
So here was the thesis today. If we
 

2295
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,309
So here was the thesis today. If we
reject this gray box, we're looking

2296
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:04,319
reject this gray box, we're looking
 

2297
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,549
reject this gray box, we're looking
short. We rejected them open. First

2298
00:52:06,549 --> 00:52:06,559
short. We rejected them open. First
 

2299
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,630
short. We rejected them open. First
trade on the open. I didn't take that

2300
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:08,640
trade on the open. I didn't take that
 

2301
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,349
trade on the open. I didn't take that
first rejection. I took the 300 break

2302
00:52:11,349 --> 00:52:11,359
first rejection. I took the 300 break
 

2303
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,270
first rejection. I took the 300 break
once I saw that buyer get caught. So,

2304
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:13,280
once I saw that buyer get caught. So,
 

2305
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,030
once I saw that buyer get caught. So,
the first trade today was the 300 break

2306
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:17,040
the first trade today was the 300 break
 

2307
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,390
the first trade today was the 300 break
right here. So, I was just using

2308
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:18,400
right here. So, I was just using
 

2309
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,270
right here. So, I was just using
orderflow for that. Um, where is my

2310
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:21,280
orderflow for that. Um, where is my
 

2311
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,309
orderflow for that. Um, where is my
short position? Right. Was right here.

2312
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:24,319
short position? Right. Was right here.
 

2313
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,390
short position? Right. Was right here.
You're not going to do it for me really.

2314
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:26,400
You're not going to do it for me really.
 

2315
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,390
You're not going to do it for me really.
There we go. First one was right here

2316
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:28,400
There we go. First one was right here
 

2317
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,150
There we go. First one was right here
into We were trying to get to the low of

2318
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:30,160
into We were trying to get to the low of
 

2319
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,829
into We were trying to get to the low of
day, right? We're trying to get to that.

2320
00:52:31,829 --> 00:52:31,839
day, right? We're trying to get to that.
 

2321
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:34,390
day, right? We're trying to get to that.
We only got to like here.

2322
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:34,400
We only got to like here.
 

2323
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,309
We only got to like here.
That was trade one. Trade two into gray

2324
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:36,319
That was trade one. Trade two into gray
 

2325
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,549
That was trade one. Trade two into gray
box. So, final targets hit. Now, you're

2326
00:52:38,549 --> 00:52:38,559
box. So, final targets hit. Now, you're
 

2327
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,470
box. So, final targets hit. Now, you're
just a runner, folks. And, uh, you can

2328
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:40,480
just a runner, folks. And, uh, you can
 

2329
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,230
just a runner, folks. And, uh, you can
try and hold this. Now, the next level

2330
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:42,240
try and hold this. Now, the next level
 

2331
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,670
try and hold this. Now, the next level
of liquidity I'll be watching at is

2332
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:43,680
of liquidity I'll be watching at is
 

2333
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,670
of liquidity I'll be watching at is
basically 25,09. So, you're looking for

2334
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:45,680
basically 25,09. So, you're looking for
 

2335
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:50,549
basically 25,09. So, you're looking for
25,000. Now, uh Dere

166 points short. and you might well get
a 300 plus point short today. So, if you

2354
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:14,400
a 300 plus point short today. So, if you
 

2355
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,430
a 300 plus point short today. So, if you
can just do me at least the courtesy of

can just do me at least the courtesy of
 

2357
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,109
can just do me at least the courtesy of
hitting the like button. Like I told

2358
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:19,119
hitting the like button. Like I told
 

2359
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,390
hitting the like button. Like I told
you, I was not going to be looking for

2360
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:20,400
you, I was not going to be looking for
 

2361
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,309
you, I was not going to be looking for
longs today. I knew we're at the lower

2362
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:22,319
longs today. I knew we're at the lower
 

2363
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,230
longs today. I knew we're at the lower
ballinger band, but I said I think we

2364
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:24,240
ballinger band, but I said I think we
 

2365
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,990
ballinger band, but I said I think we
might get that black swan type of event.

2366
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:26,000
might get that black swan type of event.
 

2367
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,910
might get that black swan type of event.
We're going to get divergence to the ES

2368
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:27,920
We're going to get divergence to the ES
 

2369
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,270
We're going to get divergence to the ES
because we had a broadening of the

2370
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:29,280
because we had a broadening of the
 

2371
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,349
because we had a broadening of the
market yesterday and that's what we've

2372
00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:31,359
market yesterday and that's what we've
 

2373
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:36,309
market yesterday and that's what we've
had. ES only 0.44% down. ENQ 1.30% down.

2374
00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:36,319
had. ES only 0.44% down. ENQ 1.30% down.
 

2375
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,109
had. ES only 0.44% down. ENQ 1.30% down.
Why? Because tech is weak. Yesterday I

2376
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:39,119
Why? Because tech is weak. Yesterday I
 

2377
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,430
Why? Because tech is weak. Yesterday I
told you we rotated back into defensive

2378
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:41,440
told you we rotated back into defensive
 

2379
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,829
told you we rotated back into defensive
names which is why ES is holding up. But

2380
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:43,839
names which is why ES is holding up. But
 

2381
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:47,990
names which is why ES is holding up. But
if we look at the sectors in the market,

2382
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:48,000
if we look at the sectors in the market,
 

2383
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,349
if we look at the sectors in the market,
you got to understand the difference

2384
00:53:49,349 --> 00:53:49,359
you got to understand the difference
 

2385
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,589
you got to understand the difference
between them two. It's not some [\h__\h]

2386
00:53:51,589 --> 00:53:51,599
between them two. It's not some [\h__\h]
 

2387
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,589
between them two. It's not some [\h__\h]
madeup algo stuff. It's about actual

2388
00:53:53,589 --> 00:53:53,599
madeup algo stuff. It's about actual
 

2389
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,710
madeup algo stuff. It's about actual
rotation. All right. So this is why. All

2390
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:56,720
rotation. All right. So this is why. All
 

2391
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,470
rotation. All right. So this is why. All
right. Look at what is staying heavy.

2392
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:58,480
right. Look at what is staying heavy.
 

2393
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,470
right. Look at what is staying heavy.

2404
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:13,680
honest. So, the rotation has been in
 

2405
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,950
honest. So, the rotation has been in
full effect and that's why we're seeing

full effect and that's why we're seeing
 

2407
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,549
full effect and that's why we're seeing
the weakness. Look at the little bid on

retest up here for where we've got
volume. All right, but the damage has

2422
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:27,839
volume. All right, but the damage has
 

2423
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,910
volume. All right, but the damage has
been done. We've made our money. If you

2424
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:29,920
been done. We've made our money. If you
 

2425
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,150
been done. We've made our money. If you
were going to do a re-short today, all

2426
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:32,160
were going to do a re-short today, all
 

2427
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,710
were going to do a re-short today, all
right, then you would need this pop up

2428
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:34,720
right, then you would need this pop up
 

2429
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,630
right, then you would need this pop up
here versus this, this, and certainly

2430
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:36,640
here versus this, this, and certainly
 

2431
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,150
here versus this, this, and certainly
this one of these to fail. But remember,

2432
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:40,160
this one of these to fail. But remember,
 

2433
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,589
this one of these to fail. But remember,
your low hanging fruits have gone.

2434
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:43,599
your low hanging fruits have gone.
 

2435
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:51,829
your low hanging fruits have gone.
We love those low hanging fruits.

2447
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,829

What do I mean by the broadening of the

2448
00:55:05,829 --> 00:55:05,839
What do I mean by the broadening of the
 

2449
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:09,589
What do I mean by the broadening of the
market? Okay. So, if we think about

2450
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:09,599
market? Okay. So, if we think about
 

2451
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,349
market? Okay. So, if we think about
if we think about let's get you to uh

2452
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:13,359
if we think about let's get you to uh
 

2453
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:15,829
if we think about let's get you to uh
I take you over to a daily. Right.

2454

I take you over to a daily. Right.
 

2455
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:21,589
I take you over to a daily. Right.
Right. If we think about

2456
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:21,599

 

2457
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,510

this run. All right. If we think about

2458
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:25,520
this run. All right. If we think about
 

2459
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,710
this run. All right. If we think about
this run

2460
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:28,720
this run
 

2461
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,990
this run
and this run, all right, in the Q's,

2462
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:32,000
and this run, all right, in the Q's,
 

2463
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,390
and this run, all right, in the Q's,
right? What caused this run in the Q's

2464
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:34,400
right? What caused this run in the Q's
 

2465
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,349
right? What caused this run in the Q's
in the ES? Right, the MAG, right? The

2466
00:55:37,349 --> 00:55:37,359
in the ES? Right, the MAG, right? The
 

2467
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:40,950
in the ES? Right, the MAG, right? The
MAG 7. If you look in this run here,

2468
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:40,960
MAG 7. If you look in this run here,
 

2469
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,430
MAG 7. If you look in this run here,
right, the amount of stocks over their

2470
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:43,440
right, the amount of stocks over their
 

2471
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,430
right, the amount of stocks over their
50-day moving average was very small for

2472
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:47,440
50-day moving average was very small for
 

2473
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,910
50-day moving average was very small for
a very long period of time. Why? All

2474
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:49,920
a very long period of time. Why? All
 

2475
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,430
a very long period of time. Why? All
right. In the Q's, 60% of the Q's is

2476
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:53,440
right. In the Q's, 60% of the Q's is
 

2477
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,750
right. In the Q's, 60% of the Q's is
made up by the Mag Seven. All right. So,

2478
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:55,760
made up by the Mag Seven. All right. So,
 

2479
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,750
made up by the Mag Seven. All right. So,
if we have a really, really, really,

2480
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:57,760
if we have a really, really, really,
 

2481
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,750
if we have a really, really, really,
really, really strong Mag 7, which is

2482
00:55:59,750 --> 00:55:59,760
really, really strong Mag 7, which is
 

2483
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,510
really, really strong Mag 7, which is
what we've had. All right. If we think

2484
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:01,520
what we've had. All right. If we think
 

2485
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,430
what we've had. All right. If we think
about what we've had, let's look at like

2486
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:03,440
about what we've had, let's look at like
 

2487
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,549
about what we've had, let's look at like
during this time, if we look at Nvidia,

2488
00:56:06,549 --> 00:56:06,559
during this time, if we look at Nvidia,
 

2489
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:08,870
during this time, if we look at Nvidia,
the growth of Nvidia,

2490
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:08,880
the growth of Nvidia,
 

2491
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,349
the growth of Nvidia,
right? From like from December, we just

2492
00:56:11,349 --> 00:56:11,359
right? From like from December, we just
 

2493
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:14,630
right? From like from December, we just
said from 22s 20 like we've moved from

2494
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:14,640
said from 22s 20 like we've moved from
 

2495
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,829
said from 22s 20 like we've moved from
the equivalent of 11 bucks to 200 bucks.

2496
00:56:17,829 --> 00:56:17,839
the equivalent of 11 bucks to 200 bucks.
 

2497
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,990
the equivalent of 11 bucks to 200 bucks.
So, I know it's done a split, but

2498
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,000
So, I know it's done a split, but
 

2499
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,150
So, I know it's done a split, but
percentage games is the same. We're up

2500
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:22,160
percentage games is the same. We're up
 

2501
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,829
percentage games is the same. We're up
2,000%.

2502
00:56:23,829 --> 00:56:23,839
2,000%.
 

2503
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,069
2,000%.
Right? 2,000%.

2504
00:56:26,069 --> 00:56:26,079
Right? 2,000%.
 

2505
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,390
Right? 2,000%.
All right. So, in that time, are we

2506
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:28,400
All right. So, in that time, are we
 

2507
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,109
All right. So, in that time, are we
having other sectors move up 2,000%.

2508
00:56:31,109 --> 00:56:31,119
having other sectors move up 2,000%.
 

2509
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,030
having other sectors move up 2,000%.
Remember, this is the number one stock

2510
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:33,040
Remember, this is the number one stock
 

2511
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,270
Remember, this is the number one stock
in the world, right? No. If we look at

2512
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:35,280
in the world, right? No. If we look at
 

2513
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,829
in the world, right? No. If we look at
some of the other things like AVGO, same

2514
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:37,839
some of the other things like AVGO, same
 

2515
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,349
some of the other things like AVGO, same
kind of thing. Look at this run from

2516
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:39,359
kind of thing. Look at this run from
 

2517
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,390
kind of thing. Look at this run from
2023, right? 2023 we have moved from the

2518
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:42,400
2023, right? 2023 we have moved from the
 

2519
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,150
2023, right? 2023 we have moved from the
equivalent of what 59 bucks all the way

2520
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:46,160
equivalent of what 59 bucks all the way
 

2521
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:51,510
equivalent of what 59 bucks all the way
up to 400 bucks. All right. Again 579%.

2522
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:51,520
up to 400 bucks. All right. Again 579%.
 

2523
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,950
up to 400 bucks. All right. Again 579%.
If we look at Meta

2524
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:54,960
If we look at Meta
 

2525
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,109
If we look at Meta
from 2023

2526
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:57,119
from 2023
 

2527
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:03,270
from 2023
we've moved from 88 bucks

2528
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:03,280

 

2529
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,150

all the way up to 800 bucks. Right? 800%

2530
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:06,160
all the way up to 800 bucks. Right? 800%
 

2531
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,990
all the way up to 800 bucks. Right? 800%
gains. Right? So if we think about that

2532
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:08,000
gains. Right? So if we think about that
 

2533
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,150
gains. Right? So if we think about that
the MAG doing these huge gains they are

2534
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:10,160
the MAG doing these huge gains they are
 

2535
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,870
the MAG doing these huge gains they are
dragging the markets up but the other

2536
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:12,880
dragging the markets up but the other
 

2537
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,870
dragging the markets up but the other
sectors all right the other names the

2538
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:14,880
sectors all right the other names the
 

2539
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,549
sectors all right the other names the
finances if we look like the best

2540
00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:16,559
finances if we look like the best
 

2541
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,589
finances if we look like the best
performing financial stock is JP Morgan

2542
00:57:19,589 --> 00:57:19,599
performing financial stock is JP Morgan
 

2543
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,430
performing financial stock is JP Morgan
all right and in that equivalent time is

2544
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:21,440
all right and in that equivalent time is
 

2545
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,349
all right and in that equivalent time is
it up anywhere near as much and this is

2546
00:57:23,349 --> 00:57:23,359
it up anywhere near as much and this is
 

2547
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:25,910
it up anywhere near as much and this is
the best performing stock no it's not up

2548
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:25,920
the best performing stock no it's not up
 

2549
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,309
the best performing stock no it's not up
we're not talking about thousand% are we

2550
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:28,319
we're not talking about thousand% are we
 

2551
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:32,870
we're not talking about thousand% are we
not talking about th000% all right

2552
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:32,880
not talking about th000% all right
 

2553
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,349
not talking about th000% all right
140% all right and that's a good

2554
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:35,359
140% all right and that's a good
 

2555
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:37,430
140% all right and that's a good
performing stock That's a good good

2556
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:37,440
performing stock That's a good good
 

2557
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,950
performing stock That's a good good
performing stock. It's the best stock in

2558
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:38,960
performing stock. It's the best stock in
 

2559
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,789
performing stock. It's the best stock in
the financial sector. So, what we're

2560
00:57:40,789 --> 00:57:40,799
the financial sector. So, what we're
 

2561
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:43,589
the financial sector. So, what we're
seeing is profits being taken out of

2562
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:43,599
seeing is profits being taken out of
 

2563
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,789
seeing is profits being taken out of
tech and rotated into the other sectors,

2564
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:46,799
tech and rotated into the other sectors,
 

2565
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,390
tech and rotated into the other sectors,
some of the defensive names. Look at the

2566
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:48,400
some of the defensive names. Look at the
 

2567
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,990
some of the defensive names. Look at the
metals, right? Look at the metals. Look

2568
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:50,000
metals, right? Look at the metals. Look
 

2569
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,150
metals, right? Look at the metals. Look
at all these things like that starting

2570
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:52,160
at all these things like that starting
 

2571
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,789
at all these things like that starting
to gain a bid. Right? Look at what I've

2572
00:57:54,789 --> 00:57:54,799
to gain a bid. Right? Look at what I've
 

2573
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:57,349
to gain a bid. Right? Look at what I've
uh started looking at this week. Uh like

2574
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:57,359
uh started looking at this week. Uh like
 

2575
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,990
uh started looking at this week. Uh like
uranium,

2576
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:00,000
uranium,
 

2577
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,630
uranium,
energy. All right. Where have we gone?

2578
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:02,640
energy. All right. Where have we gone?
 

2579
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,109
energy. All right. Where have we gone?
Right? We're starting to find bid.

2580
00:58:05,109 --> 00:58:05,119
Right? We're starting to find bid.
 

2581
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,470
Right? We're starting to find bid.
You're starting to see flow come out of

2582
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:08,480
You're starting to see flow come out of
 

2583
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,910
You're starting to see flow come out of
NQ or the MAG and into some of these

2584
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:11,920
NQ or the MAG and into some of these
 

2585
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,069
NQ or the MAG and into some of these
broadening broadening names, which is

2586
00:58:14,069 --> 00:58:14,079
broadening broadening names, which is
 

2587
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,270
broadening broadening names, which is
why we're starting to get some of this.

2588
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:15,280
why we're starting to get some of this.
 

2589
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,710
why we're starting to get some of this.
I need to move this down for you guys,

2590
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:16,720
I need to move this down for you guys,
 

2591
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,390
I need to move this down for you guys,
don't I? There we go. Which is why we're

2592
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:18,400
don't I? There we go. Which is why we're
 

2593
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,309
don't I? There we go. Which is why we're
starting to get some of this. Right? So,

2594
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:20,319
starting to get some of this. Right? So,
 

2595
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,069
starting to get some of this. Right? So,
it's the broadening of the market. It's

2596
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:22,079
it's the broadening of the market. It's
 

2597
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,710
it's the broadening of the market. It's
it's financial

2598
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:24,720
it's financial
 

2599
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,030
it's financial
uh institutions moving into some other

2600
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:27,040
uh institutions moving into some other
 

2601
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,829
uh institutions moving into some other
name. Same as we've seen, right? Why is

2602
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:29,839
name. Same as we've seen, right? Why is
 

2603
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,510
name. Same as we've seen, right? Why is
the Russell caught a bid? Right? It's

2604
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:31,520
the Russell caught a bid? Right? It's
 

2605
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,589
the Russell caught a bid? Right? It's
the catchup trade, right? This the

2606
00:58:33,589 --> 00:58:33,599
the catchup trade, right? This the
 

2607
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,309
the catchup trade, right? This the
Russell is not the tech sector. It's all

2608
00:58:36,309 --> 00:58:36,319
Russell is not the tech sector. It's all
 

2609
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:37,589
Russell is not the tech sector. It's all
the other sectors. Look at what we've

2610
00:58:37,589 --> 00:58:37,599
the other sectors. Look at what we've
 

2611
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,109
the other sectors. Look at what we've
been doing right since 2021. Bugger all

2612
00:58:41,109 --> 00:58:41,119
been doing right since 2021. Bugger all
 

2613
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:44,390
been doing right since 2021. Bugger all
really, right? But we found a bid as

2614
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:44,400
really, right? But we found a bid as
 

2615
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,270
really, right? But we found a bid as
we've started to rotate in. Compare this

2616
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:47,280
we've started to rotate in. Compare this
 

2617
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,309
we've started to rotate in. Compare this
exact chart here from 2021 right till

00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:50,319
exact chart here from 2021 right till
 

2619
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,950
exact chart here from 2021 right till
today. If we compare that exact chart to

2620
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:52,960
today. If we compare that exact chart to
 

2621
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,829

the ENQ

2622

this up a bit

2626
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:00,480
this up a bit
 

2627
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,710
this up a bit
2021 to today. I remember the Russell

2628
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:02,720
2021 to today. I remember the Russell
 

2629
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,670
2021 to today. I remember the Russell
looked boxed in. Uh the ENQ, this is

2630
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:05,680
looked boxed in. Uh the ENQ, this is
 

2631
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,349
looked boxed in. Uh the ENQ, this is
what ENQ's done during that time.

2632
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:09,359
what ENQ's done during that time.
 

2633
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:13,270
what ENQ's done during that time.
Huge, right? We've moved from 10,000

2634
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:13,280
Huge, right? We've moved from 10,000
 

2635
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,910
Huge, right? We've moved from 10,000
to 26,000,

2636
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:15,920
to 26,000,
 

2637
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,069
to 26,000,
right? Very, very different market. So

2638
00:59:18,069 --> 00:59:18,079
right? Very, very different market. So
 

2639
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,390
right? Very, very different market. So
that broadening has started to become

2640
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:20,400
that broadening has started to become
 

2641
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,829
that broadening has started to become
evident and you can really see it in the

2642
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:21,839
evident and you can really see it in the
 

2643
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,829
evident and you can really see it in the
ES. It's the easiest place to see it.

2644
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:23,839
ES. It's the easiest place to see it.
 

2645
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:25,270
ES. It's the easiest place to see it.
Right? So we're finding bid off that

2646
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:25,280
Right? So we're finding bid off that
 

2647
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,309
Right? So we're finding bid off that
gray box like we talked about. big node

2648
00:59:28,309 --> 00:59:28,319
gray box like we talked about. big node
 

2649
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,789
gray box like we talked about. big node
there on that gray box and we've drifted

2650
00:59:30,789 --> 00:59:30,799
there on that gray box and we've drifted
 

2651
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,549
there on that gray box and we've drifted
right the way up to the previous day

2652
00:59:32,549 --> 00:59:32,559
right the way up to the previous day
 

2653
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:34,549
right the way up to the previous day
low. We have a low volume node here. Now

2654
00:59:34,549 --> 00:59:34,559
low. We have a low volume node here. Now
 

2655
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:36,150
low. We have a low volume node here. Now
shorts will need to protect this. All

2656
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:36,160
shorts will need to protect this. All
 

2657
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,829
shorts will need to protect this. All
right, if shorts fail to protect this,

2658
00:59:37,829 --> 00:59:37,839
right, if shorts fail to protect this,
 

2659
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,670
right, if shorts fail to protect this,
this will be a sweep of these levels

2660
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:39,680
this will be a sweep of these levels
 

2661
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,030
this will be a sweep of these levels
here which is why it was low hanging

2662
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:41,040
here which is why it was low hanging
 

2663
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,910
here which is why it was low hanging
fruit and this is possible. Uh and this

2664
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:43,920
fruit and this is possible. Uh and this
 

2665
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,670
fruit and this is possible. Uh and this
will be back into a range for the day

2666
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:45,680
will be back into a range for the day
 

2667
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,390
will be back into a range for the day
and Alex will not be trading in here.

2668
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:48,400
and Alex will not be trading in here.
 

2669
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,069
and Alex will not be trading in here.
All right, Alex will not be trading in

2670
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:50,079
All right, Alex will not be trading in
 

2671
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,670
All right, Alex will not be trading in
here. So there needs to be a

2672
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:51,680
here. So there needs to be a
 

2673
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,190
here. So there needs to be a
continuation short here. You would have

2674
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:53,200
continuation short here. You would have
 

2675
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,270
continuation short here. You would have
to cover into this node here now and

2676
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:55,280
to cover into this node here now and
 

2677
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,030
to cover into this node here now and
then look for a break underneath. If

2678
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:57,040
then look for a break underneath. If
 

2679
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,349
then look for a break underneath. If
they reclaim this, unless you like

2680
00:59:59,349 --> 00:59:59,359
they reclaim this, unless you like
 

2681
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,750
they reclaim this, unless you like
playing rotation, which I don't, you

2682
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:01,760
playing rotation, which I don't, you
 

2683
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,030
playing rotation, which I don't, you
could trade in there, but I won't be

2684
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:03,040
could trade in there, but I won't be
 

2685
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,950
could trade in there, but I won't be
trading that today. Right? So, I'd be

2686
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:04,960
trading that today. Right? So, I'd be
 

2687
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,630
trading that today. Right? So, I'd be
looking for a short somewhere in where

2688
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:06,640
looking for a short somewhere in where
 

2689
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,589
looking for a short somewhere in where
we are now. Somewhere around here,

2690
01:00:09,589 --> 01:00:09,599
we are now. Somewhere around here,
 

2691
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,030
we are now. Somewhere around here,
right? You would want to see buyers get

2692
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:11,040
right? You would want to see buyers get
 

2693
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,789
right? You would want to see buyers get
trapped and then resell that back down

2694
01:00:12,789 --> 01:00:12,799
trapped and then resell that back down
 

2695
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:14,069
trapped and then resell that back down
and covering some here. If we go

2696
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:14,079
and covering some here. If we go
 

2697
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,549
and covering some here. If we go
rotation for me, it will mean no more

2698
01:00:16,549 --> 01:00:16,559
rotation for me, it will mean no more
 

2699
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:21,270
rotation for me, it will mean no more
trades, but that's fine.

2700
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:21,280

 

2701
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,470

What time frame do I use for the

2702
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:22,480
What time frame do I use for the
 

2703
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,910
What time frame do I use for the
Ballinger bands? I only use it on a

2704
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:23,920
Ballinger bands? I only use it on a
 

2705
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,230
Ballinger bands? I only use it on a
daily. I only use it on a daily, right?

2706
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:26,240

guys saying? Am I completely closed out?
 

2761
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,910
guys saying? Am I completely closed out?
Yeah, completely closed out once we hit

2762
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:43,920
Yeah, completely closed out once we hit
 

2763
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,270
Yeah, completely closed out once we hit
this was my target, wasn't it? Once we

2764
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:45,280
this was my target, wasn't it? Once we
 

2765
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,190
this was my target, wasn't it? Once we
hit that, we probably had excess on that

2766
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:47,200
hit that, we probably had excess on that
 

2767
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,470
hit that, we probably had excess on that
low. I didn't even look cuz I was

2768
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:48,480
low. I didn't even look cuz I was
 

2769
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,910
low. I didn't even look cuz I was
already out, but I would imagine there's

2770
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:49,920
already out, but I would imagine there's
 

2771
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,069
already out, but I would imagine there's
selling excess on the low. Yeah. So even

2772
01:01:52,069 --> 01:01:52,079
selling excess on the low. Yeah. So even
 

2773
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:53,670
selling excess on the low. Yeah. So even
on an hourly time frame if we go down to

2774
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:53,680
on an hourly time frame if we go down to
 

2775
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,190
on an hourly time frame if we go down to
like a five minute there will be selling

2776
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:55,200
like a five minute there will be selling
 

2777
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,870
like a five minute there will be selling
on their low there you go. So some

2778
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:56,880
on their low there you go. So some
 

2779
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,510
on their low there you go. So some
excess right now at this low of day

2780
01:01:59,510 --> 01:01:59,520
excess right now at this low of day
 

2781
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,510
excess right now at this low of day
delta at the low of day. So sellers

2782
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:01,520
delta at the low of day. So sellers
 

2783
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,829
delta at the low of day. So sellers
right now are stuck under 25s right that

2784
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:03,839
right now are stuck under 25s right that
 

2785
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:06,150
right now are stuck under 25s right that
is the end of the auction so far we are

2786
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:06,160
is the end of the auction so far we are
 

2787
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,750
is the end of the auction so far we are
coming back up to these key levels we

2788
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:07,760
coming back up to these key levels we
 

2789
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,950
coming back up to these key levels we
just talked about you want to see a

2790
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:08,960
just talked about you want to see a
 

2791
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,950
just talked about you want to see a
rejection there and I would be covering

2792
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:10,960
rejection there and I would be covering
 

2793
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,710
rejection there and I would be covering
some into these levels assuming those

2794
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:12,720
some into these levels assuming those
 

2795
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,309
some into these levels assuming those
sellers stay stuck. If they don't stay

2796
01:02:14,309 --> 01:02:14,319
sellers stay stuck. If they don't stay
 

2797
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:15,670
sellers stay stuck. If they don't stay
stuck you get lucky and you get the

2798
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:15,680
stuck you get lucky and you get the
 

2799
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,670
stuck you get lucky and you get the
continuation. So this, like we talked

2800
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:17,680
continuation. So this, like we talked
 

2801
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,950
continuation. So this, like we talked
about, this shelf here, look at that.

2802
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:18,960
about, this shelf here, look at that.
 

2803
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,710
about, this shelf here, look at that.
46s we just talked about. Somewhere in

2804
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:20,720
46s we just talked about. Somewhere in
 

2805
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,150
46s we just talked about. Somewhere in
there, you'd want sellers to come back

2806
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:22,160
there, you'd want sellers to come back
 

2807
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,990
there, you'd want sellers to come back
in, right? That's what you're seeing

2808
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:24,000
in, right? That's what you're seeing
 

2809
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,430
in, right? That's what you're seeing
right now. So somewhere in here, you'd

2810
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:25,440
right now. So somewhere in here, you'd
 

2811
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,270
right now. So somewhere in here, you'd
want sellers to come back in. And you

2812
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:27,280
want sellers to come back in. And you
 

2813
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,030
want sellers to come back in. And you
would need to respect these levels. All

2814
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:29,040
would need to respect these levels. All
 

2815
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,789
would need to respect these levels. All
right? So if you're short somewhere like

2816
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:30,799
right? So if you're short somewhere like
 

2817
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:32,230
right? So if you're short somewhere like
here, you would need to cover most of it

2818
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:32,240
here, you would need to cover most of it
 

2819
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,670
here, you would need to cover most of it
here. And it's starting to reclaim

2820
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:33,680
here. And it's starting to reclaim
 

2821
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,670
here. And it's starting to reclaim
already and squeeze. So they're already

2822
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:35,680
already and squeeze. So they're already
 

2823
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,829
already and squeeze. So they're already
rebidding over this. There is possibly a

2824
01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:37,839
rebidding over this. There is possibly a
 

2825
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,910
rebidding over this. There is possibly a
short from here to here. We do not know

2826
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:39,920
short from here to here. We do not know
 

2827
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,510
short from here to here. We do not know
if it wants to break down underneath.

2828
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:41,520
if it wants to break down underneath.
 

2829
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,349
if it wants to break down underneath.
You must respect that. Sellers are

2830
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:43,359
You must respect that. Sellers are
 

2831
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:44,870
You must respect that. Sellers are
definitely that is a good auction at the

01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:44,880
definitely that is a good auction at the
 

2833
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,270
definitely that is a good auction at the
lows. That wick here when we look inside

2834
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:47,280
lows. That wick here when we look inside
 

2835
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,589
lows. That wick here when we look inside
the profile right we can see that is a

2836
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:49,599
the profile right we can see that is a
 

2837
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,309
the profile right we can see that is a
good auction 24 and under is all sell

2838
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:52,319
good auction 24 and under is all sell
 

2839
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:54,710
good auction 24 and under is all sell
side that means there is a passive buyer

2840
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:54,720
side that means there is a passive buyer
 

2841
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,150
side that means there is a passive buyer
right down here who was covering and he

2842
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:58,160
right down here who was covering and he
 

2843
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,670
right down here who was covering and he
has now joined this tape to try and get

2844
01:02:59,670 --> 01:02:59,680
has now joined this tape to try and get
 

2845
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:05,190
has now joined this tape to try and get
a continuation so I'd be watching here

2846
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:05,200

 

2847
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,670

I'd be respecting even sellers getting a

2848
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:07,680
I'd be respecting even sellers getting a
 

2849
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,950
I'd be respecting even sellers getting a
little bit caught here if they break

2850
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:08,960
little bit caught here if they break
 

2851
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,030
little bit caught here if they break
under here I'd be respecting this level

2852
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:11,040
under here I'd be respecting this level
 

2853
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,390
under here I'd be respecting this level
and this level I wouldn't be expecting

2854
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:12,400
and this level I wouldn't be expecting
 

2855
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,069
and this level I wouldn't be expecting
it to go lower than that be nice if it

2856
01:03:14,069 --> 01:03:14,079
it to go lower than that be nice if it
 

2857
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:15,670
it to go lower than that be nice if it
would but I wouldn't expect it. Like I

2858
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:15,680
would but I wouldn't expect it. Like I
 

2859
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,990
would but I wouldn't expect it. Like I
said, low hanging fruit's gone, right?

2860
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:18,000
said, low hanging fruit's gone, right?
 

2861
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,670
said, low hanging fruit's gone, right?
The low hanging fruit trade is gone.

2862
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:19,680
The low hanging fruit trade is gone.
 

2863
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,870
The low hanging fruit trade is gone.

We've just got exactly what we wanted.
If we go back inside this rotation, I

2866
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:25,200
If we go back inside this rotation, I
 

2867
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,710
If we go back inside this rotation, I
would, for me personally, I would leave

2868
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:26,720
would, for me personally, I would leave
 

2869
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:33,589
would, for me personally, I would leave
it alone.

2870
01:03:33,589 --> 01:03:33,599

 

2871
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:38,069

So many of you getting this. It's great.

2872
01:03:38,069 --> 01:03:38,079

 

2873
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:39,670

What was my first trigger for the first

2874
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:39,680
What was my first trigger for the first
 

2875
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,589
What was my first trigger for the first
short? I can show you on bookmap. It was

2876
01:03:41,589 --> 01:03:41,599
short? I can show you on bookmap. It was
 

2877
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:45,349
short? I can show you on bookmap. It was
a buyer who got himself caught. Um,

2878
01:03:45,349 --> 01:03:45,359
a buyer who got himself caught. Um,
 

2879
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:47,029
a buyer who got himself caught. Um,
let's get the on map. All right, I got

2880
01:03:47,029 --> 01:03:47,039
let's get the on map. All right, I got
 

2881
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:48,309
let's get the on map. All right, I got
have to go to the start of there. You

2882
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:48,319
have to go to the start of there. You
 

2883
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:49,990
have to go to the start of there. You
might get this now. So guys, if you are

2884
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:50,000
might get this now. So guys, if you are
 

2885
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,750
might get this now. So guys, if you are
short in this now versus the sort of

2886
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:51,760
short in this now versus the sort of
 

2887
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,470
short in this now versus the sort of
250s, like I said, I would be covering a

2888
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:54,480
250s, like I said, I would be covering a
 

2889
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,910
250s, like I said, I would be covering a
little bit into this shelf towards sort

2890
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:55,920
little bit into this shelf towards sort
 

2891
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,270
little bit into this shelf towards sort
of 180s, 170s. Um, we had remind myself

2892
01:03:59,270 --> 01:03:59,280
of 180s, 170s. Um, we had remind myself
 

2893
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,109
of 180s, 170s. Um, we had remind myself
where those sellers are stuck. Uh,

2894
01:04:01,109 --> 01:04:01,119
where those sellers are stuck. Uh,
 

2895
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:04,150
where those sellers are stuck. Uh,
sellers are stuck

2896
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:04,160
sellers are stuck
 

2897
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,990
sellers are stuck
underneath 26s, right? So, you're going

2898
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:06,000
underneath 26s, right? So, you're going
 

2899
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,150
underneath 26s, right? So, you're going
to need continuation underneath 26s. If

2900
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:08,160
to need continuation underneath 26s. If
 

2901
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,510
to need continuation underneath 26s. If
you don't get that, if they start

2902
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:09,520
you don't get that, if they start
 

2903
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,990
you don't get that, if they start
bidding between 60s and 26s, you must

2904
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:12,000
bidding between 60s and 26s, you must
 

2905
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,069
bidding between 60s and 26s, you must
pay yourself a little bit. You must pay

2906
01:04:14,069 --> 01:04:14,079
pay yourself a little bit. You must pay
 

2907
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,069
pay yourself a little bit. You must pay
yourself. So, this shelf, if you are

2908
01:04:16,069 --> 01:04:16,079
yourself. So, this shelf, if you are
 

2909
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,789
yourself. So, this shelf, if you are
short in this shelf, right on these

2910
01:04:18,789 --> 01:04:18,799
short in this shelf, right on these
 

2911
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:21,510
short in this shelf, right on these
wicks, I would be taking some TP here

2912
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:21,520
wicks, I would be taking some TP here
 

2913
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,750
wicks, I would be taking some TP here
and hoping you can get lower, but not

2914
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:23,760
and hoping you can get lower, but not
 

2915
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,270

2925
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:35,990

here. My trigger for that short was this

2926
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:36,000
here. My trigger for that short was this
 

2927
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,589
here. My trigger for that short was this
player who got caught. I've got to come

2928
01:04:37,589 --> 01:04:37,599
player who got caught. I've got to come
 

2929
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:39,589
player who got caught. I've got to come
right back to what time was that? Like

2930
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:39,599
right back to what time was that? Like
 

2931
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:53,430
right back to what time was that? Like
right at the start of the day.

2932
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:53,440

 

2933
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,150

There he is.

2934
01:04:58,150 --> 01:04:58,160

 

2935
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,630

This guy. See this guy here? All right.

2936
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:00,640
This guy. See this guy here? All right.
 

2937
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,630
This guy. See this guy here? All right.
There was a big bid here. See this guy?

2938
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:02,640
There was a big bid here. See this guy?
 

2939
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,870
There was a big bid here. See this guy?
These lots. We sold through it with a

2940
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:04,880
These lots. We sold through it with a
 

2941
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,390
These lots. We sold through it with a
719 lot and I waited to see if there was

2942
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:08,400
719 lot and I waited to see if there was
 

2943
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,789
719 lot and I waited to see if there was
a reaction to go upside and there was no

2944
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:10,799
a reaction to go upside and there was no
 

2945
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:12,470
a reaction to go upside and there was no
reaction. Right? There was literally

2946
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:12,480
reaction. Right? There was literally
 

2947
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,230
reaction. Right? There was literally
nothing. So I was like right well I'm

2948
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:14,240
nothing. So I was like right well I'm
 

2949
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,470
nothing. So I was like right well I'm
joining short risking that and if we

2950
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:16,480
joining short risking that and if we
 

2951
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,390
joining short risking that and if we
can't get back above it then I know I'm

2952
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:18,400
can't get back above it then I know I'm
 

2953
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,230
can't get back above it then I know I'm
going to be comfortably placed because

2954
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:20,240
going to be comfortably placed because
 

2955
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,549
going to be comfortably placed because
I've got a 719 lot seller who I'm going

2956
01:05:22,549 --> 01:05:22,559
I've got a 719 lot seller who I'm going
 

2957
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,470
I've got a 719 lot seller who I'm going
to assume is going to reload there. So

2958
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:24,480
to assume is going to reload there. So
 

2959
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,990
to assume is going to reload there. So
there's the drift down. We didn't quite

2960
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:26,000
there's the drift down. We didn't quite
 

2961
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,150
there's the drift down. We didn't quite
quite miss uh get to our first target.

2962
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:28,160
quite miss uh get to our first target.
 

2963
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,150
quite miss uh get to our first target.
You can see we came back up to this same

2964
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:30,160
You can see we came back up to this same
 

2965
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,150
You can see we came back up to this same
level and they tried to sell it twice

2966
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:32,160
level and they tried to sell it twice
 

2967
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,230
level and they tried to sell it twice
against that 300 level which is what we

2968
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:34,240
against that 300 level which is what we
 

2969
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,230
against that 300 level which is what we
talked about. Once they lifted through I

2970
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:36,240
talked about. Once they lifted through I
 

2971
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,309
talked about. Once they lifted through I
covered uh my runner where I was hoping

2972
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:38,319
covered uh my runner where I was hoping
 

2973
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:40,710
covered uh my runner where I was hoping
to get lower. So we got down we got from

2974
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:40,720
to get lower. So we got down we got from
 

2975
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,309
to get lower. So we got down we got from
300 to 37. So we got we got six 50 60

2976
01:05:44,309 --> 01:05:44,319
300 to 37. So we got we got six 50 60
 

2977
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:45,829
300 to 37. So we got we got six 50 60
points here. Once they went through that

2978
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:45,839
points here. Once they went through that
 

2979
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:48,309
points here. Once they went through that
a squeeze happened. So 300 became that

2980
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:48,319
a squeeze happened. So 300 became that
 

2981
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,829
a squeeze happened. So 300 became that
same level. So you can see they dipped

2982
01:05:49,829 --> 01:05:49,839
same level. So you can see they dipped
 

2983
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:52,390
same level. So you can see they dipped
down they held 300. So now I know 300's

2984
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:52,400
down they held 300. So now I know 300's
 

2985
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,750
down they held 300. So now I know 300's
the key level. They tried again. They

2986
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:53,760
the key level. They tried again. They
 

2987
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,309
the key level. They tried again. They
held 300 and then they lifted back up.

2988
01:05:56,309 --> 01:05:56,319
held 300 and then they lifted back up.
 

2989
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,390
held 300 and then they lifted back up.
So we know 300 is the big overunder.

2990
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:58,400
So we know 300 is the big overunder.
 

2991
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,829
So we know 300 is the big overunder.
They came back in again here trying to

2992
01:05:59,829 --> 01:05:59,839
They came back in again here trying to
 

2993
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:01,190
They came back in again here trying to
sell the 300s. You can see the

2994
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:01,200
sell the 300s. You can see the
 

2995
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,430
sell the 300s. You can see the
importance of uh order flow for me

2996
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:03,440
importance of uh order flow for me
 

2997
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,910
importance of uh order flow for me
again. 300s 300s 300s and then they let

2998
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:05,920
again. 300s 300s 300s and then they let
 

2999
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,829
again. 300s 300s 300s and then they let
it go and then we washed back down to

3000
01:06:07,829 --> 01:06:07,839
it go and then we washed back down to
 

3001
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,510
it go and then we washed back down to
the 50s which was the same level as

3002
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:09,520
the 50s which was the same level as
 

3003
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,750
the 50s which was the same level as
before and then this time we broke.

3004
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:11,760
before and then this time we broke.
 

3005
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,230
before and then this time we broke.
Right? So it was the same thesis on both

3006
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:14,240
Right? So it was the same thesis on both
 

3007
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:18,870
Right? So it was the same thesis on both
trades and 300 was the key level.

3008
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:18,880
trades and 300 was the key level.
 

3009
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,789
trades and 300 was the key level.
It was very very obvious. In fact it was

3010
01:06:20,789 --> 01:06:20,799
It was very very obvious. In fact it was
 

3011
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,990
It was very very obvious. In fact it was
so obvious that uh he was on there even

3012
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:24,000
so obvious that uh he was on there even
 

3013
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,910
so obvious that uh he was on there even
before the open. That guy was just

3014
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:25,920
before the open. That guy was just
 

3015
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:39,750
before the open. That guy was just
hanging out there.

3016
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:39,760

 

3017
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:50,630

Okay.

3018
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:50,640

 

3019
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,190

Do I know Kyle Cox? I do not. Who's Kyle

3020
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:53,200
Do I know Kyle Cox? I do not. Who's Kyle
 

3021
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,670
Do I know Kyle Cox? I do not. Who's Kyle
Cox? Carl Cox, maybe you mean? I don't

3022
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:55,680
Cox? Carl Cox, maybe you mean? I don't
 

3023
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,470
Cox? Carl Cox, maybe you mean? I don't
know who Kyle Cox is. Carl Cox. I don't

When you go short like that, requiring

3080
01:08:17,669 --> 01:08:17,679
When you go short like that, requiring
 

3081
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,990
When you go short like that, requiring
very ex quick execution, do you use a

3082
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:20,000
very ex quick execution, do you use a
 

3083
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,309
very ex quick execution, do you use a
stop order to get in? And are there some

3084
01:08:22,309 --> 01:08:22,319
stop order to get in? And are there some
 

3085
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:24,229
stop order to get in? And are there some
parts of your execution that's

3086
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:24,239
parts of your execution that's
 

3087
01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:27,030
parts of your execution that's
semi-automated? Uh, I marketed orders in

3088
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:27,040
semi-automated? Uh, I marketed orders in
 

3089
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,630
semi-automated? Uh, I marketed orders in
that one because I was scared I was not

3090
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:28,640
that one because I was scared I was not
 

3091
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,229
that one because I was scared I was not
going to get filled, but I have an ATM,

3092
01:08:30,229 --> 01:08:30,239
going to get filled, but I have an ATM,
 

3093
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:32,070
going to get filled, but I have an ATM,
right? So, I know on those market

3094
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:32,080
right? So, I know on those market
 

3095
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,349
right? So, I know on those market
orders, even if I hot use a hotkey, I

3096
01:08:35,349 --> 01:08:35,359
orders, even if I hot use a hotkey, I
 

3097
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,829
orders, even if I hot use a hotkey, I
have a max loss automatically goes in

3098
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:37,839
have a max loss automatically goes in
 

3099
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:40,229
have a max loss automatically goes in
and a cover point automatically goes in.

3100
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:40,239
and a cover point automatically goes in.
 

3101
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:43,030
and a cover point automatically goes in.
So, if I mark it ordered here, right, my

3102
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:43,040
So, if I mark it ordered here, right, my
 

3103
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,030
So, if I mark it ordered here, right, my
max loss is probably up here and my

3104
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:45,040
max loss is probably up here and my
 

3105
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,550
max loss is probably up here and my
cover points here. And then I just drag

3106
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:46,560
cover points here. And then I just drag
 

3107
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,229
cover points here. And then I just drag
it to where I want to be. And if I don't

3108
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:48,239
it to where I want to be. And if I don't
 

3109
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:50,390
it to where I want to be. And if I don't
hit it, I just mark it out. I'll close

3110
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:50,400
hit it, I just mark it out. I'll close
 

3111
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,030
hit it, I just mark it out. I'll close
all. That's one of the advantages of

3112
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:53,040
all. That's one of the advantages of
 

3113
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,550
all. That's one of the advantages of
using Ninja Trader. You still look good.

3114
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:54,560
using Ninja Trader. You still look good.
 

3115
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,390
using Ninja Trader. You still look good.
This short looks good, guys. This short

3116
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:56,400
This short looks good, guys. This short
 

3117
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,910
This short looks good, guys. This short
still looks good. You can see, let's

3118
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:57,920
still looks good. You can see, let's
 

3119
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,910
still looks good. You can see, let's
have a look on here. Have we trapped

3120
01:08:59,910 --> 01:08:59,920
have a look on here. Have we trapped
 

3121
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,829
have a look on here. Have we trapped
buyers? Yes. So, buyers are currently

3122
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:01,839
buyers? Yes. So, buyers are currently
 

3123
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:04,470
buyers? Yes. So, buyers are currently
caught over 240s. All right. You need to

3124
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:04,480
caught over 240s. All right. You need to
 

3125
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,749
caught over 240s. All right. You need to
see follow through under this. This is

3126
01:09:05,749 --> 01:09:05,759
see follow through under this. This is
 

3127
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:07,669
see follow through under this. This is
where these buyers joined in. All right.

3128
01:09:07,669 --> 01:09:07,679
where these buyers joined in. All right.
 

3129
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,189
where these buyers joined in. All right.
So, I'd be covering a little piece into

3130
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:09,199
So, I'd be covering a little piece into
 

3131
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:11,030
So, I'd be covering a little piece into
this. If you break that, we're looking

3132
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:11,040
this. If you break that, we're looking
 

3133
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,950
this. If you break that, we're looking
for 25s and if you break that new low of

3134
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:12,960
for 25s and if you break that new low of
 

3135
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,030
for 25s and if you break that new low of
day, but the rotation is taking place

3136
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:15,040
day, but the rotation is taking place
 

3137
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,110
day, but the rotation is taking place
here between these buyers and these

3138
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:17,120
here between these buyers and these
 

3139
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,510
here between these buyers and these
buyers here. So far, it looks all right.

3140
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:19,520
buyers here. So far, it looks all right.
 

3141
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,709
buyers here. So far, it looks all right.
The question is, does it need a second

3142
01:09:20,709 --> 01:09:20,719
The question is, does it need a second
 

3143
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:22,789
The question is, does it need a second
leg higher? But if if you were short in

3144
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:22,799
leg higher? But if if you were short in
 

3145
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:24,709
leg higher? But if if you were short in
this little shelf, it's looking okay.

3146
01:09:24,709 --> 01:09:24,719
this little shelf, it's looking okay.
 

3147
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,229
this little shelf, it's looking okay.
I'd be watching trying to see if you can

3148
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:26,239
I'd be watching trying to see if you can
 

3149
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:28,229
I'd be watching trying to see if you can
get down underneath here. Here you go.

3150
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:28,239
get down underneath here. Here you go.
 

3151
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:29,990
get down underneath here. Here you go.
Starting to accelerate now. Remember,

3152
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:30,000
Starting to accelerate now. Remember,
 

3153
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,789
Starting to accelerate now. Remember,
sellers are caught under 25s. All right?

3154
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:32,799
sellers are caught under 25s. All right?
 

3155
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,590
sellers are caught under 25s. All right?
So, you must be reactive into sort of

3156
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:35,600
So, you must be reactive into sort of
 

3157
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,349
So, you must be reactive into sort of
this node here. Here I'd be covering a

3158
01:09:37,349 --> 01:09:37,359
this node here. Here I'd be covering a
 

3159
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:38,789
this node here. Here I'd be covering a
little piece into sort of where you are

3160
01:09:38,789 --> 01:09:38,799
little piece into sort of where you are
 

3161
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,789
little piece into sort of where you are
now and then looking to see if you can

3162
01:09:40,789 --> 01:09:40,799
now and then looking to see if you can
 

3163
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:42,870
now and then looking to see if you can
get to 25s.

3164
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:42,880
get to 25s.
 

3165
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,870
get to 25s.
If they hold this, they will look for

3166
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:44,880
If they hold this, they will look for
 

3167
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,550
If they hold this, they will look for
that second leg. All right? If they hold

3168
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:46,560
that second leg. All right? If they hold
 

3169
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,110
that second leg. All right? If they hold
this, there's your 50%. Right? So buyers

3170
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:49,120
this, there's your 50%. Right? So buyers
 

3171
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,110
this, there's your 50%. Right? So buyers
are trapped here. If they hold this,

3172
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:51,120
are trapped here. If they hold this,
 

3173
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,950
are trapped here. If they hold this,
they will look for a second leg relief.

3174
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:52,960
they will look for a second leg relief.
 

3175
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,950
they will look for a second leg relief.
So you are short here and you're

3176
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:54,960
So you are short here and you're
 

3177
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,229
So you are short here and you're
covering some here hoping you break 25

3178
01:09:58,229 --> 01:09:58,239
covering some here hoping you break 25
 

3179
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:00,070
covering some here hoping you break 25
for a snap. But there is no guarantee

3180
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:00,080
for a snap. But there is no guarantee
 

3181
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,070
for a snap. But there is no guarantee
that it's going to do it. So you must

3182
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:02,080
that it's going to do it. So you must
 

3183
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,669
that it's going to do it. So you must
pay yourself because you are not the

3184
01:10:03,669 --> 01:10:03,679
pay yourself because you are not the
 

3185
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,990
pay yourself because you are not the
first opportunity for lowhanging fruit.

3186
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:06,000
first opportunity for lowhanging fruit.
 

3187
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,669
first opportunity for lowhanging fruit.
You are trying to now join a

3188
01:10:07,669 --> 01:10:07,679
You are trying to now join a
 

3189
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:10,950
You are trying to now join a
continuation at a very risky area on a

3190
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:10,960
continuation at a very risky area on a
 

3191
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,470
continuation at a very risky area on a
higher time frame. But you do have this

3192
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:12,480
higher time frame. But you do have this
 

3193
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:18,149
higher time frame. But you do have this
to protect you.

3194

3195
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,229

Map's been really stupid today. It's

3196
01:10:20,229 --> 01:10:20,239
Map's been really stupid today. It's
 

3197
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:26,950
Map's been really stupid today. It's
very annoying not keeping up with price.

I know mate CC, I'm absolute buzzing. I
was going to almost wear my shirt today,

01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:31,280
was going to almost wear my shirt today,
 

3203
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,790
was going to almost wear my shirt today,
but I'm sure lots of you are Spurs fans

you you

you you
my top five don't include them. I would

my top five don't include them. I would
 

3235
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:15,270
my top five don't include them. I would
say Lucid Funded Next, uh, Apex probably

3236
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:15,280
say Lucid Funded Next, uh, Apex probably
 

3237
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,669
say Lucid Funded Next, uh, Apex probably
cheapest, but

3238
01:11:17,669 --> 01:11:17,679
cheapest, but
 

3239
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,350
cheapest, but
a little tricky to to manage, but it

3240
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:19,360
a little tricky to to manage, but it
 

3241
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,430
a little tricky to to manage, but it
will keep you teach you good discipline.

3242
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:21,440
will keep you teach you good discipline.
 

3243
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:25,750
will keep you teach you good discipline.
Um, Lucid Funded Next, um, probably the

3244
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:25,760
Um, Lucid Funded Next, um, probably the
 

3245
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,510
Um, Lucid Funded Next, um, probably the
kindest in terms of, uh, being able to

3246
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:29,520
kindest in terms of, uh, being able to
 

3247
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:44,870
kindest in terms of, uh, being able to
pass them and hold positions.

3248
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:44,880

 

3249
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,630

PA looks untradable. I mean, I'd say

3250
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:46,640
PA looks untradable. I mean, I'd say
 

3251
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,830
PA looks untradable. I mean, I'd say
that was pretty tradable. PA, the price

3252
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:49,840
that was pretty tradable. PA, the price
 

3253
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,430
that was pretty tradable. PA, the price
action was pretty good. Look at map.

3254
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:51,440
action was pretty good. Look at map.
 

3255
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,750
action was pretty good. Look at map.
Can't keep up. What are we doing? It's

3256
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:53,760
Can't keep up. What are we doing? It's
 

3257
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,550
Can't keep up. What are we doing? It's
like the auto I clicked something that

3258
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:56,560
like the auto I clicked something that
 

3259
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,510
like the auto I clicked something that
auto follows off.

3260
01:11:59,510 --> 01:11:59,520
auto follows off.
 

3261
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,910
auto follows off.
Right.

3262
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:03,920

 

3263
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,990

They're still rejecting the same level.

3264
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:06,000
They're still rejecting the same level.
 

3265
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,350
They're still rejecting the same level.
It's where those buyers were trapped.

3266
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:07,360
It's where those buyers were trapped.
 

3267
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,030
It's where those buyers were trapped.
Remember, buyers are trapped up here.

3268
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:09,040
Remember, buyers are trapped up here.
 

3269
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,630
Remember, buyers are trapped up here.
You can see they've just got caught

3270
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:10,640
You can see they've just got caught
 

3271
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:11,910
You can see they've just got caught
again. This is where those buyers are

3272
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:11,920
again. This is where those buyers are
 

3273
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,350
again. This is where those buyers are
trapped into 40. 40 to 62 is where those

3274
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:15,360
trapped into 40. 40 to 62 is where those
 

3275
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:18,149
trapped into 40. 40 to 62 is where those
buyers are trapped. Right? 40-62.

3276
01:12:18,149 --> 01:12:18,159
buyers are trapped. Right? 40-62.
 

3277
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:20,470
buyers are trapped. Right? 40-62.
These guys here.

3278
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:20,480
These guys here.
 

3279
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,990
These guys here.
This is all buy side delta. So, there

3280
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:22,000
This is all buy side delta. So, there
 

3281
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,630
This is all buy side delta. So, there
has been a passive seller here. Looking

3282
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:24,640
has been a passive seller here. Looking
 

3283
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,189
has been a passive seller here. Looking
for this move to the 50% pullback. You

3284
01:12:27,189 --> 01:12:27,199
for this move to the 50% pullback. You
 

3285
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:29,270
for this move to the 50% pullback. You
should have taken a partial here in case

3286
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:29,280
should have taken a partial here in case
 

3287
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,350
should have taken a partial here in case
they want to do a second leg. Second leg

3288
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:31,360
they want to do a second leg. Second leg
 

3289
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,870
they want to do a second leg. Second leg
would probably look like this into that

3290
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:32,880
would probably look like this into that
 

3291
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,870
would probably look like this into that
same level.

3292
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:36,880

 

3293
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,310

If we did a measured move, it would

3294
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:38,320
If we did a measured move, it would
 

3295
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,590
If we did a measured move, it would
probably be exactly that. Go from the

3296
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:41,600
probably be exactly that. Go from the
 

3297
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,630
probably be exactly that. Go from the
high to the

3298
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:44,640
high to the
 

3299
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:50,709
high to the
high to the low.

3300
01:12:50,709 --> 01:12:50,719

 

3301
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:51,910

There you go. Measured move would have

3302
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:51,920
There you go. Measured move would have
 

3303
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:57,990
There you go. Measured move would have
been 314s.

3304
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:58,000

 

3305
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,790

the map again. Getting stuck.

3307
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,709

Uh, sorry guys, I'm trying to catch up

3308
01:13:04,709 --> 01:13:04,719
Uh, sorry guys, I'm trying to catch up
 

3309
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:06,790
Uh, sorry guys, I'm trying to catch up
with you.

3310
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:06,800
with you.
 

3311
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,950
with you.
On your PAS, can you talk about what lot

3312
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:08,960
On your PAS, can you talk about what lot
 

3313
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,550
On your PAS, can you talk about what lot
position size you use? It all depends

3314
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:10,560
position size you use? It all depends
 

3315
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,709
position size you use? It all depends
which what I'm trading with. If I'm

which what I'm trading with. If I'm

3329
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,070
something where I'm a set and forget, I
don't mind using minis as long as I'm

3330
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:26,080
don't mind using minis as long as I'm
 

3331
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,070
don't mind using minis as long as I'm
being accurate.

3332
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:28,080
being accurate.
 

3333
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,590
being accurate.

3350
01:13:51,189 --> 01:13:51,199

3351
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,510
joke.
Right. Still rejecting. Look, the 40s up

3352
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:53,520
Right. Still rejecting. Look, the 40s up
 

3353
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,350
Right. Still rejecting. Look, the 40s up
here are still rejecting. The buyers are

3354
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:55,360
here are still rejecting. The buyers are
 

3355
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,350
here are still rejecting. The buyers are
still cooked up here. You can see again

3356
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:57,360
still cooked up here. You can see again
 

3357
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,270
still cooked up here. You can see again
they just got cooked again up there.

3358
01:13:59,270 --> 01:13:59,280
they just got cooked again up there.
 

3359
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,189
they just got cooked again up there.
They're still rejecting. So, you're

3360
01:14:01,189 --> 01:14:01,199
They're still rejecting. So, you're
 

3361
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:02,870
They're still rejecting. So, you're
still good to hold this short right now.

3362
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:02,880
still good to hold this short right now.
 

3363
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,030
still good to hold this short right now.
So, you should have taken one TP. You

3364
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:05,040
So, you should have taken one TP. You
 

3365
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,709
So, you should have taken one TP. You
are just waiting to see now if you can

3366
01:14:06,709 --> 01:14:06,719
are just waiting to see now if you can
 

3367
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:09,830
are just waiting to see now if you can
get into this area down here. So, 75s

3368
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:09,840
get into this area down here. So, 75s
 

3369
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,430
get into this area down here. So, 75s
underneath 75s. You have a little

3370
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:11,440
underneath 75s. You have a little
 

3371
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,669
underneath 75s. You have a little
imbalance down here into into the 50s,

3372
01:14:13,669 --> 01:14:13,679
imbalance down here into into the 50s,
 

3373
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:16,870
imbalance down here into into the 50s,
but the sellers uh are stuck at 25. So,

3374
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:16,880
but the sellers uh are stuck at 25. So,
 

3375
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,070
but the sellers uh are stuck at 25. So,
as long as you've paid yourself

3376
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:18,080
as long as you've paid yourself
 

3377
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,510
as long as you've paid yourself
somewhere into here, then you can sit

3378
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:19,520
somewhere into here, then you can sit
 

3379
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,229
somewhere into here, then you can sit
and hold to see if it's willing to go.

3380
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:22,239
and hold to see if it's willing to go.
 

3381
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:24,149
and hold to see if it's willing to go.
They just are bouncing between these

3382
01:14:24,149 --> 01:14:24,159
They just are bouncing between these
 

3383
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:25,750
They just are bouncing between these
two. Maybe they let these buyers out.

3384
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:25,760
two. Maybe they let these buyers out.
 

3385
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,470
two. Maybe they let these buyers out.

getting very upset that he's obviously

3390
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:33,120
getting very upset that he's obviously
 

3391
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,630
getting very upset that he's obviously
out of position and he needs to push it.

3392
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:34,640
out of position and he needs to push it.
 

3393
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,630
out of position and he needs to push it.
There you go. He's just cleared everyone

3394
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:36,640
There you go. He's just cleared everyone
 

3395
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,910
There you go. He's just cleared everyone
out. Gross.

3396
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:39,920
out. Gross.
 

3397
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,870
out. Gross.
That is gross. ES finding a bid there as

3398
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:42,880
That is gross. ES finding a bid there as
 

3399
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,630
That is gross. ES finding a bid there as
well. Back to its New York open on ES.

3400
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:44,640
well. Back to its New York open on ES.
 

3401
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,709
well. Back to its New York open on ES.
So, relative strength there again. So ES

3402
01:14:46,709 --> 01:14:46,719
So, relative strength there again. So ES
 

3403
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,030
So, relative strength there again. So ES
positive on the day by the way ENQ is

3404
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:49,040
positive on the day by the way ENQ is
 

3405
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,870
positive on the day by the way ENQ is
flat flat 75% down. So that could be a

3406
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:52,880
flat flat 75% down. So that could be a
 

3407
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,149
flat flat 75% down. So that could be a
clear out of the high for the second

3408
01:14:54,149 --> 01:14:54,159
clear out of the high for the second
 

3409
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:55,910
clear out of the high for the second
leg. Remember the measured move would be

3410
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:55,920
leg. Remember the measured move would be
 

3411
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,189
leg. Remember the measured move would be
into 14 somewhere up here. That' be the

3412
01:14:59,189 --> 01:14:59,199
into 14 somewhere up here. That' be the
 

3413
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:02,310
into 14 somewhere up here. That' be the
measured move. But you are now inside

3414
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:02,320
measured move. But you are now inside
 

3415
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,390
measured move. But you are now inside
this means you're starting to see a

3416
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:04,400
this means you're starting to see a
 

3417
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,630
this means you're starting to see a
failed breakdown. I really wouldn't be

3418
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:06,640
failed breakdown. I really wouldn't be
 

3419
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,070
failed breakdown. I really wouldn't be
surprised to see them [\h__\h] around with

3420
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:08,080
surprised to see them [\h__\h] around with
 

3421
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,750
surprised to see them [\h__\h] around with
this all day and build liquidity all day

3422
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:09,760
this all day and build liquidity all day
 

3423
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,510
this all day and build liquidity all day
now. Now that we've had the low hanging

3424
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:11,520
now. Now that we've had the low hanging
 

3425
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,310
now. Now that we've had the low hanging
fruit, I will not be touching the long

3426
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:14,320
fruit, I will not be touching the long
 

3427
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:24,790
fruit, I will not be touching the long
here. There's just no way

3428
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:24,800

 

3429
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:29,110

why Topep is dist distrusted. Um well

3430
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:29,120
why Topep is dist distrusted. Um well
 

3431
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:32,790
why Topep is dist distrusted. Um well
okay here's why they used to use uh data

3432
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:32,800
okay here's why they used to use uh data
 

3433
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,750
okay here's why they used to use uh data
from or like platforms other platforms

3434
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:35,760
from or like platforms other platforms
 

3435
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,510
from or like platforms other platforms
used to be able to use other platforms.

3436
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:37,520
used to be able to use other platforms.
 

3437
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,430
used to be able to use other platforms.
Then what happened is Michael Pek got

3438
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:39,440
Then what happened is Michael Pek got
 

3439
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,590
Then what happened is Michael Pek got
very greedy and decided he was going to

3440
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:41,600
very greedy and decided he was going to
 

3441
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,590
very greedy and decided he was going to
create his own platform. Okay. and he

3442
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:43,600
create his own platform. Okay. and he
 

3443
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,110
create his own platform. Okay. and he
made that platform cheaper for you to

3444
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:45,120
made that platform cheaper for you to
 

3445
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,950
made that platform cheaper for you to
trade on than the other platforms. So,

3446
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:46,960
trade on than the other platforms. So,
 

3447
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,709
trade on than the other platforms. So,
everyone migrated over to this new

3448
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:48,719
everyone migrated over to this new
 

3449
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:51,030
everyone migrated over to this new
platform. Is that new platform good? No.

3450
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:51,040
platform. Is that new platform good? No.
 

3451
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,950
platform. Is that new platform good? No.
Can you use third party apps? No. Is

3452
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:52,960
Can you use third party apps? No. Is
 

3453
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,350
Can you use third party apps? No. Is
VWAP accurate? No. Are EMAs accurate?

3454
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:55,360
VWAP accurate? No. Are EMAs accurate?
 

3455
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,669
VWAP accurate? No. Are EMAs accurate?
No. Is any of it ever good? No. Have

3456
01:15:57,669 --> 01:15:57,679
No. Is any of it ever good? No. Have
 

3457
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:00,470
No. Is any of it ever good? No. Have
they ever fixed any of it? No. Okay. So,

3458
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:00,480
they ever fixed any of it? No. Okay. So,
 

3459
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,030
they ever fixed any of it? No. Okay. So,
then what happened? Then they got rid of

3460
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:03,040
then what happened? Then they got rid of
 

3461
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,270
then what happened? Then they got rid of
all the other platforms. So, you could

3462
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:05,280
all the other platforms. So, you could
 

3463
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,189
all the other platforms. So, you could
only trade on his platform which he

3464
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:07,199
only trade on his platform which he
 

3465
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:09,350
only trade on his platform which he
would make money from no matter what.

3466
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:09,360
would make money from no matter what.
 

3467
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,110
would make money from no matter what.
Okay. And then what happened then? That

3468
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:11,120
Okay. And then what happened then? That
 

3469
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,750
Okay. And then what happened then? That
platform? Well, it kept [\h__\h] up and

3470
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:13,760
platform? Well, it kept [\h__\h] up and
 

3471
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,910
platform? Well, it kept [\h__\h] up and
going down. So then all these traders

3472
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:15,920
going down. So then all these traders
 

3473
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,310
going down. So then all these traders
who had migrated over, been forced to

3474
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:18,320
who had migrated over, been forced to
 

3475
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,070
who had migrated over, been forced to
move to that platform. I was not one of

3476
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:20,080
move to that platform. I was not one of
 

3477
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,750
move to that platform. I was not one of
them because I refused to play [\h__\h]

3478
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:21,760
them because I refused to play [\h__\h]
 

3479
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,990
them because I refused to play [\h__\h]
games. Then would get stuck in trades.

3480
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:24,000
games. Then would get stuck in trades.
 

3481
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,590
games. Then would get stuck in trades.
Then they would lose their money. They

3482
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:25,600
Then they would lose their money. They
 

3483
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,110
Then they would lose their money. They
would lose accounts. They would be up

3484
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:27,120
would lose accounts. They would be up
 

3485
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,950
would lose accounts. They would be up
big and not given that money. So what

3486
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:28,960
big and not given that money. So what
 

3487
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,470
big and not given that money. So what
did they do? Oh, you can have a free

3488
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:30,480
did they do? Oh, you can have a free
 

3489
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,950
did they do? Oh, you can have a free
account. That is not okay. That is not

3490
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:32,960
account. That is not okay. That is not
 

3491
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,390
account. That is not okay. That is not
good justification. Did this happen

3492
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:34,400
good justification. Did this happen
 

3493
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,189
good justification. Did this happen
once? No. Twice? No. This happened

3494
01:16:37,189 --> 01:16:37,199
once? No. Twice? No. This happened
 

3495
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,030
once? No. Twice? No. This happened
numerous times. In fact, it happened one

01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:39,040
numerous times. In fact, it happened one
 

3497
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,270
numerous times. In fact, it happened one
week where it pretty much happened every

week where it pretty much happened every
 

3499
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,149
week where it pretty much happened every
single day in a row. What's their

3500
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:44,159
single day in a row. What's their
 

3501
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,310

other people when they are an absolute
joke. And on top of that as well, not

3528
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:15,280
joke. And on top of that as well, not
 

3529
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,950

that I was one of them, but I know lots
 

3531
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,430
that I was one of them, but I know lots
of people who were affiliates for them

3532
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:19,440
of people who were affiliates for them
 

3533
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,110
of people who were affiliates for them
who really helped grow their business

3534
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:21,120
who really helped grow their business
 

3535
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,950
who really helped grow their business
from early on and then they just

3536
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:22,960
from early on and then they just
 

3537
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,350
from early on and then they just
completely cut them loose with like no

3538
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:25,360
completely cut them loose with like no
 

3539
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,950
completely cut them loose with like no
phone call, no explanation, just

3541
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,830
phone call, no explanation, just
completely [\h__\h] them over. So, in

3542
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:29,840
completely [\h__\h] them over. So, in
 

3543
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,830
completely [\h__\h] them over. So, in
terms of morals and ethics, there's the

3544
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:31,840
terms of morals and ethics, there's the
 

3545
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,510
terms of morals and ethics, there's the
drive up towards the 14s that we talked

3546
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:33,520
drive up towards the 14s that we talked
 

3547
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,550
drive up towards the 14s that we talked
about. same gray box in terms of morals

3548
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:36,560
about. same gray box in terms of morals
 

3549
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,550
about. same gray box in terms of morals
and ethics. Well, I'm a big moral and

3550
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:38,560
and ethics. Well, I'm a big moral and
 

3551
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,390
and ethics. Well, I'm a big moral and
ethics guy. And do they have any? They

3552
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:40,400
ethics guy. And do they have any? They
 

3553
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,750
ethics guy. And do they have any? They
do not. All right. So, there's the

3554
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:41,760
do not. All right. So, there's the
 

3555
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,270
do not. All right. So, there's the
measured move, folks. So, that's the

3556
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:43,280
measured move, folks. So, that's the
 

3557
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,430
measured move, folks. So, that's the
second leg. All right. So, they held

3558
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:45,440
second leg. All right. So, they held
 

3559
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,070
second leg. All right. So, they held
this 50%. There's the measured move.

3560
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:48,080
this 50%. There's the measured move.
 

3561
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,430
this 50%. There's the measured move.
This is your now edge here. All right.

3562
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:51,440
This is your now edge here. All right.
 

3563
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,350
This is your now edge here. All right.
And we might very well rotate in here

3564
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:53,360
And we might very well rotate in here
 

3565
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,910
And we might very well rotate in here
for a long time in this session. Very

3566
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:55,920
for a long time in this session. Very
 

3567
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:01,910
for a long time in this session. Very
very well. Can can do that.

3568
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:01,920

 

3569
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,229

uh funded next over lucid. They're both

3570
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:04,239
uh funded next over lucid. They're both
 

3571
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:06,790
uh funded next over lucid. They're both
very very good. I like both of those a

3572
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:06,800
very very good. I like both of those a
 

3573
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:12,870
very very good. I like both of those a
lot.

3574
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:12,880

 

3575
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,149

How delta offset works.

3576
01:18:16,149 --> 01:18:16,159
How delta offset works.
 

3577
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:19,750
How delta offset works.
Uh yes. Well, del delta is difference

3578
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:19,760
Uh yes. Well, del delta is difference
 

3579
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,310
Uh yes. Well, del delta is difference
between the buyers and sellers. When we

3580
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:22,320
between the buyers and sellers. When we
 

3581
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,709
between the buyers and sellers. When we
have big delta,

3582
01:18:24,709 --> 01:18:24,719
have big delta,
 

3583
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:26,229
have big delta,
when we're measuring delta, we're

3584
01:18:26,229 --> 01:18:26,239
when we're measuring delta, we're
 

3585
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:28,470
when we're measuring delta, we're
measuring aggressive participants. That

3586
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:28,480
measuring aggressive participants. That
 

3587
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,550
measuring aggressive participants. That
means that they're market orders, right?

3588
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:30,560
means that they're market orders, right?
 

3589
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,750
means that they're market orders, right?
They're aggressive. They're market

3590
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:31,760
They're aggressive. They're market
 

3591
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,229
They're aggressive. They're market
orders. So, if we have lots of market

3592
01:18:34,229 --> 01:18:34,239
orders. So, if we have lots of market
 

3593
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:36,149
orders. So, if we have lots of market
orders who are sellers, see all this red

3594
01:18:36,149 --> 01:18:36,159
orders who are sellers, see all this red
 

3595
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:38,149
orders who are sellers, see all this red
down here, this big delta down here at

3596
01:18:38,149 --> 01:18:38,159
down here, this big delta down here at
 

3597
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:39,830
down here, this big delta down here at
the bottom. If these are all market

3598
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:39,840
the bottom. If these are all market
 

3599
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,470
the bottom. If these are all market
orders and price is not moving lower and

3600
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:42,480
orders and price is not moving lower and
 

3601
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,149
orders and price is not moving lower and
we're moving higher, what does that

3602
01:18:44,149 --> 01:18:44,159
we're moving higher, what does that
 

3603
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:45,510
we're moving higher, what does that
mean? That means in here there's a

3604
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:45,520
mean? That means in here there's a
 

3605
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,669
mean? That means in here there's a
passive order. A passive order would be

3606
01:18:47,669 --> 01:18:47,679
passive order. A passive order would be
 

3607
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:49,830
passive order. A passive order would be
a limit buyer, which means someone is

3608
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:49,840
a limit buyer, which means someone is
 

3609
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:53,110
a limit buyer, which means someone is
absorbing these market orders and

3610
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:53,120
absorbing these market orders and
 

3611
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,550
absorbing these market orders and
everyone's selling into them. And this

3612
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:54,560
everyone's selling into them. And this
 

3613
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,310
everyone's selling into them. And this
limit buyer is going, "Yes, I'm going to

3614
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:56,320
limit buyer is going, "Yes, I'm going to
 

3615
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,830
limit buyer is going, "Yes, I'm going to
have all of that like a sponge, right?"

3616
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:57,840
have all of that like a sponge, right?"
 

3617
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,149
have all of that like a sponge, right?"
Okay. And as price fails to move lower

3618
01:19:00,149 --> 01:19:00,159
Okay. And as price fails to move lower
 

3619
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:01,510
Okay. And as price fails to move lower
and it starts to move higher, what do

3620
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:01,520
and it starts to move higher, what do
 

3621
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,430
and it starts to move higher, what do
they do? They start to stop out. All

3622
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:03,440
they do? They start to stop out. All
 

3623
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,830
they do? They start to stop out. All
right. And so we get this drive up.

3624
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:05,840
right. And so we get this drive up.
 

3625
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,430
right. And so we get this drive up.
Right. Same as here. We got caught here

3626
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:07,440
Right. Same as here. We got caught here
 

3627
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,030
Right. Same as here. We got caught here
for a while with these market buyers.

3628
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:09,040
for a while with these market buyers.
 

3629
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,390
for a while with these market buyers.
Got caught at the highs. We've now

3630
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:10,400
Got caught at the highs. We've now
 

3631
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,070
Got caught at the highs. We've now
cleared them out. More market buyers

3632
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:12,080
cleared them out. More market buyers
 

3633
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,669
cleared them out. More market buyers
have been caught at the highs. So we

3634
01:19:13,669 --> 01:19:13,679
have been caught at the highs. So we
 

3635
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:15,910
have been caught at the highs. So we
will probably trade between these points

3636
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:15,920
will probably trade between these points
 

3637
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,750
will probably trade between these points
for a little bit, right? While they make

3638
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:17,760
for a little bit, right? While they make
 

3639
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,430
for a little bit, right? While they make
their mind up of what they're doing,

3640
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:19,440
their mind up of what they're doing,
 

3641
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:20,790
their mind up of what they're doing,
right? And you can see that even on a

3642
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:20,800
right? And you can see that even on a
 

3643
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,149
right? And you can see that even on a
lower time frame, you'd be able to see

3644
01:19:22,149 --> 01:19:22,159
lower time frame, you'd be able to see
 

3645
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,229
lower time frame, you'd be able to see
exactly the same things. Come right down

3646
01:19:24,229 --> 01:19:24,239
exactly the same things. Come right down
 

3647
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:26,390
exactly the same things. Come right down
a lower time frame. You can see this

3648
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:26,400
a lower time frame. You can see this
 

3649
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,189
a lower time frame. You can see this
bottom candle is all sellers. All right,

3650
01:19:29,189 --> 01:19:29,199
bottom candle is all sellers. All right,
 

3651
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:31,030
bottom candle is all sellers. All right,
this is all sell side, isn't it? Down

3652
01:19:31,030 --> 01:19:31,040
this is all sell side, isn't it? Down
 

3653
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,189
this is all sell side, isn't it? Down
here, right? Those are all aggressive

3654
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:33,199
here, right? Those are all aggressive
 

3655
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:34,630
here, right? Those are all aggressive
sellers being absorbed. That means

3656
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:34,640
sellers being absorbed. That means
 

3657
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,550
sellers being absorbed. That means
there's someone huge absorbing 481 lots,

3658
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:38,560
there's someone huge absorbing 481 lots,
 

3659
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:41,030
there's someone huge absorbing 481 lots,
right? To move back up, right? Some some

3660
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:41,040
right? To move back up, right? Some some
 

3661
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,430
right? To move back up, right? Some some
limit buyer just sat there like a sponge

3662
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:43,440
limit buyer just sat there like a sponge
 

3663
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,709
limit buyer just sat there like a sponge
absorbing it. And then you get the

3664
01:19:44,709 --> 01:19:44,719
absorbing it. And then you get the
 

3665
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:46,950
absorbing it. And then you get the
shift. We go back to buy side. Why?

3666
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:46,960
shift. We go back to buy side. Why?
 

3667
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,870
shift. We go back to buy side. Why?
Because these guys start stopping out.

3668
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:48,880
Because these guys start stopping out.
 

3669
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,950
Because these guys start stopping out.
All right, that's why. Remember, auction

3670
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:50,960
All right, that's why. Remember, auction
 

3671
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,470
All right, that's why. Remember, auction
can't take place unless there's buyers

3672
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:52,480
can't take place unless there's buyers
 

3673
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,790
can't take place unless there's buyers
and sellers. And you need both

3674
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:54,800
and sellers. And you need both
 

3675
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,470
and sellers. And you need both
aggressive buyers and aggressive sellers

3676
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:56,480
aggressive buyers and aggressive sellers
 

3677
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,070
aggressive buyers and aggressive sellers
for an auction to take place. Like I

3678
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:58,080
for an auction to take place. Like I
 

3679
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,750
for an auction to take place. Like I
talked about yesterday, if you just had

3680
01:19:59,750 --> 01:19:59,760
talked about yesterday, if you just had
 

3681
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,270
talked about yesterday, if you just had
limit orders, if you just have passive

3682
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:01,280
limit orders, if you just have passive
 

3683
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,270
limit orders, if you just have passive
sellers, they will never meet each

3684
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:03,280
sellers, they will never meet each
 

3685
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:04,790
sellers, they will never meet each
other, will they? Because if you're

3686
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:04,800
other, will they? Because if you're
 

3687
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,709
other, will they? Because if you're
willing, I always give that same

3688
01:20:06,709 --> 01:20:06,719
willing, I always give that same
 

3689
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,550
willing, I always give that same
example. If you own a Rolex Daytona and

3690
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:10,560
example. If you own a Rolex Daytona and
 

3691
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,149
example. If you own a Rolex Daytona and
you currently want to sell it for

3692
01:20:12,149 --> 01:20:12,159
you currently want to sell it for
 

3693
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:13,750
you currently want to sell it for
$60,000

3694
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:13,760
$60,000
 

3695
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,149
$60,000
and I want to buy a Rolex Daytona for

3696
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:16,159
and I want to buy a Rolex Daytona for
 

3697
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:19,270
and I want to buy a Rolex Daytona for
$30,000, then we have a $30,000 spread.

3698
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:19,280
$30,000, then we have a $30,000 spread.
 

3699
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:22,790
$30,000, then we have a $30,000 spread.
And until we agree price, no auction is

3700
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:22,800
And until we agree price, no auction is
 

3701
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:30,229
And until we agree price, no auction is
uh is done. No handshake is made.

3702
01:20:30,229 --> 01:20:30,239

 

3703
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:32,630

I purchased, sorry, I can't even talk. I

I've paid for. Unfortunately, I paid for

3710
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:37,920
I've paid for. Unfortunately, I paid for
 

3711
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,350
I've paid for. Unfortunately, I paid for
some that are not worth it. Yours is

But all that happens is you roll over

3742
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:09,120
But all that happens is you roll over
 

3743
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:14,070
But all that happens is you roll over
for the next eight days.

3744
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:14,080

 

3745
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,910

Everyone's like, "Oh, I can't deal with

3746
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:15,920
Everyone's like, "Oh, I can't deal with
 

3747
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,149
Everyone's like, "Oh, I can't deal with
the trailing draw down." It's really not

3748
01:21:18,149 --> 01:21:18,159
the trailing draw down." It's really not
 

3749
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:20,709
the trailing draw down." It's really not
that hard. It is not that hard to deal

3750
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:20,719
that hard. It is not that hard to deal
 

3751
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:22,470
that hard. It is not that hard to deal
with. Like if you're oversizing, you

3752
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:22,480
with. Like if you're oversizing, you
 

3753
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,750
with. Like if you're oversizing, you
won't deal with it. If you're not

3754
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:23,760
won't deal with it. If you're not
 

3755
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,350
won't deal with it. If you're not
disciplined and you don't stop out, you

3756
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:25,360
disciplined and you don't stop out, you
 

3757
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,790
disciplined and you don't stop out, you
won't deal with it. If you're not taking

3758
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:26,800
won't deal with it. If you're not taking
 

3759
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,229
won't deal with it. If you're not taking
the correct setups, you won't deal with

3760
01:21:28,229 --> 01:21:28,239
the correct setups, you won't deal with
 

3761
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:30,950
the correct setups, you won't deal with
it. Means you shouldn't be trading

3762
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:30,960
it. Means you shouldn't be trading
 

3763
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,310
it. Means you shouldn't be trading
anyway. It should teach you some

3764
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:32,320
anyway. It should teach you some
 

3765
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,669
anyway. It should teach you some
discipline to get past it. It's the same

3766
01:21:33,669 --> 01:21:33,679
discipline to get past it. It's the same
 

3767
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:36,070
discipline to get past it. It's the same
if you get TPT pass the account and then

3768
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:36,080
if you get TPT pass the account and then
 

3769
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,350
if you get TPT pass the account and then
you never get paid. It's because you

3770
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:37,360
you never get paid. It's because you
 

3771
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,790
you never get paid. It's because you
don't know how to manage your positions.

3772
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:38,800
don't know how to manage your positions.
 

3773
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:44,149
don't know how to manage your positions.
You're probably oversizing.

3774
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:44,159

 

3775
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:45,830

Gold doing the move. Is it Is it doing

3776
01:21:45,830 --> 01:21:45,840
Gold doing the move. Is it Is it doing
 

3777
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,430
Gold doing the move. Is it Is it doing
what we talked about this morning and

3778
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:47,440
what we talked about this morning and
 

3779
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,030
what we talked about this morning and
the last few days? probably it's

3780
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:49,040
the last few days? probably it's
 

3781
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,110
the last few days? probably it's
probably had that push to sell into.

3782
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:51,120
probably had that push to sell into.
 

3783
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,830
probably had that push to sell into.
There you go. We talked about this,

3784
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:53,840
There you go. We talked about this,
 

3785
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,070
There you go. We talked about this,
didn't we? If it has failed failure to

3786
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:56,080
didn't we? If it has failed failure to
 

3787
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:00,390
didn't we? If it has failed failure to
follow through.

3788
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:00,400

 

3789
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,990

Beautiful.

3790
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:02,000
Beautiful.
 

3791
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,830
Beautiful.
Beautiful failure to follow through. If

3792
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:03,840
Beautiful failure to follow through. If
 

3793
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,870
Beautiful failure to follow through. If
we uh

3794
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:06,880
we uh
 

3795
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,350
we uh
do this even from here. Yeah, look at

3796
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:09,360
do this even from here. Yeah, look at
 

3797
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,189
do this even from here. Yeah, look at
that node we talked about. Look how thin

3798
01:22:11,189 --> 01:22:11,199
that node we talked about. Look how thin
 

3799
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:12,310
that node we talked about. Look how thin
we are about. This is everything we

3800
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:12,320
we are about. This is everything we
 

3801
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,510
we are about. This is everything we
talked about premarket. So, there's

3802
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:13,520
talked about premarket. So, there's
 

3803
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,950
talked about premarket. So, there's
probably a good a good continuation

3804
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:14,960
probably a good a good continuation
 

3805
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,110
probably a good a good continuation
short here, right? So, if you were short

3806
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:17,120
short here, right? So, if you were short
 

3807
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,910
short here, right? So, if you were short
into this block here, I'd be targeting

3808
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:19,920
into this block here, I'd be targeting
 

3809
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:23,110
into this block here, I'd be targeting
here for a TP1, TP2, and if they wanted

3810
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:23,120
here for a TP1, TP2, and if they wanted
 

3811
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,270
here for a TP1, TP2, and if they wanted
to let go, we can think about coming

3812
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:25,280
to let go, we can think about coming
 

3813
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:28,790
to let go, we can think about coming
underneath. Really nice. Very simple.

3814
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:28,800
underneath. Really nice. Very simple.
 

3815
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,189
underneath. Really nice. Very simple.
Don't over complicate it, folks. When

3816
01:22:31,189 --> 01:22:31,199
Don't over complicate it, folks. When
 

3817
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:32,709
Don't over complicate it, folks. When
everyone stops talking about gold, like

3818
01:22:32,709 --> 01:22:32,719
everyone stops talking about gold, like
 

3819
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:34,870
everyone stops talking about gold, like
I will start positioning short side soon

3820
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:34,880
I will start positioning short side soon
 

3821
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,390
I will start positioning short side soon
because everyone's going to like stop

3822
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:36,400
because everyone's going to like stop
 

3823
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,149
because everyone's going to like stop
talking about it. And this this to me

3824
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:38,159
talking about it. And this this to me
 

3825
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:39,510
talking about it. And this this to me
looks like a small cap. And when

3826
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:39,520
looks like a small cap. And when
 

3827
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,510
looks like a small cap. And when
everyone stops talking about it and we

3828
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:41,520
everyone stops talking about it and we
 

3829
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,910
everyone stops talking about it and we
start doing like this and everyone's

3830
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:43,920
start doing like this and everyone's
 

3831
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,430
start doing like this and everyone's
talking about tech again and blah blah

3832
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:45,440
talking about tech again and blah blah
 

3833
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,470
talking about tech again and blah blah
blah blah blah and we get something

3834
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:48,480
blah blah blah and we get something
 

3835
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,430
blah blah blah and we get something
maybe something like this,

3836
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:51,440
maybe something like this,
 

3837
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,270
maybe something like this,
right? And that would take years and we

3838
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:53,280
right? And that would take years and we
 

3839
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,990
right? And that would take years and we
can just sit in that trade. All right,

3840
01:22:55,990 --> 01:22:56,000
can just sit in that trade. All right,
 

3841
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,229
can just sit in that trade. All right,
if we hold this and do this then higher

3842
01:22:58,229 --> 01:22:58,239
if we hold this and do this then higher
 

3843
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:00,310
if we hold this and do this then higher
macro wise at the moment it points to

3844
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:00,320
macro wise at the moment it points to
 

3845
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:01,669
macro wise at the moment it points to
higher prices but we'll see if dollar

3846
01:23:01,669 --> 01:23:01,679
higher prices but we'll see if dollar
 

3847
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:03,590
higher prices but we'll see if dollar
starts going then that all goes off the

3848
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:03,600
starts going then that all goes off the
 

3849
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:07,990
starts going then that all goes off the
table and we get a fantastic sell.

3850
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:08,000
table and we get a fantastic sell.
 

3851
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,189
table and we get a fantastic sell.
Okay, back down into the same block.

3852
01:23:11,189 --> 01:23:11,199
Okay, back down into the same block.
 

3853
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,430
Okay, back down into the same block.
Right, so clear out of the 340s up

3854
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:13,440
Right, so clear out of the 340s up
 

3855
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,270
Right, so clear out of the 340s up
towards the 300, the measured move back

3856
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:15,280
towards the 300, the measured move back
 

3857
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,990
towards the 300, the measured move back
into the same area of liquidity. And

3858
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:18,000
into the same area of liquidity. And
 

3859
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,990
into the same area of liquidity. And
again, we have trapped sellers down here

3860
01:23:19,990 --> 01:23:20,000
again, we have trapped sellers down here
 

3861
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,510
again, we have trapped sellers down here
still. All right, but we're into the

3862
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:21,520
still. All right, but we're into the
 

3863
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,030
still. All right, but we're into the
edge of this range, 190. You start

3864
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:23,040
edge of this range, 190. You start
 

3865
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,229
edge of this range, 190. You start
letting go of that, there'll be a

3866
01:23:24,229 --> 01:23:24,239
letting go of that, there'll be a
 

3867
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:38,629
letting go of that, there'll be a
rotation further lower.

3868
01:23:38,629 --> 01:23:38,639

 

3869
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,390

Rain says, "I've had an issue weekly. A

3870
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:40,400
Rain says, "I've had an issue weekly. A
 

3871
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,310
Rain says, "I've had an issue weekly. A
lockout after winds for the day and it

3872
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:42,320
lockout after winds for the day and it
 

3873
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,510
lockout after winds for the day and it
just disappears. Happened yesterday with

just disappears. Happened yesterday with
 

3875
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,430
just disappears. Happened yesterday with
tops." Yeah, does not surprise me. I've

3876
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:45,440
tops." Yeah, does not surprise me. I've
 

3877
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:48,310
tops." Yeah, does not surprise me. I've
lost five XFAS during the ex December

3878
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:48,320
lost five XFAS during the ex December
 

3879
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,270
lost five XFAS during the ex December
outage. Was out of their window time by

3880
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:51,280
outage. Was out of their window time by
 

3881
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,950
outage. Was out of their window time by
2 minutes. It was cringe not going for

3882
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:52,960
2 minutes. It was cringe not going for
 

3883
01:23:52,960 --> 01:24:10,870
2 minutes. It was cringe not going for
top step again. There you go.

3884
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:10,880

 

3885
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,629

01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,270

Like I said, you can still get payouts

3894
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:25,280
Like I said, you can still get payouts
 

3895

payouts from them. Um don't don't like
don't listen to me, but just

3906
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:38,080
don't listen to me, but just
 

3907
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,149
don't listen to me, but just

3909
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:44,709
spread your bets, right? Have some firms
not with them is what I would say.

3910
01:24:44,709 --> 01:24:44,719
not with them is what I would say.
 

3911
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,470
not with them is what I would say.
Not much difference between top and

3912
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:46,480
Not much difference between top and
 

3913
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,629
Not much difference between top and
lucid. No, I agree. I think Lucid is a

3914
01:24:48,629 --> 01:24:48,639
lucid. No, I agree. I think Lucid is a
 

3915
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:51,270
lucid. No, I agree. I think Lucid is a
better package now um than Top Step. But

3916
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:51,280
better package now um than Top Step. But
 

3917
01:24:51,280 --> 01:25:04,709
better package now um than Top Step. But
look, it's each to their own

3918
01:25:04,709 --> 01:25:04,719

 

3919
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:07,189

Padilla. Um they're good for swings.

3920
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:07,199
Padilla. Um they're good for swings.
 

3921
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:08,790
Padilla. Um they're good for swings.
Here you go. So coming back down to this

3922
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:08,800
Here you go. So coming back down to this
 

3923
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,310
Here you go. So coming back down to this
level. All right. So this is everything

3924
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:10,320
level. All right. So this is everything
 

3925
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,310
level. All right. So this is everything
we just drew out into here. This little

3926
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:12,320
we just drew out into here. This little
 

3927
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,070
we just drew out into here. This little
imbalance, right? So here's the

3928
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:14,080
imbalance, right? So here's the
 

3929
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,390
imbalance, right? So here's the
rotation. So TP1 and then you have to

3930
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:16,400
rotation. So TP1 and then you have to
 

3931
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,149
rotation. So TP1 and then you have to
respect this 26s, right? So we've got an

3932
01:25:18,149 --> 01:25:18,159
respect this 26s, right? So we've got an
 

3933
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:20,470
respect this 26s, right? So we've got an
imbalance down in towards these 55s and

3934
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:20,480
imbalance down in towards these 55s and
 

3935
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,390
imbalance down in towards these 55s and
then we have to respect sort of 26 and

3936
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:22,400
then we have to respect sort of 26 and
 

3937
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,990
then we have to respect sort of 26 and
below. If you get that fade underneath

3938
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:24,000
below. If you get that fade underneath
 

3939
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,070
below. If you get that fade underneath
so all they did was clear out the stops,

3940
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:26,080
so all they did was clear out the stops,
 

3941
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:29,030
so all they did was clear out the stops,
do the second leg, right? One, two, do

3942
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:29,040
do the second leg, right? One, two, do
 

3943
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,350
do the second leg, right? One, two, do
the second leg, break down under here.

3944
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:31,360
the second leg, break down under here.
 

3945
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,110
the second leg, break down under here.
If they break down under this now, we

3946
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:33,120
If they break down under this now, we
 

3947
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,430
If they break down under this now, we
will see a bigger puke. But we must

3948
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:35,440
will see a bigger puke. But we must
 

3949
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:39,189
will see a bigger puke. But we must
respect 50s and 26s.

3950
01:25:39,189 --> 01:25:39,199
respect 50s and 26s.
 

3951
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:40,870
respect 50s and 26s.
So anyone who took that short, it was

3952
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:40,880
So anyone who took that short, it was
 

3953
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,310
So anyone who took that short, it was
good. Just a clear out. And then they

3954
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:42,320
good. Just a clear out. And then they
 

3955
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,149
good. Just a clear out. And then they
reshorted the same level. So they ran

3956
01:25:44,149 --> 01:25:44,159
reshorted the same level. So they ran
 

3957
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:47,030
reshorted the same level. So they ran
the stops, right? Made market buyers,

3958
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:47,040
the stops, right? Made market buyers,
 

3959
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,950
the stops, right? Made market buyers,
stopped everyone out, paired it off, and

3960
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:48,960
stopped everyone out, paired it off, and
 

3961
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,950
stopped everyone out, paired it off, and
then failed that same level. And we're

3962
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:50,960
then failed that same level. And we're
 

3963
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,629
then failed that same level. And we're
coming down to the 50s. The imbalance of

3964
01:25:52,629 --> 01:25:52,639
coming down to the 50s. The imbalance of
 

3965
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:54,070
coming down to the 50s. The imbalance of
the 50s. And remember, the sellers are

3966
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:54,080
the 50s. And remember, the sellers are
 

3967
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,709
the 50s. And remember, the sellers are
stuck at 26s and under 26s. We have

3968
01:25:56,709 --> 01:25:56,719
stuck at 26s and under 26s. We have
 

3969
01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:13,030
stuck at 26s and under 26s. We have
room. We have room.

3970
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:13,040

 

3971
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,830

Is there an indicator for I think you're

3972
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:15,840
Is there an indicator for I think you're
 

3973

Is there an indicator for I think you're
saying for think or swim platform that

will highlight zones where buyers and

3976
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:19,280
will highlight zones where buyers and
 

3977
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,030
will highlight zones where buyers and
sellers are stuck. Not unless it has

3978
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:21,040
sellers are stuck. Not unless it has
 

3979
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:29,189
sellers are stuck. Not unless it has
footprint or something like that.

3980
01:26:29,189 --> 01:26:29,199

 

3981
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:30,870

How much is the course? Depends on which

3982
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:30,880
How much is the course? Depends on which
 

3983
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,030
How much is the course? Depends on which
course, but I think it should be $699.

3984
01:26:33,030 --> 01:26:33,040
course, but I think it should be $699.
 

3985

if you took it took it would have taken
 

4023
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:14,790
if you took it took it would have taken
two attempts. You would have had one

4024
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:14,800
two attempts. You would have had one
 

4025
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:18,070
two attempts. You would have had one
attempt uh

4026

attempt uh
from here to here and then the

4028
01:27:20,229 --> 01:27:20,239
from here to here and then the
 

4029
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:22,950
from here to here and then the
breakdown. Same level and you might get

4030
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:22,960
breakdown. Same level and you might get
 

4031
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,629
breakdown. Same level and you might get
continuation now. So, back in towards

continuation now. So, back in towards
 

4033
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:27,270
continuation now. So, back in towards
these 25s and then break down under

4034
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:27,280
these 25s and then break down under
 

4035
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,990
these 25s and then break down under
there. We can look for 25,000. You can

4045
01:27:58,159 --> 01:28:01,030

Any tricks on Apex draw down? You can be

4046
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:01,040
Any tricks on Apex draw down? You can be
 

4047
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,550
Any tricks on Apex draw down? You can be
in the money but still negative draw

4048
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:02,560
in the money but still negative draw
 

4049
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,470
in the money but still negative draw
down. Trail out stops ATR. Yeah, you

should like trail and size down. Got to
size down. If you size down, the draw

4054
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:09,040
size down. If you size down, the draw
 

4055
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,430
size down. If you size down, the draw
down won't matter too much.

4056
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:11,440
down won't matter too much.
 

4057
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,070
down won't matter too much.
There you go. Let's see if they can get

4058
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:14,080
There you go. Let's see if they can get
 

4059
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,830
There you go. Let's see if they can get
it under these underneath these trap

4060
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:15,840
it under these underneath these trap
 

4061
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:27,510
it under these underneath these trap
participants for you.

4062
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:27,520

 

4063
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,990

Number 25s and under is where they're

4064
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:30,000
Number 25s and under is where they're
 

4065
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:48,070
Number 25s and under is where they're
stuck.

4066
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:48,080

 

4067
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,990

My ninja's just gone funny. I've just

4068
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:50,000
My ninja's just gone funny. I've just
 

4069
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,910
My ninja's just gone funny. I've just
got a

4070
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:51,920
got a
 

4071
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:55,350
got a
candle out of nowhere.

4072
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:55,360
candle out of nowhere.
 

4073
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,189
candle out of nowhere.
So, I'm Let me restart this. That

4074
01:28:57,189 --> 01:28:57,199
So, I'm Let me restart this. That
 

4075
01:28:57,199 --> 01:29:01,590
So, I'm Let me restart this. That
doesn't exist.

4076
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:01,600

 

4077
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:15,510

Let's try that again.

4078
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:15,520

 

4079
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,189

Right into these 25s. Remember, this is

4080
01:29:17,189 --> 01:29:17,199
Right into these 25s. Remember, this is
 

4081
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:18,790
Right into these 25s. Remember, this is
where the sell is stuck. Continuation

4082
01:29:18,790 --> 01:29:18,800
where the sell is stuck. Continuation
 

4083
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,470
where the sell is stuck. Continuation
under here. You'll get a new low of day

4084
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:20,480
under here. You'll get a new low of day
 

4085
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,030
under here. You'll get a new low of day
and you'll be looking for 25,000.

4086
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:23,040
and you'll be looking for 25,000.
 

4087
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,189
and you'll be looking for 25,000.
Uh let me just check. You'll be looking

4088
01:29:25,189 --> 01:29:25,199
Uh let me just check. You'll be looking
 

4089
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:37,270
Uh let me just check. You'll be looking
for 25,000 20 and then 25,000.

4090
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:37,280

 

4091
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,030

So, right into where they where they're

4092
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:39,040
So, right into where they where they're
 

4093
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,189
So, right into where they where they're
stuck, right? 25 25 and under. There's

4094
01:29:41,189 --> 01:29:41,199
stuck, right? 25 25 and under. There's
 

4095
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:43,110
stuck, right? 25 25 and under. There's
the push. So, you can see they're still

4096
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:43,120
the push. So, you can see they're still
 

4097
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,390
the push. So, you can see they're still
stuck there. This is what we talked

4098
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:44,400
stuck there. This is what we talked
 

4099
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,950
stuck there. This is what we talked
about these trapped traders. See that?

4100
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:46,960
about these trapped traders. See that?
 

4101
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,629
about these trapped traders. See that?
That's where they're trapped. So, no

4102
01:29:48,629 --> 01:29:48,639
That's where they're trapped. So, no
 

4103
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:50,070
That's where they're trapped. So, no
acceptance underneath, which is why it's

4104
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:50,080
acceptance underneath, which is why it's
 

4105
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,430
acceptance underneath, which is why it's
saying you have to take some money off

4106
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:51,440
saying you have to take some money off
 

4107
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,430
saying you have to take some money off
into that. They remain stuck. So, they

4108
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:53,440
into that. They remain stuck. So, they
 

4109
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,430
into that. They remain stuck. So, they
covered the first opportunity that they

4110
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:55,440
covered the first opportunity that they
 

4111
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,910
covered the first opportunity that they
had to get out break even. They just

4112
01:29:57,910 --> 01:29:57,920
had to get out break even. They just
 

4113
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:00,870
had to get out break even. They just
took, right? Hopefully that makes sense

4114
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:00,880
took, right? Hopefully that makes sense
 

4115
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:04,070
took, right? Hopefully that makes sense
to you all. Look at that. It seems like

4116
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:04,080
to you all. Look at that. It seems like
 

4117
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,950

4253
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,270
other. We're just The world's full of
cretins. It doesn't matter whether you

4254
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:43,280
cretins. It doesn't matter whether you
 

4255
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,669
cretins. It doesn't matter whether you
wear wear red or blue. It's just most of

4260
01:33:52,550 --> 01:33:52,560

 

4261
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,070

Well, that's my whole thing, Z. That's

4262
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:54,080
Well, that's my whole thing, Z. That's
 

4263
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:55,110
Well, that's my whole thing, Z. That's
what I was just saying about Peter

4264
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:55,120
what I was just saying about Peter
 

4265
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,270
what I was just saying about Peter
Mandelson. That's the whole thing. Like,

4266
01:33:57,270 --> 01:33:57,280
Mandelson. That's the whole thing. Like,
 

4267
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:19,510
Mandelson. That's the whole thing. Like,
suck it.

4268
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:19,520

 

4269
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,149

Oh, look at that pump. All right, so

4270
01:34:22,149 --> 01:34:22,159
Oh, look at that pump. All right, so
 

4271
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:23,910
Oh, look at that pump. All right, so
we've now got more stops down here. Let

4272
01:34:23,910 --> 01:34:23,920
we've now got more stops down here. Let
 

4273
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:26,390
we've now got more stops down here. Let
me just have a look on that last move.

4274
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:26,400
me just have a look on that last move.
 

4275
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,350
me just have a look on that last move.
See who came in there.

4276
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:29,360
See who came in there.
 

4277
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:32,229
See who came in there.
The big aggressive bid. All right, so

4278
01:34:32,229 --> 01:34:32,239
The big aggressive bid. All right, so
 

4279
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:33,830
The big aggressive bid. All right, so
this is how I'm seeing this. These

4280
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:33,840
this is how I'm seeing this. These
 

4281
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,830
this is how I'm seeing this. These
sellers are stuck.

4282
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:35,840
sellers are stuck.
 

4283
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,669
sellers are stuck.
We came into this level where they got

4284
01:34:37,669 --> 01:34:37,679
We came into this level where they got
 

4285
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:40,149
We came into this level where they got
stuck. A little bit more excess here.

4286
01:34:40,149 --> 01:34:40,159
stuck. A little bit more excess here.
 

4287
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:42,149
stuck. A little bit more excess here.
Buyers came back in here. So buyers are

4288
01:34:42,149 --> 01:34:42,159
Buyers came back in here. So buyers are
 

4289
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:43,990
Buyers came back in here. So buyers are
trying to protect this low. Now, that's

4290
01:34:43,990 --> 01:34:44,000
trying to protect this low. Now, that's
 

4291
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,590
trying to protect this low. Now, that's
very obvious, right? We can see it right

4292
01:34:45,590 --> 01:34:45,600
very obvious, right? We can see it right
 

4293
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,270
very obvious, right? We can see it right
here. Buyers are trying to protect that

4294
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:47,280
here. Buyers are trying to protect that
 

4295
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,189
here. Buyers are trying to protect that
low. We come back to the highs. Where

4296
01:34:49,189 --> 01:34:49,199
low. We come back to the highs. Where
 

4297
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:50,790
low. We come back to the highs. Where
are the buyers stuck? Well, where we

4298
01:34:50,790 --> 01:34:50,800
are the buyers stuck? Well, where we
 

4299
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,390
are the buyers stuck? Well, where we
just traded all the way up to? Buyers

4300
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:52,400
just traded all the way up to? Buyers
 

4301
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:55,830
just traded all the way up to? Buyers
got caught up here

4302
01:34:55,830 --> 01:34:55,840
got caught up here
 

4303
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,830
got caught up here
on the excess of that clear out push.

4304
01:34:57,830 --> 01:34:57,840
on the excess of that clear out push.
 

4305
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,870
on the excess of that clear out push.
And they also got put caught

4306
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:00,880
And they also got put caught
 

4307
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,189
And they also got put caught
at 40s, wasn't it? Was it 40s earlier

4308
01:35:03,189 --> 01:35:03,199
at 40s, wasn't it? Was it 40s earlier
 

4309
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:05,270
at 40s, wasn't it? Was it 40s earlier
today? Confusing. I have to go lower

4310
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:05,280
today? Confusing. I have to go lower
 

4311
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:08,390
today? Confusing. I have to go lower
time frame there. Give me a second.

4312
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:08,400
time frame there. Give me a second.
 

4313
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,510
time frame there. Give me a second.
Yes, buyers just got caught here. And

4314
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:11,520
Yes, buyers just got caught here. And
 

4315
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,270
Yes, buyers just got caught here. And
this is now the rotation. This is the

4316
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:13,280
this is now the rotation. This is the
 

4317
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:14,790
this is now the rotation. This is the
same level where we failed at from

4318
01:35:14,790 --> 01:35:14,800
same level where we failed at from
 

4319
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,270
same level where we failed at from
before. So, we're now going to rotate

4320
01:35:17,270 --> 01:35:17,280
before. So, we're now going to rotate
 

4321
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:19,270
before. So, we're now going to rotate
and build out liquidity between here. If

4322
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:19,280
and build out liquidity between here. If
 

4323
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,629
and build out liquidity between here. If
they take control of this, there's a

4324
01:35:20,629 --> 01:35:20,639
they take control of this, there's a
 

4325
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:22,790
they take control of this, there's a
potential squeeze. If we start snapping

4326
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:22,800
potential squeeze. If we start snapping
 

4327
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,790
potential squeeze. If we start snapping
under here, there might be continuation.

4328
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:24,800
under here, there might be continuation.
 

4329
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,390
under here, there might be continuation.
Like, as you can see, you've probably

4330
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:26,400
Like, as you can see, you've probably
 

4331
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:29,189
Like, as you can see, you've probably
noticed I'm done. Uh because I think the

4332
01:35:29,189 --> 01:35:29,199
noticed I'm done. Uh because I think the
 

4333
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:31,030
noticed I'm done. Uh because I think the
trade setups now require a lot more

4334
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:31,040
trade setups now require a lot more
 

4335
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,189
trade setups now require a lot more
liquidity to be built out. You can see

4336
01:35:33,189 --> 01:35:33,199
liquidity to be built out. You can see
 

4337
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:35,430
liquidity to be built out. You can see
we've just gone sideways basically since

4338
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:35,440
we've just gone sideways basically since
 

4339
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,750
we've just gone sideways basically since
those nice moves. There was a good short

4340
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:37,760
those nice moves. There was a good short
 

4341
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,430
those nice moves. There was a good short
like I would say this was a decent short

4342
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:39,440
like I would say this was a decent short
 

4343
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:42,229
like I would say this was a decent short
to here and then knock out the runner

4344
01:35:42,229 --> 01:35:42,239
to here and then knock out the runner
 

4345
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:43,910
to here and then knock out the runner
break even and then that exact same

4346
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:43,920
break even and then that exact same
 

4347
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,750
break even and then that exact same
short after they cleared out into that

4348
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:45,760
short after they cleared out into that
 

4349
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,510
short after they cleared out into that
same level.

4350
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:47,520
same level.
 

4351
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,510
same level.
Nice short down to here into where those

4352
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:49,520
Nice short down to here into where those
 

4353
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,590
Nice short down to here into where those
trapped players are. Probably knocked

4354
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:51,600
trapped players are. Probably knocked
 

4355
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,229
trapped players are. Probably knocked
out break even on that. And now it's

4356
01:35:54,229 --> 01:35:54,239
out break even on that. And now it's
 

4357
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:56,149
out break even on that. And now it's
just waiting. It is just a waiting game.

4358
01:35:56,149 --> 01:35:56,159
just waiting. It is just a waiting game.
 

4359
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:57,910
just waiting. It is just a waiting game.
This will need to be built out one way

4360
01:35:57,910 --> 01:35:57,920
This will need to be built out one way
 

4361
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,110
This will need to be built out one way
or another. Even if they're going to use

4362
01:35:59,110 --> 01:35:59,120
or another. Even if they're going to use
 

4363
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,669
or another. Even if they're going to use
it for either direction, they'll need to

4364
01:36:01,669 --> 01:36:01,679
it for either direction, they'll need to
 

4365
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:03,430
it for either direction, they'll need to
be built out. I will not be playing the

4366
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:03,440
be built out. I will not be playing the
 

4367
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,430
be built out. I will not be playing the
edges in this. It's not what I'm looking

4368
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:05,440
edges in this. It's not what I'm looking
 

4369
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,430
edges in this. It's not what I'm looking
to do personally. Personally, but you

that means 600 of you have not hit the

4376
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:13,440
that means 600 of you have not hit the
 

4377
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:14,870

absolutely your your right. Okay. Back
 

4429
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,030
absolutely your your right. Okay. Back
down towards these trap players. Bias

4430
01:37:09,030 --> 01:37:09,040
down towards these trap players. Bias
 

4431
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:10,390
down towards these trap players. Bias
technically is still lower. It's just

4432
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:10,400
technically is still lower. It's just
 

4433
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,910
technically is still lower. It's just
whether they can break underneath these.

4434
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:11,920
whether they can break underneath these.
 

4435
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:14,550
whether they can break underneath these.
All right. So this same level,

4436
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:14,560
All right. So this same level,
 

4437
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:18,070
All right. So this same level,
this same level that we've talked about

4438
01:37:18,070 --> 01:37:18,080
this same level that we've talked about
 

4439
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:21,030
this same level that we've talked about
where we have these guys trapped. So we

4440
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:21,040
where we have these guys trapped. So we
 

4441
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:23,430
where we have these guys trapped. So we
need continuation. We'll need to like

4442
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:23,440
need continuation. We'll need to like
 

4443
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,830
need continuation. We'll need to like
make these guys be back in the money. We

4444
01:37:25,830 --> 01:37:25,840
make these guys be back in the money. We
 

4445
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,430
make these guys be back in the money. We
will not want to protect this. So if you

4446
01:37:27,430 --> 01:37:27,440
will not want to protect this. So if you
 

4447
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,030
will not want to protect this. So if you
are in this short again I wouldn't blame

4448
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:29,040
are in this short again I wouldn't blame
 

4449
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:31,270
are in this short again I wouldn't blame
you. You need to see this expansion. Be

4450
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:31,280
you. You need to see this expansion. Be
 

4451
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:33,510
you. You need to see this expansion. Be
very careful of this kind of move of

4452
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:33,520
very careful of this kind of move of
 

4453
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,109
very careful of this kind of move of
taking it out and reclaiming just like

4454
01:37:35,109 --> 01:37:35,119
taking it out and reclaiming just like
 

4455
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:37,590
taking it out and reclaiming just like
we did the top side right because we are

4456
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:37,600
we did the top side right because we are
 

4457
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,109
we did the top side right because we are
in range but point control is moving

4458
01:37:39,109 --> 01:37:39,119
in range but point control is moving
 

4459
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:41,830
in range but point control is moving
down. We are starting to reject it. The

4460
01:37:41,830 --> 01:37:41,840
down. We are starting to reject it. The
 

4461
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:47,750
down. We are starting to reject it. The
uh lows basically or 21s is the end of

4462
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:47,760
uh lows basically or 21s is the end of
 

4463
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,510
uh lows basically or 21s is the end of
the current weekly profile on the

4464
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:49,520
the current weekly profile on the
 

4465
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:51,030
the current weekly profile on the
auction. So we look at this the current

4466
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:51,040
auction. So we look at this the current
 

4467
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,189
auction. So we look at this the current
weekly developing

4468
01:37:53,189 --> 01:37:53,199
weekly developing
 

4469
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:55,030
weekly developing
right we are starting to reject our

4470
01:37:55,030 --> 01:37:55,040
right we are starting to reject our
 

4471
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,870
right we are starting to reject our
current day point of control. We have

4472
01:37:56,870 --> 01:37:56,880
current day point of control. We have
 

4473
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,229
current day point of control. We have
not been able to get back up to the

4474
01:37:58,229 --> 01:37:58,239
not been able to get back up to the
 

4475
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:00,870
not been able to get back up to the
previous or the weekly point of control.

4476
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:00,880
previous or the weekly point of control.
 

4477
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,629
previous or the weekly point of control.
Big old B shape here, I would say, with

4478
01:38:02,629 --> 01:38:02,639
Big old B shape here, I would say, with
 

4479
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:04,390
Big old B shape here, I would say, with
some distribution left at the top. If we

4480
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:04,400
some distribution left at the top. If we
 

4481
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,790
some distribution left at the top. If we
move under this expansion down to here,

4482
01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:06,800
move under this expansion down to here,
 

4483
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,149
move under this expansion down to here,
but we want to be careful. Look how thin

4484
01:38:08,149 --> 01:38:08,159
but we want to be careful. Look how thin
 

4485
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:09,910
but we want to be careful. Look how thin
we are here. We want to be very careful

4486
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:09,920
we are here. We want to be very careful
 

4487
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,430
we are here. We want to be very careful
trading at these lows. Very, very

4488
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:11,440
trading at these lows. Very, very
 

4489
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:12,709
trading at these lows. Very, very
careful. Wouldn't be adding a short

4490
01:38:12,709 --> 01:38:12,719
careful. Wouldn't be adding a short
 

4491
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:14,790
careful. Wouldn't be adding a short
position near the lows. I'd be like

4492
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:14,800
position near the lows. I'd be like
 

4493
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,870
position near the lows. I'd be like
short up here, covering the lows, hoping

4494
01:38:16,870 --> 01:38:16,880
short up here, covering the lows, hoping
 

4495
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:20,229
short up here, covering the lows, hoping
we break lower. Not hope likeium, just

4496
01:38:20,229 --> 01:38:20,239
we break lower. Not hope likeium, just
 

4497
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:22,229
we break lower. Not hope likeium, just
positioned for it. Right. Positioned for

4498
01:38:22,229 --> 01:38:22,239
positioned for it. Right. Positioned for
 

4499
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:25,350
positioned for it. Right. Positioned for
it. A little bit different.

4500
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:25,360
it. A little bit different.
 

4501
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:28,229
it. A little bit different.
Any thoughts on BTC? Um, yeah. I mean,

4502
01:38:28,229 --> 01:38:28,239
Any thoughts on BTC? Um, yeah. I mean,
 

4503
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:29,590
Any thoughts on BTC? Um, yeah. I mean,
I've gone over this the last few days,

4504
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:29,600
I've gone over this the last few days,
 

4505
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:34,709
I've gone over this the last few days,
but I will go over it again.

4506
01:38:34,709 --> 01:38:34,719

 

4507
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:37,669

Right. Looking for the undercut and see

4508
01:38:37,669 --> 01:38:37,679
Right. Looking for the undercut and see
 

4509
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:39,189
Right. Looking for the undercut and see
if we do continuation. Right. There's

4510
01:38:39,189 --> 01:38:39,199
if we do continuation. Right. There's
 

4511
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:41,990
if we do continuation. Right. There's
the undercut. I would not be positioned

4512
01:38:41,990 --> 01:38:42,000
the undercut. I would not be positioned
 

4513
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,910
the undercut. I would not be positioned
in much right now. Like I talked about,

4514
01:38:43,910 --> 01:38:43,920
in much right now. Like I talked about,
 

4515
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:47,510
in much right now. Like I talked about,
I think if this is a big big if, but if

4516
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:47,520
I think if this is a big big if, but if
 

4517
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:50,390
I think if this is a big big if, but if
we're going to go risk off, right, you

4518
01:38:50,390 --> 01:38:50,400
we're going to go risk off, right, you
 

4519
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:55,430
we're going to go risk off, right, you
got to understand how BTC works.

4520
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:55,440

 

4521
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:58,550

We go from this low,

4522
01:38:58,550 --> 01:38:58,560
We go from this low,
 

4523
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,310
We go from this low,
this would be over a thousand days to

4524
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:00,320
this would be over a thousand days to
 

4525
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:04,229
this would be over a thousand days to
the high, right?

4526
01:39:04,229 --> 01:39:04,239
the high, right?
 

4527
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:08,790
the high, right?
Over 1,000 days to the high. So 1,066

4528
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:08,800
Over 1,000 days to the high. So 1,066
 

4529
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:12,070
Over 1,000 days to the high. So 1,066
days and we did a move of 706%.

4530
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:12,080
days and we did a move of 706%.
 

4531
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,910
days and we did a move of 706%.
All right, I will show you why I'm

4532
01:39:13,910 --> 01:39:13,920
All right, I will show you why I'm
 

4533
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:17,189
All right, I will show you why I'm
showing you this.

4534
01:39:17,189 --> 01:39:17,199
showing you this.
 

4535
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:18,790
showing you this.
You could argue that this was the low

4536
01:39:18,790 --> 01:39:18,800
You could argue that this was the low
 

4537
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:25,350
You could argue that this was the low
here, but we'll see.

4538
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:25,360

 

4539
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:28,310

over a thousand days. 1,100 and that was

4540
01:39:28,310 --> 01:39:28,320
over a thousand days. 1,100 and that was
 

4541
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,790
over a thousand days. 1,100 and that was
a 2,000% rise. All right, this will be

4542
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:30,800
a 2,000% rise. All right, this will be
 

4543
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,629
a 2,000% rise. All right, this will be
the same every single time. I can keep

4544
01:39:32,629 --> 01:39:32,639
the same every single time. I can keep
 

4545
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:34,870
the same every single time. I can keep
showing you it's going to be over the

4546
01:39:34,870 --> 01:39:34,880
showing you it's going to be over the
 

4547
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,709
showing you it's going to be over the
bull markets are over a,000 days just

4548
01:39:36,709 --> 01:39:36,719
bull markets are over a,000 days just
 

4549
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:39,030
bull markets are over a,000 days just
based on the cycles and the pivot low to

4550
01:39:39,030 --> 01:39:39,040
based on the cycles and the pivot low to
 

4551
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:42,709
based on the cycles and the pivot low to
here, right? 170 days. So, 170 days,

4552
01:39:42,709 --> 01:39:42,719
here, right? 170 days. So, 170 days,
 

4553
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:46,229
here, right? 170 days. So, 170 days,
1,100 days, 1,066

4554
01:39:46,229 --> 01:39:46,239
1,100 days, 1,066
 

4555
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:47,990
1,100 days, 1,066
days. All right, all of them with very,

4556
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:48,000
days. All right, all of them with very,
 

4557
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,750
days. All right, all of them with very,
very big gains. Right, let's look at

4558
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:49,760
very big gains. Right, let's look at
 

4559
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,669
very big gains. Right, let's look at
what the downside looks like once we put

4560
01:39:51,669 --> 01:39:51,679
what the downside looks like once we put
 

4561
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:54,310
what the downside looks like once we put
that in. Right, so here if we're going

4562
01:39:54,310 --> 01:39:54,320
that in. Right, so here if we're going
 

4563
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:59,270
that in. Right, so here if we're going
to do the draw down from this

4564
01:39:59,270 --> 01:39:59,280

 

4565
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:01,109

84%

4566
01:40:01,109 --> 01:40:01,119
84%
 

4567
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:04,550
84%
right and it lasts 300 days. If we do

4568
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:04,560
right and it lasts 300 days. If we do
 

4569
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:09,990
right and it lasts 300 days. If we do
this draw down from here,

4570
01:40:09,990 --> 01:40:10,000

 

4571
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,750

78% and it lasts 300 days. All right, so

4572
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:13,760
78% and it lasts 300 days. All right, so
 

4573
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:15,750
78% and it lasts 300 days. All right, so
guess what I would consider here as

4574
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:15,760
guess what I would consider here as
 

4575
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:17,430
guess what I would consider here as
possible.

4576
01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:17,440
possible.
 

4577
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:20,070
possible.
Right. We're going to look at 70 to 80%

4578
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:20,080
Right. We're going to look at 70 to 80%
 

4579
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:24,550
Right. We're going to look at 70 to 80%
and up to 300 days.

4580
01:40:24,550 --> 01:40:24,560
and up to 300 days.
 

4581
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:27,350
and up to 300 days.
So

4582
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:27,360
So
 

4583
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:31,510
So
somewhere like this is possible. Is that

4584
01:40:31,510 --> 01:40:31,520
somewhere like this is possible. Is that
 

4585
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:36,070
somewhere like this is possible. Is that
enough days? Somewhere like

4586
01:40:36,070 --> 01:40:36,080

 

4587
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:38,149

this is possible. Now that's not to say

4588
01:40:38,149 --> 01:40:38,159
this is possible. Now that's not to say
 

4589
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:41,189
this is possible. Now that's not to say
it has to happen but based on the cycles

4590
01:40:41,189 --> 01:40:41,199
it has to happen but based on the cycles
 

4591
01:40:41,199 --> 01:40:43,430
it has to happen but based on the cycles
right if I just zoom this out right

4592
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:43,440
right if I just zoom this out right
 

4593
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:46,149
right if I just zoom this out right
based on the cycles that is what we get

4594
01:40:46,149 --> 01:40:46,159
based on the cycles that is what we get
 

4595
01:40:46,159 --> 01:40:47,990
based on the cycles that is what we get
right from the from the beginning of

4596
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:48,000
right from the from the beginning of
 

4597
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,470
right from the from the beginning of
time of BTC we get a th00and day bull

4598
01:40:50,470 --> 01:40:50,480
time of BTC we get a th00and day bull
 

4599
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:54,149
time of BTC we get a th00and day bull
market run with huge gains and we get a

4600
01:40:54,149 --> 01:40:54,159
market run with huge gains and we get a
 

4601
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:56,709
market run with huge gains and we get a
70 to 80% pullback we get a th00and day

4602
01:40:56,709 --> 01:40:56,719
70 to 80% pullback we get a th00and day
 

4603
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:59,590
70 to 80% pullback we get a th00and day
bull run 70 to 80% pullback we get a

4604
01:40:59,590 --> 01:40:59,600
bull run 70 to 80% pullback we get a
 

4605
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:02,070
bull run 70 to 80% pullback we get a
th00andday bull run so 70 to 80%

4606
01:41:02,070 --> 01:41:02,080
th00andday bull run so 70 to 80%
 

4607
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,990
th00andday bull run so 70 to 80%
pullback where would that leave you into

4608
01:41:03,990 --> 01:41:04,000
pullback where would that leave you into
 

4609
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,510
pullback where would that leave you into
I know it's going to be break some

4610
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:05,520
I know it's going to be break some
 

4611
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,270
I know it's going to be break some
hearts here and this doesn't have to

4612
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:07,280
hearts here and this doesn't have to
 

4613
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,430
hearts here and this doesn't have to
happen, but it would lead you into

4614
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:09,440
happen, but it would lead you into
 

4615
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:12,550
happen, but it would lead you into
around the 25 to 30,000 mark. All right,

4616
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:12,560
around the 25 to 30,000 mark. All right,
 

4617
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:16,229
around the 25 to 30,000 mark. All right,
which is into this gate here. All right,

4618
01:41:16,229 --> 01:41:16,239
which is into this gate here. All right,
 

4619
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:18,070
which is into this gate here. All right,
so

4620
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:18,080
so
 

4621
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,830
so
could it be that this just undercuts and

4622
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:19,840
could it be that this just undercuts and
 

4623
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,669
could it be that this just undercuts and
reclaims? Yes. Could it just come down

4624
01:41:21,669 --> 01:41:21,679
reclaims? Yes. Could it just come down
 

4625
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:23,830
reclaims? Yes. Could it just come down
to here and find a bid here because we

4626
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:23,840
to here and find a bid here because we
 

4627
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,149
to here and find a bid here because we
know it's a big section? Absolutely, it

4628
01:41:26,149 --> 01:41:26,159
know it's a big section? Absolutely, it
 

4629
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:27,830
know it's a big section? Absolutely, it
could. All right, I'm not saying it

4630
01:41:27,830 --> 01:41:27,840
could. All right, I'm not saying it
 

4631
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:30,629
could. All right, I'm not saying it
can't. Maybe this year is different and

4632
01:41:30,629 --> 01:41:30,639
can't. Maybe this year is different and
 

4633
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:33,030
can't. Maybe this year is different and
they do this and you know, that's that's

4634
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:33,040
they do this and you know, that's that's
 

4635
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,510
they do this and you know, that's that's
what we look at. But I would just be

4636
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:35,520
what we look at. But I would just be
 

4637
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:38,229
what we look at. But I would just be
aware right now all that we're seeing is

4638
01:41:38,229 --> 01:41:38,239
aware right now all that we're seeing is
 

4639
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:40,550
aware right now all that we're seeing is
a snap of liquidity. All right, we're

4640
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:40,560
a snap of liquidity. All right, we're
 

4641
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:43,030
a snap of liquidity. All right, we're
breaking lows. There's a nice quasi and

4642
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:43,040
breaking lows. There's a nice quasi and
 

4643
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:45,109
breaking lows. There's a nice quasi and
even if we looked for a measured move

4644
01:41:45,109 --> 01:41:45,119
even if we looked for a measured move
 

4645
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:47,270
even if we looked for a measured move
from this, let's see how far this would

4646
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:47,280
from this, let's see how far this would
 

4647
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:50,470
from this, let's see how far this would
get us from like leg one. And if we look

4648
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:50,480
get us from like leg one. And if we look
 

4649
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,229
get us from like leg one. And if we look
to leg two, right, then we're going to

4650
01:41:52,229 --> 01:41:52,239
to leg two, right, then we're going to
 

4651
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:54,310
to leg two, right, then we're going to
at least look for 60,000. So I want to

4652
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:54,320
at least look for 60,000. So I want to
 

4653
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:57,669
at least look for 60,000. So I want to
be very careful. I'm considering it. If

4654
01:41:57,669 --> 01:41:57,679
be very careful. I'm considering it. If
 

4655
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:00,149
be very careful. I'm considering it. If
we w if we wick it and we reclaim, I'd

4656
01:42:00,149 --> 01:42:00,159
we w if we wick it and we reclaim, I'd
 

4657
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:02,310
we w if we wick it and we reclaim, I'd
consider it. But I actually think, you

4658
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:02,320
consider it. But I actually think, you
 

4659
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:05,350
consider it. But I actually think, you
know, based on the cycles, we want to be

4660
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:05,360
know, based on the cycles, we want to be
 

4661
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:09,510
know, based on the cycles, we want to be
thinking about a move much, much lower,

4662
01:42:09,510 --> 01:42:09,520
thinking about a move much, much lower,
 

4663
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:10,790
thinking about a move much, much lower,
right? So, I just want to be careful of

4664
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:10,800
right? So, I just want to be careful of
 

4665
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,310
right? So, I just want to be careful of
that. And this probably needs repairing.

4666
01:42:12,310 --> 01:42:12,320
that. And this probably needs repairing.
 

4667
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,910
that. And this probably needs repairing.
Look how thin this is on a squeeze. I

4668
01:42:13,910 --> 01:42:13,920
Look how thin this is on a squeeze. I
 

4669
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:16,149
Look how thin this is on a squeeze. I
don't think it's ever been repaired,

4670
01:42:16,149 --> 01:42:16,159
don't think it's ever been repaired,
 

4671
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:18,470
don't think it's ever been repaired,
right? Very thin this move up here. So,

4672
01:42:18,470 --> 01:42:18,480
right? Very thin this move up here. So,
 

4673
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:20,149
right? Very thin this move up here. So,
maybe somewhere into here. So, that

4674
01:42:20,149 --> 01:42:20,159
maybe somewhere into here. So, that
 

4675
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:22,709
maybe somewhere into here. So, that
would be my thoughts on BTC, right? But

4676
01:42:22,709 --> 01:42:22,719
would be my thoughts on BTC, right? But
 

4677
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:25,109
would be my thoughts on BTC, right? But
obviously, if I'm going to trade BTC, um

4678
01:42:25,109 --> 01:42:25,119
obviously, if I'm going to trade BTC, um
 

4679
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:28,229
obviously, if I'm going to trade BTC, um
I'm looking for huge swing uh positions,

4680
01:42:28,229 --> 01:42:28,239
I'm looking for huge swing uh positions,
 

4681
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:30,310
I'm looking for huge swing uh positions,
as in not necessarily hu huge positions,

4682
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:30,320
as in not necessarily hu huge positions,
 

4683
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:40,709
as in not necessarily hu huge positions,
but long-term swing positions.

4684
01:42:40,709 --> 01:42:40,719

 

4685
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:42,470

XRP, it'll be the same thing. You just

4686
01:42:42,470 --> 01:42:42,480
XRP, it'll be the same thing. You just
 

4687
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:45,030
XRP, it'll be the same thing. You just
need to I mean XRP is like getting

4688
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:45,040
need to I mean XRP is like getting
 

4689
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,470
need to I mean XRP is like getting
absolutely clobbered. It's currently

4690
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:46,480
absolutely clobbered. It's currently
 

4691
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:49,350
absolutely clobbered. It's currently
trading at what 1.5.

4692
01:42:49,350 --> 01:42:49,360
trading at what 1.5.
 

4693
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:52,070
trading at what 1.5.
It's given back like 50% of its gains.

4694
01:42:52,070 --> 01:42:52,080
It's given back like 50% of its gains.
 

4695
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,189
It's given back like 50% of its gains.
It's going to be the same. It's going to

4696
01:42:53,189 --> 01:42:53,199
It's going to be the same. It's going to
 

4697
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:54,629
It's going to be the same. It's going to
be the same kind of story, guys. You're

4698
01:42:54,629 --> 01:42:54,639
be the same kind of story, guys. You're
 

4699
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:57,830
be the same kind of story, guys. You're
you're going to need until uh until we

4700
01:42:57,830 --> 01:42:57,840
you're going to need until uh until we
 

4701
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:02,229
you're going to need until uh until we
catch a bid.

4702
01:43:02,229 --> 01:43:02,239

 

4703
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:05,350

Uh

4704
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:05,360

 

4705
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:07,350

until we catch a bid on the uh whole

4706
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:07,360
until we catch a bid on the uh whole
 

4707
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:17,910
until we catch a bid on the uh whole
market.

4708
01:43:17,910 --> 01:43:17,920

 

4709
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,430

All right. Look how thin we are. Think

4710
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:19,440
All right. Look how thin we are. Think
 

4711
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:20,629
All right. Look how thin we are. Think
about what we talk about all the time.

4712
01:43:20,629 --> 01:43:20,639
about what we talk about all the time.
 

4713
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:23,189
about what we talk about all the time.
Look how thin we are from this breakout,

4714
01:43:23,189 --> 01:43:23,199
Look how thin we are from this breakout,
 

4715
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:24,870
Look how thin we are from this breakout,
right? We're probably going to repric a

4716
01:43:24,870 --> 01:43:24,880
right? We're probably going to repric a
 

4717
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:35,030
right? We're probably going to repric a
decent chunk of that.

4718
01:43:35,030 --> 01:43:35,040

 

4719
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,669

It's interesting.

4720
01:43:37,669 --> 01:43:37,679
It's interesting.
 

4721
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:39,510
It's interesting.
I don't think there'll be enough data

4722
01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:39,520
I don't think there'll be enough data
 

4723
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:41,189
I don't think there'll be enough data
here to do this, but I will give it a

4724
01:43:41,189 --> 01:43:41,199
here to do this, but I will give it a
 

4725
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:43,430
here to do this, but I will give it a
go.

4726
01:43:43,430 --> 01:43:43,440
go.
 

4727
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:47,030
go.
No, not enough data. Right. What about

4728
01:43:47,030 --> 01:43:47,040
No, not enough data. Right. What about
 

4729
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:50,390
No, not enough data. Right. What about
Can you let me draw one on

4730
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:50,400
Can you let me draw one on
 

4731
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:54,390
Can you let me draw one on
Yeah, that is what would worry me.

4732
01:43:54,390 --> 01:43:54,400
Yeah, that is what would worry me.
 

4733
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:57,430
Yeah, that is what would worry me.
Very thin. Very, very, very, very thin.

4734
01:43:57,430 --> 01:43:57,440
Very thin. Very, very, very, very thin.
 

4735
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,189
Very thin. Very, very, very, very thin.
If you're very lucky, you're going to

4736
01:43:59,189 --> 01:43:59,199
If you're very lucky, you're going to
 

4737
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:02,070
If you're very lucky, you're going to
find a bid here.

4738
01:44:02,070 --> 01:44:02,080
find a bid here.
 

4739
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:04,229
find a bid here.
Um, but you can see we've lost this

4740
01:44:04,229 --> 01:44:04,239
Um, but you can see we've lost this
 

4741
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:07,109
Um, but you can see we've lost this
shelf. All right. So, buyers, all buyers

4742
01:44:07,109 --> 01:44:07,119
shelf. All right. So, buyers, all buyers
 

4743
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:09,430
shelf. All right. So, buyers, all buyers
are now caught

4744
01:44:09,430 --> 01:44:09,440
are now caught
 

4745
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:13,430
are now caught
over 180 and certainly over twos.

4746
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:13,440
over 180 and certainly over twos.
 

4747
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,350
over 180 and certainly over twos.
All right. So, we've got buyers stuck.

4748
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:15,360
All right. So, we've got buyers stuck.
 

4749
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,590
All right. So, we've got buyers stuck.
And until we reclaim that, look how thin

4750
01:44:17,590 --> 01:44:17,600
And until we reclaim that, look how thin
 

4751
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:19,510
And until we reclaim that, look how thin
we are. Where's the next level where it

4752
01:44:19,510 --> 01:44:19,520
we are. Where's the next level where it
 

4753
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,430
we are. Where's the next level where it
gets thick? I hate to [\h__\h] say it. I

4754
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:21,440
gets thick? I hate to [\h__\h] say it. I
 

4755
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:22,790
gets thick? I hate to [\h__\h] say it. I
hope it doesn't come down there for you

4756
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:22,800
hope it doesn't come down there for you
 

4757
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:25,669
hope it doesn't come down there for you
lot, but you know, maybe maybe it finds

4758
01:44:25,669 --> 01:44:25,679
lot, but you know, maybe maybe it finds
 

4759
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:27,910
lot, but you know, maybe maybe it finds
a bid here at like a 50% retracement of

4760
01:44:27,910 --> 01:44:27,920
a bid here at like a 50% retracement of
 

4761
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:31,350
a bid here at like a 50% retracement of
this gap, but this is very very thin.

4762
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:31,360
this gap, but this is very very thin.
 

4763
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,830
this gap, but this is very very thin.
Very very thin.

4764
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:33,840
Very very thin.
 

4765
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,830
Very very thin.
All markets move the same way. So, we'll

4766
01:44:35,830 --> 01:44:35,840
All markets move the same way. So, we'll
 

4767
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,750
All markets move the same way. So, we'll
just have to see. Hopefully, they do

4768
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:37,760
just have to see. Hopefully, they do
 

4769
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,750
just have to see. Hopefully, they do
some horrible trap for you. Hopefully,

4770
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:39,760
some horrible trap for you. Hopefully,
 

4771
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:43,350
some horrible trap for you. Hopefully,
you see something like this. But, you

4772
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:43,360
you see something like this. But, you
 

4773
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,910
you see something like this. But, you
know, if BTC does a 70 80% pullback,

4774
01:44:45,910 --> 01:44:45,920
know, if BTC does a 70 80% pullback,
 

4775
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:48,390
know, if BTC does a 70 80% pullback,
then you best believe that's probably

4776
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:48,400
then you best believe that's probably
 

4777
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:57,270
then you best believe that's probably
going to get filled in.

4778
01:44:57,270 --> 01:44:57,280

 

4779
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:58,709

Okay. How we doing for likes? I would

4780
01:44:58,709 --> 01:44:58,719
Okay. How we doing for likes? I would
 

4781
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:01,510
Okay. How we doing for likes? I would
like to do some giveaways.

4782
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:01,520
like to do some giveaways.
 

4783
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:13,109
like to do some giveaways.
Let's get these likes up.

4784
01:45:13,109 --> 01:45:13,119

 

4785
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:14,790

Gold and silver sh have gone over gold

4786
01:45:14,790 --> 01:45:14,800
Gold and silver sh have gone over gold
 

4787
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,790
Gold and silver sh have gone over gold
and silver a few times, buddy. I've g

4788
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:16,800
and silver a few times, buddy. I've g
 

4789
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,470
and silver a few times, buddy. I've g
gone over them a few times. Just just

4790
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:18,480
gone over them a few times. Just just
 

4791
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,550
gone over them a few times. Just just
rewind the show.

4792
01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:20,560
rewind the show.
 

4793
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,550
rewind the show.
Um, gold and silver are doing the fa

4794
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:22,560
Um, gold and silver are doing the fa
 

4795
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,790
Um, gold and silver are doing the fa
failure to follow through kind of move.

4796
01:45:24,790 --> 01:45:24,800
failure to follow through kind of move.
 

4797
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,430
failure to follow through kind of move.
All right, so golden from a swing

4798
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:27,440
All right, so golden from a swing
 

4799
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:29,030
All right, so golden from a swing
position. I'll just do it very quickly

4800
01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:29,040
position. I'll just do it very quickly
 

4801
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,990
position. I'll just do it very quickly
from a swing point of view,

4802
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:32,000
from a swing point of view,
 

4803
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,590
from a swing point of view,
right? You'd be looking for the short

4804
01:45:33,590 --> 01:45:33,600
right? You'd be looking for the short
 

4805
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,510
right? You'd be looking for the short
for the failure to follow through, which

4806
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:35,520
for the failure to follow through, which
 

4807
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:37,430
for the failure to follow through, which
is what you're starting to see today.

4808
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:37,440
is what you're starting to see today.
 

4809
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:39,270
is what you're starting to see today.
It's no different to a small cap. You go

4810
01:45:39,270 --> 01:45:39,280
It's no different to a small cap. You go
 

4811
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:41,590
It's no different to a small cap. You go
from the high to the low, we come into

4812
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:41,600
from the high to the low, we come into
 

4813
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:44,390
from the high to the low, we come into
that golden kind of pocket. All right.

4814
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:44,400
that golden kind of pocket. All right.
 

4815
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:54,310
that golden kind of pocket. All right.
We talked about the volume.

4816
01:45:54,310 --> 01:45:54,320

 

4817
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:57,990

All right. Tapped back into this.

4818
01:45:57,990 --> 01:45:58,000
All right. Tapped back into this.
 

4819
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,310
All right. Tapped back into this.
Right. So, this is where buyers last

4820
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:00,320
Right. So, this is where buyers last
 

4821
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,149
Right. So, this is where buyers last
came in with size. as we tap back in.

4822
01:46:02,149 --> 01:46:02,159
came in with size. as we tap back in.
 

4823
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:04,310
came in with size. as we tap back in.
They just got out break even. You're now

4824
01:46:04,310 --> 01:46:04,320
They just got out break even. You're now
 

4825
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:07,510
They just got out break even. You're now
likely to see a rotation back down. I

4826
01:46:07,510 --> 01:46:07,520
likely to see a rotation back down. I
 

4827
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,390
likely to see a rotation back down. I
mean, if it can't hold a bid over 930,

4828
01:46:10,390 --> 01:46:10,400
mean, if it can't hold a bid over 930,
 

4829
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:11,510
mean, if it can't hold a bid over 930,
then we're probably going to come back

4830
01:46:11,510 --> 01:46:11,520
then we're probably going to come back
 

4831
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:15,270
then we're probably going to come back
into 95 uh 930. Is that right? 930, then

4832
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:15,280
into 95 uh 930. Is that right? 930, then
 

4833
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:16,950
into 95 uh 930. Is that right? 930, then
we're going to come back into 650s. All

4834
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:16,960
we're going to come back into 650s. All
 

4835
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,310
we're going to come back into 650s. All
right. So, if it can't, this is your

4836
01:46:18,310 --> 01:46:18,320
right. So, if it can't, this is your
 

4837
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,310
right. So, if it can't, this is your
failure to follow through. A revisit

4838
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:20,320
failure to follow through. A revisit
 

4839
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:21,910
failure to follow through. A revisit
down here is likely. There's probably a

4840
01:46:21,910 --> 01:46:21,920
down here is likely. There's probably a
 

4841
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,910
down here is likely. There's probably a
short down into here, unless they go for

4842
01:46:23,910 --> 01:46:23,920
short down into here, unless they go for
 

4843
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:26,149
short down into here, unless they go for
a second leg and then do the same thing.

4844
01:46:26,149 --> 01:46:26,159
a second leg and then do the same thing.
 

4845
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:27,430
a second leg and then do the same thing.
All right. And then you have to see if

4846
01:46:27,430 --> 01:46:27,440
All right. And then you have to see if
 

4847
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:28,870
All right. And then you have to see if
they collapse it and sweep all of this

4848
01:46:28,870 --> 01:46:28,880
they collapse it and sweep all of this
 

4849
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:31,510
they collapse it and sweep all of this
out. If they reclaim this, all right, if

4850
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:31,520
out. If they reclaim this, all right, if
 

4851
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:33,669
out. If they reclaim this, all right, if
this, this, this, and this happens, then

4852
01:46:33,669 --> 01:46:33,679
this, this, this, and this happens, then
 

4853
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:36,470
this, this, this, and this happens, then
new highs are possible, right? But right

4854
01:46:36,470 --> 01:46:36,480
new highs are possible, right? But right
 

4855
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:38,629
new highs are possible, right? But right
now, that is a clear failure to follow

4856

to go higher. Why? Right? If any of you

5012
01:50:33,109 --> 01:50:33,119
to go higher. Why? Right? If any of you
 

5013
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:35,189
to go higher. Why? Right? If any of you
follow football in or especially in

5014
01:50:35,189 --> 01:50:35,199
follow football in or especially in
 

5015
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:37,430
follow football in or especially in
Europe, all right, we have what we would

5016
01:50:37,430 --> 01:50:37,440
Europe, all right, we have what we would
 

5017
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:40,790
Europe, all right, we have what we would
have relegations, right? Relegations and

5018
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:40,800
have relegations, right? Relegations and
 

5019
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:43,830
have relegations, right? Relegations and
um promotions. Okay, so we have all

5020
01:50:43,830 --> 01:50:43,840
um promotions. Okay, so we have all
 

5021
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:46,229
um promotions. Okay, so we have all
these different divisions of soccer

5022
01:50:46,229 --> 01:50:46,239
these different divisions of soccer
 

5023
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:47,990
these different divisions of soccer
teams. Hate that I'm calling it soccer,

5024
01:50:47,990 --> 01:50:48,000
teams. Hate that I'm calling it soccer,
 

5025
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,830
teams. Hate that I'm calling it soccer,
but just for you your Americans, all

5026
01:50:49,830 --> 01:50:49,840
but just for you your Americans, all
 

5027
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:51,270
but just for you your Americans, all
these different divisions of soccer

5028
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:51,280
these different divisions of soccer
 

5029
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:56,149
these different divisions of soccer
teams. And if you are a top uh team from

5030
01:50:56,149 --> 01:50:56,159
teams. And if you are a top uh team from
 

5031
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:58,629
teams. And if you are a top uh team from
let's say division two, all right, you

5032
01:50:58,629 --> 01:50:58,639
let's say division two, all right, you
 

5033
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:01,189
let's say division two, all right, you
get promoted into division one. And if

5034
01:51:01,189 --> 01:51:01,199
get promoted into division one. And if
 

5035
01:51:01,199 --> 01:51:03,669
get promoted into division one. And if
you are a lower team for if you're a bad

5036
01:51:03,669 --> 01:51:03,679
you are a lower team for if you're a bad
 

5037
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:06,229
you are a lower team for if you're a bad
performing team in division one, you get

5038
01:51:06,229 --> 01:51:06,239
performing team in division one, you get
 

5039
01:51:06,239 --> 01:51:08,310
performing team in division one, you get
taken out and put into division two.

5040
01:51:08,310 --> 01:51:08,320
taken out and put into division two.
 

5041
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:11,990
taken out and put into division two.
Right? So why am I telling you that?

5042
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:12,000
Right? So why am I telling you that?
 

5043
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,270
Right? So why am I telling you that?
Because the indexes work the same way.

5044
01:51:15,270 --> 01:51:15,280
Because the indexes work the same way.
 

5045
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:18,070
Because the indexes work the same way.
We call it rebalancing. Okay? We call it

5046
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:18,080
We call it rebalancing. Okay? We call it
 

5047
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:21,030
We call it rebalancing. Okay? We call it
rebalancing, which means if there is a

5048
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:21,040
rebalancing, which means if there is a
 

5049
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:24,550
rebalancing, which means if there is a
badly performing stock in the QQQ, which

5050
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:24,560
badly performing stock in the QQQ, which
 

5051
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:26,870
badly performing stock in the QQQ, which
is the NQ, guess what they do? They boot

5052
01:51:26,870 --> 01:51:26,880
is the NQ, guess what they do? They boot
 

5053
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:29,590
is the NQ, guess what they do? They boot
those stocks the [\h__\h] out of there. And

5054
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:29,600
those stocks the [\h__\h] out of there. And
 

5055
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:32,149
those stocks the [\h__\h] out of there. And
what do they do? They replace it with

5056
01:51:32,149 --> 01:51:32,159
what do they do? They replace it with
 

5057
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:34,310
what do they do? They replace it with
wellperforming stocks with stocks which

5058
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:34,320
wellperforming stocks with stocks which
 

5059
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:37,750
wellperforming stocks with stocks which
are doing really really well which means

5060
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:37,760
are doing really really well which means
 

5061
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:40,550
are doing really really well which means
if we think about the QQQ it's a 100

5062
01:51:40,550 --> 01:51:40,560
if we think about the QQQ it's a 100
 

5063
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:42,790
if we think about the QQQ it's a 100
stocks we boot five weak ones out we put

5064
01:51:42,790 --> 01:51:42,800
stocks we boot five weak ones out we put
 

5065
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:44,470
stocks we boot five weak ones out we put
five strong ones in what's it going to

5066
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:44,480
five strong ones in what's it going to
 

5067
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:47,589
five strong ones in what's it going to
do it can only grow all right they are

5068
01:51:47,589 --> 01:51:47,599
do it can only grow all right they are
 

5069
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:50,870
do it can only grow all right they are
fixing it so there is good growth for it

5070
01:51:50,870 --> 01:51:50,880
fixing it so there is good growth for it
 

5071
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:53,270
fixing it so there is good growth for it
when you are looking at individual names

5072
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:53,280
when you are looking at individual names
 

5073
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:55,430
when you are looking at individual names
you don't have that you do not have the

5074
01:51:55,430 --> 01:51:55,440
you don't have that you do not have the
 

5075
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:58,070
you don't have that you do not have the
luxury of it being a bundle which is

5076
01:51:58,070 --> 01:51:58,080
luxury of it being a bundle which is
 

5077
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,229
luxury of it being a bundle which is
positioned to go higher long term term.

5078
01:52:00,229 --> 01:52:00,239
positioned to go higher long term term.
 

5079
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:01,830
positioned to go higher long term term.
Okay. So, understanding the difference

5080
01:52:01,830 --> 01:52:01,840
Okay. So, understanding the difference
 

5081
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,149
Okay. So, understanding the difference
of that is really, really key. Right

5082
01:52:04,149 --> 01:52:04,159
of that is really, really key. Right
 

5083
01:52:04,159 --> 01:52:06,870
of that is really, really key. Right
back towards these 25s. Remember, under

5084
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:06,880
back towards these 25s. Remember, under
 

5085
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:08,629
back towards these 25s. Remember, under
here, there is a chance that they might

5086
01:52:08,629 --> 01:52:08,639
here, there is a chance that they might
 

5087
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:10,390
here, there is a chance that they might
come in sweep mode still. But that keeps

5088
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:10,400
come in sweep mode still. But that keeps
 

5089
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:13,030
come in sweep mode still. But that keeps
getting stuck. I'm very tempted to re

5090
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:13,040
getting stuck. I'm very tempted to re
 

5091
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:15,669
getting stuck. I'm very tempted to re
reopen this.

5092
01:52:15,669 --> 01:52:15,679
reopen this.
 

5093
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:18,070
reopen this.
So, here you go. 25s again. 25s again.

5094
01:52:18,070 --> 01:52:18,080
So, here you go. 25s again. 25s again.
 

5095
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:20,149
So, here you go. 25s again. 25s again.
25s again. And you might get follow

5096
01:52:20,149 --> 01:52:20,159
25s again. And you might get follow
 

5097
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:22,950
25s again. And you might get follow
through if they can get under here for a

5098
01:52:22,950 --> 01:52:22,960
through if they can get under here for a
 

5099
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:25,669
through if they can get under here for a
new low of day. But this is key now. And

5100
01:52:25,669 --> 01:52:25,679
new low of day. But this is key now. And
 

5101
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:27,830
new low of day. But this is key now. And
potentially you're looking for 25,000.

5102
01:52:27,830 --> 01:52:27,840
potentially you're looking for 25,000.
 

5103
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,189
potentially you're looking for 25,000.
So, if you're in this short from up

5104
01:52:29,189 --> 01:52:29,199
So, if you're in this short from up
 

5105
01:52:29,199 --> 01:52:30,790
So, if you're in this short from up
here, you better be paying yourself a

5106
01:52:30,790 --> 01:52:30,800
here, you better be paying yourself a
 

5107
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:32,070
here, you better be paying yourself a
little bit and then look to see if you

5108
01:52:32,070 --> 01:52:32,080
little bit and then look to see if you
 

5109
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:34,629
little bit and then look to see if you
can break low of day and get down. I

5110
01:52:34,629 --> 01:52:34,639
can break low of day and get down. I
 

5111
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:37,589
can break low of day and get down. I
mean, I do have a block here 25,090 down

5112
01:52:37,589 --> 01:52:37,599
mean, I do have a block here 25,090 down
 

5113
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:42,470
mean, I do have a block here 25,090 down
to 25,030 and then 25,000.

5114
01:52:42,470 --> 01:52:42,480
to 25,030 and then 25,000.
 

5115
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:43,990
to 25,030 and then 25,000.
Yes, holding up very well like we talked

5116
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:44,000
Yes, holding up very well like we talked
 

5117
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,550
Yes, holding up very well like we talked
about broadening market. I think you

5118
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:46,560
about broadening market. I think you
 

5119
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:48,709
about broadening market. I think you
might get a lower day sweep here at the

5120
01:52:48,709 --> 01:52:48,719
might get a lower day sweep here at the
 

5121
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:51,030
might get a lower day sweep here at the
very minimum, but we will see. Very,

5122
01:52:51,030 --> 01:52:51,040
very minimum, but we will see. Very,
 

5123
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:52,950
very minimum, but we will see. Very,
very close there or you may miss it by a

5124
01:52:52,950 --> 01:52:52,960
very close there or you may miss it by a
 

5125
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:55,589
very close there or you may miss it by a
couple ticks. We go over to here in

5126
01:52:55,589 --> 01:52:55,599
couple ticks. We go over to here in
 

5127
01:52:55,599 --> 01:52:57,270
couple ticks. We go over to here in
these same levels. These guys, remember

5128
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:57,280
these same levels. These guys, remember
 

5129
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:59,030
these same levels. These guys, remember
these are the guys that are stuck. So

5130
01:52:59,030 --> 01:52:59,040
these are the guys that are stuck. So
 

5131
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,790
these are the guys that are stuck. So
they keep covering. The moment they stop

5132
01:53:00,790 --> 01:53:00,800
they keep covering. The moment they stop
 

5133
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,390
they keep covering. The moment they stop
covering, you will get this lower day

5134
01:53:02,390 --> 01:53:02,400
covering, you will get this lower day
 

5135
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:03,830
covering, you will get this lower day
break. Here it comes, folks. There's

5136
01:53:03,830 --> 01:53:03,840
break. Here it comes, folks. There's
 

5137
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:05,910
break. Here it comes, folks. There's
your lower day break. Congratulations.

5138
01:53:05,910 --> 01:53:05,920
your lower day break. Congratulations.
 

5139
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:07,510
your lower day break. Congratulations.
Pay yourself now and then look to see if

5140
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:07,520
Pay yourself now and then look to see if
 

5141
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:11,430
Pay yourself now and then look to see if
you can get into 25,090.

5142
01:53:11,430 --> 01:53:11,440

 

5143
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:13,589

Oh, just happened there. Let's get that

5144
01:53:13,589 --> 01:53:13,599
Oh, just happened there. Let's get that
 

5145
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:15,270
Oh, just happened there. Let's get that
back, please, for the team. All right,

5146
01:53:15,270 --> 01:53:15,280
back, please, for the team. All right,
 

5147
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:16,950
back, please, for the team. All right,
so you're looking for 90 and then all

5148
01:53:16,950 --> 01:53:16,960
so you're looking for 90 and then all
 

5149
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:18,870
so you're looking for 90 and then all
the way down into 25,000. Here we go,

5150
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:18,880
the way down into 25,000. Here we go,
 

5151
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:20,709
the way down into 25,000. Here we go,
team. Big snap. So we've just built out

5152
01:53:20,709 --> 01:53:20,719
team. Big snap. So we've just built out
 

5153
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:22,550
team. Big snap. So we've just built out
all the liquidity and now we're going to

5154
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:22,560
all the liquidity and now we're going to
 

5155
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:25,270
all the liquidity and now we're going to
use it to drive lower. Right, we're

5156
01:53:25,270 --> 01:53:25,280
use it to drive lower. Right, we're
 

5157
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:27,589
use it to drive lower. Right, we're
going to use this to drive lower now.

5158
01:53:27,589 --> 01:53:27,599
going to use this to drive lower now.
 

5159
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:29,510
going to use this to drive lower now.
So, into 90. I would say this is a bit

5160
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:29,520
So, into 90. I would say this is a bit
 

5161
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:31,350
So, into 90. I would say this is a bit
of a cover point just based on some key

5162
01:53:31,350 --> 01:53:31,360
of a cover point just based on some key
 

5163
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:32,870
of a cover point just based on some key
levels. Let me just check this level on

5164
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:32,880
levels. Let me just check this level on
 

5165
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:36,629
levels. Let me just check this level on
the daily. Uh, next liquidity 25,30.

5166
01:53:36,629 --> 01:53:36,639
the daily. Uh, next liquidity 25,30.
 

5167
01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:39,830
the daily. Uh, next liquidity 25,30.
Going to mark this out for you. 25,030

5168
01:53:39,830 --> 01:53:39,840
Going to mark this out for you. 25,030
 

5169
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:43,270
Going to mark this out for you. 25,030
is what you're looking for.

5170
01:53:43,270 --> 01:53:43,280
is what you're looking for.
 

5171
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,669
is what you're looking for.
This right here. All right. If you can

5172
01:53:45,669 --> 01:53:45,679
This right here. All right. If you can
 

5173
01:53:45,679 --> 01:53:47,510
This right here. All right. If you can
get into that, that's your next TP

5174
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:47,520
get into that, that's your next TP
 

5175
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:50,470
get into that, that's your next TP
point. Do not let it reclaim. Now, if

5176
01:53:50,470 --> 01:53:50,480
point. Do not let it reclaim. Now, if
 

5177
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:51,990
point. Do not let it reclaim. Now, if
you were short from any of these up

5178
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:52,000
you were short from any of these up
 

5179
01:53:52,000 --> 01:54:02,470
you were short from any of these up
here, do not let it reclaim 135s. Okay,

5180
01:54:02,470 --> 01:54:02,480

 

5181
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:04,870

here we go. It's getting very, very

5182
01:54:04,870 --> 01:54:04,880
here we go. It's getting very, very
 

5183
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,870
here we go. It's getting very, very
weak.

5184
01:54:06,870 --> 01:54:06,880
weak.
 

5185
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:08,470
weak.
And as long as you stay heavy versus

5186
01:54:08,470 --> 01:54:08,480
And as long as you stay heavy versus
 

5187
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:11,030
And as long as you stay heavy versus
this gray box now, then we should have a

5188
01:54:11,030 --> 01:54:11,040
this gray box now, then we should have a
 

5189
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:12,870
this gray box now, then we should have a
continuation lower. As long as they

5190
01:54:12,870 --> 01:54:12,880
continuation lower. As long as they
 

5191
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:17,669
continuation lower. As long as they
don't let them out.

5192
01:54:17,669 --> 01:54:17,679

 

5193
01:54:17,679 --> 01:54:19,510

Come on, bookmap. You're making my life

5194
01:54:19,510 --> 01:54:19,520
Come on, bookmap. You're making my life
 

5195
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:48,070
Come on, bookmap. You're making my life
really hard.

5196
01:54:48,070 --> 01:54:48,080

 

5197
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,750

uh fixed volume. It's anchored volume

5198
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:49,760
uh fixed volume. It's anchored volume
 

5199
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,510
uh fixed volume. It's anchored volume
right here. It's anchored volume. Two

5200
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:51,520
right here. It's anchored volume. Two
 

5201
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:55,109
right here. It's anchored volume. Two
ticks per row and I have a width of 20.

5202
01:54:55,109 --> 01:54:55,119
ticks per row and I have a width of 20.
 

5203
01:54:55,119 --> 01:54:56,790
ticks per row and I have a width of 20.
Okay. So, they're still selling into

5204
01:54:56,790 --> 01:54:56,800
Okay. So, they're still selling into
 

5205
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:58,149
Okay. So, they're still selling into
this. We're building out a bit of a

5206
01:54:58,149 --> 01:54:58,159
this. We're building out a bit of a
 

5207
01:54:58,159 --> 01:54:59,669
this. We're building out a bit of a
volume node down here into in towards

5208
01:54:59,669 --> 01:54:59,679
volume node down here into in towards
 

5209
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:01,910
volume node down here into in towards
these 90s, these 86s. There is an

5210
01:55:01,910 --> 01:55:01,920
these 90s, these 86s. There is an
 

5211
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:04,310
these 90s, these 86s. There is an
imbalance here to 91, then another to

5212
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:04,320
imbalance here to 91, then another to
 

5213
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,229
imbalance here to 91, then another to
13, and then another to 19. Remember,

5214
01:55:06,229 --> 01:55:06,239
13, and then another to 19. Remember,
 

5215
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:08,310
13, and then another to 19. Remember,
very thin down. So, we would expect some

5216
01:55:08,310 --> 01:55:08,320
very thin down. So, we would expect some
 

5217
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:09,910
very thin down. So, we would expect some
kind of retracement up and then see if

5218
01:55:09,910 --> 01:55:09,920
kind of retracement up and then see if
 

5219
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:11,589
kind of retracement up and then see if
they resell it. If they don't resell it,

5220
01:55:11,589 --> 01:55:11,599
they resell it. If they don't resell it,
 

5221
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:14,070
they resell it. If they don't resell it,
it will be a failed auction, but I think

5222
01:55:14,070 --> 01:55:14,080
it will be a failed auction, but I think
 

5223
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:15,910
it will be a failed auction, but I think
they will want to resell this. I don't

5224
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:15,920
they will want to resell this. I don't
 

5225
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:17,510
they will want to resell this. I don't
think they're done with it yet. ES

5226
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:17,520
think they're done with it yet. ES
 

5227
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:19,189
think they're done with it yet. ES
coming down to its IB low as well. So,

5228
01:55:19,189 --> 01:55:19,199
coming down to its IB low as well. So,
 

5229
01:55:19,199 --> 01:55:20,550
coming down to its IB low as well. So,
you can watch that. If ES starts getting

5230
01:55:20,550 --> 01:55:20,560
you can watch that. If ES starts getting
 

5231
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:22,070
you can watch that. If ES starts getting
weak, the broader market will get weak

5232
01:55:22,070 --> 01:55:22,080
weak, the broader market will get weak
 

5233
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:23,990
weak, the broader market will get weak
with tech. That will help you, but we're

5234
01:55:23,990 --> 01:55:24,000
with tech. That will help you, but we're
 

5235
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,990
with tech. That will help you, but we're
building out a little node down here. We

5236
01:55:25,990 --> 01:55:26,000
building out a little node down here. We
 

5237
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,669
building out a little node down here. We
might very well want to come up to these

5238
01:55:27,669 --> 01:55:27,679
might very well want to come up to these
 

5239
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:29,830
might very well want to come up to these
180s, but you can stay short as long as

5240
01:55:29,830 --> 01:55:29,840
180s, but you can stay short as long as
 

5241
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:31,669
180s, but you can stay short as long as
you were short obviously above all of

5242
01:55:31,669 --> 01:55:31,679
you were short obviously above all of
 

5243
01:55:31,679 --> 01:55:33,750
you were short obviously above all of
this versus this sort of 130. You won't

5244
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:33,760
this versus this sort of 130. You won't
 

5245
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:37,830
this versus this sort of 130. You won't
want to reclaim. Ideally, they reject uh

5246
01:55:37,830 --> 01:55:37,840
want to reclaim. Ideally, they reject uh
 

5247
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:40,229
want to reclaim. Ideally, they reject uh
somewhere in here and come down into

5248
01:55:40,229 --> 01:55:40,239
somewhere in here and come down into
 

5249
01:55:40,239 --> 01:55:43,109
somewhere in here and come down into
this is what you'd be looking for. Here

5250
01:55:43,109 --> 01:55:43,119
this is what you'd be looking for. Here
 

5251
01:55:43,119 --> 01:55:47,030
this is what you'd be looking for. Here
we go.

5252
01:55:47,030 --> 01:55:47,040

 

5253
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:49,510

Can we get under this?

5254
01:55:49,510 --> 01:55:49,520
Can we get under this?
 

5255
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:50,870
Can we get under this?
Just want to check I'm not missing

5256
01:55:50,870 --> 01:55:50,880
Just want to check I'm not missing
 

5257
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:52,790
Just want to check I'm not missing
anything on an hourly basis. An old

5258
01:55:52,790 --> 01:55:52,800
anything on an hourly basis. An old
 

5259
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:54,950
anything on an hourly basis. An old
hourly wick. Yeah, we're coming into

into right now. Looks really good. So,
 

5267
01:56:04,159 --> 01:56:05,830
into right now. Looks really good. So,
can they get under all of this and get

5268
01:56:05,830 --> 01:56:05,840
can they get under all of this and get
 

5269
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:08,629
can they get under all of this and get
into those 30s for you guys? Looks good.

5270
01:56:08,629 --> 01:56:08,639
into those 30s for you guys? Looks good.
 

5271

into those 30s for you guys? Looks good.
Looks good.

5272
01:56:11,189 --> 01:56:11,199
Looks good.
 

5273
01:56:11,199 --> 01:56:12,790
Looks good.
Right, while you guys wait on that, I'm

5274
01:56:12,790 --> 01:56:12,800
Right, while you guys wait on that, I'm

going to get a little coffee here if
that's all right. I'll be right back.

that's all right. I'll be right back.
 

5279
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:16,870
that's all right. I'll be right back.
How we doing for time? I want to do a

5280
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:16,880
How we doing for time? I want to do a
 

5281
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:18,629
How we doing for time? I want to do a
giveaway as soon as we get get back.

5282
01:56:18,629 --> 01:56:18,639
giveaway as soon as we get get back.
 

5283
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:21,589
giveaway as soon as we get get back.
Right. So, just be uh

5284
01:56:21,589 --> 01:56:21,599
Right. So, just be uh
 

5285
01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:23,189
Right. So, just be uh
be mindful of that. Smash the like

5286
01:56:23,189 --> 01:56:23,199
be mindful of that. Smash the like
 

5287
01:56:23,199 --> 01:56:25,830
be mindful of that. Smash the like
button. Uh look at the VIX. Look at the

5288
01:56:25,830 --> 01:56:25,840
button. Uh look at the VIX. Look at the
 

5289
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:28,149
button. Uh look at the VIX. Look at the
VIX. Right back up into these 19s. So,

5290
01:56:28,149 --> 01:56:28,159
VIX. Right back up into these 19s. So,
 

5291
01:56:28,159 --> 01:56:30,709
VIX. Right back up into these 19s. So,
VIX will be looking for a 1962 break. If

5292
01:56:30,709 --> 01:56:30,719
VIX will be looking for a 1962 break. If
 

5293
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:32,149
VIX will be looking for a 1962 break. If
we get that break on the VIX, we're

5294
01:56:32,149 --> 01:56:32,159
we get that break on the VIX, we're
 

5295
01:56:32,159 --> 01:56:33,750
we get that break on the VIX, we're
going to go back to previous day high.

5296
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:33,760
going to go back to previous day high.
 

5297
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:35,430
going to go back to previous day high.
This looks really good. So, make sure

5298
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:35,440
This looks really good. So, make sure
 

5299
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,030
This looks really good. So, make sure
you're getting ready to cover some into

5300
01:56:37,030 --> 01:56:37,040
you're getting ready to cover some into
 

5301
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:39,430
you're getting ready to cover some into
this green line. If we get to that green

5302
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:39,440
this green line. If we get to that green
 

5303
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:42,310
this green line. If we get to that green
line, you very well might get a really

5304
01:56:42,310 --> 01:56:42,320
line, you very well might get a really
 

5305
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,070
line, you very well might get a really
nasty stop hunt. So, you can put some

5306
01:56:44,070 --> 01:56:44,080
nasty stop hunt. So, you can put some
 

5307
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:46,550
nasty stop hunt. So, you can put some
wish orders out down here because if we

5308
01:56:46,550 --> 01:56:46,560
wish orders out down here because if we
 

5309
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:48,229
wish orders out down here because if we
break that, you might get a stop hunt.

5310
01:56:48,229 --> 01:56:48,239
break that, you might get a stop hunt.
 

5311
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:50,310
break that, you might get a stop hunt.
So, you cover some into this, but you

5312
01:56:50,310 --> 01:56:50,320
So, you cover some into this, but you
 

5313
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:51,990
So, you cover some into this, but you
might want some wish orders down here

5314
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:52,000
might want some wish orders down here
 

5315
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,709
might want some wish orders down here
for this. All right, I'll be right back.

5316
01:56:54,709 --> 01:56:54,719
for this. All right, I'll be right back.
 

5317
01:56:54,719 --> 01:56:56,310
for this. All right, I'll be right back.
This is the kind of black swan day we've

5318
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:56,320
This is the kind of black swan day we've
 

5319
01:56:56,320 --> 01:59:49,510
This is the kind of black swan day we've
talked about.

5320
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:49,520

 

5321
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:51,109

All right. Sorry folks. I had to make a

5322
01:59:51,109 --> 01:59:51,119
All right. Sorry folks. I had to make a
 

5323
01:59:51,119 --> 01:59:52,870
All right. Sorry folks. I had to make a
fresh brew.

5324
01:59:52,870 --> 01:59:52,880
fresh brew.
 

5325
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:54,390
fresh brew.
Okay. You're still building out down

5326
01:59:54,390 --> 01:59:54,400
Okay. You're still building out down
 

5327
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,550
Okay. You're still building out down
here. Nice rejection of the IB low.

5328
01:59:56,550 --> 01:59:56,560
here. Nice rejection of the IB low.
 

5329
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:57,910
here. Nice rejection of the IB low.
There you go. That was what you should

5330
01:59:57,910 --> 01:59:57,920
There you go. That was what you should
 

5331
01:59:57,920 --> 01:59:59,430
There you go. That was what you should
have been looking for. So anywhere from

5332
01:59:59,430 --> 01:59:59,440
have been looking for. So anywhere from
 

5333
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:02,229
have been looking for. So anywhere from
IB low up to value. Remember rejection

5334
02:00:02,229 --> 02:00:02,239
IB low up to value. Remember rejection
 

5335
02:00:02,239 --> 02:00:04,950
IB low up to value. Remember rejection
of that and you're looking for this. And

5336
02:00:04,950 --> 02:00:04,960
of that and you're looking for this. And
 

5337
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:06,709
of that and you're looking for this. And
hopefully this breaks now this shelf for

5338
02:00:06,709 --> 02:00:06,719
hopefully this breaks now this shelf for
 

5339
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:08,870
hopefully this breaks now this shelf for
you and you can get that move. Really

5340
02:00:08,870 --> 02:00:08,880
you and you can get that move. Really
 

5341
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,870
you and you can get that move. Really
good. Fantastic. Hopefully some of you

5342
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:10,880
good. Fantastic. Hopefully some of you
 

5343
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:12,629
good. Fantastic. Hopefully some of you
took that if you weren't already in.

5344
02:00:12,629 --> 02:00:12,639
took that if you weren't already in.
 

5345
02:00:12,639 --> 02:00:15,270
took that if you weren't already in.
Right, there's your IBL. Really good.

5346
02:00:15,270 --> 02:00:15,280
Right, there's your IBL. Really good.
 

5347
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:17,030
Right, there's your IBL. Really good.
And this is your TP now down into this.

5348
02:00:17,030 --> 02:00:17,040
And this is your TP now down into this.
 

5349
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:18,149
And this is your TP now down into this.
And move your stop down. Make sure

5350
02:00:18,149 --> 02:00:18,159
And move your stop down. Make sure
 

5351
02:00:18,159 --> 02:00:20,790
And move your stop down. Make sure
you're protecting some profits here.

5352
02:00:20,790 --> 02:00:20,800
you're protecting some profits here.
 

5353
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:22,629
you're protecting some profits here.
Fantastic.

5354
02:00:22,629 --> 02:00:22,639
Fantastic.
 

5355
02:00:22,639 --> 02:00:24,550
Fantastic.
Fantastic. Here you go, folks. You're

02:00:27,750 --> 02:00:27,760
going to get it. So 30s and then uh
 

5359
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:29,589
going to get it. So 30s and then uh
after 30s, what can we think about? I'm

5360
02:00:29,589 --> 02:00:29,599
after 30s, what can we think about? I'm
 

5361
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:31,189
after 30s, what can we think about? I'm
going to have to keep going back a long

5362
02:00:31,189 --> 02:00:31,199
going to have to keep going back a long
 

5363
02:00:31,199 --> 02:00:34,390
going to have to keep going back a long
way. After 30s, we can try and look for

5364
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:34,400
way. After 30s, we can try and look for
 

5365
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:36,870
way. After 30s, we can try and look for
24,900.

5366
02:00:36,870 --> 02:00:36,880
24,900.
 

5367
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:38,070
24,900.
Right. So, we're going to respect

5368
02:00:38,070 --> 02:00:38,080
Right. So, we're going to respect
 

5369
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:40,870
Right. So, we're going to respect
25,000. We're now going back to the 17th

5370
02:00:40,870 --> 02:00:40,880
25,000. We're now going back to the 17th
 

5371
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:43,750
25,000. We're now going back to the 17th
of December. Right. Here we go. Starting

5372
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:43,760
of December. Right. Here we go. Starting
 

5373
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:46,390
of December. Right. Here we go. Starting
to see acceleration here. So, happy for

5374
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:46,400
to see acceleration here. So, happy for
 

5375
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:50,629
to see acceleration here. So, happy for
you guys. Really good.

5376
02:00:50,629 --> 02:00:50,639

 

5377
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:52,790

Yeah. Have your wish orders. Have your

5378
02:00:52,790 --> 02:00:52,800
Yeah. Have your wish orders. Have your
 

5379
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:54,550
Yeah. Have your wish orders. Have your
wish orders out. Oh, wish orders. What

5380
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:54,560
wish orders out. Oh, wish orders. What
 

5381
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:56,550
wish orders out. Oh, wish orders. What
are they? Wish orders are like hoping

5382
02:00:56,550 --> 02:00:56,560
are they? Wish orders are like hoping
 

5383
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:58,149
are they? Wish orders are like hoping
price gets somewhere. So, like if we

5384
02:00:58,149 --> 02:00:58,159
price gets somewhere. So, like if we
 

5385
02:00:58,159 --> 02:01:01,109
price gets somewhere. So, like if we
snap this, you might see a stop run of a

5386
02:01:01,109 --> 02:01:01,119
snap this, you might see a stop run of a
 

5387
02:01:01,119 --> 02:01:03,109
snap this, you might see a stop run of a
really nasty candle. So, you can cover

5388
02:01:03,109 --> 02:01:03,119
really nasty candle. So, you can cover
 

5389
02:01:03,119 --> 02:01:05,350
really nasty candle. So, you can cover
some towards this, but you can have some

5390
02:01:05,350 --> 02:01:05,360
some towards this, but you can have some
 

5391
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:07,669
some towards this, but you can have some
limit orders down here, hoping that it

5392
02:01:07,669 --> 02:01:07,679
limit orders down here, hoping that it
 

5393
02:01:07,679 --> 02:01:10,709
limit orders down here, hoping that it
fills them all in one quick go. Right?

5394
02:01:10,709 --> 02:01:10,719
fills them all in one quick go. Right?
 

5395
02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:12,550
fills them all in one quick go. Right?
Or that's that's what I do. That's what

5396
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:12,560
Or that's that's what I do. That's what
 

5397
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:15,030
Or that's that's what I do. That's what
what I have. So, I have my main TP, but

5398
02:01:15,030 --> 02:01:15,040
what I have. So, I have my main TP, but
 

5399
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:16,950
what I have. So, I have my main TP, but
when we're about to break a big pivotal

5400
02:01:16,950 --> 02:01:16,960
when we're about to break a big pivotal
 

5401
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:19,189
when we're about to break a big pivotal
level, I might have some limits set

5402
02:01:19,189 --> 02:01:19,199
level, I might have some limits set
 

5403
02:01:19,199 --> 02:01:21,109
level, I might have some limits set
further down just in case we do a big

5404
02:01:21,109 --> 02:01:21,119
further down just in case we do a big
 

5405
02:01:21,119 --> 02:01:32,709
further down just in case we do a big
swipe and then a reclaim.

5406
02:01:32,709 --> 02:01:32,719

 

5407
02:01:32,719 --> 02:01:35,189

Oh, Nvidia. Yeah, no worries, mate. So,

5408
02:01:35,189 --> 02:01:35,199
Oh, Nvidia. Yeah, no worries, mate. So,
 

5409
02:01:35,199 --> 02:01:36,709
Oh, Nvidia. Yeah, no worries, mate. So,
let's just manage this. Get down into

5410
02:01:36,709 --> 02:01:36,719
let's just manage this. Get down into
 

5411
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:38,470
let's just manage this. Get down into
here if possible and then I'll have a

5412
02:01:38,470 --> 02:01:38,480
here if possible and then I'll have a
 

5413
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:39,990
here if possible and then I'll have a
look at it. Remind me again if I don't

5414
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:40,000
look at it. Remind me again if I don't
 

5415
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,149
look at it. Remind me again if I don't
if I don't do it. Where can you reach

5416
02:01:42,149 --> 02:01:42,159
if I don't do it. Where can you reach
 

5417
02:01:42,159 --> 02:01:43,109
if I don't do it. Where can you reach
out to me on email?

5418
02:01:43,109 --> 02:01:43,119
out to me on email?
 

5419
02:01:43,119 --> 02:01:51,750
out to me on email?

5420
02:01:51,750 --> 02:01:51,760

 

5421
02:01:51,760 --> 02:02:03,109

Nice work, everyone.

5422
02:02:03,109 --> 02:02:03,119

 

5423
02:02:03,119 --> 02:02:05,589

Sometimes I use the Dixie, but um at the

5424
02:02:05,589 --> 02:02:05,599
Sometimes I use the Dixie, but um at the
 

5425
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:07,750
Sometimes I use the Dixie, but um at the
moment, you know, not not needing to use

5426
02:02:07,750 --> 02:02:07,760
moment, you know, not not needing to use
 

5427
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:11,350
moment, you know, not not needing to use
it too much. I think this

5428
02:02:11,350 --> 02:02:11,360
it too much. I think this
 

5429
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:13,030
it too much. I think this
they're going to push the Dixie a little

5430
02:02:13,030 --> 02:02:13,040
they're going to push the Dixie a little
 

5431
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:15,750
they're going to push the Dixie a little
bit, which might help market rotate, but

5432
02:02:15,750 --> 02:02:15,760
bit, which might help market rotate, but
 

5433
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:17,270
bit, which might help market rotate, but
it's more about the Dixie and gold

5434
02:02:17,270 --> 02:02:17,280
it's more about the Dixie and gold
 

5435
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:23,109
it's more about the Dixie and gold
relationship right now, I'd say.

5436
02:02:23,109 --> 02:02:23,119

 

5437
02:02:23,119 --> 02:02:25,350

Right. When we let's get to these

5438
02:02:25,350 --> 02:02:25,360
Right. When we let's get to these
 

5439
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:26,629
Right. When we let's get to these
targets, guys. I'll tell you what, let's

5440
02:02:26,629 --> 02:02:26,639
targets, guys. I'll tell you what, let's
 

5441
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:28,310
targets, guys. I'll tell you what, let's
make a deal. Let's get to these targets.

5442
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:28,320
make a deal. Let's get to these targets.
 

5443
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:29,830
make a deal. Let's get to these targets.
Once we get off these targets, I will

5444
02:02:29,830 --> 02:02:29,840
Once we get off these targets, I will
 

5445
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:32,870
Once we get off these targets, I will
happily look at Invidia, Palanteer, and

5446
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:32,880
happily look at Invidia, Palanteer, and
 

5447
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:34,070
happily look at Invidia, Palanteer, and
what some someone said something else.

5448
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:34,080
what some someone said something else.
 

5449
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:35,589
what some someone said something else.
Was it PayPal? We can look at all of

5450
02:02:35,589 --> 02:02:35,599
Was it PayPal? We can look at all of
 

5451
02:02:35,599 --> 02:02:40,629
Was it PayPal? We can look at all of
those together.

5452
02:02:40,629 --> 02:02:40,639

 

5453
02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:43,350

Happy to look at them together.

5454
02:02:43,350 --> 02:02:43,360
Happy to look at them together.
 

5455
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:45,030
Happy to look at them together.
So, a little bit of front running here.

5456
02:02:45,030 --> 02:02:45,040
So, a little bit of front running here.
 

5457
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:47,350
So, a little bit of front running here.
Just know ES just bounced off its IBL.

5458
02:02:47,350 --> 02:02:47,360
Just know ES just bounced off its IBL.
 

5459
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:49,030
Just know ES just bounced off its IBL.
All right. So, watching them as a pair.

5460
02:02:49,030 --> 02:02:49,040
All right. So, watching them as a pair.
 

5461

All right. So, watching them as a pair.
ES has just found a bid on its IBL right

5462
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:51,360
ES has just found a bid on its IBL right
 

5463
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:52,790
ES has just found a bid on its IBL right
now, right in front of it. Right? So,

5464
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:52,800
now, right in front of it. Right? So,
 

5465
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:55,189
now, right in front of it. Right? So,
you need ES to stay weak and wash down

5466
02:02:55,189 --> 02:02:55,199
you need ES to stay weak and wash down
 

5467
02:02:55,199 --> 02:02:56,310
you need ES to stay weak and wash down
into some of these levels. Remember,

5468
02:02:56,310 --> 02:02:56,320
into some of these levels. Remember,
 

5469
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:57,910
into some of these levels. Remember,
we're all the way under this. All right?

5470
02:02:57,910 --> 02:02:57,920
we're all the way under this. All right?
 

5471
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:59,990
we're all the way under this. All right?
So, we are already on ENQ. We're way

5472
02:02:59,990 --> 02:03:00,000
So, we are already on ENQ. We're way
 

5473
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,030
So, we are already on ENQ. We're way
down under this. Remember, these were

5474
02:03:01,030 --> 02:03:01,040
down under this. Remember, these were
 

5475
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:02,870
down under this. Remember, these were
the low hanging fruits for us. So, we

5476
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:02,880
the low hanging fruits for us. So, we
 

5477
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:04,950
the low hanging fruits for us. So, we
shorted the weaker asset. We took this

5478
02:03:04,950 --> 02:03:04,960
shorted the weaker asset. We took this
 

5479
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:06,870
shorted the weaker asset. We took this
out. We've just rejected. We're down

5480
02:03:06,870 --> 02:03:06,880
out. We've just rejected. We're down
 

5481
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:08,470
out. We've just rejected. We're down
here now. Very, very different charts.

5482
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:08,480
here now. Very, very different charts.
 

5483
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:11,030
here now. Very, very different charts.
Why? Because the broadening market is

5484
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:11,040
Why? Because the broadening market is
 

5485
02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:13,109
Why? Because the broadening market is
still holding up some broadening market.

5486
02:03:13,109 --> 02:03:13,119
still holding up some broadening market.
 

5487
02:03:13,119 --> 02:03:17,990
still holding up some broadening market.
some of the other sectors.

5488
02:03:17,990 --> 02:03:18,000

 

5489
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,149

You do not want a reclaim of this up

5490
02:03:20,149 --> 02:03:20,159
You do not want a reclaim of this up
 

5491
02:03:20,159 --> 02:03:21,669
You do not want a reclaim of this up
here. You do not want to see that

5492
02:03:21,669 --> 02:03:21,679
here. You do not want to see that
 

5493
02:03:21,679 --> 02:03:23,510
here. You do not want to see that
reclaim.

5494
02:03:23,510 --> 02:03:23,520
reclaim.
 

5495
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:25,350
reclaim.
Making this very tricky by saving that

5496
02:03:25,350 --> 02:03:25,360
Making this very tricky by saving that
 

5497
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:27,830
Making this very tricky by saving that
by that much. Very silly of them. Very

5498
02:03:27,830 --> 02:03:27,840
by that much. Very silly of them. Very
 

5499
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:29,030
by that much. Very silly of them. Very
silly of them. Bit like this morning

5500
02:03:29,030 --> 02:03:29,040
silly of them. Bit like this morning
 

5501
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:34,149
silly of them. Bit like this morning
they did the same bollocks.

5502
02:03:34,149 --> 02:03:34,159

 

5503
02:03:34,159 --> 02:03:35,589

Why is your initial balance low much

5504
02:03:35,589 --> 02:03:35,599
Why is your initial balance low much
 

5505
02:03:35,599 --> 02:03:37,589
Why is your initial balance low much
higher than mine? I I don't know. Well,

5506
02:03:37,589 --> 02:03:37,599
higher than mine? I I don't know. Well,
 

5507
02:03:37,599 --> 02:03:40,790
higher than mine? I I don't know. Well,
it shouldn't be. low of day was IBL was

5508
02:03:40,790 --> 02:03:40,800
it shouldn't be. low of day was IBL was
 

5509
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:43,189
it shouldn't be. low of day was IBL was
putting at 10:00 a.m. and the high was

5510
02:03:43,189 --> 02:03:43,199
putting at 10:00 a.m. and the high was
 

5511
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:45,030
putting at 10:00 a.m. and the high was
the open and we had didn't trade under

5512
02:03:45,030 --> 02:03:45,040
the open and we had didn't trade under
 

5513
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:47,910
the open and we had didn't trade under
or over that before 10:30.

5514
02:03:47,910 --> 02:03:47,920
or over that before 10:30.
 

5515
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:49,430
or over that before 10:30.
So the initial balance is your first

5516
02:03:49,430 --> 02:03:49,440
So the initial balance is your first
 

5517
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:52,709
So the initial balance is your first
hour of trading. So it's a reclaim here.

5518
02:03:52,709 --> 02:03:52,719
hour of trading. So it's a reclaim here.
 

5519
02:03:52,719 --> 02:03:55,270
hour of trading. So it's a reclaim here.
So I'd be out of this now and then you'd

5520
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:55,280
So I'd be out of this now and then you'd
 

5521
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:57,030
So I'd be out of this now and then you'd
have to watch if they're going to reject

5522
02:03:57,030 --> 02:03:57,040
have to watch if they're going to reject
 

5523
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:58,870
have to watch if they're going to reject
150 here. They want to you've got to see

5524
02:03:58,870 --> 02:03:58,880
150 here. They want to you've got to see
 

5525
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:00,470
150 here. They want to you've got to see
this reject this kind of level it's in

5526
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:00,480
this reject this kind of level it's in
 

5527
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:01,830
this reject this kind of level it's in
now. If you don't see that the way

5528
02:04:01,830 --> 02:04:01,840
now. If you don't see that the way
 

5529
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:03,990
now. If you don't see that the way
they're washing this around is is pretty

5530
02:04:03,990 --> 02:04:04,000
they're washing this around is is pretty
 

5531
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,830
they're washing this around is is pretty
gross. Look at this 100 point ripper

5532
02:04:05,830 --> 02:04:05,840
gross. Look at this 100 point ripper
 

5533
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:08,709
gross. Look at this 100 point ripper
almost straight back upside.

5534
02:04:08,709 --> 02:04:08,719
almost straight back upside.
 

5535
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:10,709
almost straight back upside.
Pretty disgusting.

5536
02:04:10,709 --> 02:04:10,719
Pretty disgusting.
 

5537
02:04:10,719 --> 02:04:17,750
Pretty disgusting.
That's ES off the IBL doing that move.

5538
02:04:17,750 --> 02:04:17,760

 

5539
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:21,430

Is Trump still speaking? Um,

5540
02:04:21,430 --> 02:04:21,440
Is Trump still speaking? Um,
 

5541
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:22,950
Is Trump still speaking? Um,
I don't think so. It was just a tweet

5542
02:04:22,950 --> 02:04:22,960
I don't think so. It was just a tweet
 

5543
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:28,629
I don't think so. It was just a tweet
that he did. It's just a tweet.

5544
02:04:28,629 --> 02:04:28,639

 

5545
02:04:28,639 --> 02:04:29,990

There you go. Back into the red box.

5546
02:04:29,990 --> 02:04:30,000
There you go. Back into the red box.
 

5547
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,990
There you go. Back into the red box.
Still still okay here. If they reclaim

5548
02:04:31,990 --> 02:04:32,000
Still still okay here. If they reclaim
 

5549
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,589
Still still okay here. If they reclaim
IB and hold though, I'd be completely

5550
02:04:33,589 --> 02:04:33,599
IB and hold though, I'd be completely
 

5551
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:35,669
IB and hold though, I'd be completely
done with it for the day. You wouldn't

5552
02:04:35,669 --> 02:04:35,679
done with it for the day. You wouldn't
 

5553
02:04:35,679 --> 02:04:37,669
done with it for the day. You wouldn't
want to see that. All right, let's go

5554
02:04:37,669 --> 02:04:37,679
want to see that. All right, let's go
 

5555
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:39,109
want to see that. All right, let's go
over these charts quickly that you

5556
02:04:39,109 --> 02:04:39,119
over these charts quickly that you
 

5557
02:04:39,119 --> 02:04:40,629
over these charts quickly that you
wanted and then we're going to do the

5558
02:04:40,629 --> 02:04:40,639
wanted and then we're going to do the
 

5559
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:42,390
wanted and then we're going to do the
giveaway. So, Nvidia, some of you

5560
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:42,400
giveaway. So, Nvidia, some of you
 

5561
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:45,270
giveaway. So, Nvidia, some of you
interested Nvidia selling off that AMD

5562
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:45,280
interested Nvidia selling off that AMD
 

5563
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:49,189
interested Nvidia selling off that AMD
news, I'd imagine.

5564
02:04:49,189 --> 02:04:49,199

 

5565
02:04:49,199 --> 02:04:50,629

Starting to look a little bit dangerous

5566
02:04:50,629 --> 02:04:50,639
Starting to look a little bit dangerous
 

5567
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:52,149
Starting to look a little bit dangerous
here, folks. I'm not going to lie to

5568
02:04:52,149 --> 02:04:52,159
here, folks. I'm not going to lie to
 

5569
02:04:52,159 --> 02:04:56,950
here, folks. I'm not going to lie to
you. This is a quasi

5570
02:04:56,950 --> 02:04:56,960

 

5571
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:59,830

failing to make a new high. That's not

5572
02:04:59,830 --> 02:04:59,840
failing to make a new high. That's not
 

5573
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:02,950
failing to make a new high. That's not
good. Uh lots of liquidity and stops

5574
02:05:02,950 --> 02:05:02,960
good. Uh lots of liquidity and stops
 

5575
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:13,990
good. Uh lots of liquidity and stops
will be under here.

5576
02:05:13,990 --> 02:05:14,000

 

5577
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:17,270

Yeah, you can see where it gets thin. If

5578
02:05:17,270 --> 02:05:17,280
Yeah, you can see where it gets thin. If
 

5579
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:19,510
Yeah, you can see where it gets thin. If
you start losing these 170s, all right,

5580
02:05:19,510 --> 02:05:19,520
you start losing these 170s, all right,
 

5581
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:24,870
you start losing these 170s, all right,
if you start seeing this move here,

5582
02:05:24,870 --> 02:05:24,880

 

5583
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:29,669

uh we are coming straight down to this,

5584
02:05:29,669 --> 02:05:29,679

 

5585
02:05:29,679 --> 02:05:31,990

right? The only other option is that

5586
02:05:31,990 --> 02:05:32,000
right? The only other option is that
 

5587
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,229
right? The only other option is that
they come under trap, reclaim and go

5588
02:05:34,229 --> 02:05:34,239
they come under trap, reclaim and go
 

5589
02:05:34,239 --> 02:05:37,270
they come under trap, reclaim and go
again. This looks not good. This is not

5590
02:05:37,270 --> 02:05:37,280
again. This looks not good. This is not
 

5591
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,910
again. This looks not good. This is not
bullish. All right, this quasi point of

5592
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:39,920
bullish. All right, this quasi point of
 

5593
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:42,149
bullish. All right, this quasi point of
control failing to hold above point of

5594
02:05:42,149 --> 02:05:42,159
control failing to hold above point of
 

5595
02:05:42,159 --> 02:05:45,189
control failing to hold above point of
control, starting to lose it very thin

5596
02:05:45,189 --> 02:05:45,199
control, starting to lose it very thin
 

5597
02:05:45,199 --> 02:05:47,109
control, starting to lose it very thin
under here. The moment you start to lose

5598
02:05:47,109 --> 02:05:47,119
under here. The moment you start to lose
 

5599
02:05:47,119 --> 02:05:49,350
under here. The moment you start to lose
that, it is good night sweetheart. All

5600
02:05:49,350 --> 02:05:49,360
that, it is good night sweetheart. All
 

5601
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:50,950
that, it is good night sweetheart. All
right. And that will be the start of the

5602
02:05:50,950 --> 02:05:50,960
right. And that will be the start of the
 

5603
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:53,109
right. And that will be the start of the
move with everything else. So, it's not

5604
02:05:53,109 --> 02:05:53,119
move with everything else. So, it's not
 

5605
02:05:53,119 --> 02:05:55,830
move with everything else. So, it's not
looking too good for Nvidia right now.

5606
02:05:55,830 --> 02:05:55,840
looking too good for Nvidia right now.
 

5607
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:59,990
looking too good for Nvidia right now.
Um, someone asked about Palunteer.

5608
02:05:59,990 --> 02:06:00,000

 

5609
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,669

Same kind of story, folks. We're seeing

5610
02:06:01,669 --> 02:06:01,679
Same kind of story, folks. We're seeing
 

5611
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:03,030
Same kind of story, folks. We're seeing
we're going to see this story across the

5612
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:03,040
we're going to see this story across the
 

5613
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:07,189
we're going to see this story across the
indexes. All right. Way too frothy. Way

5614
02:06:07,189 --> 02:06:07,199
indexes. All right. Way too frothy. Way
 

5615
02:06:07,199 --> 02:06:11,830
indexes. All right. Way too frothy. Way
way way too frothy. That is ridiculous.

5616
02:06:11,830 --> 02:06:11,840
way way too frothy. That is ridiculous.
 

5617
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:12,790
way way too frothy. That is ridiculous.
All right. That is absolutely

5618
02:06:12,790 --> 02:06:12,800
All right. That is absolutely
 

5619
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:14,950
All right. That is absolutely
ridiculous. So I know like macro point

5620
02:06:14,950 --> 02:06:14,960
ridiculous. So I know like macro point
 

5621
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:17,350
ridiculous. So I know like macro point
of view did all the government news uh

5622
02:06:17,350 --> 02:06:17,360
of view did all the government news uh
 

5623
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:19,510
of view did all the government news uh
giving it new contracts but uh even for

5624
02:06:19,510 --> 02:06:19,520
giving it new contracts but uh even for
 

5625
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:22,390
giving it new contracts but uh even for
a mean reversion and we're likely to see

5626
02:06:22,390 --> 02:06:22,400
a mean reversion and we're likely to see
 

5627
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:25,030
a mean reversion and we're likely to see
something.

5628
02:06:25,030 --> 02:06:25,040
something.
 

5629
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:26,950
something.
I mean I can't even measure it out. I'm

5630
02:06:26,950 --> 02:06:26,960
I mean I can't even measure it out. I'm
 

5631
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:45,350
I mean I can't even measure it out. I'm
going to have to do it another way.

5632
02:06:45,350 --> 02:06:45,360

 

5633
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:48,950

Same kind of story.

5634
02:06:48,950 --> 02:06:48,960

 

5635
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:50,709

I'll be watching into this pivot right

5636
02:06:50,709 --> 02:06:50,719
I'll be watching into this pivot right
 

5637
02:06:50,719 --> 02:06:59,750
I'll be watching into this pivot right
here. 23s.

5638
02:06:59,750 --> 02:06:59,760

 

5639
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:01,750

23s. If we lose 23s, you know where

5640
02:07:01,750 --> 02:07:01,760
23s. If we lose 23s, you know where
 

5641
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:05,669
23s. If we lose 23s, you know where
we're going.

5642
02:07:05,669 --> 02:07:05,679

 

5643
02:07:05,679 --> 02:07:07,350

Maybe a little undercut there would be

5644
02:07:07,350 --> 02:07:07,360
Maybe a little undercut there would be
 

5645
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:09,109
Maybe a little undercut there would be
good.

5646
02:07:09,109 --> 02:07:09,119
good.
 

5647
02:07:09,119 --> 02:07:11,430
good.
You could set price alerts. Really

5648
02:07:11,430 --> 02:07:11,440
You could set price alerts. Really
 

5649
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:13,109
You could set price alerts. Really
depends what the tone of the market is

5650
02:07:13,109 --> 02:07:13,119
depends what the tone of the market is
 

5651
02:07:13,119 --> 02:07:14,709
depends what the tone of the market is
for the next for the rest of the year.

5652
02:07:14,709 --> 02:07:14,719
for the next for the rest of the year.
 

5653
02:07:14,719 --> 02:07:16,870
for the next for the rest of the year.
But something like this, right?

5654
02:07:16,870 --> 02:07:16,880
But something like this, right?
 

5655
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:20,149
But something like this, right?
Potential buy then. But look, failed to

5656
02:07:20,149 --> 02:07:20,159
Potential buy then. But look, failed to
 

5657
02:07:20,159 --> 02:07:22,629
Potential buy then. But look, failed to
make a new high. Broke down underneath.

5658
02:07:22,629 --> 02:07:22,639
make a new high. Broke down underneath.
 

5659
02:07:22,639 --> 02:07:24,470
make a new high. Broke down underneath.
Breaking down under this swing. Starting

5660
02:07:24,470 --> 02:07:24,480
Breaking down under this swing. Starting
 

5661
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:28,629
Breaking down under this swing. Starting
to go bearish into some key levels.

5662
02:07:28,629 --> 02:07:28,639
to go bearish into some key levels.
 

5663
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:31,189
to go bearish into some key levels.
If we let go of that deeper pullback,

5664
02:07:31,189 --> 02:07:31,199
If we let go of that deeper pullback,
 

5665
02:07:31,199 --> 02:07:33,589
If we let go of that deeper pullback,
very possible.

5666
02:07:33,589 --> 02:07:33,599
very possible.
 

5667
02:07:33,599 --> 02:07:35,669
very possible.
What was the other one? PayPal. I wonder

5668
02:07:35,669 --> 02:07:35,679
What was the other one? PayPal. I wonder
 

5669
02:07:35,679 --> 02:07:37,750
What was the other one? PayPal. I wonder
if someone wanted PayPal. I was tried to

5670
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:37,760
if someone wanted PayPal. I was tried to
 

5671
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:39,510
if someone wanted PayPal. I was tried to
be long PayPal earlier this year and cut

5672
02:07:39,510 --> 02:07:39,520
be long PayPal earlier this year and cut
 

5673
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:41,669
be long PayPal earlier this year and cut
it. I was up a few times. Oh, that's

5674
02:07:41,669 --> 02:07:41,679
it. I was up a few times. Oh, that's
 

5675
02:07:41,679 --> 02:07:43,510
it. I was up a few times. Oh, that's
getting crushed.

5676
02:07:43,510 --> 02:07:43,520
getting crushed.
 

5677
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:46,629
getting crushed.
Bad earnings. Was it missed? Missed on

5678
02:07:46,629 --> 02:07:46,639
Bad earnings. Was it missed? Missed on
 

5679
02:07:46,639 --> 02:07:49,510
Bad earnings. Was it missed? Missed on
earnings. Uh, that is not a good look.

5680
02:07:49,510 --> 02:07:49,520
earnings. Uh, that is not a good look.
 

5681
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:52,709
earnings. Uh, that is not a good look.
That is a big miss.

5682
02:07:52,709 --> 02:07:52,719
That is a big miss.
 

5683
02:07:52,719 --> 02:07:54,709
That is a big miss.
Yeah, they're getting wrecked. Let's go

5684
02:07:54,709 --> 02:07:54,719
Yeah, they're getting wrecked. Let's go
 

5685
02:07:54,719 --> 02:07:57,270
Yeah, they're getting wrecked. Let's go
to a weekly. Oh my gosh. Probably into

5686
02:07:57,270 --> 02:07:57,280
to a weekly. Oh my gosh. Probably into
 

5687
02:07:57,280 --> 02:07:59,109
to a weekly. Oh my gosh. Probably into
an interesting area though if I'm

5688
02:07:59,109 --> 02:07:59,119
an interesting area though if I'm
 

5689
02:07:59,119 --> 02:08:01,350
an interesting area though if I'm
honest.

5690
02:08:01,350 --> 02:08:01,360
honest.
 

5691
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:03,109
honest.
Uh, I would imagine you're going to see

5692
02:08:03,109 --> 02:08:03,119
Uh, I would imagine you're going to see
 

5693
02:08:03,119 --> 02:08:04,950
Uh, I would imagine you're going to see
some accumulation happen start to happen

5694
02:08:04,950 --> 02:08:04,960
some accumulation happen start to happen
 

5695
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:11,189
some accumulation happen start to happen
down here now.

5696
02:08:11,189 --> 02:08:11,199

 

5697
02:08:11,199 --> 02:08:13,350

Not a bad area.

5698
02:08:13,350 --> 02:08:13,360
Not a bad area.
 

5699
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:16,229
Not a bad area.
Not a bad area to start buying in. Uh

5700
02:08:16,229 --> 02:08:16,239
Not a bad area to start buying in. Uh
 

5701
02:08:16,239 --> 02:08:17,589
Not a bad area to start buying in. Uh
doesn't mean it can't break lower. Like

5702
02:08:17,589 --> 02:08:17,599
doesn't mean it can't break lower. Like
 

5703
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:18,790
doesn't mean it can't break lower. Like
if they really want to start breaking

5704
02:08:18,790 --> 02:08:18,800
if they really want to start breaking
 

5705
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:20,950
if they really want to start breaking
these 30s, you know, don't think we

5706
02:08:20,950 --> 02:08:20,960
these 30s, you know, don't think we
 

5707
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:22,550
these 30s, you know, don't think we
can't come under all that. But I would

5708
02:08:22,550 --> 02:08:22,560
can't come under all that. But I would
 

5709
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:24,950
can't come under all that. But I would
imagine that's a pretty good area to

5710
02:08:24,950 --> 02:08:24,960
imagine that's a pretty good area to
 

5711
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:28,069
imagine that's a pretty good area to
start uh looking at for the next few

5712
02:08:28,069 --> 02:08:28,079
start uh looking at for the next few
 

5713
02:08:28,079 --> 02:08:31,189
start uh looking at for the next few
days or the next few weeks. Uh at the

5714
02:08:31,189 --> 02:08:31,199
days or the next few weeks. Uh at the
 

5715
02:08:31,199 --> 02:08:33,189
days or the next few weeks. Uh at the
very least, you're going to see a retest

5716
02:08:33,189 --> 02:08:33,199
very least, you're going to see a retest
 

5717
02:08:33,199 --> 02:08:36,229
very least, you're going to see a retest
of this, right? even if they resell that

5718
02:08:36,229 --> 02:08:36,239
of this, right? even if they resell that
 

5719
02:08:36,239 --> 02:08:39,270
of this, right? even if they resell that
down. Um, under here is obviously a

5720
02:08:39,270 --> 02:08:39,280
down. Um, under here is obviously a
 

5721
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:41,589
down. Um, under here is obviously a
nogo. But this is a interesting area for

5722
02:08:41,589 --> 02:08:41,599
nogo. But this is a interesting area for
 

5723
02:08:41,599 --> 02:08:44,950
nogo. But this is a interesting area for
accumulation. That was the CO pump and

5724
02:08:44,950 --> 02:08:44,960
accumulation. That was the CO pump and
 

5725
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:48,790
accumulation. That was the CO pump and
then the postco collapse

5726
02:08:48,790 --> 02:08:48,800
then the postco collapse
 

5727
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:50,629
then the postco collapse
and then they failed to reclaim this

5728
02:08:50,629 --> 02:08:50,639
and then they failed to reclaim this
 

5729
02:08:50,639 --> 02:08:53,510
and then they failed to reclaim this
level. So you've got lots of trap buyers

5730
02:08:53,510 --> 02:08:53,520
level. So you've got lots of trap buyers
 

5731
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:55,510
level. So you've got lots of trap buyers
in here. But I would imagine there is

5732
02:08:55,510 --> 02:08:55,520
in here. But I would imagine there is
 

5733
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:58,550
in here. But I would imagine there is
some relief from here to here at some

5734
02:08:58,550 --> 02:08:58,560
some relief from here to here at some
 

5735
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:01,350
some relief from here to here at some
point. At some point we will see a

5736
02:09:01,350 --> 02:09:01,360
point. At some point we will see a
 

5737
02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:03,750
point. At some point we will see a
relief bounce or a back test. Remember

5738
02:09:03,750 --> 02:09:03,760
relief bounce or a back test. Remember
 

5739
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:05,109
relief bounce or a back test. Remember
how the market moves. If we just

5740
02:09:05,109 --> 02:09:05,119
how the market moves. If we just
 

5741
02:09:05,119 --> 02:09:08,149
how the market moves. If we just
consider this a wave, right?

5742
02:09:08,149 --> 02:09:08,159
consider this a wave, right?
 

5743
02:09:08,159 --> 02:09:09,750
consider this a wave, right?
Right. We will come and at least back

5744
02:09:09,750 --> 02:09:09,760
Right. We will come and at least back
 

5745
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:11,589
Right. We will come and at least back
test this. So there is a trade from here

5746
02:09:11,589 --> 02:09:11,599
test this. So there is a trade from here
 

5747
02:09:11,599 --> 02:09:13,830
test this. So there is a trade from here
to here at the very least going to

5748
02:09:13,830 --> 02:09:13,840
to here at the very least going to
 

5749
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:23,030
to here at the very least going to
happen.

5750
02:09:23,030 --> 02:09:23,040

 

5751
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:24,629

Yeah, that's uh that PayPal's

5752
02:09:24,629 --> 02:09:24,639
Yeah, that's uh that PayPal's
 

5753
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:26,629
Yeah, that's uh that PayPal's
interesting for uh to scoop up to be

5754
02:09:26,629 --> 02:09:26,639
interesting for uh to scoop up to be
 

5755
02:09:26,639 --> 02:09:28,390
interesting for uh to scoop up to be
honest. Right. How are we doing in the

5756
02:09:28,390 --> 02:09:28,400
honest. Right. How are we doing in the
 

5757
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:30,870
honest. Right. How are we doing in the
market? Where are we?

5758
02:09:30,870 --> 02:09:30,880
market? Where are we?
 

5759
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:32,550
market? Where are we?
Okay, back down towards the low. Nice

5760
02:09:32,550 --> 02:09:32,560
Okay, back down towards the low. Nice
 

5761
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:34,390
Okay, back down towards the low. Nice
rejection of red box. Nice rejection of

5762
02:09:34,390 --> 02:09:34,400
rejection of red box. Nice rejection of
 

5763
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:37,830
rejection of red box. Nice rejection of
value. [\h__\h] had to like squeeze

5764
02:09:37,830 --> 02:09:37,840

5765
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:39,109

that a little bit more than they should

5766
02:09:39,109 --> 02:09:39,119
that a little bit more than they should
 

5767
02:09:39,119 --> 02:09:40,310
that a little bit more than they should
have. Still looking for You're still

5768
02:09:40,310 --> 02:09:40,320
have. Still looking for You're still
 

5769
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:41,990
have. Still looking for You're still
looking for 30s. If you added back on

5770
02:09:41,990 --> 02:09:42,000
looking for 30s. If you added back on
 

5771
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,149
looking for 30s. If you added back on
there, you're still looking for 30s. And

5772
02:09:44,149 --> 02:09:44,159
there, you're still looking for 30s. And
 

5773
02:09:44,159 --> 02:09:47,030
there, you're still looking for 30s. And
under that new lows.

5774
02:09:47,030 --> 02:09:47,040

Gone over them a few times already. It's

5928
02:13:05,270 --> 02:13:05,280
Gone over them a few times already. It's
 

5929
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:08,149
Gone over them a few times already. It's
uh two ticks.

5930
02:13:08,149 --> 02:13:08,159
uh two ticks.
 

5931
02:13:08,159 --> 02:13:11,430
uh two ticks.
Two ticks. All right. And style 20% set

5932
02:13:11,430 --> 02:13:11,440
Two ticks. All right. And style 20% set
 

5933
02:13:11,440 --> 02:13:14,149
Two ticks. All right. And style 20% set
to right. That's all I change.

5934
02:13:14,149 --> 02:13:14,159
to right. That's all I change.
 

5935
02:13:14,159 --> 02:13:16,310
to right. That's all I change.
Come on. Give the team the money. All

5936
02:13:16,310 --> 02:13:16,320
Come on. Give the team the money. All
 

5937
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:18,310
Come on. Give the team the money. All
right. Give the team the money. TP into

5938
02:13:18,310 --> 02:13:18,320
right. Give the team the money. TP into
 

5939
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:19,750
right. Give the team the money. TP into
here. Don't be a dick for a tick. If

5940
02:13:19,750 --> 02:13:19,760
here. Don't be a dick for a tick. If
 

5941
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:20,790
here. Don't be a dick for a tick. If
this doesn't want to give it to you, at

5942
02:13:20,790 --> 02:13:20,800
this doesn't want to give it to you, at
 

5943
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:22,470
this doesn't want to give it to you, at
least pay yourself some in case they're

5944
02:13:22,470 --> 02:13:22,480
least pay yourself some in case they're
 

5945
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:24,069
least pay yourself some in case they're
[\h__\h] [\h__\h] Hopefully they're not.

5946
02:13:24,069 --> 02:13:24,079
[\h__\h] [\h__\h] Hopefully they're not.
 

5947
02:13:24,079 --> 02:13:26,629
[\h__\h] [\h__\h] Hopefully they're not.
Pardon my French. And and hopefully we

5948
02:13:26,629 --> 02:13:26,639
Pardon my French. And and hopefully we
 

5949
02:13:26,639 --> 02:13:30,310
Pardon my French. And and hopefully we
get down into here.

5950
02:13:30,310 --> 02:13:30,320

 

5951
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:32,069

How do I decide where to place my stop

5952
02:13:32,069 --> 02:13:32,079
How do I decide where to place my stop
 

5953
02:13:32,079 --> 02:13:33,910
How do I decide where to place my stop
loss? The other side of volume. Right.

5954
02:13:33,910 --> 02:13:33,920
loss? The other side of volume. Right.
 

5955
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:36,149
loss? The other side of volume. Right.
So, if you just got short on this re

5956
02:13:36,149 --> 02:13:36,159
So, if you just got short on this re
 

5957
02:13:36,159 --> 02:13:38,470
So, if you just got short on this re
attempt here, you want it to protect the

5958
02:13:38,470 --> 02:13:38,480
attempt here, you want it to protect the
 

5959
02:13:38,480 --> 02:13:40,229
attempt here, you want it to protect the
other side of volume. So, I'd be short

5960
02:13:40,229 --> 02:13:40,239
other side of volume. So, I'd be short
 

5961
02:13:40,239 --> 02:13:42,310
other side of volume. So, I'd be short
in here with my stop here. All right.

5962
02:13:42,310 --> 02:13:42,320
in here with my stop here. All right.
 

5963
02:13:42,320 --> 02:13:44,950
in here with my stop here. All right.
This would be a bit of a pain. You could

5964
02:13:44,950 --> 02:13:44,960
This would be a bit of a pain. You could
 

5965
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:46,310
This would be a bit of a pain. You could
have, I guess, shorted this node with

5966
02:13:46,310 --> 02:13:46,320
have, I guess, shorted this node with
 

5967
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:48,390
have, I guess, shorted this node with
your stop into this one, or you could

5968
02:13:48,390 --> 02:13:48,400
your stop into this one, or you could
 

5969
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:49,750
your stop into this one, or you could
have reshorted this with your stop into

5970
02:13:49,750 --> 02:13:49,760
have reshorted this with your stop into
 

5971
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:51,990
have reshorted this with your stop into
that, for example. Uh, the IB trade was

5972
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:52,000
that, for example. Uh, the IB trade was
 

5973
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:53,669
that, for example. Uh, the IB trade was
very good and then they washed you out

5974
02:13:53,669 --> 02:13:53,679
very good and then they washed you out
 

5975
02:13:53,679 --> 02:13:55,990
very good and then they washed you out
and it would have needed a re-entry. But

5976
02:13:55,990 --> 02:13:56,000
and it would have needed a re-entry. But
 

5977
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,709
and it would have needed a re-entry. But
I used volume or where or where the

5978
02:13:58,709 --> 02:13:58,719
I used volume or where or where the
 

5979
02:13:58,719 --> 02:14:00,470
I used volume or where or where the
trade is no longer valid, right? So, if

5980
02:14:00,470 --> 02:14:00,480
trade is no longer valid, right? So, if
 

5981
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:01,990
trade is no longer valid, right? So, if
you were going to be short down here,

5982
02:14:01,990 --> 02:14:02,000
you were going to be short down here,
 

5983
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,550
you were going to be short down here,
you would have to have your stop here or

5984
02:14:04,550 --> 02:14:04,560
you would have to have your stop here or
 

5985
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:06,229
you would have to have your stop here or
you would have to do it on the change of

5986
02:14:06,229 --> 02:14:06,239
you would have to do it on the change of
 

5987
02:14:06,239 --> 02:14:07,750
you would have to do it on the change of
character up here, which means you would

5988
02:14:07,750 --> 02:14:07,760
character up here, which means you would
 

5989
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:09,430
character up here, which means you would
have to use very small size because it's

5990
02:14:09,430 --> 02:14:09,440
have to use very small size because it's
 

5991
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:20,310
have to use very small size because it's
over 100 points away.

5992
02:14:20,310 --> 02:14:20,320

 

5993
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:22,709

I can't sorry 80% I can't do what you

5994
02:14:22,709 --> 02:14:22,719
I can't sorry 80% I can't do what you
 

5995
02:14:22,719 --> 02:14:25,030
I can't sorry 80% I can't do what you
want. I'm really sorry. Like I I'm also

5996
02:14:25,030 --> 02:14:25,040
want. I'm really sorry. Like I I'm also
 

5997
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:26,550
want. I'm really sorry. Like I I'm also
having to trade and having to manage

5998
02:14:26,550 --> 02:14:26,560
having to trade and having to manage
 

5999
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:28,069
having to trade and having to manage
stuff. I can't say all the numbers all

6000
02:14:28,069 --> 02:14:28,079
stuff. I can't say all the numbers all
 

6001
02:14:28,079 --> 02:14:29,910
stuff. I can't say all the numbers all
the times. I I get what you're saying

6002
02:14:29,910 --> 02:14:29,920
the times. I I get what you're saying
 

6003
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:31,830
the times. I I get what you're saying
but I'm drawing it on. I will try my

6004
02:14:31,830 --> 02:14:31,840
but I'm drawing it on. I will try my
 

6005
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:37,990
but I'm drawing it on. I will try my
best, but very hard for me to do that

6006
02:14:37,990 --> 02:14:38,000

 

6007
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,310

cuz if I'm saying here and I put it the

6008
02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:40,320
cuz if I'm saying here and I put it the
 

6009
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:41,510
cuz if I'm saying here and I put it the
other side of this node, I'm not going

6010
02:14:41,510 --> 02:14:41,520
other side of this node, I'm not going
 

6011
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:42,950
other side of this node, I'm not going
to give you the price of the node. I'm

6012
02:14:42,950 --> 02:14:42,960
to give you the price of the node. I'm
 

6013
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:44,870
to give you the price of the node. I'm
really sorry. I get that. It makes it

6014
02:14:44,870 --> 02:14:44,880
really sorry. I get that. It makes it
 

6015
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:46,950
really sorry. I get that. It makes it
harder for you.

6016
02:14:46,950 --> 02:14:46,960
harder for you.
 

6017
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:50,629
harder for you.

6036
02:15:42,950 --> 02:15:42,960

 

6037
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:44,550

going to squeeze back up to the red. I

6038
02:15:44,550 --> 02:15:44,560
going to squeeze back up to the red. I
 

6039
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:46,069
going to squeeze back up to the red. I
can't believe they protected that low

6040
02:15:46,069 --> 02:15:46,079
can't believe they protected that low
 

6041
02:15:46,079 --> 02:15:50,149
can't believe they protected that low
again. ES again holding the IB. So that

6042
02:15:50,149 --> 02:15:50,159
again. ES again holding the IB. So that
 

6043
02:15:50,159 --> 02:15:52,069
again. ES again holding the IB. So that
holding the market up pretty well there

6044
02:15:52,069 --> 02:15:52,079
holding the market up pretty well there
 

6045
02:15:52,079 --> 02:15:53,990
holding the market up pretty well there
on the ES.

6046
02:15:53,990 --> 02:15:54,000
on the ES.
 

6047
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,910
on the ES.
Pretty well there on the ES. Just give

6048
02:15:55,910 --> 02:15:55,920
Pretty well there on the ES. Just give
 

6049
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:58,709
Pretty well there on the ES. Just give
you guys another minute.

6050
02:15:58,709 --> 02:15:58,719
you guys another minute.
 

6051
02:15:58,719 --> 02:16:03,350
you guys another minute.
Right. If we start to reclaim here,

6052
02:16:03,350 --> 02:16:03,360

 

6053
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:05,350

if we start to reclaim here and do a W

6054
02:16:05,350 --> 02:16:05,360
if we start to reclaim here and do a W
 

6055
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:07,109
if we start to reclaim here and do a W
and base above here, you will expect

6056
02:16:07,109 --> 02:16:07,119
and base above here, you will expect
 

6057
02:16:07,119 --> 02:16:10,790
and base above here, you will expect
range rotation from sort of above 140

6058
02:16:10,790 --> 02:16:10,800
range rotation from sort of above 140
 

6059
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:13,830
range rotation from sort of above 140
150 for relief up to the 210s. I would

6060
02:16:13,830 --> 02:16:13,840
150 for relief up to the 210s. I would
 

6061
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:15,669
150 for relief up to the 210s. I would
not be trading that long. Those of you

6062
02:16:15,669 --> 02:16:15,679
not be trading that long. Those of you
 

6063
02:16:15,679 --> 02:16:17,910
not be trading that long. Those of you
who like range rotation, that is a

6064
02:16:17,910 --> 02:16:17,920
who like range rotation, that is a
 

6065
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:20,069
who like range rotation, that is a
viable setup if they start to trade

6066
02:16:20,069 --> 02:16:20,079
viable setup if they start to trade
 

6067
02:16:20,079 --> 02:16:21,589
viable setup if they start to trade
through some of this. It's very, very

6068
02:16:21,589 --> 02:16:21,599
through some of this. It's very, very
 

6069
02:16:21,599 --> 02:16:23,189
through some of this. It's very, very
risky. In my mind, you want to stay

6070
02:16:23,189 --> 02:16:23,199
risky. In my mind, you want to stay
 

6071
02:16:23,199 --> 02:16:25,669
risky. In my mind, you want to stay
short on a day like today. But we will

6072
02:16:25,669 --> 02:16:25,679
short on a day like today. But we will
 

6073
02:16:25,679 --> 02:16:27,430
short on a day like today. But we will
see if they're starting to reclaim. We

6074
02:16:27,430 --> 02:16:27,440
see if they're starting to reclaim. We
 

6075
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:29,350
see if they're starting to reclaim. We
have to be willing to at least think

6076
02:16:29,350 --> 02:16:29,360
have to be willing to at least think
 

6077
02:16:29,360 --> 02:16:31,669
have to be willing to at least think
about that moment. They've just washed

6078
02:16:31,669 --> 02:16:31,679
about that moment. They've just washed
 

6079

6395
02:24:56,800 --> 02:24:58,870
it to get lower. Uh but ES is holding
the market up pretty well right now. But

6396
02:24:58,870 --> 02:24:58,880
the market up pretty well right now. But
 

6397
02:24:58,880 --> 02:25:00,790
the market up pretty well right now. But
this is starting to look very

6398
02:25:00,790 --> 02:25:00,800
this is starting to look very
 

6399
02:25:00,800 --> 02:25:03,270
this is starting to look very
aggressive. Sellers last got stuck here

6400
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:03,280
aggressive. Sellers last got stuck here
 

6401
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:05,190
aggressive. Sellers last got stuck here
at 70s. By the way, there were sellers

6402
02:25:05,190 --> 02:25:05,200
at 70s. By the way, there were sellers
 

6403
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:07,750
at 70s. By the way, there were sellers
at lower of days at 50s.

6404
02:25:07,750 --> 02:25:07,760
at lower of days at 50s.
 

6405
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:09,830
at lower of days at 50s.
It's looking like it's trying to

6406
02:25:09,830 --> 02:25:09,840
It's looking like it's trying to
 

6407
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:11,429
It's looking like it's trying to
accelerate. It is attempting to

6408
02:25:11,429 --> 02:25:11,439
accelerate. It is attempting to
 

6409
02:25:11,439 --> 02:25:13,270
accelerate. It is attempting to
accelerate lower here to clean up the

6410
02:25:13,270 --> 02:25:13,280
accelerate lower here to clean up the
 

6411
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:15,750
accelerate lower here to clean up the
low of day, but I'd be watching these

6412
02:25:15,750 --> 02:25:15,760
low of day, but I'd be watching these
 

6413
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:18,870
low of day, but I'd be watching these
50s. Okay, 50s. We had a big seller at

6414
02:25:18,870 --> 02:25:18,880
50s. Okay, 50s. We had a big seller at
 

6415
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:21,990
50s. Okay, 50s. We had a big seller at
that low. So 70s there was some selling

6416
02:25:21,990 --> 02:25:22,000
that low. So 70s there was some selling
 

6417
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:27,190
that low. So 70s there was some selling
before 70s to 77 50s is where that uh

6418
02:25:27,190 --> 02:25:27,200
before 70s to 77 50s is where that uh
 

6419
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:29,030
before 70s to 77 50s is where that uh
big seller at low of day got caught. If

6420
02:25:29,030 --> 02:25:29,040
big seller at low of day got caught. If
 

6421
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:31,110
big seller at low of day got caught. If
you get under there under 50s we should

6422
02:25:31,110 --> 02:25:31,120
you get under there under 50s we should
 

6423
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:32,870
you get under there under 50s we should
get that 30s which is what we're looking

6424
02:25:32,870 --> 02:25:32,880
get that 30s which is what we're looking
 

6425
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:35,750
get that 30s which is what we're looking
for. We would like to see 30s. So we're

6426
02:25:35,750 --> 02:25:35,760
for. We would like to see 30s. So we're
 

6427
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:38,950
for. We would like to see 30s. So we're
letting go of 50s here

6428
02:25:38,950 --> 02:25:38,960
letting go of 50s here
 

6429
02:25:38,960 --> 02:25:41,349
letting go of 50s here
and we let go to 50s here. Still

6430
02:25:41,349 --> 02:25:41,359
and we let go to 50s here. Still
 

6431
02:25:41,359 --> 02:25:44,150
and we let go to 50s here. Still
hovering around me 70s.

6432
02:25:44,150 --> 02:25:44,160
hovering around me 70s.
 

6433
02:25:44,160 --> 02:25:45,750
hovering around me 70s.
Reason I'm talking about this right

6434
02:25:45,750 --> 02:25:45,760
Reason I'm talking about this right
 

6435
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:48,150
Reason I'm talking about this right
here. Right down into here. 50 is where

6436
02:25:48,150 --> 02:25:48,160
here. Right down into here. 50 is where
 

6437
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:49,670
here. Right down into here. 50 is where
these sellers got stuck. And underneath

6438
02:25:49,670 --> 02:25:49,680
these sellers got stuck. And underneath
 

6439
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:51,990
these sellers got stuck. And underneath
that, we should break and get the

6440
02:25:51,990 --> 02:25:52,000
that, we should break and get the
 

6441
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:53,830
that, we should break and get the
target. If we can, if we can let these

6442
02:25:53,830 --> 02:25:53,840
target. If we can, if we can let these
 

6443
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:56,070
target. If we can, if we can let these
sellers out, we should break and get the

6444
02:25:56,070 --> 02:25:56,080
sellers out, we should break and get the
 

6445
02:25:56,080 --> 02:25:58,550
sellers out, we should break and get the
target. Leaving this shelf. If we can

6446
02:25:58,550 --> 02:25:58,560
target. Leaving this shelf. If we can
 

6447
02:25:58,560 --> 02:26:00,389
target. Leaving this shelf. If we can
leave this shelf, we should break. We're

6448
02:26:00,389 --> 02:26:00,399
leave this shelf, we should break. We're
 

6449
02:26:00,399 --> 02:26:03,110
leave this shelf, we should break. We're
just going to have to respect 50s on the

6450
02:26:03,110 --> 02:26:03,120
just going to have to respect 50s on the
 

6451
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:05,670
just going to have to respect 50s on the
nose. I can show you it right here. Can

6452
02:26:05,670 --> 02:26:05,680
nose. I can show you it right here. Can
 

6453
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:08,309
nose. I can show you it right here. Can
I move this up? No. Come on. Move up,

6454
02:26:08,309 --> 02:26:08,319
I move this up? No. Come on. Move up,
 

6455
02:26:08,319 --> 02:26:11,429
I move this up? No. Come on. Move up,
please. M this guy right here.

6456
02:26:11,429 --> 02:26:11,439
please. M this guy right here.
 

6457
02:26:11,439 --> 02:26:14,469
please. M this guy right here.
Right. This big lot here. 50s 89 lot

6458
02:26:14,469 --> 02:26:14,479
Right. This big lot here. 50s 89 lot
 

6459
02:26:14,479 --> 02:26:17,429
Right. This big lot here. 50s 89 lot
down there. We're going to respect him.

6460
02:26:17,429 --> 02:26:17,439
down there. We're going to respect him.
 

6461
02:26:17,439 --> 02:26:19,270
down there. We're going to respect him.
So, you take a partial into him and then

6462
02:26:19,270 --> 02:26:19,280
So, you take a partial into him and then
 

6463
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:21,429
So, you take a partial into him and then
see if we can break down. And ideally,

6464
02:26:21,429 --> 02:26:21,439
see if we can break down. And ideally,
 

6465
02:26:21,439 --> 02:26:23,110
see if we can break down. And ideally,
ES joins the game. Remember, ES has

6466
02:26:23,110 --> 02:26:23,120
ES joins the game. Remember, ES has
 

6467
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:25,750
ES joins the game. Remember, ES has
still not taken out his IB low yet or

6468
02:26:25,750 --> 02:26:25,760
still not taken out his IB low yet or
 

6469
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:27,590
still not taken out his IB low yet or
anything,

6470
02:26:27,590 --> 02:26:27,600
anything,
 

6471
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:35,270
anything,
but that continues to be annoying today.

6472
02:26:35,270 --> 02:26:35,280

 

6473
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:36,950

Show my trades. I mean, I'm not in a

6474
02:26:36,950 --> 02:26:36,960
Show my trades. I mean, I'm not in a
 

6475
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:39,110
Show my trades. I mean, I'm not in a
trade. Uh, we had them this morning.

6476
02:26:39,110 --> 02:26:39,120
trade. Uh, we had them this morning.
 

6477
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:41,110
trade. Uh, we had them this morning.
These were my trades this morning. Here

6478
02:26:41,110 --> 02:26:41,120
These were my trades this morning. Here
 

6479
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:43,190
These were my trades this morning. Here
and here. This is what I've called for

6480
02:26:43,190 --> 02:26:43,200
and here. This is what I've called for
 

6481
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:54,710
and here. This is what I've called for
you since.

6482
02:26:54,710 --> 02:26:54,720

 

6483
02:26:54,720 --> 02:26:57,030

VIX is climbing. No, VIX is still stuck

6484
02:26:57,030 --> 02:26:57,040
VIX is climbing. No, VIX is still stuck
 

6485
02:26:57,040 --> 02:26:59,349
VIX is climbing. No, VIX is still stuck
in between those ranges. Right. So, VIX

6486
02:26:59,349 --> 02:26:59,359
in between those ranges. Right. So, VIX
 

6487
02:26:59,359 --> 02:27:01,750
in between those ranges. Right. So, VIX
keeps finding bids down at 1850. It's

6488
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:01,760
keeps finding bids down at 1850. It's
 

6489
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:04,230
keeps finding bids down at 1850. It's
still not broken out of its like 1925

6490
02:27:04,230 --> 02:27:04,240
still not broken out of its like 1925
 

6491
02:27:04,240 --> 02:27:07,110
still not broken out of its like 1925
pivot. The big pivot is 1960s. All

6492
02:27:07,110 --> 02:27:07,120
pivot. The big pivot is 1960s. All
 

6493
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:08,790
pivot. The big pivot is 1960s. All
right, through 1960s we're going to go

6494
02:27:08,790 --> 02:27:08,800
right, through 1960s we're going to go
 

6495
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:18,389
right, through 1960s we're going to go
previous day high on Vicks.

6496
02:27:18,389 --> 02:27:18,399

 

6497
02:27:18,399 --> 02:27:19,910

Start cursing to push it down. It's

6498
02:27:19,910 --> 02:27:19,920
Start cursing to push it down. It's
 

6499
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:21,349
Start cursing to push it down. It's
coming, folks. It's coming. Look, we're

6500
02:27:21,349 --> 02:27:21,359
coming, folks. It's coming. Look, we're
 

6501
02:27:21,359 --> 02:27:22,790
coming, folks. It's coming. Look, we're
still just in the gray box. If we reject

6502
02:27:22,790 --> 02:27:22,800
still just in the gray box. If we reject
 

6503
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:24,550
still just in the gray box. If we reject
gray box, we should get the swipe. We

6504
02:27:24,550 --> 02:27:24,560
gray box, we should get the swipe. We
 

6505
02:27:24,560 --> 02:27:33,349
gray box, we should get the swipe. We
just need ES to stop [\h__\h] around.

6506
02:27:33,349 --> 02:27:33,359

 

6507
02:27:33,359 --> 02:27:35,110

What do I think about longing after we

6508
02:27:35,110 --> 02:27:35,120
What do I think about longing after we
 

6509
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:37,270
What do I think about longing after we
hit TP? I wouldn't I wouldn't be doing

6510
02:27:37,270 --> 02:27:37,280
hit TP? I wouldn't I wouldn't be doing
 

6511
02:27:37,280 --> 02:27:39,190
hit TP? I wouldn't I wouldn't be doing
that unless we trap a significant amount

6512
02:27:39,190 --> 02:27:39,200
that unless we trap a significant amount
 

6513
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:41,190
that unless we trap a significant amount
of liquidity. You've got to remember we

6514
02:27:41,190 --> 02:27:41,200
of liquidity. You've got to remember we
 

6515
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:42,790
of liquidity. You've got to remember we
are starting to break down daily,

6516
02:27:42,790 --> 02:27:42,800
are starting to break down daily,
 

6517
02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:45,030
are starting to break down daily,
weekly, monthly levels, right? Be zoomed

6518
02:27:45,030 --> 02:27:45,040
weekly, monthly levels, right? Be zoomed
 

6519
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:46,550
weekly, monthly levels, right? Be zoomed
out. Understand what we're trading to

6520
02:27:46,550 --> 02:27:46,560
out. Understand what we're trading to
 

6521
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:48,070
out. Understand what we're trading to
and why. I wouldn't be trying to guess

6522
02:27:48,070 --> 02:27:48,080
and why. I wouldn't be trying to guess
 

6523
02:27:48,080 --> 02:27:50,389
and why. I wouldn't be trying to guess
the bottom on a day like today. They

6524
02:27:50,389 --> 02:27:50,399
the bottom on a day like today. They
 

6525
02:27:50,399 --> 02:27:51,830
the bottom on a day like today. They
tried to do that yesterday and saved it.

6526
02:27:51,830 --> 02:27:51,840
tried to do that yesterday and saved it.
 

6527
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:53,429
tried to do that yesterday and saved it.
All right. Watch these 50s now as a

6528
02:27:53,429 --> 02:27:53,439
All right. Watch these 50s now as a
 

6529
02:27:53,439 --> 02:27:54,870
All right. Watch these 50s now as a
cover point. You can cover some in front

6530
02:27:54,870 --> 02:27:54,880
cover point. You can cover some in front
 

6531
02:27:54,880 --> 02:27:56,950
cover point. You can cover some in front
of 50s. And if we snap 50s, you're

6532
02:27:56,950 --> 02:27:56,960
of 50s. And if we snap 50s, you're
 

6533
02:27:56,960 --> 02:27:58,870
of 50s. And if we snap 50s, you're
looking for 30s. So right into these 50s

6534
02:27:58,870 --> 02:27:58,880
looking for 30s. So right into these 50s
 

6535
02:27:58,880 --> 02:28:00,469
looking for 30s. So right into these 50s
again. ES still not breaking down under

6536
02:28:00,469 --> 02:28:00,479
again. ES still not breaking down under
 

6537
02:28:00,479 --> 02:28:02,469
again. ES still not breaking down under
IB.

6538
02:28:02,469 --> 02:28:02,479
IB.
 

6539
02:28:02,479 --> 02:28:05,190
IB.
So you've got a TP here into 50s. If

6540
02:28:05,190 --> 02:28:05,200
So you've got a TP here into 50s. If
 

6541
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:07,030
So you've got a TP here into 50s. If
they cannot break 50s, be very careful.

6542
02:28:07,030 --> 02:28:07,040
they cannot break 50s, be very careful.

If you break 50s, you're going to get a
 

6545

If you break 50s, you're going to get a
new lower day. So 50s back up to 70s

6546
02:28:10,870 --> 02:28:10,880
new lower day. So 50s back up to 70s

new lower day. So 50s back up to 70s

is still the level where those sellers

6552
02:28:19,429 --> 02:28:19,439
is still the level where those sellers
 

6553
02:28:19,439 --> 02:28:20,870

6555

be done with it. If they fail this next

Someone is absorbing down here. Someone

6656
02:30:13,190 --> 02:30:13,200
Someone is absorbing down here. Someone
 

6657
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:14,469
Someone is absorbing down here. Someone
is definitely absorbing down here. I

6658
02:30:14,469 --> 02:30:14,479
is definitely absorbing down here. I
 

6659
02:30:14,479 --> 02:30:15,349
is definitely absorbing down here. I
think you're going to get the break,

6660
02:30:15,349 --> 02:30:15,359
think you're going to get the break,
 

6661
02:30:15,359 --> 02:30:16,950
think you're going to get the break,
though. I cannot imagine that they keep

6662
02:30:16,950 --> 02:30:16,960
though. I cannot imagine that they keep
 

6663
02:30:16,960 --> 02:30:19,110
though. I cannot imagine that they keep
saving this, but

6664
02:30:19,110 --> 02:30:19,120
saving this, but
 

6665
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:33,510
saving this, but
long as you paid yourself some.

6666
02:30:33,510 --> 02:30:33,520

 

6667
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:36,070

50s to 70 still a rotation. They want to

6668
02:30:36,070 --> 02:30:36,080
50s to 70 still a rotation. They want to
 

6669
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:39,270
50s to 70 still a rotation. They want to
pop it same as they did last time.

6670
02:30:39,270 --> 02:30:39,280
pop it same as they did last time.
 

6671
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:40,630
pop it same as they did last time.
You would not want it above that. I tell

6672
02:30:40,630 --> 02:30:40,640
You would not want it above that. I tell
 

6673
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:42,550
You would not want it above that. I tell
you that much. There is liquidity down

6674
02:30:42,550 --> 02:30:42,560
you that much. There is liquidity down
 

6675
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:44,230
you that much. There is liquidity down
at 20. So, I think we should swipe this

6676
02:30:44,230 --> 02:30:44,240
at 20. So, I think we should swipe this
 

6677
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:46,469
at 20. So, I think we should swipe this
guy our level here at 30. We should

6678
02:30:46,469 --> 02:30:46,479
guy our level here at 30. We should
 

6679
02:30:46,479 --> 02:30:49,910
guy our level here at 30. We should
swipe him. If ES can stop [\h__\h] about,

6680
02:30:49,910 --> 02:30:49,920
swipe him. If ES can stop [\h__\h] about,
 

6681
02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:52,630
swipe him. If ES can stop [\h__\h] about,
it will really help.

6682
02:30:52,630 --> 02:30:52,640
it will really help.

02:34:13,270 --> 02:34:13,280
here that you're trading into? Because
 

6845
02:34:13,280 --> 02:34:14,950
here that you're trading into? Because
the only thing left to attack now is the

6846
02:34:14,950 --> 02:34:14,960
the only thing left to attack now is the
 

6847
02:34:14,960 --> 02:34:16,630
the only thing left to attack now is the
200. Don't think I don't use moving

6848
02:34:16,630 --> 02:34:16,640
200. Don't think I don't use moving
 

6849
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:19,670
200. Don't think I don't use moving
averages. I use them.

6850
02:34:19,670 --> 02:34:19,680
averages. I use them.
 

6851
02:34:19,680 --> 02:34:22,630
averages. I use them.
Why are we in a cell?

6852
02:34:22,630 --> 02:34:22,640
Why are we in a cell?
 

6853
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:25,750
Why are we in a cell?
What? What rolled over? Oh. Oh, there it

6854
02:34:25,750 --> 02:34:25,760
What? What rolled over? Oh. Oh, there it
 

6855
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:27,349
What? What rolled over? Oh. Oh, there it
is.

6856
02:34:27,349 --> 02:34:27,359
is.
 

6857
02:34:27,359 --> 02:34:33,349
is.
I have to be a genius.

6858
02:34:33,349 --> 02:34:33,359

 

6859
02:34:33,359 --> 02:34:35,429

Here we go. All right. So, let's see if

6860
02:34:35,429 --> 02:34:35,439
Here we go. All right. So, let's see if
 

6861
02:34:35,439 --> 02:34:37,510
Here we go. All right. So, let's see if
we can dig down any further. Uh, I'm

6862
02:34:37,510 --> 02:34:37,520
we can dig down any further. Uh, I'm
 

6863
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:39,510
we can dig down any further. Uh, I'm
watching the next daily pivot. We have

6864
02:34:39,510 --> 02:34:39,520
watching the next daily pivot. We have
 

6865
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:42,710
watching the next daily pivot. We have
an old an old open here at 76 and then

6866
02:34:42,710 --> 02:34:42,720
an old an old open here at 76 and then
 

6867
02:34:42,720 --> 02:34:48,389
an old an old open here at 76 and then
we're watching 24,890.

6868
02:34:48,389 --> 02:34:48,399

 

6869
02:34:48,399 --> 02:34:50,389

24,890.

6870
02:34:50,389 --> 02:34:50,399
24,890.
 

6871
02:34:50,399 --> 02:34:52,230
24,890.
So, here we go into the top of the blue

6872
02:34:52,230 --> 02:34:52,240
So, here we go into the top of the blue
 

6873
02:34:52,240 --> 02:34:53,830
So, here we go into the top of the blue
box. We can trim some here. And then

6874
02:34:53,830 --> 02:34:53,840
box. We can trim some here. And then
 

6875
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:55,830
box. We can trim some here. And then
we're looking for all the way down to

6876
02:34:55,830 --> 02:34:55,840
we're looking for all the way down to
 

6877
02:34:55,840 --> 02:34:58,389
we're looking for all the way down to
890. Here would be the next level. I'm

6878
02:34:58,389 --> 02:34:58,399
890. Here would be the next level. I'm
 

6879
02:34:58,399 --> 02:35:01,429
890. Here would be the next level. I'm
going to put a horizontal line here.

6880
02:35:01,429 --> 02:35:01,439
going to put a horizontal line here.
 

6881
02:35:01,439 --> 02:35:02,870
going to put a horizontal line here.
Right, this is our next level. So,

6882
02:35:02,870 --> 02:35:02,880
Right, this is our next level. So,
 

6883
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:04,950
Right, this is our next level. So,
trimming some into here and then down

6884
02:35:04,950 --> 02:35:04,960
trimming some into here and then down
 

6885
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:06,630
trimming some into here and then down
into there for your next spot. We're

6886
02:35:06,630 --> 02:35:06,640
into there for your next spot. We're
 

6887
02:35:06,640 --> 02:35:08,150
into there for your next spot. We're
getting extended here, folks. So, move

6888
02:35:08,150 --> 02:35:08,160
getting extended here, folks. So, move
 

6889
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:10,630
getting extended here, folks. So, move
your stop down. You do not want to let

6890
02:35:10,630 --> 02:35:10,640
your stop down. You do not want to let
 

6891
02:35:10,640 --> 02:35:13,429
your stop down. You do not want to let
this rip all the way back, you know, 70

6892
02:35:13,429 --> 02:35:13,439
this rip all the way back, you know, 70
 

6893
02:35:13,439 --> 02:35:15,670
this rip all the way back, you know, 70
80 points on you, do you? All right. So,

6894
02:35:15,670 --> 02:35:15,680
80 points on you, do you? All right. So,
 

6895
02:35:15,680 --> 02:35:18,630
80 points on you, do you? All right. So,
a break above this shelf here where we

6896
02:35:18,630 --> 02:35:18,640
a break above this shelf here where we
 

6897
02:35:18,640 --> 02:35:21,030
a break above this shelf here where we
get thin above 13, we can see a squeeze

6898
02:35:21,030 --> 02:35:21,040
get thin above 13, we can see a squeeze
 

6899
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:23,349
get thin above 13, we can see a squeeze
back up. So, do not let it do that on

6900
02:35:23,349 --> 02:35:23,359
back up. So, do not let it do that on
 

6901
02:35:23,359 --> 02:35:25,030
back up. So, do not let it do that on
you when you're managing your position,

6902
02:35:25,030 --> 02:35:25,040
you when you're managing your position,

bollocks. All that matters is the
 

6927
02:35:52,479 --> 02:35:55,910
bollocks. All that matters is the
volume. We are leaving track volume.

6928
02:35:55,910 --> 02:35:55,920
volume. We are leaving track volume.
 

6929
02:35:55,920 --> 02:35:57,750

All right. Into the top of the blue box

6930
02:35:57,750 --> 02:35:57,760
All right. Into the top of the blue box
 

6931
02:35:57,760 --> 02:35:59,349
All right. Into the top of the blue box
here. We know this is starting to be

6932
02:35:59,349 --> 02:35:59,359
here. We know this is starting to be
 

6933
02:35:59,359 --> 02:36:01,750
here. We know this is starting to be
quite a key level here. All right. This

6934
02:36:01,750 --> 02:36:01,760
quite a key level here. All right. This
 

6935
02:36:01,760 --> 02:36:05,110
quite a key level here. All right. This
this goes back to a node that we created

6936
02:36:05,110 --> 02:36:05,120
this goes back to a node that we created
 

6937
02:36:05,120 --> 02:36:07,270
this goes back to a node that we created
from the week starting the 15th of

6938
02:36:07,270 --> 02:36:07,280
from the week starting the 15th of
 

6939
02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:09,349
from the week starting the 15th of
December and we can trade down to this

6940
02:36:09,349 --> 02:36:09,359
December and we can trade down to this
 

6941
02:36:09,359 --> 02:36:11,510
December and we can trade down to this
green line. But this is an area we found

6942
02:36:11,510 --> 02:36:11,520
green line. But this is an area we found
 

6943
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:14,230
green line. But this is an area we found
bids on the 15th of December. So you

6944
02:36:14,230 --> 02:36:14,240
bids on the 15th of December. So you
 

6945
02:36:14,240 --> 02:36:36,389
bids on the 15th of December. So you
know how far back I'm currently looking

6946
02:36:36,389 --> 02:36:36,399

 

6947
02:36:36,399 --> 02:36:39,429

Uh there's lots of ways to skin a market

6948
02:36:39,429 --> 02:36:39,439
Uh there's lots of ways to skin a market
 

6949
02:36:39,439 --> 02:36:42,230
Uh there's lots of ways to skin a market
trader on tilt. Uh it's not about the

6950
02:36:42,230 --> 02:36:42,240
trader on tilt. Uh it's not about the
 

6951
02:36:42,240 --> 02:36:43,990
trader on tilt. Uh it's not about the
teachings. It's about saying that you

6952
02:36:43,990 --> 02:36:44,000
teachings. It's about saying that you
 

6953
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:49,349
teachings. It's about saying that you
own it all and that you are the algo.

6954
02:36:49,349 --> 02:36:49,359

 

6955
02:36:49,359 --> 02:36:50,870

You you want to talk about ways to skin

6956
02:36:50,870 --> 02:36:50,880
You you want to talk about ways to skin
 

6957
02:36:50,880 --> 02:36:52,309
You you want to talk about ways to skin
a market. I'll tell you there's a

6958
02:36:52,309 --> 02:36:52,319
a market. I'll tell you there's a
 

6959
02:36:52,319 --> 02:36:55,670
a market. I'll tell you there's a
million ways to trade.

6960
02:36:55,670 --> 02:36:55,680
million ways to trade.
 

6961
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:57,429
million ways to trade.
I'm not the one that thinks it's only my

6962
02:36:57,429 --> 02:36:57,439
I'm not the one that thinks it's only my
 

6963
02:36:57,439 --> 02:36:59,750
I'm not the one that thinks it's only my
way. That would be the gay-head man that

6964
02:36:59,750 --> 02:36:59,760
way. That would be the gay-head man that
 

6965
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:06,630
way. That would be the gay-head man that
you currently look up to. Clearly,

6966
02:37:06,630 --> 02:37:06,640

 

6967
02:37:06,640 --> 02:37:08,550

how old are you? 18, probably. You're

6968
02:37:08,550 --> 02:37:08,560
how old are you? 18, probably. You're
 

6969
02:37:08,560 --> 02:37:10,950
how old are you? 18, probably. You're
probably one or two years into it. I

6970
02:37:10,950 --> 02:37:10,960
probably one or two years into it. I
 

6971
02:37:10,960 --> 02:37:22,710
probably one or two years into it. I
mean, your name's Trader on Tilt.

6972
02:37:22,710 --> 02:37:22,720

 

6973
02:37:22,720 --> 02:37:24,469

Okay, top of the blue box. Starting to

6974
02:37:24,469 --> 02:37:24,479
Okay, top of the blue box. Starting to
 

6975
02:37:24,479 --> 02:37:25,830
Okay, top of the blue box. Starting to
find a bit of a bid here. Like we said,

6976
02:37:25,830 --> 02:37:25,840
find a bit of a bid here. Like we said,
 

6977
02:37:25,840 --> 02:37:33,830
find a bit of a bid here. Like we said,
dates back to the 15th of December.

6978
02:37:33,830 --> 02:37:33,840

 

6979
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:36,790

Might find a bid here. And the trigger

6980
02:37:36,790 --> 02:37:36,800
Might find a bid here. And the trigger
 

6981
02:37:36,800 --> 02:37:38,710
Might find a bid here. And the trigger
back for a squeeze would be above 14s.

6982
02:37:38,710 --> 02:37:38,720
back for a squeeze would be above 14s.
 

6983
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:40,309
back for a squeeze would be above 14s.
Do not take the long squeeze, but back

6984
02:37:40,309 --> 02:37:40,319
Do not take the long squeeze, but back
 

6985
02:37:40,319 --> 02:37:42,070
Do not take the long squeeze, but back
above 14s. There is a squeeze out to

6986
02:37:42,070 --> 02:37:42,080
above 14s. There is a squeeze out to
 

6987
02:37:42,080 --> 02:37:47,590
above 14s. There is a squeeze out to
50s.

6988
02:37:47,590 --> 02:37:47,600

 

6989
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:49,990

Oh my god,

6990
02:37:49,990 --> 02:37:50,000
Oh my god,
 

6991
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:54,710
Oh my god,
dude. You're insufferable.

6992
02:37:54,710 --> 02:37:54,720

 

6993
02:37:54,720 --> 02:38:03,750

Goodbye.

6994
02:38:03,750 --> 02:38:03,760

 

6995
02:38:03,760 --> 02:38:16,950

Okay.

6996
02:38:16,950 --> 02:38:16,960

 

6997
02:38:16,960 --> 02:38:24,230

Any ideas to get back in? No.

6998
02:38:24,230 --> 02:38:24,240

 

6999
02:38:24,240 --> 02:38:26,630

No, we're extended now. We're leaving

7000
02:38:26,630 --> 02:38:26,640
No, we're extended now. We're leaving
 

7001
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:30,309
No, we're extended now. We're leaving
shelves now.

7002
02:38:30,309 --> 02:38:30,319

 

7003
02:38:30,319 --> 02:38:32,070

So, you should be out most of your TP.

7004
02:38:32,070 --> 02:38:32,080
So, you should be out most of your TP.
 

7005
02:38:32,080 --> 02:38:33,750
So, you should be out most of your TP.
The only thing left to do is come down

7006
02:38:33,750 --> 02:38:33,760
The only thing left to do is come down
 

7007
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:35,349
The only thing left to do is come down
here. We're starting to see big, big

7008
02:38:35,349 --> 02:38:35,359
here. We're starting to see big, big
 

7009
02:38:35,359 --> 02:38:36,550
here. We're starting to see big, big
extensions. You're starting to see

7010
02:38:36,550 --> 02:38:36,560
extensions. You're starting to see
 

7011
02:38:36,560 --> 02:38:38,309
extensions. You're starting to see
panic. You're starting to see ES, right?

7012
02:38:38,309 --> 02:38:38,319
panic. You're starting to see ES, right?
 

7013
02:38:38,319 --> 02:38:39,830
panic. You're starting to see ES, right?
ES now trading down towards that

7014
02:38:39,830 --> 02:38:39,840
ES now trading down towards that
 

7015
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:43,110
ES now trading down towards that
previous day, previous week low.

7016
02:38:43,110 --> 02:38:43,120
previous day, previous week low.
 

7017
02:38:43,120 --> 02:38:46,070
previous day, previous week low.
All right. So, we're watching ES into

7018
02:38:46,070 --> 02:38:46,080
All right. So, we're watching ES into
 

7019
02:38:46,080 --> 02:38:48,230
All right. So, we're watching ES into
688675

7020
02:38:48,230 --> 02:38:48,240
688675
 

7021
02:38:48,240 --> 02:38:56,950
688675
and 6878,

7022
02:38:56,950 --> 02:38:56,960

 

7023
02:38:56,960 --> 02:38:59,030

but we're into the key level, right? If

7024
02:38:59,030 --> 02:38:59,040
but we're into the key level, right? If
 

7025
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:00,550
but we're into the key level, right? If
we go back on the daily here, you

7026
02:39:00,550 --> 02:39:00,560
we go back on the daily here, you
 

7027
02:39:00,560 --> 02:39:02,870
we go back on the daily here, you
understand where we are. I can move this

7028
02:39:02,870 --> 02:39:02,880
understand where we are. I can move this
 

7029
02:39:02,880 --> 02:39:06,230
understand where we are. I can move this
down a little bit. One

7030
02:39:06,230 --> 02:39:06,240
down a little bit. One
 

7031
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:09,270
down a little bit. One
here and one

7032
02:39:09,270 --> 02:39:09,280
here and one
 

7033
02:39:09,280 --> 02:39:11,270
here and one
here. Right? This is where we're trading

7034
02:39:11,270 --> 02:39:11,280
here. Right? This is where we're trading
 

7035
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:13,750
here. Right? This is where we're trading
back into this block.

7036
02:39:13,750 --> 02:39:13,760
back into this block.
 

7037
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:15,670
back into this block.
And then the bottom of this blue right

7038
02:39:15,670 --> 02:39:15,680
And then the bottom of this blue right
 

7039
02:39:15,680 --> 02:39:17,429
And then the bottom of this blue right
here.

7040
02:39:17,429 --> 02:39:17,439
here.
 

7041
02:39:17,439 --> 02:39:19,030
here.
And you got to understand like we talked

7042
02:39:19,030 --> 02:39:19,040
And you got to understand like we talked
 

7043
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:21,270
And you got to understand like we talked
about, we are potentially going to leave

7044
02:39:21,270 --> 02:39:21,280
about, we are potentially going to leave
 

7045
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:24,870
about, we are potentially going to leave
all this volume trapped. And if we start

7046
02:39:24,870 --> 02:39:24,880
all this volume trapped. And if we start
 

7047
02:39:24,880 --> 02:39:27,110
all this volume trapped. And if we start
to find acceptance here, we will start

7048
02:39:27,110 --> 02:39:27,120
to find acceptance here, we will start
 

7049
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:31,110
to find acceptance here, we will start
to rotate into some of this.

7050
02:39:31,110 --> 02:39:31,120
to rotate into some of this.
 

7051
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:32,550
to rotate into some of this.
It's what we've been going over for

7052
02:39:32,550 --> 02:39:32,560
It's what we've been going over for
 

7053
02:39:32,560 --> 02:39:34,630
It's what we've been going over for
weeks, right? We've built out so much

7054
02:39:34,630 --> 02:39:34,640
weeks, right? We've built out so much
 

7055
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:37,510
weeks, right? We've built out so much
liquidity dating back to 5th of Jan. So

7056
02:39:37,510 --> 02:39:37,520
liquidity dating back to 5th of Jan. So
 

7057
02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:39,110
liquidity dating back to 5th of Jan. So
much liquidity dating back to the 5th of

7058
02:39:39,110 --> 02:39:39,120
much liquidity dating back to the 5th of
 

7059
02:39:39,120 --> 02:39:45,990
much liquidity dating back to the 5th of
Jan.

7060
02:39:45,990 --> 02:39:46,000

 

7061
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:47,910

You managed to make double your target

7062
02:39:47,910 --> 02:39:47,920
You managed to make double your target
 

7063
02:39:47,920 --> 02:39:51,990
You managed to make double your target
in five minutes. Nice work.

7064
02:39:51,990 --> 02:39:52,000
in five minutes. Nice work.
 

7065
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,389
in five minutes. Nice work.
Yeah, like we said, guys, guys, why does

7066
02:39:54,389 --> 02:39:54,399
Yeah, like we said, guys, guys, why does
 

7067
02:39:54,399 --> 02:39:56,550
Yeah, like we said, guys, guys, why does
everyone bang on about ICT so much? It's

7068
02:39:56,550 --> 02:39:56,560
everyone bang on about ICT so much? It's
 

7069
02:39:56,560 --> 02:39:59,429
everyone bang on about ICT so much? It's
insane. Yes, some of his concepts are

7070
02:39:59,429 --> 02:39:59,439
insane. Yes, some of his concepts are
 

7071
02:39:59,439 --> 02:40:01,270
insane. Yes, some of his concepts are
great. Yes, like I said, some of his

7072
02:40:01,270 --> 02:40:01,280
great. Yes, like I said, some of his
 

7073
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:02,630
great. Yes, like I said, some of his
teachings are really good. They're not

7074
02:40:02,630 --> 02:40:02,640
teachings are really good. They're not
 

7075
02:40:02,640 --> 02:40:04,070
teachings are really good. They're not
always that accurate, but they're really

7076
02:40:04,070 --> 02:40:04,080
always that accurate, but they're really
 

7077
02:40:04,080 --> 02:40:06,230
always that accurate, but they're really
good. But he did not create the

7078
02:40:06,230 --> 02:40:06,240
good. But he did not create the
 

7079
02:40:06,240 --> 02:40:07,750
good. But he did not create the
algorithm. He does not own the stock

7080
02:40:07,750 --> 02:40:07,760
algorithm. He does not own the stock
 

7081
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:09,270
algorithm. He does not own the stock
market. You should not be [\h__\h] on

7082
02:40:09,270 --> 02:40:09,280
market. You should not be [\h__\h] on
 

7083
02:40:09,280 --> 02:40:11,349
market. You should not be [\h__\h] on
volume profile and all this other stuff.

7084
02:40:11,349 --> 02:40:11,359
volume profile and all this other stuff.
 

7085
02:40:11,359 --> 02:40:12,550
volume profile and all this other stuff.
Like I said, if you think you created

7086
02:40:12,550 --> 02:40:12,560
Like I said, if you think you created
 

7087
02:40:12,560 --> 02:40:13,910
Like I said, if you think you created
the stock market, go and sit down with

7088
02:40:13,910 --> 02:40:13,920
the stock market, go and sit down with
 

7089
02:40:13,920 --> 02:40:16,070
the stock market, go and sit down with
Jamie Diamond and I'd like to see him

7090
02:40:16,070 --> 02:40:16,080
Jamie Diamond and I'd like to see him
 

7091
02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:17,510
Jamie Diamond and I'd like to see him
have a chat with him. All right?

7092
02:40:17,510 --> 02:40:17,520
have a chat with him. All right?
 

7093
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:19,990
have a chat with him. All right?
Otherwise, shut the [\h__\h] up talking

7094
02:40:19,990 --> 02:40:20,000
Otherwise, shut the [\h__\h] up talking
 

7095
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,630
Otherwise, shut the [\h__\h] up talking
about a gray old man. Who [\h__\h] cares?

7096
02:40:22,630 --> 02:40:22,640
about a gray old man. Who [\h__\h] cares?
 

7097
02:40:22,640 --> 02:40:25,349
about a gray old man. Who [\h__\h] cares?
Your job is to make money. The end. The

7098
02:40:25,349 --> 02:40:25,359
Your job is to make money. The end. The
 

7099
02:40:25,359 --> 02:40:27,830
Your job is to make money. The end. The
end. I don't care how you make money,

7100
02:40:27,830 --> 02:40:27,840
end. I don't care how you make money,
 

7101
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:30,950
end. I don't care how you make money,
right? The end. The end. That's the end

7102
02:40:30,950 --> 02:40:30,960
right? The end. The end. That's the end
 

7103
02:40:30,960 --> 02:40:34,630
right? The end. The end. That's the end
of it.

7104
02:40:34,630 --> 02:40:34,640

 

7105
02:40:34,640 --> 02:40:37,190

Right. They're not his concepts. [\h__\h]

7106
02:40:37,190 --> 02:40:37,200
Right. They're not his concepts. [\h__\h]
 

7107
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:38,469
Right. They're not his concepts. [\h__\h]
hell. I don't know how many times I can

7108
02:40:38,469 --> 02:40:38,479
hell. I don't know how many times I can
 

7109
02:40:38,479 --> 02:40:40,150
hell. I don't know how many times I can
say this on stream. Why do people want

7110
02:40:40,150 --> 02:40:40,160
say this on stream. Why do people want
 

7111
02:40:40,160 --> 02:40:41,349
say this on stream. Why do people want
to protect this person that they don't

7112
02:40:41,349 --> 02:40:41,359
to protect this person that they don't
 

7113
02:40:41,359 --> 02:40:45,590
to protect this person that they don't
know? It's insane.

7114
02:40:45,590 --> 02:40:45,600

 

7115
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:48,630

Made 146 points. I'm out. I got scared.

7116
02:40:48,630 --> 02:40:48,640
Made 146 points. I'm out. I got scared.
 

7117
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:50,790
Made 146 points. I'm out. I got scared.
I don't blame you. It's It's such a good

7118
02:40:50,790 --> 02:40:50,800
I don't blame you. It's It's such a good
 

7119
02:40:50,800 --> 02:40:53,990
I don't blame you. It's It's such a good
trade. So, what? You're to here.

7120
02:40:53,990 --> 02:40:54,000
trade. So, what? You're to here.
 

7121
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:55,270
trade. So, what? You're to here.
Did you take it from up there? I'm not

7122
02:40:55,270 --> 02:40:55,280
Did you take it from up there? I'm not
 

7123
02:40:55,280 --> 02:40:57,429
Did you take it from up there? I'm not
sure. Maybe you took a re-entry here.

7124
02:40:57,429 --> 02:40:57,439
sure. Maybe you took a re-entry here.
 

7125
02:40:57,439 --> 02:40:58,950
sure. Maybe you took a re-entry here.
But we're into the blue box. It's a good

7126
02:40:58,950 --> 02:40:58,960
But we're into the blue box. It's a good
 

7127
02:40:58,960 --> 02:41:00,389
But we're into the blue box. It's a good
place to start covering now, isn't it?

7128
02:41:00,389 --> 02:41:00,399
place to start covering now, isn't it?
 

7129
02:41:00,399 --> 02:41:01,910
place to start covering now, isn't it?
You don't want to like Look how steep we

7130
02:41:01,910 --> 02:41:01,920
You don't want to like Look how steep we
 

7131
02:41:01,920 --> 02:41:04,389
You don't want to like Look how steep we
are since the snap. Remember we said

7132
02:41:04,389 --> 02:41:04,399
are since the snap. Remember we said
 

7133
02:41:04,399 --> 02:41:05,910
are since the snap. Remember we said
since this snaps since here you should

7134
02:41:05,910 --> 02:41:05,920
since this snaps since here you should
 

7135
02:41:05,920 --> 02:41:07,510
since this snaps since here you should
have wish orders down to the blue box

7136
02:41:07,510 --> 02:41:07,520
have wish orders down to the blue box
 

7137
02:41:07,520 --> 02:41:09,510
have wish orders down to the blue box
because this can happen and they might

7138
02:41:09,510 --> 02:41:09,520
because this can happen and they might
 

7139
02:41:09,520 --> 02:41:11,349
because this can happen and they might
well put in a pivot at some point. All

7140
02:41:11,349 --> 02:41:11,359
well put in a pivot at some point. All
 

7141
02:41:11,359 --> 02:41:13,190
well put in a pivot at some point. All
right, we'd expect some kind of retrace.

7142
02:41:13,190 --> 02:41:13,200
right, we'd expect some kind of retrace.
 

7143
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:14,710
right, we'd expect some kind of retrace.
We don't just trade straight down, do

7144
02:41:14,710 --> 02:41:14,720
We don't just trade straight down, do
 

7145
02:41:14,720 --> 02:41:17,830
We don't just trade straight down, do
we? But some since snapping this, right,

7146
02:41:17,830 --> 02:41:17,840
we? But some since snapping this, right,
 

7147
02:41:17,840 --> 02:41:19,590
we? But some since snapping this, right,
we said there probably be wish orders

7148
02:41:19,590 --> 02:41:19,600
we said there probably be wish orders
 

7149
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:24,550
we said there probably be wish orders
down into the blue box.

7150

7155
02:41:29,840 --> 02:41:31,830
dating back to where we found a bid from
the 17th of December. So if you look at

7156
02:41:31,830 --> 02:41:31,840
the 17th of December. So if you look at
 

7157
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:35,750
the 17th of December. So if you look at
the lows of both November the 25th, all

7158
02:41:35,750 --> 02:41:35,760
the lows of both November the 25th, all

7160
02:41:38,070 --> 02:41:38,080
right, and the 17th of December, those
 

7161
02:41:38,080 --> 02:41:39,990

we're pretty thin here above 80. They
 

7323
02:45:31,760 --> 02:45:33,990
we're pretty thin here above 80. They
might come and test test this 25,000 and

7351
02:46:12,160 --> 02:46:13,510
relief like we've talked about through
here. Probably come up and test this

02:46:13,510 --> 02:46:13,520
here. Probably come up and test this
 

7353
02:46:13,520 --> 02:46:15,990
here. Probably come up and test this
next node and through here. So, this is

7354
02:46:15,990 --> 02:46:16,000
next node and through here. So, this is
 

7355
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:17,670
next node and through here. So, this is
the next area for them to defend. And if

7356
02:46:17,670 --> 02:46:17,680
the next area for them to defend. And if
 

7357
02:46:17,680 --> 02:46:18,950
the next area for them to defend. And if
they don't defend it, we will get

7358
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:18,960
they don't defend it, we will get
 

7359
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:20,950
they don't defend it, we will get
relief. Remember, we've hit main target.

All the way up here now is possible for
 

7363
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:24,469
All the way up here now is possible for
the relief. So, into this node, through

02:46:24,469 --> 02:46:24,479
the relief. So, into this node, through
 

7365
02:46:24,479 --> 02:46:25,830
the relief. So, into this node, through
here all the way possible. Remember, we

7366
02:46:25,830 --> 02:46:25,840
here all the way possible. Remember, we
 

7367
02:46:25,840 --> 02:46:27,590
here all the way possible. Remember, we
went straight down. We can go straight

7368
02:46:27,590 --> 02:46:27,600
went straight down. We can go straight
 

7369
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:28,870
went straight down. We can go straight
back up, which is why I saying be done

7370
02:46:28,870 --> 02:46:28,880
back up, which is why I saying be done
 

7371

with the trade as you come into this
 

7373
02:46:30,319 --> 02:46:34,230
with the trade as you come into this
blue box. And we would imagine all right

7374
02:46:34,230 --> 02:46:34,240
blue box. And we would imagine all right
 

7375
02:46:34,240 --> 02:46:35,670
blue box. And we would imagine all right
they will have to make a decision in

7376
02:46:35,670 --> 02:46:35,680
they will have to make a decision in
 

7377
02:46:35,680 --> 02:46:37,349
they will have to make a decision in
here whether they want to resell this

7378

here whether they want to resell this
 

7379
02:46:37,359 --> 02:46:39,670
here whether they want to resell this
down and find a bid. This may very well

7380
02:46:39,670 --> 02:46:39,680
down and find a bid. This may very well
 

7381
02:46:39,680 --> 02:46:41,349
down and find a bid. This may very well
be the range for the afternoon while

7382
02:46:41,349 --> 02:46:41,359
be the range for the afternoon while
 

7383
02:46:41,359 --> 02:46:43,990
be the range for the afternoon while
they make that decision. Now

7384
02:46:43,990 --> 02:46:44,000
they make that decision. Now
 

7385
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:47,030
they make that decision. Now
um for you guys who trade IB

um for you guys who trade IB
right Scottly Mr. Foster Scott did we

7388
02:46:50,230 --> 02:46:50,240
right Scottly Mr. Foster Scott did we
 

7389
02:46:50,240 --> 02:46:51,830
right Scottly Mr. Foster Scott did we
hit your target? We might well have

7390
02:46:51,830 --> 02:46:51,840
hit your target? We might well have
 

7391
02:46:51,840 --> 02:46:54,950
hit your target? We might well have
done. We did. We did. We hit your

7394
02:46:58,150 --> 02:46:58,160
target. One and a half extension of IB.
 

7395
02:46:58,160 --> 02:46:59,830
target. One and a half extension of IB.
So, lots of reasons to be done with

7396
02:46:59,830 --> 02:46:59,840
So, lots of reasons to be done with
 

7397
02:46:59,840 --> 02:47:03,190
So, lots of reasons to be done with
this. Low hanging fruit gone,

7398
02:47:03,190 --> 02:47:03,200
this. Low hanging fruit gone,
 

7399
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:06,950
this. Low hanging fruit gone,
overextended. Probably saw some sellers

7400
02:47:06,950 --> 02:47:06,960
overextended. Probably saw some sellers
 

7401
02:47:06,960 --> 02:47:09,110
overextended. Probably saw some sellers
trapped at that low now. Yep, there we

7402
02:47:09,110 --> 02:47:09,120
trapped at that low now. Yep, there we
 

7403
02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:10,790
trapped at that low now. Yep, there we
go. So, excess at the low was pretty

7404
02:47:10,790 --> 02:47:10,800
go. So, excess at the low was pretty
 

7405
02:47:10,800 --> 02:47:19,429
go. So, excess at the low was pretty
good. So, I'd say from 47s is the level.

7406
02:47:19,429 --> 02:47:19,439

 

7407
02:47:19,439 --> 02:47:25,990

Yeah, Fabio's awesome, man.

7408
02:47:25,990 --> 02:47:26,000

 

7409
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,230

What is the blue box? this blue box. We

7410
02:47:28,230 --> 02:47:28,240
What is the blue box? this blue box. We
 

7411
02:47:28,240 --> 02:47:32,230
What is the blue box? this blue box. We
just went over it. It's It's an area

7412
02:47:32,230 --> 02:47:32,240
just went over it. It's It's an area
 

7413
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:34,710
just went over it. It's It's an area
where I think we will probably find some

7414
02:47:34,710 --> 02:47:34,720
where I think we will probably find some
 

7415
02:47:34,720 --> 02:47:38,550
where I think we will probably find some
bids. Um, if you just Yeah, I'm just

02:47:42,070 --> 02:47:42,080
Look how many times If I just keep
 

7421
02:47:42,080 --> 02:47:44,790
Look how many times If I just keep
pulling this area along, if it will let

7422
02:47:44,790 --> 02:47:44,800
pulling this area along, if it will let
 

7423
02:47:44,800 --> 02:47:47,750
pulling this area along, if it will let
me

There we go. If we just keep pulling
 

7429
02:47:50,960 --> 02:47:53,990
There we go. If we just keep pulling
this area along. You can see since the

7430
02:47:53,990 --> 02:47:54,000
this area along. You can see since the
 

7431
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,150
this area along. You can see since the
new contract how sticky this area has

7432
02:47:56,150 --> 02:47:56,160
new contract how sticky this area has
 

7433
02:47:56,160 --> 02:47:58,950
new contract how sticky this area has

7467
02:48:35,120 --> 02:48:36,950
really big area. We don't expect markets
to just completely tank in one

7468
02:48:36,950 --> 02:48:36,960
to just completely tank in one
 

7469
02:48:36,960 --> 02:48:39,990
to just completely tank in one
direction, right? The key for this week

7470
02:48:39,990 --> 02:48:40,000
direction, right? The key for this week
 

7471
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,309
direction, right? The key for this week
was there was the failed breakout last

7472
02:48:42,309 --> 02:48:42,319
was there was the failed breakout last
 

7473
02:48:42,319 --> 02:48:45,750
was there was the failed breakout last
week. We left volume trapped up there.

7474
02:48:45,750 --> 02:48:45,760
week. We left volume trapped up there.
 

7475
02:48:45,760 --> 02:48:47,429
week. We left volume trapped up there.
All right, so now we've got two sets of

7476
02:48:47,429 --> 02:48:47,439
All right, so now we've got two sets of
 

7477
02:48:47,439 --> 02:48:49,110
All right, so now we've got two sets of
volume trapped. We had the all-time high

7478
02:48:49,110 --> 02:48:49,120
volume trapped. We had the all-time high
 

7479
02:48:49,120 --> 02:48:51,030
volume trapped. We had the all-time high
volume trapped here. We left volume

7480
02:48:51,030 --> 02:48:51,040
volume trapped here. We left volume
 

7481
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:53,349
volume trapped here. We left volume
trapped up here. We rotated in this

7482
02:48:53,349 --> 02:48:53,359
trapped up here. We rotated in this
 

7483
02:48:53,359 --> 02:48:54,950
trapped up here. We rotated in this
range, which was gross. All I wanted to

7484
02:48:54,950 --> 02:48:54,960
range, which was gross. All I wanted to
 

7485
02:48:54,960 --> 02:48:56,550
range, which was gross. All I wanted to
do is leave this range. Today was the

7486
02:48:56,550 --> 02:48:56,560
do is leave this range. Today was the
 

7487
02:48:56,560 --> 02:48:57,750
do is leave this range. Today was the
first attempt to leave the range

7488
02:48:57,750 --> 02:48:57,760
first attempt to leave the range
 

7489
02:48:57,760 --> 02:48:59,349
first attempt to leave the range
properly. We're starting to do it. We

7490
02:48:59,349 --> 02:48:59,359
properly. We're starting to do it. We
 

7491
02:48:59,359 --> 02:49:01,030
properly. We're starting to do it. We
might well find a bid there for a day or

7492
02:49:01,030 --> 02:49:01,040
might well find a bid there for a day or
 

7493
02:49:01,040 --> 02:49:02,469
might well find a bid there for a day or
two, session or two, maybe even a week

7494
02:49:02,469 --> 02:49:02,479
two, session or two, maybe even a week
 

7495
02:49:02,479 --> 02:49:04,950
two, session or two, maybe even a week
or two before we look for this kind of

7496
02:49:04,950 --> 02:49:04,960
or two before we look for this kind of
 

7497
02:49:04,960 --> 02:49:07,110
or two before we look for this kind of
move down here and below. If we want to

7498
02:49:07,110 --> 02:49:07,120
move down here and below. If we want to
 

7499
02:49:07,120 --> 02:49:08,230
move down here and below. If we want to
think about what that's going to look

7500
02:49:08,230 --> 02:49:08,240
think about what that's going to look
 

7501
02:49:08,240 --> 02:49:10,150
think about what that's going to look
like on a daily, uh those of you who

7502
02:49:10,150 --> 02:49:10,160
like on a daily, uh those of you who
 

7503
02:49:10,160 --> 02:49:11,429
like on a daily, uh those of you who
have been here for a number of weeks

7504
02:49:11,429 --> 02:49:11,439
have been here for a number of weeks
 

7505
02:49:11,439 --> 02:49:12,950
have been here for a number of weeks
will know that we've been thinking about

7506
02:49:12,950 --> 02:49:12,960
will know that we've been thinking about
 

7507
02:49:12,960 --> 02:49:14,870
will know that we've been thinking about
this move on the daily for a while,

7508
02:49:14,870 --> 02:49:14,880
this move on the daily for a while,
 

7509
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:17,190
this move on the daily for a while,
right? We have a big volume shelf right

7510
02:49:17,190 --> 02:49:17,200
right? We have a big volume shelf right
 

7511
02:49:17,200 --> 02:49:19,110
right? We have a big volume shelf right
here which we're trading right into.

7512
02:49:19,110 --> 02:49:19,120
here which we're trading right into.
 

7513
02:49:19,120 --> 02:49:20,309
here which we're trading right into.
We're already starting to leave this

7514
02:49:20,309 --> 02:49:20,319
We're already starting to leave this
 

7515
02:49:20,319 --> 02:49:22,070
We're already starting to leave this
one. This is anchored from the high.

7516
02:49:22,070 --> 02:49:22,080
one. This is anchored from the high.
 

7517
02:49:22,080 --> 02:49:23,750
one. This is anchored from the high.
This is your whole year. All right. So,

7518
02:49:23,750 --> 02:49:23,760
This is your whole year. All right. So,
 

7519
02:49:23,760 --> 02:49:26,550
This is your whole year. All right. So,
this is 12 months. This is anchored from

7520
02:49:26,550 --> 02:49:26,560
this is 12 months. This is anchored from
 

7521
02:49:26,560 --> 02:49:28,550
this is 12 months. This is anchored from
the all-time high. We are starting to

7522
02:49:28,550 --> 02:49:28,560
the all-time high. We are starting to
 

7523
02:49:28,560 --> 02:49:30,790
the all-time high. We are starting to
leave this. If we start to leave this,

7524
02:49:30,790 --> 02:49:30,800
leave this. If we start to leave this,
 

7525
02:49:30,800 --> 02:49:33,030
leave this. If we start to leave this,
we will start to attack this stop here

7526
02:49:33,030 --> 02:49:33,040
we will start to attack this stop here
 

7527
02:49:33,040 --> 02:49:36,950
we will start to attack this stop here
and the 200 day SMA. Yes, I use SMAs in

7528
02:49:36,950 --> 02:49:36,960
and the 200 day SMA. Yes, I use SMAs in
 

7529
02:49:36,960 --> 02:49:39,750
and the 200 day SMA. Yes, I use SMAs in
EMAs also do. They're very important.

7530
02:49:39,750 --> 02:49:39,760
EMAs also do. They're very important.
 

7531
02:49:39,760 --> 02:49:41,990
EMAs also do. They're very important.
This is our yearly average. If we start

7532
02:49:41,990 --> 02:49:42,000
This is our yearly average. If we start
 

7533
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,790
This is our yearly average. If we start
to lose that, you know, if we start to

7534
02:49:44,790 --> 02:49:44,800
to lose that, you know, if we start to
 

7535
02:49:44,800 --> 02:49:47,030
to lose that, you know, if we start to
open up these Ballingers and trend down

7536
02:49:47,030 --> 02:49:47,040
open up these Ballingers and trend down
 

7537
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:48,870
open up these Ballingers and trend down
and get stuck underneath that, then

7538
02:49:48,870 --> 02:49:48,880
and get stuck underneath that, then
 

7539
02:49:48,880 --> 02:49:51,190
and get stuck underneath that, then
maybe we go risk off into some of this.

7540
02:49:51,190 --> 02:49:51,200
maybe we go risk off into some of this.
 

7541
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:53,830
maybe we go risk off into some of this.
We will see. We will see. But right now,

7542
02:49:53,830 --> 02:49:53,840
We will see. We will see. But right now,
 

7543
02:49:53,840 --> 02:49:55,429
We will see. We will see. But right now,
the main thing is probably thinking

7544
02:49:55,429 --> 02:49:55,439
the main thing is probably thinking
 

7545
02:49:55,439 --> 02:49:57,910
the main thing is probably thinking
about a pullback based on the tariff

7546
02:49:57,910 --> 02:49:57,920
about a pullback based on the tariff
 

7547
02:49:57,920 --> 02:49:59,510
about a pullback based on the tariff
pivot.

7548
02:49:59,510 --> 02:49:59,520
pivot.
 

7549
02:49:59,520 --> 02:50:01,110
pivot.
We can afford to come very very deep

7550
02:50:01,110 --> 02:50:01,120
We can afford to come very very deep
 

7551
02:50:01,120 --> 02:50:02,950
We can afford to come very very deep
here. Like even here is only a 30%

7552
02:50:02,950 --> 02:50:02,960
here. Like even here is only a 30%
 

7553
02:50:02,960 --> 02:50:05,910
here. Like even here is only a 30%
pullback, folks. This can still be a

7554
02:50:05,910 --> 02:50:05,920
pullback, folks. This can still be a
 

7555
02:50:05,920 --> 02:50:08,950
pullback, folks. This can still be a
very bullish pullback longterm unless

7556
02:50:08,950 --> 02:50:08,960
very bullish pullback longterm unless
 

7557
02:50:08,960 --> 02:50:10,950
very bullish pullback longterm unless
we're going to come to 50 and below. So,

7558
02:50:10,950 --> 02:50:10,960
we're going to come to 50 and below. So,
 

7559
02:50:10,960 --> 02:50:12,550
we're going to come to 50 and below. So,
lots of opportunities here in the market

7560
02:50:12,550 --> 02:50:12,560
lots of opportunities here in the market
 

7561
02:50:12,560 --> 02:50:14,630
lots of opportunities here in the market
this year for swing positions. Lots of

7562
02:50:14,630 --> 02:50:14,640
this year for swing positions. Lots of
 

7563
02:50:14,640 --> 02:50:17,590
this year for swing positions. Lots of
opportunities for swing positions.

7564
02:50:17,590 --> 02:50:17,600
opportunities for swing positions.
 

7565
02:50:17,600 --> 02:50:19,510
opportunities for swing positions.
The deeper we go, the better. All right.

7566
02:50:19,510 --> 02:50:19,520
The deeper we go, the better. All right.
 

7567
02:50:19,520 --> 02:50:21,429
The deeper we go, the better. All right.
So, through here now, probably up to the

7568
02:50:21,429 --> 02:50:21,439
So, through here now, probably up to the
 

7569
02:50:21,439 --> 02:50:22,950
So, through here now, probably up to the
next gray box, right? Squeeze. So, be

7570
02:50:22,950 --> 02:50:22,960
next gray box, right? Squeeze. So, be
 

7571
02:50:22,960 --> 02:50:39,030
next gray box, right? Squeeze. So, be
done with it. I would be done with it.

7572
02:50:39,030 --> 02:50:39,040

right they're going to need to protect

best short opportunities were up here,
 

7713

daily Ballinger band. All right, it
 

7725
02:53:45,040 --> 02:53:46,469
daily Ballinger band. All right, it
doesn't mean we can't trade lower, but

7726
02:53:46,469 --> 02:53:46,479
doesn't mean we can't trade lower, but
 

7727
02:53:46,479 --> 02:53:48,309
doesn't mean we can't trade lower, but
if you are entering new short positions

7728

02:53:50,319 --> 02:53:51,830
underneath this, you are asking for
problems. Do I think we could have a

7732
02:53:51,830 --> 02:53:51,840
problems. Do I think we could have a
 

7733
02:53:51,840 --> 02:53:53,429
problems. Do I think we could have a
black swan kind of event? I do. I

black swan kind of event? I do. I

black swan kind of event? I do. I
already think we're starting to see such

already think we're starting to see such
 

7737
02:53:54,720 --> 02:53:57,590
already think we're starting to see such
big divergence between all of these, but

7738
02:53:57,590 --> 02:53:57,600
big divergence between all of these, but
 

7739
02:53:57,600 --> 02:53:59,910
big divergence between all of these, but
be careful. Remember, we've got is it

02:54:37,439 --> 02:54:44,230

So, I think we go to 25,080 now. 25,080.

7768
02:54:44,230 --> 02:54:44,240

 

7769
02:54:44,240 --> 02:54:47,750

I mean, we have an old gap fill.

7770
02:54:47,750 --> 02:54:47,760
I mean, we have an old gap fill.
 

7771
02:54:47,760 --> 02:54:55,269
I mean, we have an old gap fill.
Oh, you mean to go upside 25,080?

7772
02:54:55,269 --> 02:54:55,279

 

7773
02:54:55,279 --> 02:54:57,269

Yeah, this box. Yeah, it I mean it's

7774
02:54:57,269 --> 02:54:57,279
Yeah, this box. Yeah, it I mean it's
 

7775
02:54:57,279 --> 02:55:00,389
Yeah, this box. Yeah, it I mean it's
trying to it's trying to retest this,

7776
02:55:00,389 --> 02:55:00,399
trying to it's trying to retest this,
 

7777
02:55:00,399 --> 02:55:03,349
trying to it's trying to retest this,
right? So, we went from here to here.

7778
02:55:03,349 --> 02:55:03,359
right? So, we went from here to here.
 

7779
02:55:03,359 --> 02:55:05,590
right? So, we went from here to here.
They now bid above this. They should

7780
02:55:05,590 --> 02:55:05,600
They now bid above this. They should
 

7781
02:55:05,600 --> 02:55:07,670
They now bid above this. They should
build liquidity here. If they go above

7782
02:55:07,670 --> 02:55:07,680
build liquidity here. If they go above
 

7783
02:55:07,680 --> 02:55:09,269
build liquidity here. If they go above
this, we go to the next node. If they

7784
02:55:09,269 --> 02:55:09,279
this, we go to the next node. If they
 

7785
02:55:09,279 --> 02:55:10,870
this, we go to the next node. If they
reject this, we trade back down to this.

7786
02:55:10,870 --> 02:55:10,880
reject this, we trade back down to this.
 

7787
02:55:10,880 --> 02:55:12,309
reject this, we trade back down to this.
If they find acceptance lower, we trade

7788
02:55:12,309 --> 02:55:12,319
If they find acceptance lower, we trade
 

7789
02:55:12,319 --> 02:55:13,830
If they find acceptance lower, we trade
back down to this. It's always block to

7790
02:55:13,830 --> 02:55:13,840
back down to this. It's always block to
 

7791

Right.

7808
02:55:37,269 --> 02:55:37,279

 

7809
02:55:37,279 --> 02:55:39,429

We don't trade in like one straight

7810
02:55:39,429 --> 02:55:39,439
We don't trade in like one straight
 

7811
02:55:39,439 --> 02:55:44,710
We don't trade in like one straight
line. It's not how we trade.

7812
02:55:44,710 --> 02:55:44,720

 

7813
02:55:44,720 --> 02:55:46,630

7816
02:55:57,830 --> 02:55:57,840

 

7817
02:55:57,840 --> 02:56:01,110

When I'm hitting first TP and closing my

02:56:01,110 --> 02:56:01,120
When I'm hitting first TP and closing my
 

7819
02:56:01,120 --> 02:56:03,110
When I'm hitting first TP and closing my
follower trades fully, I can't figure

02:56:03,110 --> 02:56:03,120
follower trades fully, I can't figure
 

7821
02:56:03,120 --> 02:56:05,510
follower trades fully, I can't figure
out what it's doing. I have mode set to

7822
02:56:05,510 --> 02:56:05,520
out what it's doing. I have mode set to
 

7823
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:08,150
out what it's doing. I have mode set to
the same ATM strategy.

7824
02:56:08,150 --> 02:56:08,160
the same ATM strategy.
 

7825
02:56:08,160 --> 02:56:11,429

7831
02:56:17,760 --> 02:56:20,469
So I can understand fully.
Would I be looking for a short here now?

7832
02:56:20,469 --> 02:56:20,479
Would I be looking for a short here now?
 

7833
02:56:20,479 --> 02:56:22,469
Would I be looking for a short here now?
For me, no. For me now, we're too far

7834
02:56:22,469 --> 02:56:22,479
For me, no. For me now, we're too far
 

7835
02:56:22,479 --> 02:56:25,110
For me, no. For me now, we're too far
into discount. All right. There is a

7836
02:56:25,110 --> 02:56:25,120
into discount. All right. There is a
 

7837
02:56:25,120 --> 02:56:26,630
into discount. All right. There is a
last target left, but remember we've

7838
02:56:26,630 --> 02:56:26,640
last target left, but remember we've
 

7839
02:56:26,640 --> 02:56:29,190
last target left, but remember we've
we've washed out so much, guys. We've

7840
02:56:29,190 --> 02:56:29,200
we've washed out so much, guys. We've
 

7841
02:56:29,200 --> 02:56:31,830
we've washed out so much, guys. We've
we've taken out so many key levels. Um

7842
02:56:31,830 --> 02:56:31,840
we've taken out so many key levels. Um
 

7843
02:56:31,840 --> 02:56:35,910
we've taken out so many key levels. Um
we can afford for a little repric. Um

7844
02:56:35,910 --> 02:56:35,920
we can afford for a little repric. Um
 

7845
02:56:35,920 --> 02:56:38,950
we can afford for a little repric. Um
if if they build in my mind if they

7846
02:56:38,950 --> 02:56:38,960
if if they build in my mind if they
 

7847
02:56:38,960 --> 02:56:41,429
if if they build in my mind if they
build sufficient liquidity out here and

7848
02:56:41,429 --> 02:56:41,439
build sufficient liquidity out here and
 

7849
02:56:41,439 --> 02:56:43,750
build sufficient liquidity out here and
then you know come and swipe these and

7850
02:56:43,750 --> 02:56:43,760
then you know come and swipe these and
 

7851
02:56:43,760 --> 02:56:45,349
then you know come and swipe these and
come back under maybe there's a short

7852
02:56:45,349 --> 02:56:45,359
come back under maybe there's a short
 

7853
02:56:45,359 --> 02:56:47,030
come back under maybe there's a short
back down but you have to ask yourself

7854
02:56:47,030 --> 02:56:47,040
back down but you have to ask yourself
 

7855
02:56:47,040 --> 02:56:48,870
back down but you have to ask yourself
like is it worth it? If we were short

7856
02:56:48,870 --> 02:56:48,880
like is it worth it? If we were short
 

7857
02:56:48,880 --> 02:56:51,910
like is it worth it? If we were short
here, short here and short here, do we

7858
02:56:51,910 --> 02:56:51,920
here, short here and short here, do we
 

7859
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:54,550
here, short here and short here, do we
need one more or have we made enough

7860
02:56:54,550 --> 02:56:54,560
need one more or have we made enough
 

7861
02:56:54,560 --> 02:56:56,790
need one more or have we made enough
money for the day and we come back

7862
02:56:56,790 --> 02:56:56,800
money for the day and we come back
 

7863
02:56:56,800 --> 02:56:59,990
money for the day and we come back
tomorrow and trade again?

7864
02:56:59,990 --> 02:57:00,000
tomorrow and trade again?
 

7865
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,550
tomorrow and trade again?
That's what I would ask myself.

7866
02:57:02,550 --> 02:57:02,560
That's what I would ask myself.
 

7867
02:57:02,560 --> 02:57:05,349
That's what I would ask myself.
I certainly wouldn't be getting long

7868
02:57:05,349 --> 02:57:05,359
I certainly wouldn't be getting long
 

7869
02:57:05,359 --> 02:57:07,269
I certainly wouldn't be getting long
personally.

7870
02:57:07,269 --> 02:57:07,279
personally.
 

7871
02:57:07,279 --> 02:57:08,870
personally.
I think there's panic in the market a

7872
02:57:08,870 --> 02:57:08,880
I think there's panic in the market a
 

7873
02:57:08,880 --> 02:57:13,190
I think there's panic in the market a
little bit.

7874
02:57:13,190 --> 02:57:13,200

 

7875
02:57:13,200 --> 02:57:16,230

How high up might it reclaim or chop?

7876
02:57:16,230 --> 02:57:16,240
How high up might it reclaim or chop?
 

7877
02:57:16,240 --> 02:57:19,269
How high up might it reclaim or chop?
Only 1.64% red day two. Might just be

7878
02:57:19,269 --> 02:57:19,279
Only 1.64% red day two. Might just be
 

7879
02:57:19,279 --> 02:57:21,429
Only 1.64% red day two. Might just be
another October November pullback event.

7880
02:57:21,429 --> 02:57:21,439
another October November pullback event.
 

7881
02:57:21,439 --> 02:57:23,190
another October November pullback event.
Uh

7882
02:57:23,190 --> 02:57:23,200
Uh
 

7883
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:25,269
Uh
it might be, but I think you're likely

7884
02:57:25,269 --> 02:57:25,279
it might be, but I think you're likely
 

7885
02:57:25,279 --> 02:57:27,110
it might be, but I think you're likely
to see like I talked about on the hourly

7886
02:57:27,110 --> 02:57:27,120
to see like I talked about on the hourly
 

7887
02:57:27,120 --> 02:57:31,590
to see like I talked about on the hourly
and daily, we're starting to be very

7888
02:57:31,590 --> 02:57:31,600
and daily, we're starting to be very
 

7889
02:57:31,600 --> 02:57:33,830
and daily, we're starting to be very
dangerous. I mean, if you The difference

7890
02:57:33,830 --> 02:57:33,840
dangerous. I mean, if you The difference
 

7891
02:57:33,840 --> 02:57:37,590
dangerous. I mean, if you The difference
was the pullback in December,

7892
02:57:37,590 --> 02:57:37,600
was the pullback in December,
 

7893
02:57:37,600 --> 02:57:39,349
was the pullback in December,
uh we didn't have all the liquidity

7894
02:57:39,349 --> 02:57:39,359
uh we didn't have all the liquidity
 

7895
02:57:39,359 --> 02:57:41,910
uh we didn't have all the liquidity
built out, right? We've now got all the

7896
02:57:41,910 --> 02:57:41,920
built out, right? We've now got all the
 

7897
02:57:41,920 --> 02:57:44,950
built out, right? We've now got all the
liquidity from 19th,

7898
02:57:44,950 --> 02:57:44,960
liquidity from 19th,
 

7899
02:57:44,960 --> 02:57:46,630
liquidity from 19th,
19th of December. We've got like two

7900
02:57:46,630 --> 02:57:46,640
19th of December. We've got like two
 

7901
02:57:46,640 --> 02:57:48,230
19th of December. We've got like two
months worth of liquidity built out that

7902
02:57:48,230 --> 02:57:48,240
months worth of liquidity built out that
 

7903
02:57:48,240 --> 02:57:56,950
months worth of liquidity built out that
we can wreck, maybe even more.

7904
02:57:56,950 --> 02:57:56,960

 

7905
02:57:56,960 --> 02:57:58,870

What's the indicator? Blue white profile

7906
02:57:58,870 --> 02:57:58,880
What's the indicator? Blue white profile
 

7907
02:57:58,880 --> 02:58:01,590
What's the indicator? Blue white profile
at the right hand side. This anchored

7908
02:58:01,590 --> 02:58:01,600
at the right hand side. This anchored
 

7909
02:58:01,600 --> 02:58:02,950
at the right hand side. This anchored
volume profile. It's not an indicator.

7910
02:58:02,950 --> 02:58:02,960
volume profile. It's not an indicator.
 

7911
02:58:02,960 --> 02:58:04,630
volume profile. It's not an indicator.
It's a drawing tool. It's just a drawing

7912
02:58:04,630 --> 02:58:04,640
It's a drawing tool. It's just a drawing
 

7913

02:58:17,040 --> 02:58:19,670
know. I haven't I haven't looked at the
options data, but

7920
02:58:19,670 --> 02:58:19,680
options data, but
 

7921
02:58:19,680 --> 02:58:21,830
options data, but
I I wouldn't be buying calls today

7922
02:58:21,830 --> 02:58:21,840
I I wouldn't be buying calls today
 

7923
02:58:21,840 --> 02:58:24,469
I I wouldn't be buying calls today
personally. But also, when you're saying

7924
02:58:24,469 --> 02:58:24,479
personally. But also, when you're saying
 

7925
02:58:24,479 --> 02:58:25,750
personally. But also, when you're saying
something like that, you have to

7926
02:58:25,750 --> 02:58:25,760
something like that, you have to
 

7927
02:58:25,760 --> 02:58:27,110
something like that, you have to
understand I don't understand what

7928
02:58:27,110 --> 02:58:27,120
understand I don't understand what
 

7929
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:27,990
understand I don't understand what
you're looking at. Are you looking at

7930
02:58:27,990 --> 02:58:28,000
you're looking at. Are you looking at
 

7931
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:29,190
you're looking at. Are you looking at
for a swing position? Are you looking

7932
02:58:29,190 --> 02:58:29,200
for a swing position? Are you looking
 

7933
02:58:29,200 --> 02:58:33,670
for a swing position? Are you looking
for a scalp position?

7934
02:58:33,670 --> 02:58:33,680

 

7935
02:58:33,680 --> 02:58:35,190

How do you do your stops? That's my

7936
02:58:35,190 --> 02:58:35,200
How do you do your stops? That's my
 

7937
02:58:35,200 --> 02:58:37,190
How do you do your stops? That's my
biggest problem. 90% right, but always

7938
02:58:37,190 --> 02:58:37,200
biggest problem. 90% right, but always
 

7939
02:58:37,200 --> 02:58:41,190
biggest problem. 90% right, but always
get stopped out. Use use volume or

7940
02:58:41,190 --> 02:58:41,200
get stopped out. Use use volume or
 

7941
02:58:41,200 --> 02:58:44,150
get stopped out. Use use volume or
structure to protect you. So if you were

7942
02:58:44,150 --> 02:58:44,160
structure to protect you. So if you were
 

7943
02:58:44,160 --> 02:58:46,550
structure to protect you. So if you were
getting short in here, you don't want it

7944
02:58:46,550 --> 02:58:46,560
getting short in here, you don't want it
 

7945
02:58:46,560 --> 02:58:48,389
getting short in here, you don't want it
to reclaim this. So your stop would have

7946
02:58:48,389 --> 02:58:48,399
to reclaim this. So your stop would have
 

7947
02:58:48,399 --> 02:58:49,830
to reclaim this. So your stop would have
to be the other side. If you were short

7948
02:58:49,830 --> 02:58:49,840
to be the other side. If you were short
 

7949
02:58:49,840 --> 02:58:52,150
to be the other side. If you were short
versus this, your stop would need to be

7950
02:58:52,150 --> 02:58:52,160
versus this, your stop would need to be
 

7951
02:58:52,160 --> 02:58:53,750
versus this, your stop would need to be
I mean that's actually quite ugly. You

7952
02:58:53,750 --> 02:58:53,760
I mean that's actually quite ugly. You
 

7953
02:58:53,760 --> 02:58:55,030
I mean that's actually quite ugly. You
would probably got stopped out. But

7954
02:58:55,030 --> 02:58:55,040
would probably got stopped out. But
 

7955
02:58:55,040 --> 02:58:56,469
would probably got stopped out. But
let's say you're short versus this, I'd

7956
02:58:56,469 --> 02:58:56,479
let's say you're short versus this, I'd
 

7957
02:58:56,479 --> 02:58:58,389
let's say you're short versus this, I'd
put your stop the other side. If you

7958
02:58:58,389 --> 02:58:58,399
put your stop the other side. If you
 

7959
02:58:58,399 --> 02:58:59,750
put your stop the other side. If you
were short versus here, you'd put your

7960
02:58:59,750 --> 02:58:59,760
were short versus here, you'd put your
 

7961
02:58:59,760 --> 02:59:01,110
were short versus here, you'd put your
stop at that swing high, which it

7962
02:59:01,110 --> 02:59:01,120
stop at that swing high, which it
 

7963
02:59:01,120 --> 02:59:02,870
stop at that swing high, which it
protected. All right. Your stop should

7964
02:59:02,870 --> 02:59:02,880
protected. All right. Your stop should
 

7965
02:59:02,880 --> 02:59:05,590
protected. All right. Your stop should
be where the trade is no longer valid.

7966
02:59:05,590 --> 02:59:05,600
be where the trade is no longer valid.
 

7967
02:59:05,600 --> 02:59:07,349
be where the trade is no longer valid.
All right. So if if for some reason

7968
02:59:07,349 --> 02:59:07,359
All right. So if if for some reason
 

7969
02:59:07,359 --> 02:59:09,590
All right. So if if for some reason
you've bought this, all right, your stop

7970
02:59:09,590 --> 02:59:09,600
you've bought this, all right, your stop
 

7971
02:59:09,600 --> 02:59:10,870
you've bought this, all right, your stop
would have to be at that low, wouldn't

7972
02:59:10,870 --> 02:59:10,880
would have to be at that low, wouldn't
 

7973
02:59:10,880 --> 02:59:15,110
would have to be at that low, wouldn't
it?

7974
02:59:15,110 --> 02:59:15,120

 

7975
02:59:15,120 --> 02:59:16,630

If you don't put your stock where it's

7976
02:59:16,630 --> 02:59:16,640
If you don't put your stock where it's
 

7977
02:59:16,640 --> 02:59:18,309
If you don't put your stock where it's
no longer valid, if you're just doing it

7978
02:59:18,309 --> 02:59:18,319
no longer valid, if you're just doing it
 

7979
02:59:18,319 --> 02:59:21,750
no longer valid, if you're just doing it
based on a number that you like or or a

7980
02:59:21,750 --> 02:59:21,760
based on a number that you like or or a
 

7981
02:59:21,760 --> 02:59:23,510
based on a number that you like or or a
profit amount, you will get stopped out

7982
02:59:23,510 --> 02:59:23,520
profit amount, you will get stopped out
 

7983
02:59:23,520 --> 02:59:24,870
profit amount, you will get stopped out
all the time. The market doesn't care

7984
02:59:24,870 --> 02:59:24,880
all the time. The market doesn't care
 

7985
02:59:24,880 --> 02:59:26,070
all the time. The market doesn't care
about how much money you're going to

7986
02:59:26,070 --> 02:59:26,080
about how much money you're going to
 

7987
02:59:26,080 --> 02:59:28,230
about how much money you're going to
make or lose. It cares about what's in

7988
02:59:28,230 --> 02:59:28,240
make or lose. It cares about what's in
 

7989
02:59:28,240 --> 02:59:34,309
make or lose. It cares about what's in
front of you.

7990
02:59:34,309 --> 02:59:34,319

 

7991
02:59:34,319 --> 02:59:35,990

You still have week low signals. I mean,

7992
02:59:35,990 --> 02:59:36,000
You still have week low signals. I mean,
 

7993
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:39,670
You still have week low signals. I mean,
yeah, it might be like ES did just miss

7994
02:59:39,670 --> 02:59:39,680
yeah, it might be like ES did just miss
 

7995
02:59:39,680 --> 02:59:42,630
yeah, it might be like ES did just miss
the low. Look, it still hasn't taken it.

7996
02:59:42,630 --> 02:59:42,640
the low. Look, it still hasn't taken it.
 

7997
02:59:42,640 --> 02:59:44,550
the low. Look, it still hasn't taken it.
It still has not taken these loads.

7998
02:59:44,550 --> 02:59:44,560
It still has not taken these loads.
 

7999
02:59:44,560 --> 02:59:46,550
It still has not taken these loads.
Remember, we've taken all these out. It

8000
02:59:46,550 --> 02:59:46,560
Remember, we've taken all these out. It
 

8001
02:59:46,560 --> 02:59:48,230
Remember, we've taken all these out. It
found a bid in front. It's come back to

8002
02:59:48,230 --> 02:59:48,240
found a bid in front. It's come back to
 

8003
02:59:48,240 --> 02:59:49,910
found a bid in front. It's come back to
IB.

8004
02:59:49,910 --> 02:59:49,920
IB.
 

8005
02:59:49,920 --> 02:59:52,870
IB.
All right, we know this is a big level.

8006
02:59:52,870 --> 02:59:52,880
All right, we know this is a big level.
 

8007
02:59:52,880 --> 02:59:54,630
All right, we know this is a big level.
It's come back to IB. All right, if they

8008
02:59:54,630 --> 02:59:54,640
It's come back to IB. All right, if they
 

8009
02:59:54,640 --> 02:59:56,870
It's come back to IB. All right, if they
can snap this, market will get weak. But

8010
02:59:56,870 --> 02:59:56,880
can snap this, market will get weak. But
 

8011
02:59:56,880 --> 02:59:58,070
can snap this, market will get weak. But
you want to be careful. Think about

8012
02:59:58,070 --> 02:59:58,080
you want to be careful. Think about
 

8013
02:59:58,080 --> 02:59:59,670
you want to be careful. Think about
where we built all this liquidity. This

8014
02:59:59,670 --> 02:59:59,680
where we built all this liquidity. This
 

8015
02:59:59,680 --> 03:00:02,070
where we built all this liquidity. This
is the liquidity build, right? We

8016
03:00:02,070 --> 03:00:02,080
is the liquidity build, right? We
 

8017
03:00:02,080 --> 03:00:04,230
is the liquidity build, right? We
finally broke down. We're revisiting

8018
03:00:04,230 --> 03:00:04,240
finally broke down. We're revisiting
 

8019
03:00:04,240 --> 03:00:06,550
finally broke down. We're revisiting
that. You want that to reject and come

8020
03:00:06,550 --> 03:00:06,560
that. You want that to reject and come
 

8021
03:00:06,560 --> 03:00:08,309
that. You want that to reject and come
back down. And if they reclaim this,

8022
03:00:08,309 --> 03:00:08,319
back down. And if they reclaim this,
 

8023
03:00:08,319 --> 03:00:10,630
back down. And if they reclaim this,
they can come and hunt stops. Like I

8024
03:00:10,630 --> 03:00:10,640
they can come and hunt stops. Like I
 

8025
03:00:10,640 --> 03:00:12,389
they can come and hunt stops. Like I
said, I wouldn't be long biased today

8026
03:00:12,389 --> 03:00:12,399
said, I wouldn't be long biased today
 

8027
03:00:12,399 --> 03:00:14,630
said, I wouldn't be long biased today
personally.

8028
03:00:14,630 --> 03:00:14,640
personally.
 

8029
03:00:14,640 --> 03:00:17,190
personally.
Doesn't make sense to me.

8030
03:00:17,190 --> 03:00:17,200
Doesn't make sense to me.
 

8031
03:00:17,200 --> 03:00:19,990
Doesn't make sense to me.
About to get out of here, folks. Last

8032
03:00:19,990 --> 03:00:20,000
About to get out of here, folks. Last
 

8033
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:28,389
About to get out of here, folks. Last
few questions.

8034
03:00:28,389 --> 03:00:28,399

 

8035
03:00:28,399 --> 03:00:29,750

Orderflow question. If you're looking

8036
03:00:29,750 --> 03:00:29,760
Orderflow question. If you're looking
 

8037
03:00:29,760 --> 03:00:31,750
Orderflow question. If you're looking
for a long and buyers get trapped near

8038
03:00:31,750 --> 03:00:31,760
for a long and buyers get trapped near
 

8039
03:00:31,760 --> 03:00:33,750
for a long and buyers get trapped near
highs and then get out as the market

8040
03:00:33,750 --> 03:00:33,760
highs and then get out as the market
 

8041
03:00:33,760 --> 03:00:35,429
highs and then get out as the market
trades through the upside, is that a

8042
03:00:35,429 --> 03:00:35,439
trades through the upside, is that a
 

8043
03:00:35,439 --> 03:00:37,510
trades through the upside, is that a
viable entry?

8044
03:00:37,510 --> 03:00:37,520
viable entry?
 

8045
03:00:37,520 --> 03:00:38,790
viable entry?
You're looking for a long, buyers get

8046
03:00:38,790 --> 03:00:38,800
You're looking for a long, buyers get
 

8047
03:00:38,800 --> 03:00:43,269
You're looking for a long, buyers get
trapped at the highs and then get out.

8048
03:00:43,269 --> 03:00:43,279

 

8049
03:00:43,279 --> 03:00:44,790

Oh, you mean Okay, so you're talking

8050
03:00:44,790 --> 03:00:44,800
Oh, you mean Okay, so you're talking
 

8051
03:00:44,800 --> 03:00:47,590
Oh, you mean Okay, so you're talking
about this move here.

8052
03:00:47,590 --> 03:00:47,600
about this move here.
 

8053
03:00:47,600 --> 03:00:50,230
about this move here.
You're saying the market's done this,

8054
03:00:50,230 --> 03:00:50,240
You're saying the market's done this,
 

8055
03:00:50,240 --> 03:00:53,590
You're saying the market's done this,
buyers are trapped here, we pull back.

8056
03:00:53,590 --> 03:00:53,600
buyers are trapped here, we pull back.
 

8057
03:00:53,600 --> 03:00:55,830
buyers are trapped here, we pull back.
Is it viable to get long as they break

8058
03:00:55,830 --> 03:00:55,840
Is it viable to get long as they break
 

8059
03:00:55,840 --> 03:00:58,070
Is it viable to get long as they break
as as this? That would be a breakout

8060
03:00:58,070 --> 03:00:58,080
as as this? That would be a breakout
 

8061
03:00:58,080 --> 03:01:00,230
as as this? That would be a breakout
trade. Better trade would be to position

8062
03:01:00,230 --> 03:01:00,240
trade. Better trade would be to position
 

8063
03:01:00,240 --> 03:01:01,830
trade. Better trade would be to position
here,

8064
03:01:01,830 --> 03:01:01,840
here,
 

8065
03:01:01,840 --> 03:01:04,870
here,
right? And then look for that.

8066
03:01:04,870 --> 03:01:04,880
right? And then look for that.
 

8067
03:01:04,880 --> 03:01:06,469
right? And then look for that.
Yes, it's viable, but that would be the

8068
03:01:06,469 --> 03:01:06,479
Yes, it's viable, but that would be the
 

8069
03:01:06,479 --> 03:01:29,670
Yes, it's viable, but that would be the
better trade.

8070
03:01:29,670 --> 03:01:29,680

 

8071
03:01:29,680 --> 03:01:30,950

I think it will wash all the way back to

8072
03:01:30,950 --> 03:01:30,960
I think it will wash all the way back to
 

8073
03:01:30,960 --> 03:01:33,030
I think it will wash all the way back to
value area low. You mean drive up to

8074
03:01:33,030 --> 03:01:33,040
value area low. You mean drive up to
 

8075
03:01:33,040 --> 03:01:34,389
value area low. You mean drive up to
value area low? I mean, it's got to get

8076
03:01:34,389 --> 03:01:34,399
value area low? I mean, it's got to get
 

8077
03:01:34,399 --> 03:01:35,910
value area low? I mean, it's got to get
through a lot of nodes to do that. So

8078
03:01:35,910 --> 03:01:35,920
through a lot of nodes to do that. So
 

8079
03:01:35,920 --> 03:01:37,510
through a lot of nodes to do that. So
far, we're still staying heavy, but we

8080
03:01:37,510 --> 03:01:37,520
far, we're still staying heavy, but we
 

8081
03:01:37,520 --> 03:01:40,710
far, we're still staying heavy, but we
just rejected. We just make this. It's

8082
03:01:40,710 --> 03:01:40,720
just rejected. We just make this. It's
 

8083
03:01:40,720 --> 03:01:42,309
just rejected. We just make this. It's
actually this tiny little node here has

8084
03:01:42,309 --> 03:01:42,319
actually this tiny little node here has
 

8085
03:01:42,319 --> 03:01:44,230
actually this tiny little node here has
just been developed. It's gross. Should

8086
03:01:44,230 --> 03:01:44,240
just been developed. It's gross. Should
 

8087
03:01:44,240 --> 03:01:46,469
just been developed. It's gross. Should
have come up to here really. Still looks

8088
03:01:46,469 --> 03:01:46,479
have come up to here really. Still looks
 

8089
03:01:46,479 --> 03:01:47,830
have come up to here really. Still looks
like it wants to trade lower. It's still

8090
03:01:47,830 --> 03:01:47,840
like it wants to trade lower. It's still
 

8091
03:01:47,840 --> 03:01:50,389
like it wants to trade lower. It's still
got this target. Still no change in

8092
03:01:50,389 --> 03:01:50,399
got this target. Still no change in
 

8093
03:01:50,399 --> 03:01:51,990
got this target. Still no change in
structure if you think about how we're

8094
03:01:51,990 --> 03:01:52,000
structure if you think about how we're
 

8095
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:57,269
structure if you think about how we're
moving.

8096
03:01:57,269 --> 03:01:57,279

 

8097
03:01:57,279 --> 03:01:59,910

Right. There's no pivot. It's still a

8098
03:01:59,910 --> 03:01:59,920
Right. There's no pivot. It's still a
 

8099
03:01:59,920 --> 03:02:02,790
Right. There's no pivot. It's still a
sell. I'd probably be done with it, but

8100
03:02:02,790 --> 03:02:02,800
sell. I'd probably be done with it, but
 

8101
03:02:02,800 --> 03:02:04,630
sell. I'd probably be done with it, but
you know, there's argument to keep

8102
03:02:04,630 --> 03:02:04,640
you know, there's argument to keep
 

8103
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:06,870
you know, there's argument to keep
trading lower, but for me, too far a

8104
03:02:06,870 --> 03:02:06,880
trading lower, but for me, too far a
 

8105
03:02:06,880 --> 03:02:14,389
trading lower, but for me, too far a
discount for a new position.

8106
03:02:14,389 --> 03:02:14,399

 

8107
03:02:14,399 --> 03:02:17,590

What an em this one. 7289. The purple

8108
03:02:17,590 --> 03:02:17,600
What an em this one. 7289. The purple
 

8109
03:02:17,600 --> 03:02:23,190
What an em this one. 7289. The purple
one. You mean 7289?

8110
03:02:23,190 --> 03:02:23,200

 

8111
03:02:23,200 --> 03:02:25,670

Hey Rick, how's it going? When I see

8112
03:02:25,670 --> 03:02:25,680
Hey Rick, how's it going? When I see
 

8113
03:02:25,680 --> 03:02:27,830
Hey Rick, how's it going? When I see
bookmap going down, but it's green

8114
03:02:27,830 --> 03:02:27,840
bookmap going down, but it's green
 

8115
03:02:27,840 --> 03:02:30,710
bookmap going down, but it's green
bubbles all the way down and CBD up,

8116
03:02:30,710 --> 03:02:30,720
bubbles all the way down and CBD up,
 

8117
03:02:30,720 --> 03:02:32,389
bubbles all the way down and CBD up,
that means there's a major divergence,

8118
03:02:32,389 --> 03:02:32,399
that means there's a major divergence,
 

8119
03:02:32,399 --> 03:02:35,750
that means there's a major divergence,
strong bull absorption. Well, if you see

8120
03:02:35,750 --> 03:02:35,760
strong bull absorption. Well, if you see
 

8121
03:02:35,760 --> 03:02:38,630
strong bull absorption. Well, if you see
price going down, but it's green bubbles

8122
03:02:38,630 --> 03:02:38,640
price going down, but it's green bubbles
 

8123
03:02:38,640 --> 03:02:41,110
price going down, but it's green bubbles
up. That means there's passive selling.

8124
03:02:41,110 --> 03:02:41,120
up. That means there's passive selling.
 

8125
03:02:41,120 --> 03:02:43,429
up. That means there's passive selling.
Price can't go down with green. You mean

8126
03:02:43,429 --> 03:02:43,439
Price can't go down with green. You mean
 

8127
03:02:43,439 --> 03:02:46,309
Price can't go down with green. You mean
afterwards? You mean like this here?

8128
03:02:46,309 --> 03:02:46,319
afterwards? You mean like this here?
 

8129
03:02:46,319 --> 03:02:48,070
afterwards? You mean like this here?
Trying to I'm trying to understand the

8130
03:02:48,070 --> 03:02:48,080
Trying to I'm trying to understand the
 

8131
03:02:48,080 --> 03:02:50,389
Trying to I'm trying to understand the
uh way you framed it. Right. If we see

8132
03:02:50,389 --> 03:02:50,399
uh way you framed it. Right. If we see
 

8133
03:02:50,399 --> 03:02:52,469
uh way you framed it. Right. If we see
this here, these blue bubbles, these

8134
03:02:52,469 --> 03:02:52,479
this here, these blue bubbles, these
 

8135
03:02:52,479 --> 03:02:54,230
this here, these blue bubbles, these
green bubbles here and here, right?

8136
03:02:54,230 --> 03:02:54,240
green bubbles here and here, right?
 

8137
03:02:54,240 --> 03:02:55,349
green bubbles here and here, right?
These are aggressive market

8138
03:02:55,349 --> 03:02:55,359
These are aggressive market
 

8139
03:02:55,359 --> 03:02:57,750
These are aggressive market
participants. These are market orders,

8140
03:02:57,750 --> 03:02:57,760
participants. These are market orders,
 

8141
03:02:57,760 --> 03:03:00,070
participants. These are market orders,
right? These are aggressive buyers. Was

8142
03:03:00,070 --> 03:03:00,080
right? These are aggressive buyers. Was
 

8143
03:03:00,080 --> 03:03:01,670
right? These are aggressive buyers. Was
price able to move higher after those

8144
03:03:01,670 --> 03:03:01,680
price able to move higher after those
 

8145
03:03:01,680 --> 03:03:03,750
price able to move higher after those
aggressive buyers came in? No. So, what

8146
03:03:03,750 --> 03:03:03,760
aggressive buyers came in? No. So, what
 

8147
03:03:03,760 --> 03:03:05,110
aggressive buyers came in? No. So, what
does that mean? It means there's

8148
03:03:05,110 --> 03:03:05,120
does that mean? It means there's
 

8149
03:03:05,120 --> 03:03:06,710
does that mean? It means there's
absorption sell side. So, there's

8150
03:03:06,710 --> 03:03:06,720
absorption sell side. So, there's
 

8151
03:03:06,720 --> 03:03:09,269
absorption sell side. So, there's
sellers here willing to sell and force

8152
03:03:09,269 --> 03:03:09,279
sellers here willing to sell and force
 

8153
03:03:09,279 --> 03:03:10,550
sellers here willing to sell and force
this market lower, which we're starting

8154
03:03:10,550 --> 03:03:10,560
this market lower, which we're starting
 

8155
03:03:10,560 --> 03:03:11,990
this market lower, which we're starting
to see. Now, we're going to retest this

8156
03:03:11,990 --> 03:03:12,000
to see. Now, we're going to retest this
 

8157
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:13,750
to see. Now, we're going to retest this
same level here where we just broke down

8158
03:03:13,750 --> 03:03:13,760
same level here where we just broke down
 

8159
03:03:13,760 --> 03:03:15,830
same level here where we just broke down
from. All right. So, buyers are coming

8160
03:03:15,830 --> 03:03:15,840
from. All right. So, buyers are coming
 

8161
03:03:15,840 --> 03:03:17,750
from. All right. So, buyers are coming
flying in here. If they don't get their

8162
03:03:17,750 --> 03:03:17,760
flying in here. If they don't get their
 

8163
03:03:17,760 --> 03:03:19,590
flying in here. If they don't get their
way and we use this pivot to sell, which

8164
03:03:19,590 --> 03:03:19,600
way and we use this pivot to sell, which
 

8165
03:03:19,600 --> 03:03:21,269
way and we use this pivot to sell, which
we're now using just structurally, we're

8166
03:03:21,269 --> 03:03:21,279
we're now using just structurally, we're
 

8167
03:03:21,279 --> 03:03:22,870
we're now using just structurally, we're
going to come down to where these buyers

8168
03:03:22,870 --> 03:03:22,880
going to come down to where these buyers
 

8169
03:03:22,880 --> 03:03:25,030
going to come down to where these buyers
just came in. If we lose these bids

8170
03:03:25,030 --> 03:03:25,040
just came in. If we lose these bids
 

8171
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:26,469
just came in. If we lose these bids
under here where these buyers just came

8172
03:03:26,469 --> 03:03:26,479
under here where these buyers just came
 

8173
03:03:26,479 --> 03:03:28,630
under here where these buyers just came
flying in. So, we're using now I

8174
03:03:28,630 --> 03:03:28,640
flying in. So, we're using now I
 

8175
03:03:28,640 --> 03:03:30,630
flying in. So, we're using now I
basically saying this is the pivot

8176
03:03:30,630 --> 03:03:30,640
basically saying this is the pivot
 

8177
03:03:30,640 --> 03:03:32,790
basically saying this is the pivot
somewhere in here, right? And if we lose

8178
03:03:32,790 --> 03:03:32,800
somewhere in here, right? And if we lose
 

8179
03:03:32,800 --> 03:03:35,030
somewhere in here, right? And if we lose
that, then we will try and trade

8180
03:03:35,030 --> 03:03:35,040
that, then we will try and trade
 

8181
03:03:35,040 --> 03:03:37,190
that, then we will try and trade
underneath this pivot. And if we lose

8182
03:03:37,190 --> 03:03:37,200
underneath this pivot. And if we lose
 

8183
03:03:37,200 --> 03:03:39,830
underneath this pivot. And if we lose
that, right, we can trade into this

8184
03:03:39,830 --> 03:03:39,840
that, right, we can trade into this
 

8185
03:03:39,840 --> 03:03:41,670
that, right, we can trade into this
cluster here, which is where the low of

8186
03:03:41,670 --> 03:03:41,680
cluster here, which is where the low of
 

8187
03:03:41,680 --> 03:03:43,030
cluster here, which is where the low of
day auction is right now. And you can

8188
03:03:43,030 --> 03:03:43,040
day auction is right now. And you can
 

8189
03:03:43,040 --> 03:03:45,030
day auction is right now. And you can
see there's a buyer here trying to

8190
03:03:45,030 --> 03:03:45,040
see there's a buyer here trying to
 

8191
03:03:45,040 --> 03:03:46,389
see there's a buyer here trying to
support that low of day auction. and

8192
03:03:46,389 --> 03:03:46,399
support that low of day auction. and
 

8193
03:03:46,399 --> 03:03:48,230
support that low of day auction. and
he's trying to provide liquidity down

8194
03:03:48,230 --> 03:03:48,240
he's trying to provide liquidity down
 

8195
03:03:48,240 --> 03:03:50,710
he's trying to provide liquidity down
there. So that when we see this buyers

8196
03:03:50,710 --> 03:03:50,720
there. So that when we see this buyers
 

8197
03:03:50,720 --> 03:03:52,870
there. So that when we see this buyers
at high and price not moving higher that

8198
03:03:52,870 --> 03:03:52,880
at high and price not moving higher that
 

8199
03:03:52,880 --> 03:03:55,269
at high and price not moving higher that
is a seller absorbing the tape moving it

8200
03:03:55,269 --> 03:03:55,279
is a seller absorbing the tape moving it
 

8201
03:03:55,279 --> 03:03:58,870
is a seller absorbing the tape moving it
lower. When we see selling at lows and

8202
03:03:58,870 --> 03:03:58,880
lower. When we see selling at lows and
 

8203
03:03:58,880 --> 03:04:00,630
lower. When we see selling at lows and
not able to move lower that is a buyer

8204
03:04:00,630 --> 03:04:00,640
not able to move lower that is a buyer
 

8205
03:04:00,640 --> 03:04:02,630
not able to move lower that is a buyer
in the tape this right here and we move

8206
03:04:02,630 --> 03:04:02,640
in the tape this right here and we move
 

8207
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:05,110
in the tape this right here and we move
price higher. So we had 150 lot sellside

8208
03:04:05,110 --> 03:04:05,120
price higher. So we had 150 lot sellside
 

8209
03:04:05,120 --> 03:04:07,590
price higher. So we had 150 lot sellside
above that 30 lot 50 lot and then we see

8210
03:04:07,590 --> 03:04:07,600
above that 30 lot 50 lot and then we see
 

8211
03:04:07,600 --> 03:04:09,510
above that 30 lot 50 lot and then we see
this buying come in and we absorb it. So

8212
03:04:09,510 --> 03:04:09,520
this buying come in and we absorb it. So
 

8213
03:04:09,520 --> 03:04:11,670
this buying come in and we absorb it. So
you see selling at loes being absorbed

8214
03:04:11,670 --> 03:04:11,680
you see selling at loes being absorbed
 

8215
03:04:11,680 --> 03:04:18,230
you see selling at loes being absorbed
as we move higher.

8216
03:04:18,230 --> 03:04:18,240

unless it's a swing position. What was

8220
03:04:22,550 --> 03:04:22,560
unless it's a swing position. What was
 

8221
03:04:22,560 --> 03:04:24,309
unless it's a swing position. What was
my job before trading? I was a music

8222
03:04:24,309 --> 03:04:24,319

possibility all the way down to 600. Let

8234
03:04:37,110 --> 03:04:37,120

8235
03:04:37,120 --> 03:04:39,429
possibility all the way down to 600. Let
me have a look. Uh you were talking

8236
03:04:39,429 --> 03:04:39,439
me have a look. Uh you were talking
 

8237
03:04:39,439 --> 03:04:42,550
me have a look. Uh you were talking
about the QQQ. Okay. What? So, we've got

8238
03:04:42,550 --> 03:04:42,560
about the QQQ. Okay. What? So, we've got
 

8239
03:04:42,560 --> 03:04:44,230
about the QQQ. Okay. What? So, we've got
a put wall down at 600 is what you're

8240
03:04:44,230 --> 03:04:44,240
a put wall down at 600 is what you're
 

8241
03:04:44,240 --> 03:04:46,070
a put wall down at 600 is what you're
saying. That makes sense because I have

8242
03:04:46,070 --> 03:04:46,080
saying. That makes sense because I have
 

8243
03:04:46,080 --> 03:04:48,710
saying. That makes sense because I have
got a big level there drawn out which

8244
03:04:48,710 --> 03:04:48,720
got a big level there drawn out which
 

8245
03:04:48,720 --> 03:04:51,510
got a big level there drawn out which
dates back a long long way. Zoom this

8246
03:04:51,510 --> 03:04:51,520
dates back a long long way. Zoom this
 

8247
03:04:51,520 --> 03:04:53,429
dates back a long long way. Zoom this
out a bit.

8248
03:04:53,429 --> 03:04:53,439

8249
03:04:53,439 --> 03:04:55,750
out a bit.
All the way back to 17th of December.

8250
03:04:55,750 --> 03:04:55,760
All the way back to 17th of December.
 

8251
03:04:55,760 --> 03:04:57,590
All the way back to 17th of December.
So, it makes sense. So, it's kind of the

8252
03:04:57,590 --> 03:04:57,600
So, it makes sense. So, it's kind of the
 

8253
03:04:57,600 --> 03:04:59,110
So, it makes sense. So, it's kind of the
same block. We're actually kind of

8254
03:04:59,110 --> 03:04:59,120
same block. We're actually kind of
 

8255
03:04:59,120 --> 03:05:01,750
same block. We're actually kind of
trading in that block now on the ENQ.

8256
03:05:01,750 --> 03:05:01,760
trading in that block now on the ENQ.
 

8257
03:05:01,760 --> 03:05:05,830
trading in that block now on the ENQ.
Uh, so QQQ needs to catch up the ETF.

8258
03:05:05,830 --> 03:05:05,840
Uh, so QQQ needs to catch up the ETF.
 

8259
03:05:05,840 --> 03:05:08,070
Uh, so QQQ needs to catch up the ETF.
It's the same block. 17th of December.

8260
03:05:08,070 --> 03:05:08,080
It's the same block. 17th of December.
 

8261
03:05:08,080 --> 03:05:11,510
It's the same block. 17th of December.
This is this block. So on the NQ, that

8262
03:05:11,510 --> 03:05:11,520
This is this block. So on the NQ, that
 

8263
03:05:11,520 --> 03:05:14,710
This is this block. So on the NQ, that
block here is 600 on the QQQ. If you

8264
03:05:14,710 --> 03:05:14,720
block here is 600 on the QQQ. If you
 

8265
03:05:14,720 --> 03:05:18,230
block here is 600 on the QQQ. If you
look at where 600 is on the QQQ, it's

8266
03:05:18,230 --> 03:05:18,240
look at where 600 is on the QQQ, it's
 

8267
03:05:18,240 --> 03:05:20,389
look at where 600 is on the QQQ, it's
the 17th of December. If you look at

8268
03:05:20,389 --> 03:05:20,399
the 17th of December. If you look at
 

8269
03:05:20,399 --> 03:05:21,750
the 17th of December. If you look at
this block here that we've just traded

8270
03:05:21,750 --> 03:05:21,760
this block here that we've just traded
 

8271
03:05:21,760 --> 03:05:24,070
this block here that we've just traded
into, it's the same level. So we've got

8272
03:05:24,070 --> 03:05:24,080
into, it's the same level. So we've got
 

8273
03:05:24,080 --> 03:05:28,469
into, it's the same level. So we've got
a little bit of divergence.

8274
03:05:28,469 --> 03:05:28,479

 

8275
03:05:28,479 --> 03:05:34,469

How far are your stop losses? It depends

How far are your stop losses? It depends
 

8345
03:06:51,920 --> 03:06:55,429

repeat this hard enough. Right? Let's

8348
03:06:57,429 --> 03:06:57,439
repeat this hard enough. Right? Let's
 

8349
03:06:57,439 --> 03:06:59,750
repeat this hard enough. Right? Let's
say you've entered late here on a short

8350
03:06:59,750 --> 03:06:59,760
say you've entered late here on a short
 

8351
03:06:59,760 --> 03:07:01,990
say you've entered late here on a short
here, right? Your stop loss would need

8352
03:07:01,990 --> 03:07:02,000
here, right? Your stop loss would need
 

8353
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:04,710
here, right? Your stop loss would need
to be up here. Okay, that's what the

8354
03:07:04,710 --> 03:07:04,720
to be up here. Okay, that's what the
 

8355
03:07:04,720 --> 03:07:06,469
to be up here. Okay, that's what the
market is dictating your stop loss to

8356
03:07:06,469 --> 03:07:06,479
market is dictating your stop loss to
 

8357
03:07:06,479 --> 03:07:08,309
market is dictating your stop loss to
be. If your stop loss is 10 points

8358
03:07:08,309 --> 03:07:08,319
be. If your stop loss is 10 points
 

8359
03:07:08,319 --> 03:07:09,510
be. If your stop loss is 10 points
because you only want to trade 10

8360
03:07:09,510 --> 03:07:09,520
because you only want to trade 10
 

8361
03:07:09,520 --> 03:07:11,670
because you only want to trade 10
points, then you know why would the

8362
03:07:11,670 --> 03:07:11,680
points, then you know why would the
 

8363
03:07:11,680 --> 03:07:13,590
points, then you know why would the
market care about you? It doesn't. It

8364
03:07:13,590 --> 03:07:13,600
market care about you? It doesn't. It
 

8365
03:07:13,600 --> 03:07:15,590
market care about you? It doesn't. It
cares about the swing. So asking how big

8366
03:07:15,590 --> 03:07:15,600
cares about the swing. So asking how big
 

8367
03:07:15,600 --> 03:07:17,990
cares about the swing. So asking how big
your stop loss is really depends where

8368
03:07:17,990 --> 03:07:18,000
your stop loss is really depends where
 

8369
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:21,429
your stop loss is really depends where
your entry is and where the trade is no

8370
03:07:21,429 --> 03:07:21,439
your entry is and where the trade is no
 

8371
03:07:21,439 --> 03:07:25,429
your entry is and where the trade is no
longer valid. And then this size, right,

8372
03:07:25,429 --> 03:07:25,439
longer valid. And then this size, right,
 

8373
03:07:25,439 --> 03:07:28,150
longer valid. And then this size, right,
the size of that stop should dictate the

8374
03:07:28,150 --> 03:07:28,160
the size of that stop should dictate the
 

8375
03:07:28,160 --> 03:07:36,710
the size of that stop should dictate the
amount of contracts that you take.

8376
03:07:36,710 --> 03:07:36,720

 

8377
03:07:36,720 --> 03:07:39,590

Is being a profitable trader boring as

8378
03:07:39,590 --> 03:07:39,600
Is being a profitable trader boring as
 

8379
03:07:39,600 --> 03:07:41,190
Is being a profitable trader boring as
you have to wait for setups? Yeah, that

8380
03:07:41,190 --> 03:07:41,200
you have to wait for setups? Yeah, that
 

8381
03:07:41,200 --> 03:07:43,030
you have to wait for setups? Yeah, that
like most of the day is spent stalking

right. So, if that's your higher time

8528
03:11:09,590 --> 03:11:09,600
right. So, if that's your higher time
 

8529
03:11:09,600 --> 03:11:16,790
right. So, if that's your higher time
frame, that means lower time frame,

in here. Right. Today,
 

8537
03:11:23,120 --> 03:11:25,750
in here. Right. Today,
we are here. All right. We had we

8538
03:11:25,750 --> 03:11:25,760
we are here. All right. We had we
 

8539
03:11:25,760 --> 03:11:27,349
we are here. All right. We had we
actually had a failed breakout last

8540
03:11:27,349 --> 03:11:27,359
actually had a failed breakout last
 

8541
03:11:27,359 --> 03:11:29,590
actually had a failed breakout last
week, trapped buyers, and we came back

8542
03:11:29,590 --> 03:11:29,600
week, trapped buyers, and we came back
 

8543
03:11:29,600 --> 03:11:31,269
week, trapped buyers, and we came back
into range and today we are breaking out

8544
03:11:31,269 --> 03:11:31,279
into range and today we are breaking out
 

8545
03:11:31,279 --> 03:11:33,590
into range and today we are breaking out
the other side. So, if you were white,

8546
03:11:33,590 --> 03:11:33,600
the other side. So, if you were white,
 

8547
03:11:33,600 --> 03:11:35,590
the other side. So, if you were white,
that could have been the spring, right?

8548
03:11:35,590 --> 03:11:35,600
that could have been the spring, right?
 

8549
03:11:35,600 --> 03:11:37,990
that could have been the spring, right?
So this today and yesterday was a sign

8550
03:11:37,990 --> 03:11:38,000
So this today and yesterday was a sign
 

8551
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:40,309
So this today and yesterday was a sign
of strength. It might be that we get a

8552
03:11:40,309 --> 03:11:40,319
of strength. It might be that we get a
 

8553
03:11:40,319 --> 03:11:43,110
of strength. It might be that we get a
trend down which means this on lower

8554
03:11:43,110 --> 03:11:43,120
trend down which means this on lower
 

8555
03:11:43,120 --> 03:11:45,670
trend down which means this on lower
time frames will start to look like this

8556
03:11:45,670 --> 03:11:45,680
time frames will start to look like this
 

8557
03:11:45,680 --> 03:11:47,190
time frames will start to look like this
more which is what we've seen the last

8558
03:11:47,190 --> 03:11:47,200
more which is what we've seen the last
 

8559
03:11:47,200 --> 03:11:49,590
more which is what we've seen the last
few days. Right? So this is building

8560
03:11:49,590 --> 03:11:49,600
few days. Right? So this is building
 

8561
03:11:49,600 --> 03:11:52,070
few days. Right? So this is building
liquidity that means building volume.

8562
03:11:52,070 --> 03:11:52,080
liquidity that means building volume.
 

8563
03:11:52,080 --> 03:11:54,950
liquidity that means building volume.
This is using the volume right intraday.

8564
03:11:54,950 --> 03:11:54,960
This is using the volume right intraday.
 

8565
03:11:54,960 --> 03:11:57,030
This is using the volume right intraday.
Now because we've done such a big move

8566
03:11:57,030 --> 03:11:57,040
Now because we've done such a big move
 

8567
03:11:57,040 --> 03:11:59,030
Now because we've done such a big move
if we're going to move lower we need to

8568
03:11:59,030 --> 03:11:59,040
if we're going to move lower we need to
 

8569
03:11:59,040 --> 03:12:01,429
if we're going to move lower we need to
build volume out don't we? So how how do

8570
03:12:01,429 --> 03:12:01,439
build volume out don't we? So how how do
 

8571
03:12:01,439 --> 03:12:03,670
build volume out don't we? So how how do
we move lower?

8572
03:12:03,670 --> 03:12:03,680
we move lower?
 

8573
03:12:03,680 --> 03:12:06,469
we move lower?
If buyers come in here and they bid the

8574
03:12:06,469 --> 03:12:06,479
If buyers come in here and they bid the
 

8575
03:12:06,479 --> 03:12:08,469
If buyers come in here and they bid the
market up and more buyers come in here

8576
03:12:08,469 --> 03:12:08,479
market up and more buyers come in here
 

8577
03:12:08,479 --> 03:12:10,550
market up and more buyers come in here
and bid the market up and more buyers

8578
03:12:10,550 --> 03:12:10,560
and bid the market up and more buyers
 

8579
03:12:10,560 --> 03:12:12,870
and bid the market up and more buyers
come in here and bid the market up and

8580
03:12:12,870 --> 03:12:12,880
come in here and bid the market up and
 

8581
03:12:12,880 --> 03:12:15,510
come in here and bid the market up and
then this buyer gets stuck and we come

8582
03:12:15,510 --> 03:12:15,520
then this buyer gets stuck and we come
 

8583
03:12:15,520 --> 03:12:17,670
then this buyer gets stuck and we come
down and this buyer gets stuck and we

8584
03:12:17,670 --> 03:12:17,680
down and this buyer gets stuck and we
 

8585
03:12:17,680 --> 03:12:20,630
down and this buyer gets stuck and we
come down then these buyers are the

8586
03:12:20,630 --> 03:12:20,640
come down then these buyers are the
 

8587
03:12:20,640 --> 03:12:22,710
come down then these buyers are the
buildout stage. All right. And their

8588
03:12:22,710 --> 03:12:22,720
buildout stage. All right. And their
 

8589
03:12:22,720 --> 03:12:24,550
buildout stage. All right. And their
stops when we run their stops become

8590
03:12:24,550 --> 03:12:24,560
stops when we run their stops become
 

8591
03:12:24,560 --> 03:12:26,389
stops when we run their stops become
sellside and we use them to go lower.

8592
03:12:26,389 --> 03:12:26,399
sellside and we use them to go lower.
 

8593
03:12:26,399 --> 03:12:28,070
sellside and we use them to go lower.
That's how we build the liquidity.

8594
03:12:28,070 --> 03:12:28,080
That's how we build the liquidity.
 

8595
03:12:28,080 --> 03:12:29,750
That's how we build the liquidity.
Right? Same as here. This will be a big

8596
03:12:29,750 --> 03:12:29,760
Right? Same as here. This will be a big
 

8597
03:12:29,760 --> 03:12:31,990
Right? Same as here. This will be a big
pivot here. Right? I would imagine if we

8598
03:12:31,990 --> 03:12:32,000
pivot here. Right? I would imagine if we
 

8599
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:34,150
pivot here. Right? I would imagine if we
come above this, lots of buyers will

8600
03:12:34,150 --> 03:12:34,160
come above this, lots of buyers will
 

8601
03:12:34,160 --> 03:12:37,030
come above this, lots of buyers will
chase in and it's very possible we use

8602
03:12:37,030 --> 03:12:37,040
chase in and it's very possible we use
 

8603
03:12:37,040 --> 03:12:38,710
chase in and it's very possible we use
their liquidity then to come back down.

8604
03:12:38,710 --> 03:12:38,720
their liquidity then to come back down.
 

8605
03:12:38,720 --> 03:12:40,630
their liquidity then to come back down.
All right, so we go choppy when we need

8606
03:12:40,630 --> 03:12:40,640
All right, so we go choppy when we need
 

8607
03:12:40,640 --> 03:12:43,110
All right, so we go choppy when we need
to build liquidity. We cannot move in a

8608
03:12:43,110 --> 03:12:43,120
to build liquidity. We cannot move in a
 

8609
03:12:43,120 --> 03:12:47,510
to build liquidity. We cannot move in a
straight line.

8610
03:12:47,510 --> 03:12:47,520

 

8611
03:12:47,520 --> 03:12:50,070

Am I on every day? Yes. 9:15 Eastern

8612
03:12:50,070 --> 03:12:50,080
Am I on every day? Yes. 9:15 Eastern
 

8613
03:12:50,080 --> 03:12:54,630
Am I on every day? Yes. 9:15 Eastern
into lunch.

8614
03:12:54,630 --> 03:12:54,640

 

8615
03:12:54,640 --> 03:12:57,429

What prop gives you 90% off Apex right

8616
03:12:57,429 --> 03:12:57,439
What prop gives you 90% off Apex right
 

8617
03:12:57,439 --> 03:13:05,349
What prop gives you 90% off Apex right
now?

8618
03:13:05,349 --> 03:13:05,359

 

8619
03:13:05,359 --> 03:13:07,670

You ever think about doing a backcountry

8620
03:13:07,670 --> 03:13:07,680
You ever think about doing a backcountry
 

8621
03:13:07,680 --> 03:13:12,309
You ever think about doing a backcountry
heli ride on the mountains in Alaska?

8622
03:13:12,309 --> 03:13:12,319

 

8623
03:13:12,319 --> 03:13:15,510

Don't worry about blocked roads. I don't

8624
03:13:15,510 --> 03:13:15,520
Don't worry about blocked roads. I don't
 

8625
03:13:15,520 --> 03:13:16,790
Don't worry about blocked roads. I don't
know. Why would I think about doing

8626
03:13:16,790 --> 03:13:16,800
know. Why would I think about doing
 

8627
03:13:16,800 --> 03:13:22,150
know. Why would I think about doing
that?

8628
03:13:22,150 --> 03:13:22,160

 

8629
03:13:22,160 --> 03:13:25,429

We often do a Vshape on rebounds. Uh I

8630
03:13:25,429 --> 03:13:25,439
We often do a Vshape on rebounds. Uh I
 

8631
03:13:25,439 --> 03:13:27,429
We often do a Vshape on rebounds. Uh I
would change that statement quite

8632
03:13:27,429 --> 03:13:27,439
would change that statement quite
 

8633
03:13:27,439 --> 03:13:29,590
would change that statement quite
drastically. often?

8634
03:13:29,590 --> 03:13:29,600
drastically. often?
 

8635
03:13:29,600 --> 03:13:32,309
drastically. often?
No. Vshapes are not often. Do they

8636
03:13:32,309 --> 03:13:32,319
No. Vshapes are not often. Do they
 

8637
03:13:32,319 --> 03:13:36,950
No. Vshapes are not often. Do they
happen? Yes. Are they often? No. When do

8638
03:13:36,950 --> 03:13:36,960
happen? Yes. Are they often? No. When do
 

8639
03:13:36,960 --> 03:13:39,110
happen? Yes. Are they often? No. When do
they happen? They happen when we have

8640
03:13:39,110 --> 03:13:39,120
they happen? They happen when we have
 

8641
03:13:39,120 --> 03:13:40,950
they happen? They happen when we have
something like this, right? So, if the

8642
03:13:40,950 --> 03:13:40,960
something like this, right? So, if the
 

8643
03:13:40,960 --> 03:13:43,429
something like this, right? So, if the
higher time frame,

8644
03:13:43,429 --> 03:13:43,439
higher time frame,
 

8645
03:13:43,439 --> 03:13:48,309
higher time frame,
let's say, uh,

8646
03:13:48,309 --> 03:13:48,319

 

8647
03:13:48,319 --> 03:13:50,870

we've moved down. Jesus Christ. Let's

8648
03:13:50,870 --> 03:13:50,880
we've moved down. Jesus Christ. Let's
 

8649
03:13:50,880 --> 03:13:52,950
we've moved down. Jesus Christ. Let's
say it's like this, right? Higher time

8650
03:13:52,950 --> 03:13:52,960
say it's like this, right? Higher time
 

8651
03:13:52,960 --> 03:13:55,510
say it's like this, right? Higher time
frame. Big extension. Big extension. Big

8652
03:13:55,510 --> 03:13:55,520
frame. Big extension. Big extension. Big
 

8653
03:13:55,520 --> 03:13:58,550
frame. Big extension. Big extension. Big
extension. and we move down here for the

8654
03:13:58,550 --> 03:13:58,560
extension. and we move down here for the
 

8655
03:13:58,560 --> 03:14:02,550
extension. and we move down here for the
first time and we left lots of limit

8656
03:14:02,550 --> 03:14:02,560
first time and we left lots of limit
 

8657
03:14:02,560 --> 03:14:04,150
first time and we left lots of limit
buyers waiting here. This is where

8658
03:14:04,150 --> 03:14:04,160
buyers waiting here. This is where
 

8659
03:14:04,160 --> 03:14:05,830
buyers waiting here. This is where
you'll get a Vshape. All right,

8660
03:14:05,830 --> 03:14:05,840
you'll get a Vshape. All right,
 

8661
03:14:05,840 --> 03:14:07,910
you'll get a Vshape. All right,
especially if it's a drastic move and a

8662
03:14:07,910 --> 03:14:07,920
especially if it's a drastic move and a
 

8663
03:14:07,920 --> 03:14:10,309
especially if it's a drastic move and a
drastic move and especially if this is

8664
03:14:10,309 --> 03:14:10,319
drastic move and especially if this is
 

8665
03:14:10,319 --> 03:14:12,790
drastic move and especially if this is
news and it's very very thin, right?

8666
03:14:12,790 --> 03:14:12,800
news and it's very very thin, right?
 

8667
03:14:12,800 --> 03:14:14,950
news and it's very very thin, right?
Then we'll be thin back up, right?

8668
03:14:14,950 --> 03:14:14,960
Then we'll be thin back up, right?
 

8669
03:14:14,960 --> 03:14:16,630
Then we'll be thin back up, right?
Whenever the market's thin one side, it

8670
03:14:16,630 --> 03:14:16,640
Whenever the market's thin one side, it
 

8671
03:14:16,640 --> 03:14:18,469
Whenever the market's thin one side, it
would go thin the other way. Uh if you

8672
03:14:18,469 --> 03:14:18,479
would go thin the other way. Uh if you
 

8673
03:14:18,479 --> 03:14:22,950
would go thin the other way. Uh if you
want an example of that,

8674
03:14:22,950 --> 03:14:22,960

 

8675
03:14:22,960 --> 03:14:27,349

All

8676
03:14:27,349 --> 03:14:27,359

 

8677
03:14:27,359 --> 03:14:30,469

right. Thin up. Straight up. This shot

8678
03:14:30,469 --> 03:14:30,479
right. Thin up. Straight up. This shot
 

8679
03:14:30,479 --> 03:14:33,349
right. Thin up. Straight up. This shot
here. Straight up and straight down. All

8680
03:14:33,349 --> 03:14:33,359
here. Straight up and straight down. All
 

8681
03:14:33,359 --> 03:14:35,429
here. Straight up and straight down. All
right. Because there's no structure.

8682
03:14:35,429 --> 03:14:35,439
right. Because there's no structure.
 

8683
03:14:35,439 --> 03:14:37,190
right. Because there's no structure.
Right. If we'd built structure out in

8684
03:14:37,190 --> 03:14:37,200
Right. If we'd built structure out in
 

8685
03:14:37,200 --> 03:14:40,229
Right. If we'd built structure out in
here,

8686
03:14:40,229 --> 03:14:40,239

 

8687
03:14:40,239 --> 03:14:42,150

right, then this on the way down would

8688
03:14:42,150 --> 03:14:42,160
right, then this on the way down would
 

8689
03:14:42,160 --> 03:14:45,110
right, then this on the way down would
have respected each level, but it didn't

8690
03:14:45,110 --> 03:14:45,120
have respected each level, but it didn't
 

8691
03:14:45,120 --> 03:14:46,710
have respected each level, but it didn't
have any structure. So, we're not going

8692
03:14:46,710 --> 03:14:46,720
have any structure. So, we're not going
 

8693
03:14:46,720 --> 03:14:47,910
have any structure. So, we're not going
to have structure on the way down

8694
03:14:47,910 --> 03:14:47,920
to have structure on the way down
 

8695
03:14:47,920 --> 03:14:49,429

either.
 

8697
03:14:49,439 --> 03:14:52,309
either.
Right? So Vshapes happen when we come

8698
03:14:52,309 --> 03:14:52,319
Right? So Vshapes happen when we come
 

8699
03:14:52,319 --> 03:14:55,990
Right? So Vshapes happen when we come
into areas where we have a huge buyer

8700
03:14:55,990 --> 03:14:56,000
into areas where we have a huge buyer
 

8701
03:14:56,000 --> 03:14:57,750
into areas where we have a huge buyer
waiting

8702

How much discount do I get on your code
 

8707
03:15:04,560 --> 03:15:05,910
How much discount do I get on your code
with funded next? I'm not sure at the

8708
03:15:05,910 --> 03:15:05,920
with funded next? I'm not sure at the
 

8709

moment to be honest. I'm genuinely not
 

8711
03:15:08,160 --> 03:15:11,110
moment to be honest. I'm genuinely not
sure. Um but it's always the maximum

8712
03:15:11,110 --> 03:15:11,120
sure. Um but it's always the maximum
 

8713
03:15:11,120 --> 03:15:21,269

8851
03:18:07,279 --> 03:18:09,750
go. Here we go, folks. We're going to
get that next hit. Here it comes.

8852
03:18:09,750 --> 03:18:09,760
get that next hit. Here it comes.
 

8853
03:18:09,760 --> 03:18:11,429
get that next hit. Here it comes.
Literally tagging into it. There you go.

8854
03:18:11,429 --> 03:18:11,439
Literally tagging into it. There you go.
 

8855

Literally tagging into it. There you go.
Just taken. So, your final one finally

8856
03:18:14,229 --> 03:18:14,239
Just taken. So, your final one finally
 

8857
03:18:14,239 --> 03:18:16,389
Just taken. So, your final one finally
came out there. There you go. See the

8858
03:18:16,389 --> 03:18:16,399
came out there. There you go. See the
 

8859
03:18:16,399 --> 03:18:18,469
came out there. There you go. See the
reaction around here. And the only thing

8860
03:18:18,469 --> 03:18:18,479
reaction around here. And the only thing
 

8861
03:18:18,479 --> 03:18:21,670
reaction around here. And the only thing
left now. The only thing left now is the

8862
03:18:21,670 --> 03:18:21,680
left now. The only thing left now is the
 

8863
03:18:21,680 --> 03:18:24,389
left now. The only thing left now is the
bottom of this blue box. And under that

8864
03:18:24,389 --> 03:18:24,399
bottom of this blue box. And under that
 

8865
03:18:24,399 --> 03:18:26,389
bottom of this blue box. And under that
I will have to put some new lines in. We

8866
03:18:26,389 --> 03:18:26,399
I will have to put some new lines in. We
 

8867
03:18:26,399 --> 03:18:28,229
I will have to put some new lines in. We
are getting very very weak. This is like

8868
03:18:28,229 --> 03:18:28,239
are getting very very weak. This is like
 

8869
03:18:28,239 --> 03:18:30,469
are getting very very weak. This is like
what we're talking about potential black

8870
03:18:30,469 --> 03:18:30,479
what we're talking about potential black
 

8871
03:18:30,479 --> 03:18:33,910
what we're talking about potential black
swan type events where we go outside of

8872
03:18:33,910 --> 03:18:33,920
swan type events where we go outside of
 

8873
03:18:33,920 --> 03:18:36,550
swan type events where we go outside of
uh two standard deviations. The reason I

8874
03:18:36,550 --> 03:18:36,560
uh two standard deviations. The reason I
 

8875
03:18:36,560 --> 03:18:37,670
uh two standard deviations. The reason I
thought that was probable is because

8876
03:18:37,670 --> 03:18:37,680
thought that was probable is because
 

8877
03:18:37,680 --> 03:18:39,510
thought that was probable is because
this like we talked about four standard

8878
03:18:39,510 --> 03:18:39,520
this like we talked about four standard
 

8879
03:18:39,520 --> 03:18:41,190
this like we talked about four standard
deviations recently has only been nine

8880
03:18:41,190 --> 03:18:41,200
deviations recently has only been nine
 

8881
03:18:41,200 --> 03:18:42,950
deviations recently has only been nine
points. Normally it's about 3 to 4,000

8882
03:18:42,950 --> 03:18:42,960
points. Normally it's about 3 to 4,000
 

8883
03:18:42,960 --> 03:18:45,990
points. Normally it's about 3 to 4,000
points. So, green line now taken. That

8884
03:18:45,990 --> 03:18:46,000
points. So, green line now taken. That
 

8885
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:49,510
points. So, green line now taken. That
is a

8886
03:18:49,510 --> 03:18:49,520

 

8887
03:18:49,520 --> 03:18:53,269

323 point trade if you took it. And I

8888
03:18:53,269 --> 03:18:53,279
323 point trade if you took it. And I
 

8889
03:18:53,279 --> 03:18:58,070
323 point trade if you took it. And I
would look for this next.

8890
03:18:58,070 --> 03:18:58,080

 

8891
03:18:58,080 --> 03:18:59,990

03:19:12,080 --> 03:19:14,070

Beautiful move. green line tags. So, we

8898
03:19:14,070 --> 03:19:14,080
Beautiful move. green line tags. So, we
 

8899
03:19:14,080 --> 03:19:15,349
Beautiful move. green line tags. So, we
can remove that green line now. We've

8900
03:19:15,349 --> 03:19:15,359
can remove that green line now. We've
 

8901
03:19:15,359 --> 03:19:18,150
can remove that green line now. We've
hit it. The only thing left now is the

8902
03:19:18,150 --> 03:19:18,160
hit it. The only thing left now is the
 

8903
03:19:18,160 --> 03:19:20,550
hit it. The only thing left now is the
bottom of the blue box. But, uh, like I

8904
03:19:20,550 --> 03:19:20,560
bottom of the blue box. But, uh, like I
 

8905
03:19:20,560 --> 03:19:21,830
bottom of the blue box. But, uh, like I
said, be done with it. I wouldn't, like

8906
03:19:21,830 --> 03:19:21,840
said, be done with it. I wouldn't, like
 

8907
03:19:21,840 --> 03:19:24,070
said, be done with it. I wouldn't, like
I said, I would not be long today. This

8908
03:19:24,070 --> 03:19:24,080
I said, I would not be long today. This
 

8909
03:19:24,080 --> 03:19:26,790
I said, I would not be long today. This
is a big sell day.

8910
03:19:26,790 --> 03:19:26,800
is a big sell day.
 

8911
03:19:26,800 --> 03:19:29,190
is a big sell day.

the daily now
we're starting to break away. Uh it's

8958
03:20:53,429 --> 03:20:53,439
we're starting to break away. Uh it's
 

8959
03:20:53,439 --> 03:20:56,229
we're starting to break away. Uh it's
very possible now we can trade 24800s.

8960
03:20:56,229 --> 03:20:56,239
very possible now we can trade 24800s.
 

8961
03:20:56,239 --> 03:20:58,469
very possible now we can trade 24800s.
Remember we talked about that 24800s is

Remember we talked about that 24800s is
 

8963
03:20:58,479 --> 03:21:01,590
Remember we talked about that 24800s is
possible now today. Uh based on these

8964
03:21:01,590 --> 03:21:01,600
possible now today. Uh based on these
 

8965
03:21:01,600 --> 03:21:03,349
possible now today. Uh based on these
nodes, look how we're leaving all this

8966
03:21:03,349 --> 03:21:03,359
nodes, look how we're leaving all this
 

8967
03:21:03,359 --> 03:21:05,910
nodes, look how we're leaving all this
volume. I've talked about this so many

8968
03:21:05,910 --> 03:21:05,920
volume. I've talked about this so many
 

8969
03:21:05,920 --> 03:21:08,550
volume. I've talked about this so many
times on stream, especially up here. We

8970
03:21:08,550 --> 03:21:08,560
times on stream, especially up here. We
 

8971
03:21:08,560 --> 03:21:10,790
times on stream, especially up here. We
left this volume. We're about to leave.

8972
03:21:10,790 --> 03:21:10,800
left this volume. We're about to leave.
 

8973
03:21:10,800 --> 03:21:12,469
left this volume. We're about to leave.
This is yearly. This is based on the

8974
03:21:12,469 --> 03:21:12,479
This is yearly. This is based on the
 

8975
03:21:12,479 --> 03:21:15,190
This is yearly. This is based on the
last 12 months. Understand that if we

8976
03:21:15,190 --> 03:21:15,200
last 12 months. Understand that if we
 

8977
03:21:15,200 --> 03:21:17,670
last 12 months. Understand that if we
leave all these participants stuck from

8978
03:21:17,670 --> 03:21:17,680
leave all these participants stuck from
 

8979
03:21:17,680 --> 03:21:19,429
leave all these participants stuck from
the last 12 months, we're going to keep

8980
03:21:19,429 --> 03:21:19,439
the last 12 months, we're going to keep
 

8981
03:21:19,439 --> 03:21:21,429
the last 12 months, we're going to keep
trading down this level. Then we get

8982
03:21:21,429 --> 03:21:21,439
trading down this level. Then we get
 

8983
03:21:21,439 --> 03:21:23,510
trading down this level. Then we get
thin this level. Guess what's there? A

8984
03:21:23,510 --> 03:21:23,520
thin this level. Guess what's there? A
 

8985
03:21:23,520 --> 03:21:25,590
thin this level. Guess what's there? A
big stop and the 200 day. That is my

8986
03:21:25,590 --> 03:21:25,600
big stop and the 200 day. That is my
 

8987
03:21:25,600 --> 03:21:27,670
big stop and the 200 day. That is my
target. That is my big old target that

8988
03:21:27,670 --> 03:21:27,680
target. That is my big old target that
 

8989
03:21:27,680 --> 03:21:38,870
target. That is my big old target that
I'd like to see hit.

8990
03:21:38,870 --> 03:21:38,880

 

8991
03:21:38,880 --> 03:21:42,309

Almost there. What is this blue box? Uh,

8992
03:21:42,309 --> 03:21:42,319
Almost there. What is this blue box? Uh,
 

8993
03:21:42,319 --> 03:21:45,269
Almost there. What is this blue box? Uh,
it is the pivot right down to the 25th

8994
03:21:45,269 --> 03:21:45,279
it is the pivot right down to the 25th
 

8995
03:21:45,279 --> 03:21:47,190
it is the pivot right down to the 25th
of November. Is the 25th, isn't it?

8996
03:21:47,190 --> 03:21:47,200
of November. Is the 25th, isn't it?
 

8997
03:21:47,200 --> 03:21:54,950
of November. Is the 25th, isn't it?
Yeah, 25th of November.

8998
03:21:54,950 --> 03:21:54,960

 

8999
03:21:54,960 --> 03:21:56,550

What order flow software do I think is

9000
03:21:56,550 --> 03:21:56,560
What order flow software do I think is
 

9001
03:21:56,560 --> 03:22:01,349
What order flow software do I think is
best? Um,

9002
03:22:01,349 --> 03:22:01,359

 

9003
03:22:01,359 --> 03:22:02,870

I use Quant Tower, but I feel there's

9004
03:22:02,870 --> 03:22:02,880
I use Quant Tower, but I feel there's
 

9005
03:22:02,880 --> 03:22:04,229
I use Quant Tower, but I feel there's
something missing. I I don't know what

9006
03:22:04,229 --> 03:22:04,239
something missing. I I don't know what
 

9007
03:22:04,239 --> 03:22:05,269
something missing. I I don't know what
you could get for Quant to Tower. I'm

9008
03:22:05,269 --> 03:22:05,279
you could get for Quant to Tower. I'm
 

9009
03:22:05,279 --> 03:22:06,309
you could get for Quant to Tower. I'm
sure there's something really good for

9010
03:22:06,309 --> 03:22:06,319
sure there's something really good for
 

9011
03:22:06,319 --> 03:22:13,590
sure there's something really good for
Quant Tower. Um, I use uh City by

9012
03:22:13,590 --> 03:22:13,600
Quant Tower. Um, I use uh City by
 

9013
03:22:13,600 --> 03:22:15,910
Quant Tower. Um, I use uh City by
um,

9014
03:22:15,910 --> 03:22:15,920
um,
 

9015
03:22:15,920 --> 03:22:18,630
um,
Twin Peaks is what I use. Okay. So, bit

9016
03:22:18,630 --> 03:22:18,640
Twin Peaks is what I use. Okay. So, bit
 

9017
03:22:18,640 --> 03:22:19,830
Twin Peaks is what I use. Okay. So, bit
of a bid in front of the bottom of this

9018
03:22:19,830 --> 03:22:19,840
of a bid in front of the bottom of this
 

9019
03:22:19,840 --> 03:22:22,950
of a bid in front of the bottom of this
blue box here. Probably look to resell

9020
03:22:22,950 --> 03:22:22,960
blue box here. Probably look to resell
 

9021
03:22:22,960 --> 03:22:24,790
blue box here. Probably look to resell
it around 46es. I would not be selling

9022
03:22:24,790 --> 03:22:24,800
it around 46es. I would not be selling
 

9023
03:22:24,800 --> 03:22:26,469
it around 46es. I would not be selling
these lows. Okay. I would not be selling

9024
03:22:26,469 --> 03:22:26,479
these lows. Okay. I would not be selling
 

9025
03:22:26,479 --> 03:22:29,429
these lows. Okay. I would not be selling
these lows, but there's a bit of a edge

9026
03:22:29,429 --> 03:22:29,439
these lows, but there's a bit of a edge
 

9027
03:22:29,439 --> 03:22:32,150
these lows, but there's a bit of a edge
now being developed down here. There's

9028
03:22:32,150 --> 03:22:32,160
now being developed down here. There's
 

9029
03:22:32,160 --> 03:22:34,150
now being developed down here. There's
the drive back in towards 46es. If they

9030
03:22:34,150 --> 03:22:34,160
the drive back in towards 46es. If they
 

9031
03:22:34,160 --> 03:22:35,510
the drive back in towards 46es. If they
want to resell it and finish this and

9032
03:22:35,510 --> 03:22:35,520
want to resell it and finish this and
 

9033
03:22:35,520 --> 03:22:44,550
want to resell it and finish this and
clean this up, they will.

9034
03:22:44,550 --> 03:22:44,560

 

9035
03:22:44,560 --> 03:22:46,229

Nice. Nice work everyone. Lots of you

9036
03:22:46,229 --> 03:22:46,239
Nice. Nice work everyone. Lots of you
 

9037
03:22:46,239 --> 03:22:51,429
Nice. Nice work everyone. Lots of you
got that. That's awesome.

9038
03:22:51,429 --> 03:22:51,439

 

9039
03:22:51,439 --> 03:22:53,190

What account size best? Small accounts,

9040
03:22:53,190 --> 03:22:53,200
What account size best? Small accounts,
 

9041
03:22:53,200 --> 03:22:58,550
What account size best? Small accounts,
25 or 50K account? 50k count's great.

9042
03:22:58,550 --> 03:22:58,560

 

9043
03:22:58,560 --> 03:23:00,309

They're still rejecting this new shelf

9044
03:23:00,309 --> 03:23:00,319
They're still rejecting this new shelf
 

9045
03:23:00,319 --> 03:23:02,070
They're still rejecting this new shelf
now where we just broke down from.

9046
03:23:02,070 --> 03:23:02,080
now where we just broke down from.
 

9047
03:23:02,080 --> 03:23:03,830
now where we just broke down from.
Remember, we're thin up. Don't want it

9048
03:23:03,830 --> 03:23:03,840
Remember, we're thin up. Don't want it
 

9049
03:23:03,840 --> 03:23:05,190
Remember, we're thin up. Don't want it
reclaiming all of this. Otherwise, it's

9050
03:23:05,190 --> 03:23:05,200
reclaiming all of this. Otherwise, it's
 

9051
03:23:05,200 --> 03:23:06,309
reclaiming all of this. Otherwise, it's
going to come right up into here. But if

9052
03:23:06,309 --> 03:23:06,319
going to come right up into here. But if
 

9053
03:23:06,319 --> 03:23:07,990
going to come right up into here. But if
they keep rejecting this, they can

9054
03:23:07,990 --> 03:23:08,000
they keep rejecting this, they can
 

9055
03:23:08,000 --> 03:23:09,429
they keep rejecting this, they can
potentially come down to the lows. Let's

9056
03:23:09,429 --> 03:23:09,439
potentially come down to the lows. Let's
 

9057
03:23:09,439 --> 03:23:10,870
potentially come down to the lows. Let's
just check to the low of day of auction.

9058
03:23:10,870 --> 03:23:10,880
just check to the low of day of auction.
 

9059
03:23:10,880 --> 03:23:12,150
just check to the low of day of auction.
So, they're coming for this imbalance

9060
03:23:12,150 --> 03:23:12,160
So, they're coming for this imbalance
 

9061
03:23:12,160 --> 03:23:14,229
So, they're coming for this imbalance
here where we just sold from. It's not

9062
03:23:14,229 --> 03:23:14,239
here where we just sold from. It's not
 

9063
03:23:14,239 --> 03:23:16,389
here where we just sold from. It's not
bad excess at the low. So, this is key.

9064
03:23:16,389 --> 03:23:16,399
bad excess at the low. So, this is key.
 

9065
03:23:16,399 --> 03:23:18,950
bad excess at the low. So, this is key.
Now, this is the imbalance where we just

9066
03:23:18,950 --> 03:23:18,960
Now, this is the imbalance where we just
 

9067
03:23:18,960 --> 03:23:21,670
Now, this is the imbalance where we just
sold from. Why does it do that? Right.

9068
03:23:21,670 --> 03:23:21,680
sold from. Why does it do that? Right.
 

9069
03:23:21,680 --> 03:23:22,870
sold from. Why does it do that? Right.
So, we're trading back into where we

9070
03:23:22,870 --> 03:23:22,880
So, we're trading back into where we
 

9071
03:23:22,880 --> 03:23:24,229
So, we're trading back into where we
just sold from. If they resell it,

9072
03:23:24,229 --> 03:23:24,239
just sold from. If they resell it,
 

9073
03:23:24,239 --> 03:23:30,790
just sold from. If they resell it,
they'll come back to these lows. Now,

9074
03:23:30,790 --> 03:23:30,800

 

9075
03:23:30,800 --> 03:23:32,389

do not I, like I said, I would not be

9076
03:23:32,389 --> 03:23:32,399
do not I, like I said, I would not be
 

9077
03:23:32,399 --> 03:23:35,269
do not I, like I said, I would not be
longing this. You're asking for it. Here

9078
03:23:35,269 --> 03:23:35,279
longing this. You're asking for it. Here
 

9079
03:23:35,279 --> 03:23:37,349
longing this. You're asking for it. Here
we go.

9080
03:23:37,349 --> 03:23:37,359
we go.
 

9081
03:23:37,359 --> 03:23:39,670
we go.
And a break now will take you to the

9082
03:23:39,670 --> 03:23:39,680
And a break now will take you to the
 

9083
03:23:39,680 --> 03:23:41,269
And a break now will take you to the
850s.

9084
03:23:41,269 --> 03:23:41,279
850s.
 

9085
03:23:41,279 --> 03:23:42,950
850s.
ES, by the way, is finally taking out

9086
03:23:42,950 --> 03:23:42,960
ES, by the way, is finally taking out
 

9087
03:23:42,960 --> 03:23:44,870
ES, by the way, is finally taking out
its key levels. So, ES did that move.

9088
03:23:44,870 --> 03:23:44,880
its key levels. So, ES did that move.
 

9089
03:23:44,880 --> 03:23:45,910
its key levels. So, ES did that move.
Remember, we talked about the green

9090
03:23:45,910 --> 03:23:45,920
Remember, we talked about the green
 

9091
03:23:45,920 --> 03:23:47,670
Remember, we talked about the green
lines on ES. It needs to take out those

9092
03:23:47,670 --> 03:23:47,680
lines on ES. It needs to take out those
 

9093
03:23:47,680 --> 03:23:49,830
lines on ES. It needs to take out those
green lines. And look at there. There

9094
03:23:49,830 --> 03:23:49,840
green lines. And look at there. There
 

9095
03:23:49,840 --> 03:23:51,670
green lines. And look at there. There
you go. So ES now completed the move

9096
03:23:51,670 --> 03:23:51,680
you go. So ES now completed the move
 

9097
03:23:51,680 --> 03:23:54,550
you go. So ES now completed the move
that we did at the start of the day and

9098
03:23:54,550 --> 03:23:54,560
that we did at the start of the day and
 

9099
03:23:54,560 --> 03:23:56,550
that we did at the start of the day and
if ES stays weak under this you will see

9100
03:23:56,550 --> 03:23:56,560
if ES stays weak under this you will see
 

9101
03:23:56,560 --> 03:24:03,830
if ES stays weak under this you will see
continuation on NQ.

9102
03:24:03,830 --> 03:24:03,840

 

9103
03:24:03,840 --> 03:24:05,750

Why can't orderflow get students get

9104
03:24:05,750 --> 03:24:05,760
Why can't orderflow get students get
 

9105
03:24:05,760 --> 03:24:08,309
Why can't orderflow get students get
into the discord? Because it the discord

9106
03:24:08,309 --> 03:24:08,319
into the discord? Because it the discord
 

9107
03:24:08,319 --> 03:24:10,870
into the discord? Because it the discord
is like it teaches how I trade in

9108
03:24:10,870 --> 03:24:10,880
is like it teaches how I trade in
 

9109
03:24:10,880 --> 03:24:13,910
is like it teaches how I trade in
general like how I position myself what

9110
03:24:13,910 --> 03:24:13,920
general like how I position myself what
 

9111
03:24:13,920 --> 03:24:15,990
general like how I position myself what
I'm looking for the patterns all this

9112
03:24:15,990 --> 03:24:16,000
I'm looking for the patterns all this
 

9113
03:24:16,000 --> 03:24:18,550
I'm looking for the patterns all this
stuff. If you trade order flow and

9114
03:24:18,550 --> 03:24:18,560
stuff. If you trade order flow and
 

9115
03:24:18,560 --> 03:24:20,710
stuff. If you trade order flow and
you're constantly looking for reversals,

9116
03:24:20,710 --> 03:24:20,720
you're constantly looking for reversals,
 

9117
03:24:20,720 --> 03:24:22,150
you're constantly looking for reversals,
you're going to really hurt students who

9118
03:24:22,150 --> 03:24:22,160
you're going to really hurt students who
 

9119
03:24:22,160 --> 03:24:24,070
you're going to really hurt students who
are like continuation traders if you

9120
03:24:24,070 --> 03:24:24,080
are like continuation traders if you
 

9121
03:24:24,080 --> 03:24:26,229
are like continuation traders if you
like. So the order flow teaches you how

9122
03:24:26,229 --> 03:24:26,239
like. So the order flow teaches you how
 

9123
03:24:26,239 --> 03:24:27,429
like. So the order flow teaches you how
to trade order flow, but it doesn't

9124
03:24:27,429 --> 03:24:27,439
to trade order flow, but it doesn't
 

9125
03:24:27,439 --> 03:24:29,269
to trade order flow, but it doesn't
teach you on like the setups necessarily

9126
03:24:29,269 --> 03:24:29,279
teach you on like the setups necessarily
 

9127
03:24:29,279 --> 03:24:31,510
teach you on like the setups necessarily
that we're looking for. Um, so it would

9128
03:24:31,510 --> 03:24:31,520
that we're looking for. Um, so it would
 

9129
03:24:31,520 --> 03:24:33,269
that we're looking for. Um, so it would
just it would be problematic to the

9130
03:24:33,269 --> 03:24:33,279
just it would be problematic to the
 

9131
03:24:33,279 --> 03:24:36,150
just it would be problematic to the
students in Discord. I think it would

9132
03:24:36,150 --> 03:24:36,160
students in Discord. I think it would
 

9133
03:24:36,160 --> 03:24:37,750
students in Discord. I think it would
cause too many I thought about it a few

9134
03:24:37,750 --> 03:24:37,760
cause too many I thought about it a few
 

9135
03:24:37,760 --> 03:24:40,150
cause too many I thought about it a few
times, but I don't want students trading

9136
03:24:40,150 --> 03:24:40,160
times, but I don't want students trading
 

9137
03:24:40,160 --> 03:24:41,590
times, but I don't want students trading
like different directions. I want them

9138
03:24:41,590 --> 03:24:41,600
like different directions. I want them
 

9139
03:24:41,600 --> 03:24:43,110
like different directions. I want them
to support each other. It creates like

9140
03:24:43,110 --> 03:24:43,120
to support each other. It creates like
 

9141
03:24:43,120 --> 03:24:47,030
to support each other. It creates like
the best possible uh environment for

9142
03:24:47,030 --> 03:24:47,040
the best possible uh environment for
 

9143
03:24:47,040 --> 03:24:48,469
the best possible uh environment for
them to trade together, especially when

9144
03:24:48,469 --> 03:24:48,479
them to trade together, especially when
 

9145
03:24:48,479 --> 03:24:49,750
them to trade together, especially when
I'm not there. That's the only reason

9146
03:24:49,750 --> 03:24:49,760
I'm not there. That's the only reason
 

9147
03:24:49,760 --> 03:25:03,510
I'm not there. That's the only reason
why.

9148
03:25:03,510 --> 03:25:03,520

 

9149
03:25:03,520 --> 03:25:05,349

Well, and that there you go. And if and

9150
03:25:05,349 --> 03:25:05,359
Well, and that there you go. And if and
 

9151
03:25:05,359 --> 03:25:06,950
Well, and that there you go. And if and
if people pay less and get in, then

9152
03:25:06,950 --> 03:25:06,960
if people pay less and get in, then
 

9153
03:25:06,960 --> 03:25:08,710
if people pay less and get in, then
everyone else be upset. Yeah, fair

9154
03:25:08,710 --> 03:25:08,720
everyone else be upset. Yeah, fair
 

9155
03:25:08,720 --> 03:25:09,830
everyone else be upset. Yeah, fair
enough. Hadn't even thought of that,

9156
03:25:09,830 --> 03:25:09,840
enough. Hadn't even thought of that,
 

9157
03:25:09,840 --> 03:25:11,349
enough. Hadn't even thought of that,
