Especially if you're going to look at

46
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:14,560
Especially if you're going to look at
 

47
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,350
Especially if you're going to look at
ETFs as a bit of a hint for you. Okay,

ETFs as a bit of a hint for you. Okay,
so what have we seen? Well, we broke

50
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
so what have we seen? Well, we broke
 

51
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,350
so what have we seen? Well, we broke
range last week. Friday went into a

52
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
range last week. Friday went into a
 

53
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,469
range last week. Friday went into a
strong sell. Monday continued that sell.

54
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
strong sell. Monday continued that sell.
 

55
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,189
strong sell. Monday continued that sell.
Tuesday gap down into the old point of

56
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
Tuesday gap down into the old point of
 

57
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,510
Tuesday gap down into the old point of
control on the old weekly candle like we

58
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
control on the old weekly candle like we
 

59
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,189
control on the old weekly candle like we
predicted

60
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
predicted
 

61
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,909
predicted
in the weekly newsletter and on Monday's

62
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
in the weekly newsletter and on Monday's
 

63
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,990
in the weekly newsletter and on Monday's
morning session. Once we got there, it

64
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
morning session. Once we got there, it
 

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,909
morning session. Once we got there, it
is likely that buyers will try and

66
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
is likely that buyers will try and
 

67
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,830
is likely that buyers will try and
defend that level. All right, this is al

68
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
defend that level. All right, this is al
 

69
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,070
defend that level. All right, this is al
also over 50% of a pullback. All right.

70
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
also over 50% of a pullback. All right.
 

71
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,670
also over 50% of a pullback. All right.
So, it's a level that they are

72
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
So, it's a level that they are
 

73
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,189
So, it's a level that they are
interested in defending. Now, if we look

74
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
interested in defending. Now, if we look
 

75
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,189
interested in defending. Now, if we look
at the yearly profile, you can see we've

76
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
at the yearly profile, you can see we've
 

77
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,270
at the yearly profile, you can see we've
started developing quite a thick area

78
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
started developing quite a thick area
 

79
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,950
started developing quite a thick area
here between this red box and blue box,

80
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
here between this red box and blue box,
 

81
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,029
here between this red box and blue box,
which surprise surprise is pretty much

82
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
which surprise surprise is pretty much
 

83
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,029
which surprise surprise is pretty much
the weekly range right now. All right.

84
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
the weekly range right now. All right.
 

85
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,350
the weekly range right now. All right.
So, it's a big big big level that we're

86
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
So, it's a big big big level that we're
 

87
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,749
So, it's a big big big level that we're
looking at at the moment. So, we need to

88
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
looking at at the moment. So, we need to
 

89
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,150
looking at at the moment. So, we need to
be careful of rotations. When we

90
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
be careful of rotations. When we
 

91
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,469
be careful of rotations. When we
consider this current high of day we've

92
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
consider this current high of day we've
 

93
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,270
consider this current high of day we've
put in overnight and we consider this

94
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
put in overnight and we consider this
 

95
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,830
put in overnight and we consider this
edge and we consider where we broke from

96
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
edge and we consider where we broke from
 

97
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,309
edge and we consider where we broke from
and we also look at the EMAs. What do we

98
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
and we also look at the EMAs. What do we
 

99
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,469
and we also look at the EMAs. What do we
have? Well, we have every single cluster

100
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
have? Well, we have every single cluster
 

101
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,309
have? Well, we have every single cluster
there. All right, 5day, 20-day, 50-day

102
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
there. All right, 5day, 20-day, 50-day
 

103
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,469
there. All right, 5day, 20-day, 50-day
all here. This is a big level. Don't be

104
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479
all here. This is a big level. Don't be
 

105
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,309
all here. This is a big level. Don't be
surprised if we do a dance like this for

106
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
surprised if we do a dance like this for
 

107
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,830
surprised if we do a dance like this for
a while. It's going to have to make up

108
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
a while. It's going to have to make up
 

109
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,909
a while. It's going to have to make up
its mind. If we're going to see

110
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:33,919
its mind. If we're going to see
 

111
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,150
its mind. If we're going to see
rejection here, all right, then today

112
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
rejection here, all right, then today
 

113
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,670
rejection here, all right, then today
you could think about a look above and

114
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
you could think about a look above and
 

115
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,189
you could think about a look above and
fell. Remember, there's not much news

116
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
fell. Remember, there's not much news
 

117
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,710
fell. Remember, there's not much news
coming today. When's all the news

118
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720
coming today. When's all the news
 

119
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,830
coming today. When's all the news
coming? Tomorrow and Friday and the uh

120
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:43,840
coming? Tomorrow and Friday and the uh
 

121
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,150
coming? Tomorrow and Friday and the uh
carry trade as well coming Friday and

122
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
carry trade as well coming Friday and
 

123
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,070
carry trade as well coming Friday and
over the weekend. So, I would be

124
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
over the weekend. So, I would be
 

125
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,230
over the weekend. So, I would be
somewhat aware of this low volume node

126
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
somewhat aware of this low volume node
 

127
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,710
somewhat aware of this low volume node
here. Any traps that they want to set in

128
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
here. Any traps that they want to set in
 

129
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,309
here. Any traps that they want to set in
here. Now, if we find acceptance back

130
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,319
here. Now, if we find acceptance back
 

131
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,230
here. Now, if we find acceptance back
into the old weekly range, sure, we can

132
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
into the old weekly range, sure, we can
 

133
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,390
into the old weekly range, sure, we can
rotate in here into Christmas. But

134
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
rotate in here into Christmas. But
 

135
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,589
rotate in here into Christmas. But
right now, we are literally in balance.

136
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
right now, we are literally in balance.
 

137
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,350
right now, we are literally in balance.
There's flat. There's plus two standard

138
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
There's flat. There's plus two standard
 

139
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,270
There's flat. There's plus two standard
deviation. There's minus2. Here's your

140
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
deviation. There's minus2. Here's your
 

141
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,390
deviation. There's minus2. Here's your
zero line. All right. Just be cautious.

142
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
zero line. All right. Just be cautious.
 

143
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,350
zero line. All right. Just be cautious.
I would say like there's no big big A+

144
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
I would say like there's no big big A+
 

145
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,510
I would say like there's no big big A+
trade. The A+ trade was that down and

146
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
trade. The A+ trade was that down and
 

147
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,189
trade. The A+ trade was that down and
was probably that back up and they made

148
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
was probably that back up and they made
 

149
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,589
was probably that back up and they made
that very choppy. Uh now we just have to

150
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,599
that very choppy. Uh now we just have to
 

151
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,749
that very choppy. Uh now we just have to
wait and see what we do. Now we can find

152
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
wait and see what we do. Now we can find
 

153
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,589
wait and see what we do. Now we can find
a little bit more edge here as we move

154
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
a little bit more edge here as we move
 

155
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,150
a little bit more edge here as we move
into the hourly charts. Right. So, let's

156
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
into the hourly charts. Right. So, let's
 

157
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,469
into the hourly charts. Right. So, let's
just move into the Actually, before I do

158
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
just move into the Actually, before I do
 

159
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,150
just move into the Actually, before I do
that,

160
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
that,
 

161
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,510
that,
uh make a note of uh these weekly levels

162
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
uh make a note of uh these weekly levels
 

163
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,670
uh make a note of uh these weekly levels
cuz if you're on the new contract, it's

164
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
cuz if you're on the new contract, it's
 

165
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,110
cuz if you're on the new contract, it's
going to show you the weekly levels down

166
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
going to show you the weekly levels down
 

167
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,629
going to show you the weekly levels down
there. They are incorrect. All right,

168
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
there. They are incorrect. All right,
 

169
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,150
there. They are incorrect. All right,
they're incorrect. So, make a note of

170
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
they're incorrect. So, make a note of
 

171
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,990
they're incorrect. So, make a note of
these weekly levels. Your previous week

172
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
these weekly levels. Your previous week
 

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,270
these weekly levels. Your previous week
low, uh value low, 741. That's the main

174
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
low, uh value low, 741. That's the main
 

175
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,790
low, uh value low, 741. That's the main
one that you probably need to be looking

176
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
one that you probably need to be looking
 

177
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,870
one that you probably need to be looking
at right now.

178
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:48,880
at right now.
 

179
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,589
at right now.
All right, into the hourlys. Just focus

180
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
All right, into the hourlys. Just focus
 

181
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,430
All right, into the hourlys. Just focus
on here with me. Let's move this down.

182
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
on here with me. Let's move this down.
 

183
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,749
on here with me. Let's move this down.
Focus on here. This right here is the

184
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
Focus on here. This right here is the
 

185
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,909
Focus on here. This right here is the
current weekly profile, the developing

186
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
current weekly profile, the developing
 

187
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,350
current weekly profile, the developing
weekly profile. You can see for now we

188
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
weekly profile. You can see for now we
 

189
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,749
weekly profile. You can see for now we
are trying to find a bid outside of it.

190
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
are trying to find a bid outside of it.
 

191
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,510
are trying to find a bid outside of it.
So what did we do yesterday? As a

192
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
So what did we do yesterday? As a
 

193
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,430
So what did we do yesterday? As a
reminder, here's your old naked point of

194
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
reminder, here's your old naked point of
 

195
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,589
reminder, here's your old naked point of
control. We drifted under it overnight.

196
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
control. We drifted under it overnight.
 

197
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,510
control. We drifted under it overnight.
We back tested it. We held it in New

198
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
We back tested it. We held it in New
 

199
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,110
We back tested it. We held it in New
York. We went very, very, very, very

200
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
York. We went very, very, very, very
 

201
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,350
York. We went very, very, very, very
choppy, but we held that naked point of

202
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
choppy, but we held that naked point of
 

203
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,830
choppy, but we held that naked point of
control. This was the buy zone that I

204
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
control. This was the buy zone that I
 

205
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,110
control. This was the buy zone that I
kept talking about earlier in the week

206
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
kept talking about earlier in the week
 

207
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,390
kept talking about earlier in the week
and back end of last week and the

208
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
and back end of last week and the
 

209
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,550
and back end of last week and the
newsletter where we'd probably find a

210
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
newsletter where we'd probably find a
 

211
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,029
newsletter where we'd probably find a
dip. All right, this was your 930 on the

212
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
dip. All right, this was your 930 on the
 

213
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,990
dip. All right, this was your 930 on the
old contract 930 level.

214
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
old contract 930 level.
 

215
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,909
old contract 930 level.
So since then, we are now building out

216
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919
So since then, we are now building out
 

217
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,670
So since then, we are now building out
one of these, aren't we? Right, there's

218
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
one of these, aren't we? Right, there's
 

219
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,110
one of these, aren't we? Right, there's
a new channel being built out. The

220
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
a new channel being built out. The
 

221
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,670
a new channel being built out. The
question is, is this a continuation

222
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
question is, is this a continuation
 

223
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,269
question is, is this a continuation
channel to sell? Because I'd say the

224
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
channel to sell? Because I'd say the
 

225
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,310
channel to sell? Because I'd say the
strong high is there, the low is there.

226
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
strong high is there, the low is there.
 

227
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,469
strong high is there, the low is there.
This is your swing point. Right now, we

228
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
This is your swing point. Right now, we
 

229
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,790
This is your swing point. Right now, we
are trading within this swing point and

230
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
are trading within this swing point and
 

231
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,550
are trading within this swing point and
we just failed at 70 fib. So I'd be

232
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
we just failed at 70 fib. So I'd be
 

233
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,230
we just failed at 70 fib. So I'd be
aware of that. I'd be aware of this

234
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
aware of that. I'd be aware of this
 

235
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,630
aware of that. I'd be aware of this
channel, right? We're not technically

236
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
channel, right? We're not technically
 

237
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,310
channel, right? We're not technically
backside until we let go of this

238
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
backside until we let go of this
 

239
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,070
backside until we let go of this
channel. It's possible it might want to

240
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,080
channel. It's possible it might want to
 

241
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,990
channel. It's possible it might want to
come and sweep this high, maybe repric

242
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
come and sweep this high, maybe repric
 

243
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,509
come and sweep this high, maybe repric
some of this low volume node. All of

244
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
some of this low volume node. All of
 

245
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,350
some of this low volume node. All of
these things are possible. So, we need

246
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
these things are possible. So, we need
 

247
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,790
these things are possible. So, we need
to be aware of that. So, what does that

248
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
to be aware of that. So, what does that
 

249
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,470
to be aware of that. So, what does that
mean? There's two plays really I would

250
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
mean? There's two plays really I would
 

251
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,269
mean? There's two plays really I would
be looking at for today. If you're going

252
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279
be looking at for today. If you're going
 

253
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,829
be looking at for today. If you're going
to look for the fail breaker out or the

254
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
to look for the fail breaker out or the
 

255
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,829
to look for the fail breaker out or the
look above and fail, you really want to

256
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
look above and fail, you really want to
 

257
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,350
look above and fail, you really want to
take out this high here, 520s into this

258
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
take out this high here, 520s into this
 

259
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,949
take out this high here, 520s into this
low volume node, and you want to see

260
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
low volume node, and you want to see
 

261
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,430
low volume node, and you want to see
sellers come in and absolutely smack

262
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
sellers come in and absolutely smack
 

263
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,750
sellers come in and absolutely smack
that back down and produce one of these

264
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760
that back down and produce one of these
 

265
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,150
that back down and produce one of these
for a trade back inside this range. All

266
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
for a trade back inside this range. All
 

267
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,990
for a trade back inside this range. All
right, so your short opportunity will be

268
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
right, so your short opportunity will be
 

269
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,190
right, so your short opportunity will be
a rejection up here or an ad here. Um, I

270
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,200
a rejection up here or an ad here. Um, I
 

271
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,590
a rejection up here or an ad here. Um, I
would avoid trading in here like the

272
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
would avoid trading in here like the
 

273
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,230
would avoid trading in here like the
plague, folks. All right. I would not be

274
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,240
plague, folks. All right. I would not be
 

275
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,509
plague, folks. All right. I would not be
uh trading anywhere in let's call it

276
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
uh trading anywhere in let's call it
 

277
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,190
uh trading anywhere in let's call it
330s to 220s. Try and leave that alone.

278
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
330s to 220s. Try and leave that alone.
 

279
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,110
330s to 220s. Try and leave that alone.
You can see what's happened there. All

280
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
You can see what's happened there. All
 

281
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,630
You can see what's happened there. All
right, that is your liquidity build

282
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
right, that is your liquidity build
 

283
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,430
right, that is your liquidity build
area. For me, the easiest move if you're

284
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
area. For me, the easiest move if you're
 

285
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,030
area. For me, the easiest move if you're
going to play short is going to be

286
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040
going to play short is going to be
 

287
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,630
going to play short is going to be
trying to sell that back into that

288
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
trying to sell that back into that
 

289
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,350
trying to sell that back into that
range. If you're looking for longs, it's

290
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
range. If you're looking for longs, it's
 

291
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,949
range. If you're looking for longs, it's
pretty simple. Either we hold the

292
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
pretty simple. Either we hold the
 

293
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,829
pretty simple. Either we hold the
current uh developing weekly profile or

294
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
current uh developing weekly profile or
 

295
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,949
current uh developing weekly profile or
more likely this move back into the

296
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
more likely this move back into the
 

297
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,790
more likely this move back into the
previous day. All right, previous day

298
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:02,800
previous day. All right, previous day
 

299
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,110
previous day. All right, previous day
value area high to find a bid around

300
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
value area high to find a bid around
 

301
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,790
value area high to find a bid around
here. There's lots of confluence around

302
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
here. There's lots of confluence around
 

303
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,750
here. There's lots of confluence around
this sort of 350 320 area. All right, so

304
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
this sort of 350 320 area. All right, so
 

305
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,750
this sort of 350 320 area. All right, so
something like this up that would be

306
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
something like this up that would be
 

307
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,389
something like this up that would be
TP1. And if you get lucky, you get a

308
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
TP1. And if you get lucky, you get a
 

309
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,590
TP1. And if you get lucky, you get a
move like that. All right, that would be

310
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
move like that. All right, that would be
 

311
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,269
move like that. All right, that would be
a 200 point banger if you get that

312
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279
a 200 point banger if you get that
 

313
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,509
a 200 point banger if you get that
today. Would be fantastic. Those are the

314
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
today. Would be fantastic. Those are the
 

315
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,269
today. Would be fantastic. Those are the
two moves. If we just come back in here

316
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:21,279
two moves. If we just come back in here
 

317
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,430
two moves. If we just come back in here
and do this,

318
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
and do this,
 

319
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,750
and do this,
right, no trade day for Alex. I'm going

320
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
right, no trade day for Alex. I'm going
 

321
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,190
right, no trade day for Alex. I'm going
to make that clear now. If we're going

322
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
to make that clear now. If we're going
 

323
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,350
to make that clear now. If we're going
to trade inside yesterday's range, I am

324
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:29,360
to trade inside yesterday's range, I am
 

325
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,630
to trade inside yesterday's range, I am
not interested. I'm going to just

326
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:30,640
not interested. I'm going to just
 

327
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,190
not interested. I'm going to just
measure that out just to make triple

328
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,200
measure that out just to make triple
 

329
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,350
measure that out just to make triple
triple sure. But I'm pretty sure that's

330
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
triple sure. But I'm pretty sure that's
 

331
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,949
triple sure. But I'm pretty sure that's
accurate what I put out there. Let me

332
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
accurate what I put out there. Let me
 

333
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,870
accurate what I put out there. Let me
just check just in case.

334
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
just check just in case.
 

335
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,470
just check just in case.

Yeah, that's good. That's good. All
 

341
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,590
Yeah, that's good. That's good. All
right. So, those are the two plays. Look

342
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
right. So, those are the two plays. Look
 

343
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,230
right. So, those are the two plays. Look
above and fail or dips inside that hold.

344
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
above and fail or dips inside that hold.
 

345
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,750
above and fail or dips inside that hold.
Not going to trade yesterday's range,

346
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
Not going to trade yesterday's range,
 

347
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,710
Not going to trade yesterday's range,
right? Keep it nice and simple. Keep it

348
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
right? Keep it nice and simple. Keep it
 

349
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,790
right? Keep it nice and simple. Keep it
nice and simple because there's no big

350
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
nice and simple because there's no big
 

351
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,590
nice and simple because there's no big
news drivers today. All right. So, it's

352
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
news drivers today. All right. So, it's
 

353
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,630
news drivers today. All right. So, it's
very very very very very very

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
very very very very very very
 

355
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,590
very very very very very very
possible that today is just like some of

possible that today is just like some of
 

357
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,269
possible that today is just like some of
this and maybe a little fail break,

358
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279
this and maybe a little fail break,
 

359
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,630
this and maybe a little fail break,
maybe a little fail break. It's very

00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
maybe a little fail break. It's very
 

361
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,150
maybe a little fail break. It's very
very possible that we do something like

362
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
very possible that we do something like
 

363
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,550
very possible that we do something like
that today. Don't go giving your gains

364
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
that today. Don't go giving your gains
 

365
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,230
that today. Don't go giving your gains
back. All right? Don't go giving your

gains back.
And what did we do overnight? We can

370
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
And what did we do overnight? We can
 

371
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,870
And what did we do overnight? We can
have a look at overnight. All right.

372
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
have a look at overnight. All right.
 

373
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,790
have a look at overnight. All right.
Asia found a bid. All right. So that big

374
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:26,800
Asia found a bid. All right. So that big
 

375
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,430
Asia found a bid. All right. So that big
drive yesterday uh in Discord we caught

376
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,440
drive yesterday uh in Discord we caught
 

377
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,829
drive yesterday uh in Discord we caught
it from down here. We were long in the

378
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
it from down here. We were long in the
 

379
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,350
it from down here. We were long in the
afternoon

380
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
afternoon
 

381
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,310
afternoon
uh 200 around the 200s. 220 was the trap

382
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
uh 200 around the 200s. 220 was the trap
 

383
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,670
uh 200 around the 200s. 220 was the trap
level. That's where bears got trapped

384
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680
level. That's where bears got trapped
 

385
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,670
level. That's where bears got trapped
and we played long. Very proud of a lot

386
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
and we played long. Very proud of a lot
 

387
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,670
and we played long. Very proud of a lot
of them got 100 points. I don't know if

388
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
of them got 100 points. I don't know if
 

389
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,350
of them got 100 points. I don't know if
any of them sat in more of it for the

390
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
any of them sat in more of it for the
 

391
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,670
any of them sat in more of it for the
next dip. Um we missed my target. My

392
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:45,680
next dip. Um we missed my target. My
 

393
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,430
next dip. Um we missed my target. My
target was 450. We missed it by six

394
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
target was 450. We missed it by six
 

395
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,350
target was 450. We missed it by six
points. My final target, but it was

396
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
points. My final target, but it was
 

397
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,350
points. My final target, but it was
there or thereabouts. And then

398
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
there or thereabouts. And then
 

399
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,110
there or thereabouts. And then
overnight, what have we done? Well,

400
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
overnight, what have we done? Well,
 

401
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,710
overnight, what have we done? Well,
after we came up to that target, there

402
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
after we came up to that target, there
 

403
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,710
after we came up to that target, there
was a big puke out overnight. We've gone

404
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
was a big puke out overnight. We've gone
 

405
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,389
was a big puke out overnight. We've gone
sideways, but we are holding the top

406
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
sideways, but we are holding the top
 

407
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,389
sideways, but we are holding the top
side of this range and you're seeing

408
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
side of this range and you're seeing
 

409
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,550
side of this range and you're seeing
expansion higher coming to back test

410
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
expansion higher coming to back test
 

411
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,829
expansion higher coming to back test
this 20-day and 5day. So, new range

412
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:05,839
this 20-day and 5day. So, new range
 

413
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,990
this 20-day and 5day. So, new range
maybe to be created here. We will see.

414
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
maybe to be created here. We will see.
 

415
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,590
maybe to be created here. We will see.
We will see. Nice and slow this morning.

416
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
We will see. Nice and slow this morning.
 

417
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,750
We will see. Nice and slow this morning.
I'm not going to be attacking it uh out

418
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
I'm not going to be attacking it uh out
 

419
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,750
I'm not going to be attacking it uh out
the gate, I don't think. Okay, let's

420
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
the gate, I don't think. Okay, let's
 

421
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,870
the gate, I don't think. Okay, let's
have a look what else we have going on.

422
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
have a look what else we have going on.
 

423
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,110
have a look what else we have going on.
We'll have a quick look at the ES and

424
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,120
We'll have a quick look at the ES and
 

425
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,670
We'll have a quick look at the ES and
the spiders and the Q's and the VIX and

426
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680
the spiders and the Q's and the VIX and
 

427
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,069
the spiders and the Q's and the VIX and
the MAG.

428
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
the MAG.
 

429
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,350
the MAG.
Okay, so zooming out on the ES,

430
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
Okay, so zooming out on the ES,
 

431
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,710
Okay, so zooming out on the ES,
see where it is versus those levels. All

432
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
see where it is versus those levels. All
 

433
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,790
see where it is versus those levels. All
right, coming in for a back test of that

434
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
right, coming in for a back test of that
 

435
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,110
right, coming in for a back test of that
900 level we said was so key. All right,

436
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
900 level we said was so key. All right,
 

437
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,350
900 level we said was so key. All right,
so yesterday we left value. Remember

438
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
so yesterday we left value. Remember
 

439
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,110
so yesterday we left value. Remember
we've had value here. We had relative

440
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
we've had value here. We had relative
 

441
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,590
we've had value here. We had relative
strength. It finally left it and it's

442
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600
strength. It finally left it and it's
 

443
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,350
strength. It finally left it and it's
finding a bid now and it's going to come

444
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,360
finding a bid now and it's going to come
 

445
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,110
finding a bid now and it's going to come
and back test that 900. That's your

446
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
and back test that 900. That's your
 

447
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,190
and back test that 900. That's your
level. That is your level. We go back

448
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
level. That is your level. We go back
 

449
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,030
level. That is your level. We go back
inside 900 then we're probably going to

450
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040
inside 900 then we're probably going to
 

451
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,190
inside 900 then we're probably going to
chop. If they bears react to this then

452
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
chop. If they bears react to this then
 

453
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,110
chop. If they bears react to this then
they're going to look to retest towards

454
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
they're going to look to retest towards
 

455
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,030
they're going to look to retest towards
the lows. Right? So that's very very

456
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
the lows. Right? So that's very very
 

457
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,030
the lows. Right? So that's very very
similar kind of setup right now. Uh if

458
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040
similar kind of setup right now. Uh if
 

459
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,230
similar kind of setup right now. Uh if
we look at the spiders you're going to

460
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
we look at the spiders you're going to
 

461
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,230
we look at the spiders you're going to
see the same thing is coming back into

462
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
see the same thing is coming back into
 

463
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,030
see the same thing is coming back into
that range. Right? Pre-market 680.

464
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
that range. Right? Pre-market 680.
 

465
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,470
that range. Right? Pre-market 680.
Remember remember the gamma levels that

466
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,480
Remember remember the gamma levels that
 

467
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,230
Remember remember the gamma levels that
we had on the way down. I said 75 would

468
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,240
we had on the way down. I said 75 would
 

469
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,069
we had on the way down. I said 75 would
be key yesterday. It's pretty much lower

470
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
be key yesterday. It's pretty much lower
 

471
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,550
be key yesterday. It's pretty much lower
day. [snorts] 75, 680, 682,

472
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:14,560

 

473
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,310

685, 688, 690. Those are the those are

474
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
685, 688, 690. Those are the those are
 

475
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,230
685, 688, 690. Those are the those are
the levels for you guys playing spiders,

476
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,240
the levels for you guys playing spiders,
 

477
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,670
the levels for you guys playing spiders,
but you're looking exactly the same

478
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:21,680
but you're looking exactly the same
 

479
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,629
but you're looking exactly the same
stuff. Does it reclaim the old level or

480
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
stuff. Does it reclaim the old level or
 

481
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,190
stuff. Does it reclaim the old level or
are we going to see a sharp rejection of

482
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
are we going to see a sharp rejection of
 

483
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,870
are we going to see a sharp rejection of
around here? All right. So, is this a

484
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880
around here? All right. So, is this a
 

485
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,030
around here? All right. So, is this a
breakdown and this is a retest to sell

486
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,040
breakdown and this is a retest to sell
 

487
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,710
breakdown and this is a retest to sell
or are they going to reclaim and this is

488
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
or are they going to reclaim and this is
 

489
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,550
or are they going to reclaim and this is
look below and fail? All to be found out

490
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
look below and fail? All to be found out
 

491
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,784
look below and fail? All to be found out
in the next couple days, I would say.

492
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:36,794
in the next couple days, I would say.
 

493
00:13:36,794 --> 00:13:37,350
in the next couple days, I would say.

you're struggling with the rollover,

498
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
you're struggling with the rollover,
 

499
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,750
you're struggling with the rollover,
just make sure you're looking at the

500
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
just make sure you're looking at the
 

501
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,350
just make sure you're looking at the
ETFs.

502
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:43,360
ETFs.
 

503
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,430
ETFs.
It will uh do you a massive favor. So,

504
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
It will uh do you a massive favor. So,
 

505
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,949
It will uh do you a massive favor. So,
we can see where we found resistance

506
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959
we can see where we found resistance
 

507
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,230
we can see where we found resistance
yesterday, this edge here. And you could

508
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
yesterday, this edge here. And you could
 

509
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,990
yesterday, this edge here. And you could
even argue there's a little shelf up

510
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
even argue there's a little shelf up
 

511
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,389
even argue there's a little shelf up
here right now, which maybe it can hold

512
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:54,399
here right now, which maybe it can hold
 

513
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,310
here right now, which maybe it can hold
if it can get through this and repric

514
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
if it can get through this and repric
 

515
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,470
if it can get through this and repric
this thin level. So, there's some

516
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
this thin level. So, there's some
 

517
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,230
this thin level. So, there's some
repricing to be done in here. Very, very

518
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
repricing to be done in here. Very, very
 

519
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,230
repricing to be done in here. Very, very
possible like we talked about. So, dips,

520
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
possible like we talked about. So, dips,
 

521
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,150
possible like we talked about. So, dips,
if they hold dips, we're looking for

522
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160
if they hold dips, we're looking for
 

523
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,629
if they hold dips, we're looking for
that. And once we get up there, may very

524
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:06,639
that. And once we get up there, may very
 

525
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,990
that. And once we get up there, may very
well be looking for that trade back

526
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000
well be looking for that trade back
 

527
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,470
well be looking for that trade back
downside. So, probably just trade in the

528
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,480
downside. So, probably just trade in the
 

529
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,670
downside. So, probably just trade in the
balance. Uh, let's have a look at the

530
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:11,680
balance. Uh, let's have a look at the
 

531
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,230
balance. Uh, let's have a look at the
Dixie.

532
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
Dixie.
 

533
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,829
Dixie.
Found a bid. It found a bid. So, well,

534
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:17,839
Found a bid. It found a bid. So, well,
 

535
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,350
Found a bid. It found a bid. So, well,
it'll be interesting to see how we act

536
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
it'll be interesting to see how we act
 

537
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,910
it'll be interesting to see how we act
here coming into the JPY carry, but

538
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
here coming into the JPY carry, but
 

539
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,829
here coming into the JPY carry, but
maybe one of these. Maybe one of these.

540
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
maybe one of these. Maybe one of these.
 

541
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,990
maybe one of these. Maybe one of these.
Kind of similar. Uh, let's have a look

542
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,000
Kind of similar. Uh, let's have a look
 

543
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,590
Kind of similar. Uh, let's have a look
at gold. I know some of you are trading

544
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:27,600
at gold. I know some of you are trading
 

545
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,949
at gold. I know some of you are trading
gold. Yeah, you're still in that same

546
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:28,959
gold. Yeah, you're still in that same
 

547
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,389
gold. Yeah, you're still in that same
range by the looks of it. We talked

548
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:30,399
range by the looks of it. We talked
 

549
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,590
range by the looks of it. We talked
about this yesterday. I can't remember

550
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
about this yesterday. I can't remember
 

551
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,269
about this yesterday. I can't remember
who asked me. Right, these are your

552
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
who asked me. Right, these are your
 

553
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,110
who asked me. Right, these are your
pivot highs. All the stops are up here

554
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120
pivot highs. All the stops are up here
 

555
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,110
pivot highs. All the stops are up here
right now. Gold's creating a range in

556
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
right now. Gold's creating a range in
 

557
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,350
right now. Gold's creating a range in
here. All right, if dips hold, they're

558
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
here. All right, if dips hold, they're
 

559
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,189
here. All right, if dips hold, they're
trying to get back up up into this for a

560
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
trying to get back up up into this for a
 

561
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,110
trying to get back up up into this for a
breakout. All right, if they fail the

562
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120
breakout. All right, if they fail the
 

563
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,470
breakout. All right, if they fail the
dips, you're going to come back in here.

564
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:44,480
dips, you're going to come back in here.
 

565
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,470
dips, you're going to come back in here.
That is a failure to take out the high

566
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
That is a failure to take out the high
 

567
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,550
That is a failure to take out the high
and we build liquidity and that can be a

568
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
and we build liquidity and that can be a
 

569
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,269
and we build liquidity and that can be a
little bit dangerous.

570
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,279
little bit dangerous.
 

571
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,710
little bit dangerous.
The VIX. All right, VIX is getting

572
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
The VIX. All right, VIX is getting
 

573
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,509
The VIX. All right, VIX is getting
melted this morning. All right, it's

574
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:55,519
melted this morning. All right, it's
 

575
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,870
melted this morning. All right, it's
getting melted back down this morning.

576
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:56,880
getting melted back down this morning.
 

577
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,110
getting melted back down this morning.
Let's zoom into this.

578
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
Let's zoom into this.
 

579
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,350
Let's zoom into this.
It's starting to lose some levels.

580
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360

 

581
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,030

This is your new rotation right now.

582
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,040
This is your new rotation right now.
 

583
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,790
This is your new rotation right now.
Okay, you can see very very clearly if

584
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
Okay, you can see very very clearly if
 

585
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,269
Okay, you can see very very clearly if
we get under here

586
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:11,279
we get under here
 

587
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,269
we get under here
next pivots's down into here into the

588
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
next pivots's down into here into the
 

589
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,590
next pivots's down into here into the
sub 15s which is very bullish for the

590
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:15,600
sub 15s which is very bullish for the
 

591
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,110
sub 15s which is very bullish for the
market. So just waiting to see how we

592
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,120
market. So just waiting to see how we
 

593
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,550
market. So just waiting to see how we
act in the VIX. You can see it's going

594
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
act in the VIX. You can see it's going
 

595
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,790
act in the VIX. You can see it's going
it's very much like the rest of the

596
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
it's very much like the rest of the
 

597
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,629
it's very much like the rest of the
markets right now. We are just in a

598
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:22,639
markets right now. We are just in a
 

599
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,430
markets right now. We are just in a
rotation at level to level to level to

600
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
rotation at level to level to level to
 

601
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,750
rotation at level to level to level to
level to level to level to level to

602
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:27,760
level to level to level to level to
 

603
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,590
level to level to level to level to
level to level. We're just checking out.

604
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:29,600
level to level. We're just checking out.
 

605
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,430
level to level. We're just checking out.
All right, just think of it like I don't

606
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
All right, just think of it like I don't
 

607
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,910
All right, just think of it like I don't
know a stair. You got resistance above,

608
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:33,920
know a stair. You got resistance above,
 

609
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,509
know a stair. You got resistance above,
support below. You break support, you go

610
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
support below. You break support, you go
 

611
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,269
support below. You break support, you go
to the next level, you test it as a

612
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:37,279
to the next level, you test it as a
 

613
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,870
to the next level, you test it as a
resistance. That's all we're doing on

614
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
resistance. That's all we're doing on
 

615
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,629
resistance. That's all we're doing on
every single market right now. It is a

616
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
every single market right now. It is a
 

617
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,710
every single market right now. It is a
buildout. All right, MAG is interesting.

618
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:42,720
buildout. All right, MAG is interesting.
 

619
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,030
buildout. All right, MAG is interesting.
Some of these caught a bid. So, let's

620
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,040
Some of these caught a bid. So, let's
 

621
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,389
Some of these caught a bid. So, let's
have a little look here.

622
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
have a little look here.
 

623
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,350
have a little look here.
So, slight gap up there on Apple and you

624
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
So, slight gap up there on Apple and you
 

625
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,870
So, slight gap up there on Apple and you
can see really Apple would get going

626
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
can see really Apple would get going
 

627
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,030
can see really Apple would get going
over 7576.

628
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,040
over 7576.
 

629
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,310
over 7576.
All right. If it can get back over that,

630
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
All right. If it can get back over that,
 

631
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,350
All right. If it can get back over that,
we can maybe trade into the mid. Yeah,

632
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
we can maybe trade into the mid. Yeah,
 

633
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,749
we can maybe trade into the mid. Yeah,
76 is going to be key through that 77's

634
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:03,759
76 is going to be key through that 77's
 

635
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,189
76 is going to be key through that 77's
retest. All right. So, this is what

636
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
retest. All right. So, this is what
 

637
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,749
retest. All right. So, this is what
Apple's trying to do. It's trying to

638
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
Apple's trying to do. It's trying to
 

639
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,990
Apple's trying to do. It's trying to
create a sort of one two day base here.

640
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
create a sort of one two day base here.
 

641
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,829
create a sort of one two day base here.
If it can break out outside of this,

642
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
If it can break out outside of this,
 

643
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,590
If it can break out outside of this,
it's got a squeeze probably up into this

644
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,600
it's got a squeeze probably up into this
 

645
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,670
it's got a squeeze probably up into this
fib up into 77. So, it's got a couple

646
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:17,680
fib up into 77. So, it's got a couple
 

647
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,470
fib up into 77. So, it's got a couple
points in it if big if it can get going.

648
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
points in it if big if it can get going.
 

649
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,710
points in it if big if it can get going.
But, we do have a gap up there. Amazon,

650
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
But, we do have a gap up there. Amazon,
 

651
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,949
But, we do have a gap up there. Amazon,
you can see very big gap up there. Uh

652
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:24,959
you can see very big gap up there. Uh
 

653
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,670
you can see very big gap up there. Uh
this was on AI news. Um

654
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
this was on AI news. Um
 

655
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,269
this was on AI news. Um
so let's see if it can hold. You know,

656
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:31,279
so let's see if it can hold. You know,
 

657
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,189
so let's see if it can hold. You know,
AI has not been holding well recently,

658
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
AI has not been holding well recently,
 

659
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,870
AI has not been holding well recently,
but you know, if they hold this dip,

660
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
but you know, if they hold this dip,
 

661
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,310
but you know, if they hold this dip,
which they're trying to do, then then

662
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,320
which they're trying to do, then then
 

663
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,990
which they're trying to do, then then
maybe they get a bit of relief out of

664
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000
maybe they get a bit of relief out of
 

665
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,670
maybe they get a bit of relief out of
this. It's what they're attempting to

666
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:39,680
this. It's what they're attempting to
 

667
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,829
this. It's what they're attempting to
do. Where are we in relation to

668
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:41,839
do. Where are we in relation to
 

669
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,749
do. Where are we in relation to
everything else?

670
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:43,759
everything else?
 

671
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,910
everything else?
Not too bad. Looks a bit backsidey, but

672
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
Not too bad. Looks a bit backsidey, but
 

673
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,670
Not too bad. Looks a bit backsidey, but
not too bad. Goo,

674
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:49,680
not too bad. Goo,
 

675
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,670
not too bad. Goo,
this one continues to be in this channel

676
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:51,680
this one continues to be in this channel
 

677
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,110
this one continues to be in this channel
down. Just waiting for this to peter

678
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,120
down. Just waiting for this to peter
 

679
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,790
down. Just waiting for this to peter
out. All right, this continues to be in

680
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
out. All right, this continues to be in
 

681
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,870
out. All right, this continues to be in
one of these. Eventually, we will

682
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:56,880
one of these. Eventually, we will
 

683
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,550
one of these. Eventually, we will
probably go sideways and catch a little

684
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:58,560
probably go sideways and catch a little
 

685
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,470
probably go sideways and catch a little
bit of a relief rally. So, just waiting

686
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:00,480
bit of a relief rally. So, just waiting
 

687
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,990
bit of a relief rally. So, just waiting
to see what happens. I'd say really

688
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
to see what happens. I'd say really
 

689
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,430
to see what happens. I'd say really
there's still nothing to do in Google

690
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440
there's still nothing to do in Google
 

691
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,390
there's still nothing to do in Google
from a swing point of view. Meta, uh,

692
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,400
from a swing point of view. Meta, uh,
 

693
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,350
from a swing point of view. Meta, uh,
I'm still long in this. Um, up pretty

694
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:09,360
I'm still long in this. Um, up pretty
 

695
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,949
I'm still long in this. Um, up pretty
comfortably in this, but uh,

696
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,959
comfortably in this, but uh,
 

697
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,270
comfortably in this, but uh,
yes, what we going to do with this with

698
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
yes, what we going to do with this with
 

699
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,029
yes, what we going to do with this with
this thing here? I don't know. I'm long

700
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:17,039
this thing here? I don't know. I'm long
 

701
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,029
this thing here? I don't know. I'm long
from down here still from the 82s, I

702
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
from down here still from the 82s, I
 

703
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,630
from down here still from the 82s, I
think it is. Small size. still haven't

704
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
think it is. Small size. still haven't
 

705
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,909
think it is. Small size. still haven't
added, but let's see if Meta can start

706
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
added, but let's see if Meta can start
 

707
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,990
added, but let's see if Meta can start
to

708
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
to
 

709
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,549
to
box in a little bit

710
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:28,559
box in a little bit
 

711
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,310
box in a little bit
as the chance to come back up. All

712
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,320
as the chance to come back up. All
 

713
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,190
as the chance to come back up. All
right, so big if because this can be

714
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
right, so big if because this can be
 

715
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,950
right, so big if because this can be
like the market a fail breakout on one

716
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
like the market a fail breakout on one
 

717
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,669
like the market a fail breakout on one
of these for remainder of the year. So

718
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
of these for remainder of the year. So
 

719
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,110
of these for remainder of the year. So
very very similar to what we're looking

720
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,120
very very similar to what we're looking
 

721
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,510
very very similar to what we're looking
at in the cues opening up flat but is

722
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:41,520
at in the cues opening up flat but is
 

723
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:48,230
at in the cues opening up flat but is
above the base.

724
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240

 

725
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,390

That doesn't look too good.

726
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400
That doesn't look too good.
 

727
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,390
That doesn't look too good.
That really does not look too good,

728
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,400
That really does not look too good,
 

729
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,190
That really does not look too good,
right? One attempt, two attempts, lower

730
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
right? One attempt, two attempts, lower
 

731
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,950
right? One attempt, two attempts, lower
high, lower high, lower high, back into

732
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:56,960
high, lower high, lower high, back into
 

733
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,789
high, lower high, lower high, back into
base. Uh be avoiding anything on

734
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:00,799
base. Uh be avoiding anything on
 

735
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,830
base. Uh be avoiding anything on
Microsoft right now.

736
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840
Microsoft right now.
 

737
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,669
Microsoft right now.
And Nvidia, this is the one that's uh

738
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679
And Nvidia, this is the one that's uh
 

739
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,350
And Nvidia, this is the one that's uh
everyone's got eyes on, but it just

740
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,360
everyone's got eyes on, but it just
 

741
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,590
everyone's got eyes on, but it just
cannot get going. I don't I don't think

742
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:09,600
cannot get going. I don't I don't think
 

743
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,270
cannot get going. I don't I don't think
it's going to get going until the end of

744
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
it's going to get going until the end of
 

745
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,830
it's going to get going until the end of
the year. I can't see uh why it will.

746
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:13,840
the year. I can't see uh why it will.
 

747
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,909
the year. I can't see uh why it will.
It's had numerous attempts to reclaim.

748
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
It's had numerous attempts to reclaim.
 

749
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,830
It's had numerous attempts to reclaim.
You can see like the constant shove up

750
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
You can see like the constant shove up
 

751
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,270
You can see like the constant shove up
being sold into. So double tops up here,

752
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280
being sold into. So double tops up here,
 

753
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,310
being sold into. So double tops up here,
alltime highs, failures, failures to

754
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,320
alltime highs, failures, failures to
 

755
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,710
alltime highs, failures, failures to
reclaim, failures to reclaim. There's

756
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:26,720
reclaim, failures to reclaim. There's
 

757
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,390
reclaim, failures to reclaim. There's
going to be a lot of liquidity built out

758
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400
going to be a lot of liquidity built out
 

759
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,990
going to be a lot of liquidity built out
into these levels. If we get a snap of

760
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
into these levels. If we get a snap of
 

761
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,510
into these levels. If we get a snap of
that, it's night night time. But whether

762
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:33,520
that, it's night night time. But whether
 

763
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,750
that, it's night night time. But whether
I think next week becomes a bit cleaner

764
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:35,760
I think next week becomes a bit cleaner
 

765
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,230
I think next week becomes a bit cleaner
if I'm honest, but we will see. Tesla

766
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,240
if I'm honest, but we will see. Tesla
 

767
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,510
if I'm honest, but we will see. Tesla
looks very strong like we've talked

768
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:39,520
looks very strong like we've talked
 

769
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,190
looks very strong like we've talked
about for a number of weeks. It looked

770
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,200
about for a number of weeks. It looked
 

771
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,789
about for a number of weeks. It looked
good. I kept saying here, it looks good

772
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:42,799
good. I kept saying here, it looks good
 

773
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,710
good. I kept saying here, it looks good
for the breakout. Even this this hold of

774
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:13,840
nice.
 

935
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,070
nice.
Oh, here they go then. Back to the top

936
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080
Oh, here they go then. Back to the top
 

937
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,270
Oh, here they go then. Back to the top
side. Bulls piling in here. We didn't

938
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,280
side. Bulls piling in here. We didn't
 

939
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,669
side. Bulls piling in here. We didn't
get the level that we wanted to buy at.

940
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:21,679
get the level that we wanted to buy at.
 

941
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,390
get the level that we wanted to buy at.
Not yet. So, I'm watching it did come

942
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
Not yet. So, I'm watching it did come
 

943
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,070
Not yet. So, I'm watching it did come
into the blue box. I'm watching this gap

944
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,080
into the blue box. I'm watching this gap
 

945
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,590
into the blue box. I'm watching this gap
fill here and uh down here to see how we

946
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
fill here and uh down here to see how we
 

947
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,990
fill here and uh down here to see how we
at. So really, you know, I I would like

948
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
at. So really, you know, I I would like
 

949
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,590
at. So really, you know, I I would like
to see something like this would be

950
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:33,600
to see something like this would be
 

951
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,669
to see something like this would be
really nice. That that would be really

952
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:35,679
really nice. That that would be really
 

953
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,110
really nice. That that would be really
nice. We just want to be careful if we

954
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,120
nice. We just want to be careful if we
 

955
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,669
nice. We just want to be careful if we
get a backside move. So just let this

956
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:39,679
get a backside move. So just let this
 

957
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,669
get a backside move. So just let this
settle down.

958
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:41,679
settle down.
 

959
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,590
settle down.
See if the mag can catch a bid. Here we

960
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,600
See if the mag can catch a bid. Here we
 

961
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,270
See if the mag can catch a bid. Here we
come. Coming back into these levels now.

962
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,280
come. Coming back into these levels now.
 

963
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,830
come. Coming back into these levels now.
So gap filled potential. Ideally we come

964
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:47,840
So gap filled potential. Ideally we come
 

965
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,669
So gap filled potential. Ideally we come
and back test previous day value area

966
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:49,679
and back test previous day value area
 

967
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,510
and back test previous day value area
high and they find a bid there. If they

968
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:51,520
high and they find a bid there. If they
 

969
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,110
high and they find a bid there. If they
like I said if they don't find a bid

970
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,120
like I said if they don't find a bid
 

971
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,310
like I said if they don't find a bid
there um I will and I just got an alert

972
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:56,320
there um I will and I just got an alert
 

973
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,630
there um I will and I just got an alert
on Nvidia. some videos crossing downside

974
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:58,640
on Nvidia. some videos crossing downside
 

975
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,070
on Nvidia. some videos crossing downside
of a major level. So, you want to be

976
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,080
of a major level. So, you want to be
 

977
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,909
of a major level. So, you want to be
careful. I'm not willing to trade in

978
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:01,919
careful. I'm not willing to trade in
 

979
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,510
careful. I'm not willing to trade in
here today. All right. I'm not willing

980
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:03,520
here today. All right. I'm not willing
 

981
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,590
here today. All right. I'm not willing
to trade in this zone down here.

982
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:07,600

 

983
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,830

No chance.

984
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840

 

985
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:23,430

No flipping chance.

986
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,440

 

987
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,909

So, they keep trying to sell 22s down to

988
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:25,919
So, they keep trying to sell 22s down to
 

989
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:32,870
So, they keep trying to sell 22s down to
400.

990
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:32,880

 

991
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,710

There we go. That's better. Wondering

992
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:34,720
There we go. That's better. Wondering
 

993
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:42,390
There we go. That's better. Wondering
what was going on there. [snorts]

994
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:42,400

 

995
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,310

Long for the day. Long for the day if we

996
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,320
Long for the day. Long for the day if we
 

997
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,070
Long for the day. Long for the day if we
can hold dips. Yeah, if we if we're

998
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,080
can hold dips. Yeah, if we if we're
 

999
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,070
can hold dips. Yeah, if we if we're
willing to hold. I mean, I don't really

1000
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,080
willing to hold. I mean, I don't really
 

1001
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,510
willing to hold. I mean, I don't really
like what we're doing right now here.

1002
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:49,520
like what we're doing right now here.
 

1003
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,230
like what we're doing right now here.
I'd rather see this close the gap first.

1004
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,240
I'd rather see this close the gap first.
 

1005
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,310
I'd rather see this close the gap first.
We came pretty close on the spiders and

1006
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,320
We came pretty close on the spiders and
 

1007
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,750
We came pretty close on the spiders and
pretty close on the cues. I don't like

1008
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:55,760
pretty close on the cues. I don't like
 

1009
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,590
pretty close on the cues. I don't like
it when we leave it open by that tiny

1010
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,600
it when we leave it open by that tiny
 

1011
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,149
it when we leave it open by that tiny
little bit. So, either we gap fill or

1012
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:00,159
little bit. So, either we gap fill or
 

1013
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,310
little bit. So, either we gap fill or
come down into previous day high and I'm

1014
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,320
come down into previous day high and I'm
 

1015
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,750
come down into previous day high and I'm
long biased if we show that buyers want

1016
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:05,760
long biased if we show that buyers want
 

1017
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,669
long biased if we show that buyers want
to step up and hold it. All right, I

1018
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:07,679
to step up and hold it. All right, I
 

1019
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,590
to step up and hold it. All right, I
don't want to be too biased because if

1020
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
don't want to be too biased because if
 

1021
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,190
don't want to be too biased because if
we let go of this range, we're going to

1022
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,200
we let go of this range, we're going to
 

1023
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,669
we let go of this range, we're going to
go into the death chop. So, we're long

1024
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:13,679
go into the death chop. So, we're long
 

1025
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,029
go into the death chop. So, we're long
if we can hold that and we're looking

1026
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:15,039
if we can hold that and we're looking
 

1027
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,549
if we can hold that and we're looking
for a breakout and we're going to sell

1028
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:16,559
for a breakout and we're going to sell
 

1029
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,630
for a breakout and we're going to sell
the breakout because it's very possible

1030
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:18,640
the breakout because it's very possible
 

1031
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,149
the breakout because it's very possible
that we're going to do a rebalance. Go

1032
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:20,159
that we're going to do a rebalance. Go
 

1033
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,350
that we're going to do a rebalance. Go
to the beginning of the show. Talked

1034
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:21,360
to the beginning of the show. Talked
 

1035
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:32,070
to the beginning of the show. Talked
about all of it.

1036
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,080

 

1037
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,669

Very tight range these opening few

1038
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:33,679
Very tight range these opening few
 

1039
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,269
Very tight range these opening few
minutes, folks. So, buyers get keep

1040
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:35,279
minutes, folks. So, buyers get keep
 

1041
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,830
minutes, folks. So, buyers get keep
getting caught over 22.

1042
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:37,840
getting caught over 22.
 

1043
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,510
getting caught over 22.
All right. Sellers keep selling that and

1044
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:39,520
All right. Sellers keep selling that and
 

1045
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,830
All right. Sellers keep selling that and
sellers keep getting caught into 400. So

1046
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:41,840
sellers keep getting caught into 400. So
 

1047
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,350
sellers keep getting caught into 400. So
you've got like a 20 point tiny little

1048
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:43,360
you've got like a 20 point tiny little
 

1049
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,909
you've got like a 20 point tiny little
range here. Just let it breathe. You're

1050
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:45,919
range here. Just let it breathe. You're
 

1051
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,750
range here. Just let it breathe. You're
4 minutes into the day. Haven't even set

1052
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:47,760
4 minutes into the day. Haven't even set
 

1053
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,510
4 minutes into the day. Haven't even set
that opening 5m minute bar yet. Let it

1054
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520
that opening 5m minute bar yet. Let it
 

1055
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,230
that opening 5m minute bar yet. Let it
breathe a little bit.

1056
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:52,240
breathe a little bit.
 

1057
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,390
breathe a little bit.

talked about mixed bag. Oracle still

1068
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,360
talked about mixed bag. Oracle still
 

1069
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,990
talked about mixed bag. Oracle still

right? Rotate. We've seen rotation out

1072
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:14,240
right? Rotate. We've seen rotation out
 

1073
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,870
right? Rotate. We've seen rotation out
of tech recently or at least out of the

1074
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:16,880
of tech recently or at least out of the
 

1075
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,149
of tech recently or at least out of the
AI risk names into some of the safer

1076
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:20,159
AI risk names into some of the safer
 

1077
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,909
AI risk names into some of the safer
assets, even into some small caps, which

1078
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:21,919
assets, even into some small caps, which
 

1079
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,830
assets, even into some small caps, which
is why you've seen the RTY have relative

1080
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:23,840
is why you've seen the RTY have relative
 

1081
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,149
is why you've seen the RTY have relative
strength the last few weeks. Here we

1082
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,159
strength the last few weeks. Here we
 

1083
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,789
strength the last few weeks. Here we
come. So maybe, sorry, let's move this

1084
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:28,799
come. So maybe, sorry, let's move this
 

1085
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,750
come. So maybe, sorry, let's move this
up. We're getting this gap fill now. All

1087
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,510
up. We're getting this gap fill now. All
right, down into here. Just going to

00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:33,520
right, down into here. Just going to
 

1089
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,029
right, down into here. Just going to
remove this white line. We know where it

1090
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:35,039
remove this white line. We know where it
 

1091
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,630
remove this white line. We know where it
is there or thereabouts. And just try

1092
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:36,640
is there or thereabouts. And just try
 

1093
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,149
is there or thereabouts. And just try
and clean up this chart again because

and clean up this chart again because
 

1095
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,630
and clean up this chart again because
everything is so tight.

everything is so tight.

1102
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:46,960
a little bit ugly. Let's just reload
 

1103
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,269
a little bit ugly. Let's just reload
this.

1104
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:51,279

 

1105
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,029

It just does it horizontal without all

1106
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:53,039
It just does it horizontal without all
 

1107
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,470
It just does it horizontal without all
the little bumps in it. There we go.

1108
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:54,480
the little bumps in it. There we go.
 

1109
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,269
the little bumps in it. There we go.
That's better, isn't it?

1110
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
That's better, isn't it?
 

1111
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,870
That's better, isn't it?
All right. So, coming near to this gap,

1112
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:58,880
All right. So, coming near to this gap,
 

1113
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,149
All right. So, coming near to this gap,

1116
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:04,960
previous day close. Sellers got caught
 

1117
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,630
previous day close. Sellers got caught
down there again. We still haven't quite

1118
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:06,640
down there again. We still haven't quite
 

1119
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,549
down there again. We still haven't quite
closed the gap. ES hasn't quite closed

1120
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:08,559
closed the gap. ES hasn't quite closed
 

1121
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,070
closed the gap. ES hasn't quite closed
the gap. We're watching to see if they

1122
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,080
the gap. We're watching to see if they
 

1123
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,590
the gap. We're watching to see if they
close the gap and then if they come into

1124
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:11,600
close the gap and then if they come into
 

1125
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,510
close the gap and then if they come into
previous day value area high. And this

1126
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
previous day value area high. And this
 

1127
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,870
previous day value area high. And this
is the kind of area where I'm interested

1128
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:14,880
is the kind of area where I'm interested
 

1129
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,470
is the kind of area where I'm interested
in bidding in. If they hold this, I'll

1130
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:16,480
in bidding in. If they hold this, I'll
 

1131
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,390
in bidding in. If they hold this, I'll
consider it. But I want to see if

1132
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:18,400
consider it. But I want to see if
 

1133
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,909
consider it. But I want to see if
they're willing to hold yesterday's

1134
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:19,919
they're willing to hold yesterday's
 

1135
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,590
they're willing to hold yesterday's
value area high. If they're not willing

1136
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:21,600
value area high. If they're not willing
 

1137
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,669
value area high. If they're not willing
to hold it, I will not be bidding on it.

1138
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:23,679
to hold it, I will not be bidding on it.
 

1139
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,763
to hold it, I will not be bidding on it.
Right? I'm not bidding against it.

1140
00:26:25,763 --> 00:26:25,773
Right? I'm not bidding against it.
 

1141
00:26:25,773 --> 00:26:26,870
Right? I'm not bidding against it.

[snorts]
 

1143
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:34,789
[snorts]
Make that clear.

1144
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:34,799

 

1145
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,430

Okay. Gap now filled on the Q's. Not

1146
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:37,440
Okay. Gap now filled on the Q's. Not
 

1147
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,269
Okay. Gap now filled on the Q's. Not
filled yet on the spiders. Still got a

1148
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:39,279
filled yet on the spiders. Still got a
 

1149
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:49,669
filled yet on the spiders. Still got a
little bit of downside to come.

1150
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679

 

1151
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,430

There we go. All right. Coming into

1152
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:51,440
There we go. All right. Coming into
 

1153
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,710
There we go. All right. Coming into
these levels. Right. So now I'm

1154
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:52,720
these levels. Right. So now I'm
 

1155
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,710
these levels. Right. So now I'm
interested to see if we're willing to

1156
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:54,720
interested to see if we're willing to
 

1157
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,390
interested to see if we're willing to
hold these levels. We might not be

1158
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,400
hold these levels. We might not be
 

1159
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,149
hold these levels. We might not be
willing to hold it. So I don't want to

1160
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:58,159
willing to hold it. So I don't want to
 

1161
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,549
willing to hold it. So I don't want to
bid against it. I want to see sellers

1162
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:00,559
bid against it. I want to see sellers
 

1163
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,549
bid against it. I want to see sellers
get trapped. So here is SPY now filling

1164
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:04,559
get trapped. So here is SPY now filling
 

1165
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,590
get trapped. So here is SPY now filling
its gap. And we are into these key

1166
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,600
its gap. And we are into these key
 

1167
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,350
its gap. And we are into these key
levels, folks. So, are we willing to

1168
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,360
levels, folks. So, are we willing to
 

1169
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,430
levels, folks. So, are we willing to
hold previous day value area high,

1170
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:11,440
hold previous day value area high,
 

1171
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,029
hold previous day value area high,
previous day point control around here?

1172
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:13,039
previous day point control around here?
 

1173
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,789
previous day point control around here?
If we're willing to hold and we're going

1174
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:14,799
If we're willing to hold and we're going
 

1175
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,710
If we're willing to hold and we're going
to trap sellers, I'm willing to buy. If

1176
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:16,720
to trap sellers, I'm willing to buy. If
 

1177
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,230
to trap sellers, I'm willing to buy. If
we're not willing to hold, then I'm not

1178
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,240
we're not willing to hold, then I'm not
 

1179
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,149
we're not willing to hold, then I'm not
willing to do a thing. I'm not going to

1180
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:20,159
willing to do a thing. I'm not going to
 

1181
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,549
willing to do a thing. I'm not going to
trade in yesterday's range. Yesterday

1182
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:22,559
trade in yesterday's range. Yesterday
 

1183
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,470
trade in yesterday's range. Yesterday
told you told [clears throat] you

1184
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:24,480
told you told [clears throat] you
 

1185
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,029
told you told [clears throat] you
yesterday showed you in that range how

1186
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:27,039
yesterday showed you in that range how
 

1187
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,669
yesterday showed you in that range how
choppy it was.

1188
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679
choppy it was.
 

1189
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,110
choppy it was.
So, I'm selling at the lows here.

1190
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,120
So, I'm selling at the lows here.
 

1191
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,990
So, I'm selling at the lows here.
Starting to start to get caught. Not

1192
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,000
Starting to start to get caught. Not
 

1193
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,830
Starting to start to get caught. Not
seeing enough yet, though. Here we go.

00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:35,840
seeing enough yet, though. Here we go.
 

1195
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,434
seeing enough yet, though. Here we go.
Starting to see a bid. I'm

1203
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,630
and stop already in place. Let's see.
It's got to get back through these 60s.

1204
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:48,640
It's got to get back through these 60s.
 

1205
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,789
It's got to get back through these 60s.
Here we go. Here we go. Fantastic.

1206
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:52,799
Here we go. Here we go. Fantastic.
 

1207
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:53,830
Here we go. Here we go. Fantastic.
All right. I'm going to sell a little

1208
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:53,840
All right. I'm going to sell a little
 

1209
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,350
All right. I'm going to sell a little
bit of a pop into this because buyers

1210
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:55,360
bit of a pop into this because buyers
 

1211
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,350
bit of a pop into this because buyers
just came in there and got hit with a

1212
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:57,360
just came in there and got hit with a
 

1213
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,190
just came in there and got hit with a
refresh seller. So, I'm being very, very

1214
00:27:59,190 --> 00:27:59,200
refresh seller. So, I'm being very, very
 

1215
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,350
refresh seller. So, I'm being very, very
cautious as I start the day here. Not

1216
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:01,360
cautious as I start the day here. Not
 

1217
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,630
cautious as I start the day here. Not
convinced we finish the auction, but

1218
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:02,640
convinced we finish the auction, but
 

1219
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,230
convinced we finish the auction, but
sellers are trapped under 40 right now.

1220
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:04,240
sellers are trapped under 40 right now.
 

1221
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,350
sellers are trapped under 40 right now.
So that's the level it's going to have

1222
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,360
So that's the level it's going to have
 

1223
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,510
So that's the level it's going to have
to hold. Doesn't hold 40, then I think

1224
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:07,520
to hold. Doesn't hold 40, then I think
 

1225
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,669
to hold. Doesn't hold 40, then I think
we reflush down and we can think about a

1226
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:09,679
we reflush down and we can think about a
 

1227
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,470
we reflush down and we can think about a
reload if and when [snorts] they retrap.

1228
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:12,480
reload if and when [snorts] they retrap.
 

1229
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,149
reload if and when [snorts] they retrap.
But all the time we're above 40, sellers

1230
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,159
But all the time we're above 40, sellers
 

1231
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,669
But all the time we're above 40, sellers
are currently stuck on the lower time

1232
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:15,679
are currently stuck on the lower time
 

1233
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,710
are currently stuck on the lower time
frame.

1234
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:18,720

 

1235
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,190

Got to hold 40 here. Got to hold 40

1236
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,200
Got to hold 40 here. Got to hold 40
 

1237
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,319
Got to hold 40 here. Got to hold 40
here.

1238
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:24,329

 

1239

Why couldn't you turn up before I took

Now, uh buyers do keep getting a little

1294
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,080
Now, uh buyers do keep getting a little
 

1295
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,590
Now, uh buyers do keep getting a little
bit caught here into 60. So, there's

1296
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:23,600
bit caught here into 60. So, there's
 

1297
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,110
bit caught here into 60. So, there's
only about 20 point rotation here.

1298
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,120
only about 20 point rotation here.

only about 20 point rotation here.
Waiting for this ledge to be built out.

Waiting for this ledge to be built out.
 

1301
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,710
Waiting for this ledge to be built out.
You've got a ledge at 45. I would still

1302
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:28,720
You've got a ledge at 45. I would still
 

1303
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,470
You've got a ledge at 45. I would still
say if they let go 40, this will flush.

1304
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:30,480
say if they let go 40, this will flush.
 

1305
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:41,350
say if they let go 40, this will flush.
Just be careful.

1306
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,360

 

1307
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,830

Big sellers coming in here. And if they

1308
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:43,840
Big sellers coming in here. And if they
 

1309
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,350
Big sellers coming in here. And if they
get caught at 40, it' be the same thing.

1310
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,360
get caught at 40, it' be the same thing.
 

1311
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,870
get caught at 40, it' be the same thing.
I'll get some volume on here because we

1312
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
I'll get some volume on here because we
 

1313
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,549
I'll get some volume on here because we
are actually developing a bit of a shelf

1314
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:48,559
are actually developing a bit of a shelf
 

1315
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,310
are actually developing a bit of a shelf
early.

1316
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:50,320
early.
 

1317
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,350
early.
Very early.

1318
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,360

 

1319
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,630

I'm [snorts] flat on this at the moment,

1320
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:56,640
I'm [snorts] flat on this at the moment,
 

1321
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,230
I'm [snorts] flat on this at the moment,
folks. We had I had a little scalp up

1322
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,240
folks. We had I had a little scalp up
 

1323
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,669
folks. We had I had a little scalp up
there. Just waiting to see now. All

1324
00:29:59,669 --> 00:29:59,679
there. Just waiting to see now. All
 

1325
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,750
there. Just waiting to see now. All
right. little scalp up waiting to see.

1326
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:01,760
right. little scalp up waiting to see.
 

1327
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,669
right. little scalp up waiting to see.
You can see how sensitive this 40 is,

1328
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:03,679
You can see how sensitive this 40 is,
 

1329
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,430
You can see how sensitive this 40 is,
right? Every time we're banging into it,

1330
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:05,440
right? Every time we're banging into it,
 

1331
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,789
right? Every time we're banging into it,
there is someone trying to absorb it.

1332
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:06,799
there is someone trying to absorb it.
 

1333
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,710
there is someone trying to absorb it.
But if he runs out of bids, you're going

1334
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:08,720
But if he runs out of bids, you're going
 

1335
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,470
But if he runs out of bids, you're going
to see a flush. I'm just warning you

1336
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:10,480
to see a flush. I'm just warning you
 

1337
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,870
to see a flush. I'm just warning you
that now.

1338
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:12,880
that now.
 

1339
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,389
that now.
And the next level down would probably

1340
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:14,399
And the next level down would probably
 

1341
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,710
And the next level down would probably
be into 75 and 60 right around here. So,

1342
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:18,720
be into 75 and 60 right around here. So,
 

1343
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,950
be into 75 and 60 right around here. So,
they need to hold this really. Sellers

1344
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:20,960
they need to hold this really. Sellers
 

1345
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,870
they need to hold this really. Sellers
got caught there again into that low of

1346
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:22,880
got caught there again into that low of
 

1347
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,470
got caught there again into that low of
day. This is a battle here. We are in a

1348
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:26,480
day. This is a battle here. We are in a
 

1349
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,070
day. This is a battle here. We are in a
technically in a cell, but I'm just

1350
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,080
technically in a cell, but I'm just
 

1351
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,190
technically in a cell, but I'm just
watching if we're going to go in

1352
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,200
watching if we're going to go in
 

1353
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,630
watching if we're going to go in
rotation, they need to hold this. So,

1354
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:30,640
rotation, they need to hold this. So,
 

1355
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,389
rotation, they need to hold this. So,
I'm still flattening this. I had one go

1356
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:32,399
I'm still flattening this. I had one go
 

1357
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,710
I'm still flattening this. I had one go
for a small little scalp

1358
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:34,720
for a small little scalp
 

1359
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,510
for a small little scalp
and uh sellers are piling in here. Mag

1360
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:37,520
and uh sellers are piling in here. Mag
 

1361
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,110
and uh sellers are piling in here. Mag
is starting to roll a little bit, so

1362
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,120
is starting to roll a little bit, so
 

1363
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,510
is starting to roll a little bit, so
maybe a deeper dive. This is my nogo

1364
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:41,520
maybe a deeper dive. This is my nogo
 

1365
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,110
maybe a deeper dive. This is my nogo
territory. If we're going to fade into

1366
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,120
territory. If we're going to fade into
 

1367
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,870
territory. If we're going to fade into
this, I'm not interested in touching it.

1368
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:44,880
this, I'm not interested in touching it.
 

1369
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,630
this, I'm not interested in touching it.
Technically, we can rotate down to

1370
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:46,640
Technically, we can rotate down to
 

1371
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,230
Technically, we can rotate down to
there, but I really don't want to trade

1372
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:48,240
there, but I really don't want to trade
 

1373
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,149
there, but I really don't want to trade
yesterday's range. I've made that clear

1374
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:50,159
yesterday's range. I've made that clear
 

1375
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,830
yesterday's range. I've made that clear
from pre-market. That is not the trade

1376
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:51,840
from pre-market. That is not the trade
 

1377
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,669
from pre-market. That is not the trade
I'm looking for today. We're either

1378
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:53,679
I'm looking for today. We're either
 

1379
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,830
I'm looking for today. We're either
going to go expansion and I'll trade

1380
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:55,840
going to go expansion and I'll trade
 

1381
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,750
going to go expansion and I'll trade
upside or we're going to do a fail

1382
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:57,760
upside or we're going to do a fail
 

1383
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,269
upside or we're going to do a fail
breakout of the high and I'll trade

1384
00:30:59,269 --> 00:30:59,279
breakout of the high and I'll trade
 

1385
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,190
breakout of the high and I'll trade
downside. I'm not going to trade in the

1386
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,200
downside. I'm not going to trade in the
 

1387
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,110
downside. I'm not going to trade in the
chop zone.

1388
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,120

 

1389
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,950

There they go. So, more sellers get

1390
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:06,960

1517
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,230
anything else right now. There's the tap
of the 22s where that seller was. He

1518
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:36,240
of the 22s where that seller was. He
 

1519
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,549
of the 22s where that seller was. He
refresh sold it. So he's still in

1521
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,870
refresh sold it. So he's still in
control right now at 22s. He's reloaded

control right now at 22s. He's reloaded
 

1523
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,630

on the tape here as well, making himself
 

1525
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,310
on the tape here as well, making himself
known. So, we're watching if they're

00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:45,279
going to break out. They're going to
 

1529
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,789
going to break out. They're going to
have to get back above 20s. Otherwise,

1530
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:46,799
have to get back above 20s. Otherwise,
 

1531
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,789
have to get back above 20s. Otherwise,
these sellers are well in control right

1532
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:48,799
these sellers are well in control right
 

1533
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,830
these sellers are well in control right
now. Here's the test of 20. So, they're

1534
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:51,840
now. Here's the test of 20. So, they're
 

1535
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,430
now. Here's the test of 20. So, they're
coming up into this guy. He's still

1536
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:53,440
coming up into this guy. He's still
 

1537
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,789
coming up into this guy. He's still

00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:50,399
Still waiting and watching. Still in my
 

1591
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,389
Still waiting and watching. Still in my
no trade zone right now. We have to get

1592
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:52,399
no trade zone right now. We have to get
 

1593
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,750
no trade zone right now. We have to get
out of this zone for me to be interested

1594
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:53,760
out of this zone for me to be interested
 

1595
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,149
out of this zone for me to be interested
in doing anything today.

1596

I do not want to trade yesterday's range

1598
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:58,079
I do not want to trade yesterday's range
 

1599
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,990
I do not want to trade yesterday's range
because if you just zoom out and look at

1600
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,000
because if you just zoom out and look at
 

1601
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,230
because if you just zoom out and look at
yesterday, it's pretty ugly that range,

1602
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,240
yesterday, it's pretty ugly that range,
 

1603
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,069
yesterday, it's pretty ugly that range,
isn't it? We don't want to trade there.

1604
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:04,079
isn't it? We don't want to trade there.
 

1605
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,390
isn't it? We don't want to trade there.
And we've now lost developing weeks uh

1606
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:08,400
And we've now lost developing weeks uh
 

1607
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,230
And we've now lost developing weeks uh
point of control. Developing week point

1608
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:10,240
point of control. Developing week point
 

1609
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,470
point of control. Developing week point
of control at 340 as well. So that will

1610
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:12,480
of control at 340 as well. So that will
 

1611
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,470
of control at 340 as well. So that will
be previous day value area high

1612
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:14,480
be previous day value area high
 

1613
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,470
be previous day value area high
developing weak point of control 340.

1614
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:16,480
developing weak point of control 340.
 

1615
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,150
developing weak point of control 340.
That's your overunder for the day.

1616
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,160
That's your overunder for the day.
 

1617
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,990
That's your overunder for the day.
That's your sentiment shift for the day

1618
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,000
That's your sentiment shift for the day
 

1619
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,990
That's your sentiment shift for the day
in my mind.

1620
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,000
in my mind.
 

1621
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,589
in my mind.

Sellers still in control here. They're
absolutely in control. We haven't even

00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:25,520
absolutely in control. We haven't even
 

1625
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,670
absolutely in control. We haven't even
popped this delta at 320s yet. So

1626
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:27,680
popped this delta at 320s yet. So
 

1627
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,630
popped this delta at 320s yet. So
sellers still in control here.

1628
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:30,640
sellers still in control here.
 

1629
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,470
sellers still in control here.
So coming back to test these 20s again.

1630
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:32,480
So coming back to test these 20s again.
 

1631
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,390
So coming back to test these 20s again.
Is that refresh seller here or is he

1632
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:34,400
Is that refresh seller here or is he

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,069
Is that refresh seller here or is he

1635
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,670
gone? Are we going to now start to move?
All right. And I'm getting interested

1636
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:37,680
All right. And I'm getting interested
 

1637
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,069
All right. And I'm getting interested
now. Popping through 20s. Can we reclaim

1638
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:40,079
now. Popping through 20s. Can we reclaim
 

1639
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,349
now. Popping through 20s. Can we reclaim
the 40s?

1640
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:43,359

 

1641
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,270

Remember that is your sentiment shift.

1642
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:45,280
Remember that is your sentiment shift.
 

1643
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,870
Remember that is your sentiment shift.
Higher time frame sentiment shift on the

1644
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:46,880
Higher time frame sentiment shift on the
 

1645
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,270
Higher time frame sentiment shift on the
day is 40s. 20 to 40s still remains a

1646
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:49,280
day is 40s. 20 to 40s still remains a
 

1647
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,109
day is 40s. 20 to 40s still remains a
rotation right now. So they're going to

1648
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:51,119
rotation right now. So they're going to
 

1649
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,030
rotation right now. So they're going to
try and refresh sell these 20s after

1650
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,040
try and refresh sell these 20s after
 

1651
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,829
try and refresh sell these 20s after
that fail breakout. 40s. It per my

1652
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:55,839
that fail breakout. 40s. It per my
 

1653
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,630
that fail breakout. 40s. It per my
interest and uh couldn't hold. So still

1654
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:58,640
interest and uh couldn't hold. So still
 

1655
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,390
interest and uh couldn't hold. So still
waiting to see are we going to move out

1656

waiting to see are we going to move out
 

1657
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,069
waiting to see are we going to move out

no interest in trading this. We talked
 

1801
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,109
no interest in trading this. We talked

about it premarket. This is not what I

wanted to see today. I do not want us
 

1805
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,589

just to go back in value, especially

1806
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:51,599
just to go back in value, especially
 

1807
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,310
just to go back in value, especially
after an aggressive sell without really

after an aggressive sell without really
 

1809
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,069
after an aggressive sell without really
taking that liquidity at the high. So,

1810
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:56,079
taking that liquidity at the high. So,
 

1811
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,829
taking that liquidity at the high. So,
yet again, ENQ leaving that 520 high. I

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,829
if we'd probably taken that first. But
there we go. And the move really for the

Morning, Bella. Morning. Morning.
 

1843
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,310
Morning, Bella. Morning. Morning.
Okay, it's probably going to come into

1844
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:42,320
Okay, it's probably going to come into
 

1845
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,910
Okay, it's probably going to come into
value. And then remember this old naked

1846
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:43,920
value. And then remember this old naked
 

1847
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,550
value. And then remember this old naked
point control that we bid off yesterday.

1848
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:46,560
point control that we bid off yesterday.
 

1849
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,910
point control that we bid off yesterday.
I really didn't want to see us back

1850
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:47,920
I really didn't want to see us back
 

1851
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,870
I really didn't want to see us back
here. So, if we're going to reclaim, we

1852
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:50,880
here. So, if we're going to reclaim, we
 

1853
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,310
here. So, if we're going to reclaim, we
got to reclaim these shelves here. These

1854
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:52,320
got to reclaim these shelves here. These
 

1855
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,710
got to reclaim these shelves here. These
320s. Oh my god, we're going. [\h__\h]

1856
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:54,720
320s. Oh my god, we're going. [\h__\h]
 

1857
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,349
320s. Oh my god, we're going. [\h__\h]
hell, mate. Did we just hit a gamma

1858
00:39:57,349 --> 00:39:57,359
hell, mate. Did we just hit a gamma
 

1859
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,550
hell, mate. Did we just hit a gamma
level? Where's Nope.

1860
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:00,560
level? Where's Nope.
 

1861
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,310
level? Where's Nope.
Okay. Well, I'm watching these same

1862
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:02,320
Okay. Well, I'm watching these same
 

1863
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,470
Okay. Well, I'm watching these same
levels upside. So, we got to get back

1864
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:04,480
levels upside. So, we got to get back
 

1865
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,589
levels upside. So, we got to get back
above 320s and 340s. Not just push.

1866
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:07,599
above 320s and 340s. Not just push.
 

1867
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,030
above 320s and 340s. Not just push.
We've got to start holding higher lows

1868
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,040
We've got to start holding higher lows
 

1869
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,349
We've got to start holding higher lows
above it.

1870
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:11,359
above it.
 

1871
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,030
above it.
Every push is being sold into this

1872
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,040
Every push is being sold into this
 

1873
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,470
Every push is being sold into this
morning so far. Every push so far is

1874
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:16,480
morning so far. Every push so far is
 

1875
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,550
morning so far. Every push so far is
being sold into. We do have someone

1876
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:18,560
being sold into. We do have someone
 

1877
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,390
being sold into. We do have someone
trying to step up on the bid at 75

1878
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:20,400
trying to step up on the bid at 75
 

1879
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,310
trying to step up on the bid at 75
there. Let's see if he's a Mr. Algo and

1880
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:22,320
there. Let's see if he's a Mr. Algo and
 

1881
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,030
there. Let's see if he's a Mr. Algo and
he walks away

1882
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,040
he walks away
 

1883
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,390
he walks away
trying to support a bid here.

1884
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:28,400
trying to support a bid here.
 

1885
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,190
trying to support a bid here.
320s and 340s remain the level for me

1886
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:31,200
320s and 340s remain the level for me
 

1887
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,069
320s and 340s remain the level for me
like real real interest.

1888
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:34,079
like real real interest.
 

1889
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,150
like real real interest.
So, I'm going to see some big flip in

1890
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,160
So, I'm going to see some big flip in
 

1891
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,670
So, I'm going to see some big flip in
delta here as we trade into point of

1892
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:37,680
delta here as we trade into point of
 

1893
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,710
delta here as we trade into point of
control on the session at 10.

1894
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:40,720
control on the session at 10.
 

1895
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,230
control on the session at 10.
What was the sentiment shift? I got

1896
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:42,240
What was the sentiment shift? I got
 

1897
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,750
What was the sentiment shift? I got
trying to remember. 340 is the big

1898
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:43,760
trying to remember. 340 is the big
 

1899
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,390
trying to remember. 340 is the big
sentiment shift.

1900
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:46,400
sentiment shift.
 

1901
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:57,030
sentiment shift.
340 is the big big sentiment shift.

1902
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,040

 

1903
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,870

Bit of a wiggle there. Bit of a wiggle

1904
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:58,880
Bit of a wiggle there. Bit of a wiggle
 

1905
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,790
Bit of a wiggle there. Bit of a wiggle
here. We're going to do a squeeze.

1906
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:00,800
here. We're going to do a squeeze.
 

1907
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,309
here. We're going to do a squeeze.
They're not bidding until we get down to

1908
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:02,319
They're not bidding until we get down to
 

1909
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,750
They're not bidding until we get down to
75.

1910
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:03,760
75.
 

1911
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,190
75.
Someone's got themselves caught down

1912
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,200
Someone's got themselves caught down
 

1913
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,750
Someone's got themselves caught down
here. Some sellers have got themselves

1914
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:07,760
here. Some sellers have got themselves
 

1915
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,270
here. Some sellers have got themselves
caught down here. Back into the opening

1916
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:09,280
caught down here. Back into the opening
 

1917
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,430
caught down here. Back into the opening
range on the day. Are we going to

1918
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:11,440
range on the day. Are we going to
 

1919
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,270
range on the day. Are we going to
revisit this 340? So, we've got a shelf

1920
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:13,280
revisit this 340? So, we've got a shelf
 

1921
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,910
revisit this 340? So, we've got a shelf
here. Sort of 315s.

1922
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:15,920
here. Sort of 315s.
 

1923
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,670
here. Sort of 315s.
Get through that 340s. Get through that

1924
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:17,680
Get through that 340s. Get through that
 

1925
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,750
Get through that 340s. Get through that
as bigger squeezes on. But until that

1926
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:19,760
as bigger squeezes on. But until that
 

1927
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,349
as bigger squeezes on. But until that
point, sellers remain in control because

1928
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:21,359
point, sellers remain in control because
 

1929
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,270
point, sellers remain in control because
we're underneath previous days or we're

1930
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:23,280
we're underneath previous days or we're
 

1931
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,510
we're underneath previous days or we're
inside previous day's value. We start

1932
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:25,520
inside previous day's value. We start
 

1933
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,550
inside previous day's value. We start
reclaiming though. It' be interesting.

1934
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:28,560
reclaiming though. It' be interesting.
 

1935
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,230
reclaiming though. It' be interesting.
It will be interesting if we start to go

1936
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,240
It will be interesting if we start to go
 

1937
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,550
It will be interesting if we start to go
reclaim.

1938
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:32,560
reclaim.
 

1939
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,150
reclaim.
I mean sellers still in control but

1940
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,160
I mean sellers still in control but
 

1941
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,630
I mean sellers still in control but
there are a ton of sellers on this

1942
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:36,640
there are a ton of sellers on this
 

1943
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,150
there are a ton of sellers on this
break. All right, think about how many

1944
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,160
break. All right, think about how many
 

1945
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,390
break. All right, think about how many
sellers came in here. If we are going to

1946
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:40,400
sellers came in here. If we are going to
 

1947
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,750
sellers came in here. If we are going to
we can't just poke above them. All

1948
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:41,760
we can't just poke above them. All
 

1949
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,829
we can't just poke above them. All
right, we need to do this and this and

1950
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:43,839
right, we need to do this and this and
 

1951
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,150
right, we need to do this and this and
then there's a squeeze until that point.

1952
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:46,160
then there's a squeeze until that point.
 

1953
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,589
then there's a squeeze until that point.
Right, this is where the sellers have

1954
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:47,599
Right, this is where the sellers have
 

1955
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,270
Right, this is where the sellers have
come in with size. If we do this, there

1956
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:49,280
come in with size. If we do this, there
 

1957
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,990
come in with size. If we do this, there
is a squeeze out possible. It's how

1958
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:52,000
is a squeeze out possible. It's how
 

1959
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,430
is a squeeze out possible. It's how
they've set it up is horrible. I'm not

1960
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:53,440
they've set it up is horrible. I'm not
 

1961
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,190
they've set it up is horrible. I'm not
tap tapping that and letting go of

1962
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,200
tap tapping that and letting go of
 

1963
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,990
tap tapping that and letting go of
previous day value. But

1964
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,000

 

1965
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,109

I wouldn't even call it a C setup. Uh

1966
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:03,119
I wouldn't even call it a C setup. Uh
 

1967
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,069
I wouldn't even call it a C setup. Uh
honestly, I would not even call it a C

1968
00:42:06,069 --> 00:42:06,079
honestly, I would not even call it a C
 

1969
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,664
honestly, I would not even call it a C
setup.

1970
00:42:07,664 --> 00:42:07,674
setup.
 

1971
00:42:07,674 --> 00:42:16,069
setup.
[snorts]

1972
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:16,079

 

1973
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,069

Let's see.

1974
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:18,079
Let's see.
 

1975
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,750
Let's see.
I am watch. I'm interested in trading

1976
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:19,760
I am watch. I'm interested in trading
 

1977
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,390
I am watch. I'm interested in trading
the squeeze if they want to do it.

1978
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:22,400
the squeeze if they want to do it.
 

1979
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,230
the squeeze if they want to do it.
Here's value on the day again. Tens. If

1980
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:24,240
Here's value on the day again. Tens. If
 

1981
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,430
Here's value on the day again. Tens. If
we get through this, we're going to go

1982
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:25,440
we get through this, we're going to go
 

1983
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,829
we get through this, we're going to go
40s. And that's the big big big big big

1984
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:27,839
40s. And that's the big big big big big
 

1985
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,670
40s. And that's the big big big big big
level.

1986
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:31,680

 

1987
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,510

Is there anyone selling up at 40s? No,

1988
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:33,520
Is there anyone selling up at 40s? No,
 

1989
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:39,510
Is there anyone selling up at 40s? No,
they're selling 20s still. Okay.

1990
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:39,520

 

1991
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,150

I hate that we left the highs and I hate

1992
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:42,160
I hate that we left the highs and I hate
 

1993
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,230
I hate that we left the highs and I hate
that we left value area low. That is

1994
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:44,240
that we left value area low. That is
 

1995
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,030

00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:46,000
sitting here telling me it's down again,
 

2147
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,910
sitting here telling me it's down again,
it's down again. You've been doing that

2148
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:47,920
it's down again. You've been doing that
 

2149
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,829
it's down again. You've been doing that
all year. This isn't me digging you guys

2150
00:45:49,829 --> 00:45:49,839
all year. This isn't me digging you guys
 

2151
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,270
all year. This isn't me digging you guys
out, but you need to stop and look at

2152
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:51,280
out, but you need to stop and look at
 

2153
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,589
out, but you need to stop and look at
yourself. If it's down yesterday and it

2154
00:45:53,589 --> 00:45:53,599
yourself. If it's down yesterday and it
 

2155
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,510
yourself. If it's down yesterday and it
was down again today and it was down 3

2156
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:55,520
was down again today and it was down 3
 

2157
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,030
was down again today and it was down 3
weeks ago and it was down four weeks ago

2158
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:57,040
weeks ago and it was down four weeks ago
 

2159
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,870
weeks ago and it was down four weeks ago
and it was down two months ago and you

2160
00:45:58,870 --> 00:45:58,880
and it was down two months ago and you
 

2161
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,790
and it was down two months ago and you
know the web developer left and it's a

2162
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:00,800
know the web developer left and it's a
 

2163
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,109
know the web developer left and it's a
web-based pro platform, why are you

2164
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:03,119
web-based pro platform, why are you
 

2165
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,030
web-based pro platform, why are you
trading there? That's what you have to

2166
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:05,040
trading there? That's what you have to
 

2167
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,670
trading there? That's what you have to
ask. Why are you trading there? Would

2168
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:07,680
ask. Why are you trading there? Would
 

2169
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,430
ask. Why are you trading there? Would
you buy a car which is breaking down

2170
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:09,440
you buy a car which is breaking down
 

2171
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,950
you buy a car which is breaking down
over and over and over and over and over

2172
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:12,960
over and over and over and over and over
 

2173
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,990
over and over and over and over and over
again? You wouldn't. So, don't waste

2174
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:16,000
again? You wouldn't. So, don't waste
 

2175
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,230
again? You wouldn't. So, don't waste
your money on someone that wants to

2176
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:18,240
your money on someone that wants to
 

2177
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,950
your money on someone that wants to
steal money off you.

2178
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:22,960

 

2179
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,109

There you go. It's a little rant, but

2180
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:25,119
There you go. It's a little rant, but
 

2181
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,670
There you go. It's a little rant, but
it's to protect you guys. I've made my

2182
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:27,680
it's to protect you guys. I've made my
 

2183
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,430
it's to protect you guys. I've made my
feelings clear about this, not just on

2184
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:29,440
feelings clear about this, not just on
 

2185
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,309
feelings clear about this, not just on
this stream, for probably over a year

2186
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:32,319
this stream, for probably over a year
 

2187
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,230
this stream, for probably over a year
now. All right. They failed to break the

2188
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:34,240
now. All right. They failed to break the
 

2189
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,069
now. All right. They failed to break the
low there. We're still developing this

2190
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:36,079
low there. We're still developing this
 

2191
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,710
low there. We're still developing this
like sort of shelf in here. Those

2192
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:38,720
like sort of shelf in here. Those
 

2193
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,069
like sort of shelf in here. Those
sellers definitely got caught in that

2194
00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:40,079
sellers definitely got caught in that
 

2195
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:46,710
sellers definitely got caught in that
imbalance into 70 there.

2196
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:46,720

 

2197
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,069

Watching this to see now if we're going

2198
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:48,079
Watching this to see now if we're going
 

2199
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,510
Watching this to see now if we're going
to pop because sellers definitely got

2200
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:49,520
to pop because sellers definitely got
 

2201
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,950
to pop because sellers definitely got
caught into that imbalance. If we're

2202
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:50,960
caught into that imbalance. If we're
 

2203
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,550
caught into that imbalance. If we're
going to get through the teens, then we

2204
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:52,560
going to get through the teens, then we
 

2205
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,630
going to get through the teens, then we
can trade up to the 40s. And that is the

2206
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:54,640
can trade up to the 40s. And that is the
 

2207
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,069
can trade up to the 40s. And that is the
what I'm really interested in is how we

2208
00:46:56,069 --> 00:46:56,079
what I'm really interested in is how we
 

2209
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,589
what I'm really interested in is how we
act once we get up there. I'm really

2210
00:46:57,589 --> 00:46:57,599
act once we get up there. I'm really
 

2211
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:58,630
act once we get up there. I'm really
interested this at the moment because

2212
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:58,640
interested this at the moment because
 

2213
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,829
interested this at the moment because
they're starting to try and aggressively

2214
00:46:59,829 --> 00:46:59,839
they're starting to try and aggressively
 

2215
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,589
they're starting to try and aggressively
get this through the 20s. This is the

2216
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:01,599
get this through the 20s. This is the
 

2217
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:02,790
get this through the 20s. This is the
level. If they get through 20s, we're

2218
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:02,800
level. If they get through 20s, we're
 

2219
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,030
level. If they get through 20s, we're
going 40s. Bing bing bing bing bing bing

2220
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:05,040
going 40s. Bing bing bing bing bing bing
 

2221
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,790
going 40s. Bing bing bing bing bing bing
bing bing bing. Can you get us through

2222
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:06,800
bing bing bing. Can you get us through
 

2223
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,550
bing bing bing. Can you get us through
this level? Buyers, can you get up to

2224
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:08,560
this level? Buyers, can you get up to
 

2225
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,230
this level? Buyers, can you get up to
40s? Don't want to see a fa failed

2226
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:10,240
40s? Don't want to see a fa failed
 

2227
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,390
40s? Don't want to see a fa failed
breakout. I need to see continuation up

2228
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:12,400
breakout. I need to see continuation up
 

2229
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,829
breakout. I need to see continuation up
to 40s. Otherwise, it's a two-legged

2230
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:13,839
to 40s. Otherwise, it's a two-legged
 

2231
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,109
to 40s. Otherwise, it's a two-legged
that they're going to come and smack

2232
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:15,119
that they're going to come and smack
 

2233
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,870
that they're going to come and smack
back down. And we're looking at this

2234
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:16,880
back down. And we're looking at this
 

2235
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,390
back down. And we're looking at this
seller who's caught up here. That's

2236
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:18,400
seller who's caught up here. That's
 

2237
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,309
seller who's caught up here. That's
where I want to trade his pain. So, we

2238
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:20,319
where I want to trade his pain. So, we
 

2239
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,390
where I want to trade his pain. So, we
had sellers come flying in here, get

2240
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:22,400
had sellers come flying in here, get
 

2241
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,910
had sellers come flying in here, get
themselves caught. Big sellers were

2242
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:23,920
themselves caught. Big sellers were
 

2243
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,990
themselves caught. Big sellers were
traded in here. All right. This seller

2244
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:26,000
traded in here. All right. This seller
 

2245
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,349
traded in here. All right. This seller
is getting squeezed to here. If we

2246
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:27,359
is getting squeezed to here. If we
 

2247
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:28,710
is getting squeezed to here. If we
squeeze this guy out, we're coming

2248
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:28,720
squeeze this guy out, we're coming
 

2249
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,309
squeeze this guy out, we're coming
straight back upside. So that's why I'm

2250
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:30,319
straight back upside. So that's why I'm
 

2251
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,790
straight back upside. So that's why I'm
watching the 40s.

2252
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:32,800
watching the 40s.
 

2253
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,270

Let's go. I need to look below and fail.

Let's go. I need to look below and fail.
 

2309

Let's go. I need to look below and fail.
We need to go upside. Upside. Upside.

Do not want to fail back inside. Do not

you do not [\h__\h] dare do this. Hey, at
 

2321
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:03,349
you do not [\h__\h] dare do this. Hey, at
least I paid myself. Still holding one.

2322
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:03,359

 

2323
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,309

Want dips to hold into 20s and tens.

2324
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:06,319
Want dips to hold into 20s and tens.
 

2325
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,309
Want dips to hold into 20s and tens.
Really, there's some couple imbalances

2326
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:08,319
Really, there's some couple imbalances
 

2327
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:09,750
Really, there's some couple imbalances
from that squeeze out. They need to hold

2328
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:09,760
from that squeeze out. They need to hold
 

2329
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,349
from that squeeze out. They need to hold
20s and tens. They definitely cannot

2330
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:11,359
20s and tens. They definitely cannot
 

2331
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,750
20s and tens. They definitely cannot
become back below tens. Sellers are

2332
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:13,760
become back below tens. Sellers are
 

2333
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,190
become back below tens. Sellers are
currently offside under 298. So that I

2334
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:17,200
currently offside under 298. So that I
 

2335
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,030
currently offside under 298. So that I
mean that's the last I wouldn't be

2336
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:19,040
mean that's the last I wouldn't be
 

2337
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,270
mean that's the last I wouldn't be
holding down to there, but

2338
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:21,280
holding down to there, but
 

2339
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,589
holding down to there, but
if they reload here in 20s and tens for

2340
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:23,599
if they reload here in 20s and tens for
 

2341
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,430
if they reload here in 20s and tens for
a resqueeze up, it would be really good.

2342
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:25,440
a resqueeze up, it would be really good.
 

2343
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,750
a resqueeze up, it would be really good.
But definitely sellers are stuck under

2344
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:27,760
But definitely sellers are stuck under
 

2345
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,349
But definitely sellers are stuck under
300. So you do not want to see this go

2346
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:31,359
300. So you do not want to see this go
 

2347
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,390
300. So you do not want to see this go
back under the 300s right now. Let's go,

2348
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:34,400
back under the 300s right now. Let's go,
 

2349
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,589
back under the 300s right now. Let's go,
[\h__\h] Let's squeeze this.

2350
00:49:37,589 --> 00:49:37,599
[\h__\h] Let's squeeze this.
 

2351
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,150
[\h__\h] Let's squeeze this.
Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Come on,

Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Come on,
baby. You've got it in you.

2354
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:46,079

 

2355
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,750

Some more sellers here into 30s and 25s.

2356
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:49,760
Some more sellers here into 30s and 25s.
 

2357
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,190
Some more sellers here into 30s and 25s.
They're protecting previous day value

2358
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:51,200
They're protecting previous day value
 

2359
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,790
They're protecting previous day value
very high right now. I need to be very

2360
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:52,800
very high right now. I need to be very
 

2361
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,470
very high right now. I need to be very
careful if they keep protecting that

2362
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:54,480
careful if they keep protecting that
 

2363
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,390
careful if they keep protecting that
because that is uh saying that we want

2364
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:56,400
because that is uh saying that we want
 

2365
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,069
because that is uh saying that we want
to go back into the rotation again from

2366
00:49:58,069 --> 00:49:58,079
to go back into the rotation again from
 

2367
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,589
to go back into the rotation again from
yesterday. Remember, we didn't hit

2368
00:49:59,589 --> 00:49:59,599
yesterday. Remember, we didn't hit
 

2369
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,150
yesterday. Remember, we didn't hit
previous day value area low. Here's the

2370
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:02,160
previous day value area low. Here's the
 

2371
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,950
previous day value area low. Here's the
move back into 20s.

2372
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:04,960
move back into 20s.
 

2373
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,549
move back into 20s.
Some sellers coming in here at the low

2374
00:50:06,549 --> 00:50:06,559
Some sellers coming in here at the low
 

2375
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,870
Some sellers coming in here at the low
of this candle.

2376
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:10,880

 

2377
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,950

They're caught again. Can we see

2378
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:12,960
They're caught again. Can we see
 

2379
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,349
They're caught again. Can we see
expansion higher now? Caught them

2380
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:15,359
expansion higher now? Caught them
 

2381
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,750
expansion higher now? Caught them
offside again. Got to get back through

2382
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:17,760
offside again. Got to get back through
 

2383
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,990
offside again. Got to get back through
value through 40s and we will squeeze.

2384
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:20,000
value through 40s and we will squeeze.
 

2385
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,430
value through 40s and we will squeeze.
They're trying to refresh sell this into

00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:21,440
They're trying to refresh sell this into
 

2387
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,390
They're trying to refresh sell this into
40s. It's getting tight here.

2388
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:24,400
40s. It's getting tight here.
 

2389
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,230

We just need to get through 40s for a

We just need to get through 40s for a
 

2391
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,430
We just need to get through 40s for a
squeeze out now. Come on. We caught some

2392
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:29,440
squeeze out now. Come on. We caught some
 

2393
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,630
squeeze out now. Come on. We caught some
more there. You've got to get back

2394
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:30,640
more there. You've got to get back
 

2395
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,390
more there. You've got to get back
through. Let's do this squeeze out. You

2396
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:32,400
through. Let's do this squeeze out. You
 

2397
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,910
through. Let's do this squeeze out. You
don't need to reload one more time.

2398
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:33,920
don't need to reload one more time.
 

2399
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,589
don't need to reload one more time.
Squeeze it out now or I'm out. Squeeze

2400
00:50:35,589 --> 00:50:35,599
Squeeze it out now or I'm out. Squeeze
 

2401

it out now. I'm out. Oh, you
 

2403
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:44,150
it out now. I'm out. Oh, you
[\h__\h] playing around games.

2404
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,160

 

2405
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,270

You idiots. You idiots.

2406
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:49,280
You idiots. You idiots.
 

2407

You idiots. You idiots.
Someone wants to play games between 20

2408
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:50,880
Someone wants to play games between 20
 

2409
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,230
Someone wants to play games between 20
and 40. So, I'm not going to sit through

2410
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:52,240
and 40. So, I'm not going to sit through
 

2411
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,470
and 40. So, I'm not going to sit through
it. I'll just rewait now for us to get

2412
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:54,480
it. I'll just rewait now for us to get
 

2413
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,870
it. I'll just rewait now for us to get
close back over 40 for a read.

2414
00:50:58,870 --> 00:50:58,880

 

2415
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,309

Not done below. Yeah, I mean it's

2416
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:00,319
Not done below. Yeah, I mean it's
 

2417
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,150
Not done below. Yeah, I mean it's
possible, but uh like I said, sellers

2418
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:02,160
possible, but uh like I said, sellers
 

2419
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,069
possible, but uh like I said, sellers
are caught under 300. Until sellers get

2420
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:04,079
are caught under 300. Until sellers get
 

2421
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,390
are caught under 300. Until sellers get
back under 300, they're in trouble. They

2422
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:06,400
back under 300, they're in trouble. They
 

2423
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,910
back under 300, they're in trouble. They
might well come back under 300. Now,

2424
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:07,920
might well come back under 300. Now,
 

2425
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,950
might well come back under 300. Now,
here's the retest. This is where the

2426
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:08,960
here's the retest. This is where the
 

2427
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,710
here's the retest. This is where the
delta got stuck last time, right into

2428
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:10,720
delta got stuck last time, right into
 

2429
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,790
delta got stuck last time, right into
this 300. If they close back under here,

2430
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:12,800
this 300. If they close back under here,
 

2431
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,910
this 300. If they close back under here,
we're going to go lower of day because

2432
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:13,920
we're going to go lower of day because
 

2433
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,630
we're going to go lower of day because
we did not get down to here, but made

2434
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:16,640
we did not get down to here, but made
 

2435
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,549
we did not get down to here, but made
good money on that last shove up. just

2436
00:51:18,549 --> 00:51:18,559
good money on that last shove up. just
 

2437
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,710
good money on that last shove up. just
what we needed to get a close over 40.

2438
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:20,720
what we needed to get a close over 40.
 

2439
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,710
what we needed to get a close over 40.
Well, I didn't read add until we got

2440
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:22,720
Well, I didn't read add until we got
 

2441
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,309
Well, I didn't read add until we got
over 40s, but now we're waiting. So,

2442
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:24,319
over 40s, but now we're waiting. So,
 

2443
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:25,910
over 40s, but now we're waiting. So,

00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:51,839
seller.
 

2597
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:53,430
seller.
So, he's spoofing to move this lower.

2598
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:53,440
So, he's spoofing to move this lower.
 

2599
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,750
So, he's spoofing to move this lower.
I'm out of this. If he's going to spoof

2600
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:55,760
I'm out of this. If he's going to spoof
 

2601
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,230
I'm out of this. If he's going to spoof
to move it lower, I don't want to play

2602
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:58,240
to move it lower, I don't want to play
 

2603
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,790
to move it lower, I don't want to play
because it means he's a seller.

2604
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:00,800
because it means he's a seller.
 

2605
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,470
because it means he's a seller.
So, I'll just wait. I'll wait for a

00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:02,480
So, I'll just wait. I'll wait for a
 

2607
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,190
So, I'll just wait. I'll wait for a
close back over 40 to buy this. Now,

2608
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:05,200
close back over 40 to buy this. Now,
 

2609
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,790
close back over 40 to buy this. Now,
sorry, I have to talk out loud in my

2610
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:06,800
sorry, I have to talk out loud in my
 

2611
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,390
sorry, I have to talk out loud in my
head sometimes.

2612
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:10,400

 

2613
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:19,190

talk it out loud in my head.

2614
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:19,200

 

2615
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,950

There you go. So, he's reselling it. So,

2616
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:20,960
There you go. So, he's reselling it. So,
 

2617
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,710
There you go. So, he's reselling it. So,
he was spoofing the bid so that he could

2618
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:22,720
he was spoofing the bid so that he could
 

2619
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,069
he was spoofing the bid so that he could
come in and sell it and then he's

2620
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:24,079
come in and sell it and then he's
 

2621
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:25,510
come in and sell it and then he's
pulling his bid so that we can flush

2622
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:25,520
pulling his bid so that we can flush
 

2623
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,950
pulling his bid so that we can flush
down lower. That's why I had to say it

2624
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:26,960
down lower. That's why I had to say it
 

2625
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,349
down lower. That's why I had to say it
out loud. Head's still waking up here

2626
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:29,359
out loud. Head's still waking up here
 

2627
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,109
out loud. Head's still waking up here
this morning.

2628
00:55:31,109 --> 00:55:31,119
this morning.
 

2629
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,710
this morning.
Head is still waking up. 300 is still

2630
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:32,720
Head is still waking up. 300 is still
 

2631
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,349
Head is still waking up. 300 is still
the level point of control. Uh if they

2632
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:35,359
the level point of control. Uh if they
 

2633
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,430
the level point of control. Uh if they
break down under here, this is actually

2634
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:37,440
break down under here, this is actually
 

2635
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,750
break down under here, this is actually
a fail to move higher. Now trying to be

2636
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:39,760
a fail to move higher. Now trying to be
 

2637
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,589
a fail to move higher. Now trying to be
uh neutral looking at this. This is a

2638
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:41,599
uh neutral looking at this. This is a
 

2639
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:42,950
uh neutral looking at this. This is a
fail to move high. If they break this,

2640
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:42,960
fail to move high. If they break this,
 

2641
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,670
fail to move high. If they break this,
then this is available. But this is

2642
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:45,680
then this is available. But this is
 

2643
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,589
then this is available. But this is
where the sellers got stuck. This 300

2644
00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:47,599
where the sellers got stuck. This 300
 

2645
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,349
where the sellers got stuck. This 300
and this is the range. You got 40 points

2646
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:49,359
and this is the range. You got 40 points
 

2647
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:50,950
and this is the range. You got 40 points
here.

2648
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:50,960
here.
 

2649
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,589
here.
So you got 300 to 20 rotation, 20 to 40

2650
00:55:53,589 --> 00:55:53,599
So you got 300 to 20 rotation, 20 to 40
 

2651
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,309
So you got 300 to 20 rotation, 20 to 40
rotation. Over 20 you need to break 50s

2652
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:56,319
rotation. Over 20 you need to break 50s
 

2653
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,549
rotation. Over 20 you need to break 50s
and then the squeeze is on. And they

2654
00:55:58,549 --> 00:55:58,559
and then the squeeze is on. And they
 

2655
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,190
and then the squeeze is on. And they
keep refresh selling into these 30s up

2656
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:01,200
keep refresh selling into these 30s up
 

2657
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,470
keep refresh selling into these 30s up
here. You can see it on the T. See this

2658
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:02,480
here. You can see it on the T. See this
 

2659
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,870
here. You can see it on the T. See this

2679
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:42,789

value area high. We got to get through

2680
00:56:42,789 --> 00:56:42,799
value area high. We got to get through
 

2681
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,150

We should go and test him. Really

00:57:10,069 --> 00:57:10,079
We should go and test him. Really
 

2707
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:11,990
We should go and test him. Really
spy and ES now through VWAP looking much

spy and ES now through VWAP looking much
 

2709
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,910
spy and ES now through VWAP looking much
better as an alignment. VIX got crushed

2710
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:13,920
better as an alignment. VIX got crushed
 

2711
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,990
better as an alignment. VIX got crushed
back under previous days low. Alignment

2712
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:16,000
back under previous days low. Alignment
 

2713
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,670
back under previous days low. Alignment
is upside. It's just depends if this

2714
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:17,680
is upside. It's just depends if this
 

2715
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,829
is upside. It's just depends if this
refresh seller is going to keep being a

2716
00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:19,839
refresh seller is going to keep being a
 

2717
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:21,109
refresh seller is going to keep being a
pain up here. And the answer right now

2718
00:57:21,109 --> 00:57:21,119
pain up here. And the answer right now
 

2719
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,510
pain up here. And the answer right now
is yes, he is.

2720
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:23,520
is yes, he is.
 

2721
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:28,390
is yes, he is.
My god, why won't you let it retest?

2722
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:28,400

 

2723
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,829

So, they're leaning on previous day

2724
00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:29,839
So, they're leaning on previous day
 

2725
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:31,750
So, they're leaning on previous day
value high right here. They're leaning

2726
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:31,760
value high right here. They're leaning
 

2727
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,670
value high right here. They're leaning
on this level to try and resell. This is

2728
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:33,680
on this level to try and resell. This is
 

2729
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,270
on this level to try and resell. This is
another failed breakout to the high

2730
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:35,280
another failed breakout to the high
 

2731
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,069
another failed breakout to the high
side. All right. So, this is two

2732
00:57:38,069 --> 00:57:38,079
side. All right. So, this is two
 

2733
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,390
side. All right. So, this is two
attempts now to break out. One, two.

2734
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:40,400
attempts now to break out. One, two.
 

2735
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,910
attempts now to break out. One, two.
They cannot get through here. The more

2736
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:41,920
They cannot get through here. The more
 

2737
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,069
They cannot get through here. The more
they try, the more buyers keep trying up

2738
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:44,079
they try, the more buyers keep trying up
 

2739
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:45,510
they try, the more buyers keep trying up
here, the more they get stuck. Sellers

2740
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:45,520
here, the more they get stuck. Sellers
 

2741
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,510
here, the more they get stuck. Sellers
are now stuck down here. This is the

2742
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:47,520
are now stuck down here. This is the
 

2743
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,829
are now stuck down here. This is the
rotation. If sellers win, they will get

2744
00:57:49,829 --> 00:57:49,839
rotation. If sellers win, they will get
 

2745
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:51,589
rotation. If sellers win, they will get
this. If buyers win, they will get this.

2746
00:57:51,589 --> 00:57:51,599
this. If buyers win, they will get this.

00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:31,119
last couple hours. Here you go. They're
 

2829
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,190
last couple hours. Here you go. They're
taking control back to the 300. If they

2830
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:33,200
taking control back to the 300. If they
 

2831
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,870
taking control back to the 300. If they
sell 300 here, I would imagine we're

2832
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:34,880
sell 300 here, I would imagine we're
 

2833
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,270
sell 300 here, I would imagine we're
going to go lower day. If they can close

2834
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:37,280
going to go lower day. If they can close
 

2835
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,309
going to go lower day. If they can close
under 300 otherwise, same rotation 300

2836
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:40,319
under 300 otherwise, same rotation 300
 

2837
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:47,670

to 40 to 340.

2839
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,910

Yeah, I agree. He was a seller. Exactly,

2840
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:49,920
Yeah, I agree. He was a seller. Exactly,
 

2841
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,030
Yeah, I agree. He was a seller. Exactly,
Raph. He was spoofing the bid because he

2842
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:53,040
Raph. He was spoofing the bid because he
 

2843
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,349
Raph. He was spoofing the bid because he
was sellside. Right. So, he was putting

2844
00:59:55,349 --> 00:59:55,359
was sellside. Right. So, he was putting
 

2845
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,109
was sellside. Right. So, he was putting
bid support in and he was selling down

2846
00:59:57,109 --> 00:59:57,119
bid support in and he was selling down
 

2847
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:58,549
bid support in and he was selling down
into it and then he was pulling the bid

2848
00:59:58,549 --> 00:59:58,559
into it and then he was pulling the bid
 

2849
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,789
into it and then he was pulling the bid
hoping that we just fly through it.

2850
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:00,799
hoping that we just fly through it.
 

2851
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,309
hoping that we just fly through it.

2855

my head. I'm like, "Okay, if he's a
spoofer bid side, then he wants the

2856
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:06,480
spoofer bid side, then he wants the
 

2857
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,030

level like a like a I don't know what

2910
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:06,960
level like a like a I don't know what
 

2911
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,150
level like a like a I don't know what
you call that. Spring. They're waiting

2912
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:10,160
you call that. Spring. They're waiting
 

2913
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,069
you call that. Spring. They're waiting
for one side to get stuck and pop. And

2914
01:01:12,069 --> 01:01:12,079
for one side to get stuck and pop. And
 

2915
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:19,510
for one side to get stuck and pop. And
at the moment it's just a battle.

2916
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:19,520

 

2917
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,750

2370. If I got a guy above it, I can

2918
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:21,760
2370. If I got a guy above it, I can
 

2919
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,150
2370. If I got a guy above it, I can
see.

Yeah. I mean, you can see the big bids

2922
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:25,680
Yeah. I mean, you can see the big bids
 

2923
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,230
Yeah. I mean, you can see the big bids
are down at 237s.

2924
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:28,240
are down at 237s.
 

2925
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,150
are down at 237s.
Is that previous day value or low? It's

2926
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:30,160
Is that previous day value or low? It's
 

2927
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,789
Is that previous day value or low? It's
above it.

2928
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:32,799
above it.
 

2929
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,990
above it.
It's there or thereabouts.

2930
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:36,000
It's there or thereabouts.
 

2931
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,510
It's there or thereabouts.
This just does not look good. This looks

2932
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:37,520
This just does not look good. This looks
 

2933
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,430
This just does not look good. This looks
like yesterday.

2934
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:39,440
like yesterday.
 

2935
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,670
like yesterday.
This is why I said I wouldn't trade this

2936
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:41,680
This is why I said I wouldn't trade this
 

2937
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,789
This is why I said I wouldn't trade this
level because price yesterday showed you

2938
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:44,799
level because price yesterday showed you
 

2939
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:46,230
level because price yesterday showed you
what it wants to do on this level, which

2940
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:46,240
what it wants to do on this level, which
 

2941
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,549
what it wants to do on this level, which
is be a pain in the butt. The buys

2942
01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:48,559
is be a pain in the butt. The buys
 

2943
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:51,030
is be a pain in the butt. The buys
yesterday,

2944
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:51,040
yesterday,
 

2945
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,349
yesterday,
uh, it was 220, right, chat? The guys in

2946
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:53,359
uh, it was 220, right, chat? The guys in
 

2947
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:56,789
uh, it was 220, right, chat? The guys in
mind our Discord, we were bidding off

2948
01:01:56,789 --> 01:01:56,799
mind our Discord, we were bidding off
 

2949
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:59,270
mind our Discord, we were bidding off
naked point of control, break of 220.

2950
01:01:59,270 --> 01:01:59,280
naked point of control, break of 220.
 

2951
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,549
naked point of control, break of 220.
There's the squeeze. That's where the

2952
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:00,559
There's the squeeze. That's where the
 

2953
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:03,510
There's the squeeze. That's where the
sellers are stuck from yesterday. You've

2954
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:03,520
sellers are stuck from yesterday. You've
 

2955
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:07,030
sellers are stuck from yesterday. You've
got short sellers stuck down here. They

2956
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:07,040
got short sellers stuck down here. They
 

2957
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,589
got short sellers stuck down here. They
will remain stuck down here if we don't

2958
01:02:09,589 --> 01:02:09,599
will remain stuck down here if we don't
 

2959
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,230
will remain stuck down here if we don't
let them out. So we also need to think

2960
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,240
let them out. So we also need to think
 

2961
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,309
let them out. So we also need to think
about that because that there was big

2962
01:02:14,309 --> 01:02:14,319
about that because that there was big
 

2963
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:17,030
about that because that there was big
size stuck down here yesterday

2964
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:17,040
size stuck down here yesterday
 

2965
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,510
size stuck down here yesterday
and this is the the key level. So if

2966
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:19,520
and this is the the key level. So if
 

2967
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,109
and this is the the key level. So if
these guys remain stuck, we drift

2968
01:02:21,109 --> 01:02:21,119
these guys remain stuck, we drift
 

2969
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,710
these guys remain stuck, we drift
upside. If these guys are let out,

2970
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:24,720
upside. If these guys are let out,
 

2971
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,829
upside. If these guys are let out,
we can't rule out this. We can't um I'm

2972
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:27,839
we can't rule out this. We can't um I'm
 

2973
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,030
we can't rule out this. We can't um I'm
not thinking about that until we get

2974
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:29,040
not thinking about that until we get
 

2975
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,589
not thinking about that until we get
undervalue and until we we have to

2976
01:02:31,589 --> 01:02:31,599
undervalue and until we we have to
 

2977
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:34,230
undervalue and until we we have to
reject 220 and 200 and then we can think

2978
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:34,240
reject 220 and 200 and then we can think
 

2979
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,710
reject 220 and 200 and then we can think
about that melt to 800s. I didn't think

2980
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:36,720
about that melt to 800s. I didn't think
 

2981
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,829
about that melt to 800s. I didn't think
it would come today. I'm going to be

2982
01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:37,839
it would come today. I'm going to be
 

2983
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,349
it would come today. I'm going to be
honest with you. I did not not think

2984
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:39,359
honest with you. I did not not think
 

2985
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,670
honest with you. I did not not think
we'd do this move today. I still don't.

2986
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:41,680
we'd do this move today. I still don't.
 

2987
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,309
we'd do this move today. I still don't.
But I'm aware of it. Saying it out loud

2988
01:02:44,309 --> 01:02:44,319
But I'm aware of it. Saying it out loud
 

2989
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:45,990
But I'm aware of it. Saying it out loud
because I'm going to have to shift tone.

2990
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:46,000
because I'm going to have to shift tone.
 

2991
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,510
because I'm going to have to shift tone.
If we start letting those sellers who

were stuck from yesterday out, if we
start going into a major sell, we have

2996
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:51,119
start going into a major sell, we have
 

2997
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,349
start going into a major sell, we have
to be aware of that.

in the morning New York time. We go
through pre-market analysis. The levels

3016
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:12,240
through pre-market analysis. The levels
 

3017
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,589
through pre-market analysis. The levels
I'm looking at, the trades I'm looking

3018
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:13,599
I'm looking at, the trades I'm looking
 

3019
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:15,829
I'm looking at, the trades I'm looking
at today. Been very clear at the trades

3020
01:03:15,829 --> 01:03:15,839
at today. Been very clear at the trades
 

3021
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:16,950
at today. Been very clear at the trades
I'm looking at. Actually, none of them

3022
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:16,960
I'm looking at. Actually, none of them
 

3023
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,309
I'm looking at. Actually, none of them
have come in. If I'm honest with you, we

3024
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:18,319
have come in. If I'm honest with you, we
 

3025
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:19,990
have come in. If I'm honest with you, we
didn't get the look above and fail and

3026
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:20,000
didn't get the look above and fail and
 

3027
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,589
didn't get the look above and fail and
we haven't held value. We've gone right

3028
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:21,599
we haven't held value. We've gone right
 

3029
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,109
we haven't held value. We've gone right
back into yesterday's range, which was

3030
01:03:23,109 --> 01:03:23,119
back into yesterday's range, which was
 

3031
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,190
back into yesterday's range, which was
the one trade I said I did not want to

3032
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:25,200
the one trade I said I did not want to
 

3033
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,029
the one trade I said I did not want to
take. The only other trade I would

3034
01:03:27,029 --> 01:03:27,039
take. The only other trade I would
 

3035
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:29,670
take. The only other trade I would
consider, if we lose yesterday's value,

3036
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:29,680
consider, if we lose yesterday's value,
 

3037
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,950
consider, if we lose yesterday's value,
like I said, if we start losing

3038
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:30,960
like I said, if we start losing
 

3039
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,390
like I said, if we start losing
yesterday's value, we have to be very

3040
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:32,400
yesterday's value, we have to be very
 

3041
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,309
yesterday's value, we have to be very
aware of this weekly level. It's a 50%

3042
01:03:34,309 --> 01:03:34,319
aware of this weekly level. It's a 50%
 

3043
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:36,390
aware of this weekly level. It's a 50%
pullback on the fib. It's an old naked

3044
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:36,400
pullback on the fib. It's an old naked
 

3045
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,829
pullback on the fib. It's an old naked
point of control. But if we start

3046
01:03:37,829 --> 01:03:37,839
point of control. But if we start
 

3047
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:40,549
point of control. But if we start
rotating under here, there is a sell

3048
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:40,559
rotating under here, there is a sell
 

3049
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,390
rotating under here, there is a sell
previous day low and this is the next

3050
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:42,400
previous day low and this is the next
 

3051
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,990
previous day low and this is the next
target. That's based on the daily

3052
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:44,000
target. That's based on the daily
 

3053
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,870
target. That's based on the daily
profiles. All right, if we go back to

3054
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:46,880
profiles. All right, if we go back to
 

3055
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,470
profiles. All right, if we go back to
the dailies for those of you who might

3056
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:48,480
the dailies for those of you who might
 

3057
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,390
the dailies for those of you who might
be joining late, it's important to make

3058
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:50,400
be joining late, it's important to make
 

3059
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,829
be joining late, it's important to make
sure you're zooming out, understand

3060
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:51,839
sure you're zooming out, understand
 

3061
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,910
sure you're zooming out, understand
where we are. All right, if we are going

3062
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:53,920
where we are. All right, if we are going
 

3063
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,829
where we are. All right, if we are going
to keep losing this, we it's possible

3064
01:03:55,829 --> 01:03:55,839
to keep losing this, we it's possible
 

3065
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:57,270
to keep losing this, we it's possible
we're going to test the bottom side of

3066
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:57,280
we're going to test the bottom side of
 

3067
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,069
we're going to test the bottom side of
this shelf again. This is the old PC.

3068
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:00,079
this shelf again. This is the old PC.
 

3069
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:01,589
this shelf again. This is the old PC.
All right, and if we lose that, the next

3070
01:04:01,589 --> 01:04:01,599
All right, and if we lose that, the next
 

3071
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:03,510
All right, and if we lose that, the next
level was really 800. I would expect

3072
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:03,520
level was really 800. I would expect
 

3073
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,109
level was really 800. I would expect
buyers, like I've been saying, I expect

3074
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:05,119
buyers, like I've been saying, I expect
 

3075
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,950
buyers, like I've been saying, I expect
buyers will try their best to defend

3076
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:06,960
buyers will try their best to defend
 

3077
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,950
buyers will try their best to defend
this area. This can easily be a

3078
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:08,960
this area. This can easily be a
 

3079
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,309
this area. This can easily be a
rotation. You can see this part of the

3080
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:10,319
rotation. You can see this part of the
 

3081
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:14,150
rotation. You can see this part of the
D-shape. This can be a rotation here.

3082
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:14,160
D-shape. This can be a rotation here.
 

3083
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,670
D-shape. This can be a rotation here.
So, we need to be aware of that. Balls

3084
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:15,680
So, we need to be aware of that. Balls
 

3085
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,029
So, we need to be aware of that. Balls
really technically don't take control

3086
01:04:17,029 --> 01:04:17,039
really technically don't take control
 

3087
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:19,430
really technically don't take control
till you see that from a technical point

3088
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:19,440
till you see that from a technical point
 

3089
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,870
till you see that from a technical point
of view, but they will try and defend

3090
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:20,880
of view, but they will try and defend
 

3091
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:28,069
of view, but they will try and defend
this level here.

3092
01:04:28,069 --> 01:04:28,079

 

3093
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:30,789

It's back on. Sorry, folks.

3094
01:04:30,789 --> 01:04:30,799
It's back on. Sorry, folks.
 

3095
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:34,950
It's back on. Sorry, folks.
Okay, so they've caught them again

3096
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:34,960
Okay, so they've caught them again
 

3097
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,349
Okay, so they've caught them again
in and around these same levels. We're

3098
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:37,359
in and around these same levels. We're
 

3099
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:39,190
in and around these same levels. We're
getting a huge node now starting to be

3100
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:39,200
getting a huge node now starting to be
 

3101
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,270
getting a huge node now starting to be
built out. It's a 10point node. You can

3102
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:41,280
built out. It's a 10point node. You can
 

3103
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,950
built out. It's a 10point node. You can
see this. Do you remember anyone that

3104
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:42,960
see this. Do you remember anyone that
 

3105
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,710
see this. Do you remember anyone that
was here yesterday? The gray box, which

3106
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:44,720
was here yesterday? The gray box, which
 

3107
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,870
was here yesterday? The gray box, which
was the rotational box. Well, it was

3108
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:46,880
was the rotational box. Well, it was
 

3109
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,549
was the rotational box. Well, it was
probably around here. It's here again.

3110
01:04:48,549 --> 01:04:48,559
probably around here. It's here again.
 

3111
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,710
probably around here. It's here again.
All right, that is your rotational node.

3112
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:50,720
All right, that is your rotational node.
 

3113
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,710
All right, that is your rotational node.
Until we leave that, until we have a

3114
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:52,720
Until we leave that, until we have a
 

3115
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,069
Until we leave that, until we have a
breakaway from that, you can see this

3116
01:04:54,069 --> 01:04:54,079
breakaway from that, you can see this
 

3117
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:57,430
breakaway from that, you can see this

here at 20s. Are we going to start to
 

3141
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,589
here at 20s. Are we going to start to
squeeze through 20s? Is it going to get

3142
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:25,599
squeeze through 20s? Is it going to get
 

3143
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,349
squeeze through 20s? Is it going to get
back to the 40s? Is it going to reclaim

3144
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:27,359
back to the 40s? Is it going to reclaim
 

3145
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:29,750
back to the 40s? Is it going to reclaim
40s and go for a squeeze through to 50

3146
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:29,760
40s and go for a squeeze through to 50
 

3147

40s and go for a squeeze through to 50
and VWOP at 65? Or are they going to

3148
01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:31,839
and VWOP at 65? Or are they going to
 

3149
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:34,150
and VWOP at 65? Or are they going to
refresh sell these 20s and look for that

3150
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:34,160
refresh sell these 20s and look for that
 

3151
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,390
refresh sell these 20s and look for that
rotation again? We are. See the gray

to remove this just to clean it up a
 

3157
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,150
to remove this just to clean it up a
little bit. All right, that's your

rotation. We've got another little node

3160
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:43,760
rotation. We've got another little node
 

3161
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,829
rotation. We've got another little node
here. Can they find acceptance above all

3162
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:45,839
here. Can they find acceptance above all
 

3163
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:47,670
here. Can they find acceptance above all
of this area or is it just going to be a

3164
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:47,680
of this area or is it just going to be a
 

3165
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,710
of this area or is it just going to be a
pot to sell into again?

3166
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:50,720
pot to sell into again?
 

3167
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,150
pot to sell into again?
So, New York view up here. They're going

3168
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:52,160
So, New York view up here. They're going
 

3169
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,510
So, New York view up here. They're going
to have to clear. There's lots of

3170
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:53,520
to have to clear. There's lots of
 

3171
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,190
to have to clear. There's lots of
problems now. You got previous day point

3172
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:55,200
problems now. You got previous day point
 

3173
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,150
problems now. You got previous day point
of control. Uh developing profile point

3174
01:05:58,150 --> 01:05:58,160
of control. Uh developing profile point
 

3175
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,829
of control. Uh developing profile point
of control is this thick red line. New

3176
01:05:59,829 --> 01:05:59,839
of control is this thick red line. New
 

3177
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:01,750
of control is this thick red line. New
York view up previous day value area

3178
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:01,760
York view up previous day value area
 

3179
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,510
York view up previous day value area
high. Above that there's a squeeze out

3180
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:03,520
high. Above that there's a squeeze out
 

3181
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:07,109
high. Above that there's a squeeze out
until that it looks a little thick to do

3182
01:06:07,109 --> 01:06:07,119
until that it looks a little thick to do
 

3183
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:08,789
until that it looks a little thick to do
anything.

3184
01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:08,799
anything.
 

3185
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,950
anything.
They're based on VP Nick. Yeah, based on

3186
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:10,960
They're based on VP Nick. Yeah, based on
 

3187
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,910
They're based on VP Nick. Yeah, based on
VP. I do look at uh TPO occasionally on

3188
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:13,920
VP. I do look at uh TPO occasionally on
 

3189
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,349
VP. I do look at uh TPO occasionally on
a 30-inut chart, but to be honest, if

3190
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:17,359
a 30-inut chart, but to be honest, if
 

3191
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:19,190
a 30-inut chart, but to be honest, if
I'm looking for like single prints and

3192
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:19,200
I'm looking for like single prints and
 

3193
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:24,390
I'm looking for like single prints and
stuff, I can see it anyway.

3194
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:24,400

 

3195
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,270

back to the 300 then. So the 320 to 300

3196
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:27,280
back to the 300 then. So the 320 to 300
 

3197
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,109
back to the 300 then. So the 320 to 300
rotation continuing

3198
01:06:31,109 --> 01:06:31,119

 

3199
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:33,270

until we get a close outside of one of

3200
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:33,280

3247
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,630

While they make their mind up,
rejecting VWOP again. So spy is stuck

3266
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:12,240
rejecting VWOP again. So spy is stuck
 

3267
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,069
rejecting VWOP again. So spy is stuck
between 20-day and VWOP. It's basically

3268
01:08:14,069 --> 01:08:14,079
between 20-day and VWOP. It's basically
 

3269
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:15,589
between 20-day and VWOP. It's basically
at its mean reversion. That's what

3270
01:08:15,589 --> 01:08:15,599
at its mean reversion. That's what
 

3271
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:18,870
at its mean reversion. That's what
you've got on the spy. And the ENQ

3272
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:18,880
you've got on the spy. And the ENQ
 

3273
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,590
you've got on the spy. And the ENQ
or the Q's are well, they're below every

3274
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:21,600
or the Q's are well, they're below every
 

3275
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,630
or the Q's are well, they're below every
key moving average right now. But we're

3276
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:24,640
key moving average right now. But we're
 

3277
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,749
key moving average right now. But we're
not getting follow through to the

3278
01:08:25,749 --> 01:08:25,759
not getting follow through to the
 

3279
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:32,229
not getting follow through to the
downside that they keep looking for.

3280
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:32,239

 

3281
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:35,430

And this is terrible.

3282
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:35,440
And this is terrible.
 

3283
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,149
And this is terrible.
This is like yesterday. No follow

3284
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:38,159
This is like yesterday. No follow
 

3285
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:39,910
This is like yesterday. No follow
through. sellers should take control

3286
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:39,920
through. sellers should take control
 

3287
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,189
through. sellers should take control
here at this point. Like they've had

3288
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:41,199
here at this point. Like they've had
 

3289
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:43,510
here at this point. Like they've had
enough opportunities to take control.

3290
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:43,520
enough opportunities to take control.
 

3291
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,749
enough opportunities to take control.
Kind of weird that they're not in many

3292
01:08:45,749 --> 01:08:45,759
Kind of weird that they're not in many
 

3293
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:48,229
Kind of weird that they're not in many
ways. You know, you've got the

3294
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:48,239
ways. You know, you've got the
 

3295
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:49,990
ways. You know, you've got the
opportunity. Why not grab it with both

3296
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:50,000
opportunity. Why not grab it with both
 

3297
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,390
opportunity. Why not grab it with both
hands?

3298
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:54,400

 

3299
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,390

Back to test 300 again. That's where

3308
01:09:05,749 --> 01:09:05,759
Back to test 300 again. That's where
 

3309
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:07,430
Back to test 300 again. That's where
that delta was offside. volume point of

3310
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:07,440
that delta was offside. volume point of
 

3311
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,870
that delta was offside. volume point of

3313
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,189
control on the day now three or six.
We're starting to move away from volume

3314
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:11,199
We're starting to move away from volume
 

3315
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:13,110
We're starting to move away from volume
point of control but we're not seeing uh

3316
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:13,120
point of control but we're not seeing uh
 

3317
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,870

follow through down to value area low on
 

3319
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,390
follow through down to value area low on
the session now. Can they expand this

3320
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:16,400
the session now. Can they expand this
 

3321
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,349
the session now. Can they expand this
under 80? No is the answer so far.

3322
01:09:19,349 --> 01:09:19,359
under 80? No is the answer so far.
 

3323
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:20,870
under 80? No is the answer so far.
Sellers came in again got absorbed

3324
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:20,880
Sellers came in again got absorbed
 

3325
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,309
Sellers came in again got absorbed
again. So there's still a passive buyer

3326
01:09:22,309 --> 01:09:22,319
again. So there's still a passive buyer
 

3327
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,149
again. So there's still a passive buyer
here and there's still a passive seller

3328
01:09:24,149 --> 01:09:24,159
here and there's still a passive seller
 

3329
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:27,910
here and there's still a passive seller
above. Passive sellers were at uh 340s

3330
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:27,920
above. Passive sellers were at uh 340s
 

3331
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,749
above. Passive sellers were at uh 340s
then they moved to 320s now they've

3332
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:29,759
then they moved to 320s now they've
 

3333
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,590
then they moved to 320s now they've
moved to 300. They need to stay in

3334
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:31,600
moved to 300. They need to stay in
 

3335
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,149
moved to 300. They need to stay in
control of 300. If they stay in control

3336
01:09:34,149 --> 01:09:34,159
control of 300. If they stay in control
 

3337
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:36,229
control of 300. If they stay in control
of 300, there is a potential wash. Value

3338
01:09:36,229 --> 01:09:36,239
of 300, there is a potential wash. Value
 

3339
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:38,550
of 300, there is a potential wash. Value
area low soaking again at 280s. Oh my

3340
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:38,560
area low soaking again at 280s. Oh my
 

3341
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,110
area low soaking again at 280s. Oh my
god, we're into anyone who's been

3342
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:41,120
god, we're into anyone who's been
 

3343
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,630
god, we're into anyone who's been
joining me here for months. We're back

3344
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:42,640
joining me here for months. We're back
 

3345
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,550
joining me here for months. We're back
into those 20 point range rotations on

3346
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:44,560
into those 20 point range rotations on
 

3347
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,189
into those 20 point range rotations on
NQ. That's what we're back into. So

3348
01:09:47,189 --> 01:09:47,199
NQ. That's what we're back into. So
 

3349
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:48,870
NQ. That's what we're back into. So
really, sellers need to reject this

3350
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:48,880
really, sellers need to reject this
 

3351
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,149
really, sellers need to reject this
shelf. All right, they've worked really

3353
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:52,070
shelf. All right, they've worked really
hard to get back under this rotation.

3354
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:52,080
hard to get back under this rotation.
 

3355
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,669
hard to get back under this rotation.
Failed look, failed look, failed look.

3356
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:53,679
Failed look, failed look, failed look.
 

3357
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:54,950
Failed look, failed look, failed look.
They've worked hard to get under. They

3358
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:54,960
They've worked hard to get under. They
 

3359
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,270
They've worked hard to get under. They
need to sell this now back down to value

3360
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:57,280
need to sell this now back down to value
 

3361
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,270
need to sell this now back down to value
area low. If they fail to do that, they

3362
01:09:59,270 --> 01:09:59,280
area low. If they fail to do that, they
 

3363
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,950
area low. If they fail to do that, they
keep flying in here. they cannot get

3364
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:00,960
keep flying in here. they cannot get
 

3365
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,910
keep flying in here. they cannot get
this break, we'll probably do this move.

3366
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:03,920
this break, we'll probably do this move.
 

3367
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,070
this break, we'll probably do this move.
And this is like your avoid at all cost

3368
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:06,080
And this is like your avoid at all cost
 

3369
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,990
And this is like your avoid at all cost
kind of area. You do not want to trade

3370
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:08,000
kind of area. You do not want to trade
 

3371
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,910
kind of area. You do not want to trade
this gray box, right? You can see every

3372
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:09,920
this gray box, right? You can see every
 

3373
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,510
this gray box, right? You can see every
time we come in a gray box, it's kind of

3374
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:11,520
time we come in a gray box, it's kind of
 

3375
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,750
time we come in a gray box, it's kind of
gross.

3376
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:13,760
gross.
 

3377
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,229
gross.
So that seller was 300 like we talked

3378
01:10:16,229 --> 01:10:16,239
So that seller was 300 like we talked
 

3379
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:17,910
So that seller was 300 like we talked
about and we're coming to test him

3380
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:17,920
about and we're coming to test him
 

3381
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:29,270
about and we're coming to test him
again.

3382
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:29,280

 

3383
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:33,350

And again testing him.

3384
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:33,360

 

3385
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,510

It's all the way down at 240 right now.

3386
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:35,520
It's all the way down at 240 right now.
 

3387
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,910
It's all the way down at 240 right now.
I'm somewhat surprised.

3388
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:39,920

 

3389
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,550

Where are we at at spy? 78. There must

3390
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:42,560
Where are we at at spy? 78. There must
 

3391
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,750
Where are we at at spy? 78. There must
be a gamma level at 78.

3392
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:45,760
be a gamma level at 78.
 

3393
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,390
be a gamma level at 78.
Under that we go 75s. There must be. Can

3394
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:48,400
Under that we go 75s. There must be. Can
 

3395
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,149
Under that we go 75s. There must be. Can
anyone tell me is there a gamma level at

3396
01:10:50,149 --> 01:10:50,159
anyone tell me is there a gamma level at
 

3397
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:53,270
anyone tell me is there a gamma level at
78 today on spy?

3398
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:53,280
78 today on spy?
 

3399
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,149
78 today on spy?
Bet there is.

3400
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:56,159
Bet there is.
 

3401
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:59,990
Bet there is.
I bet there is mate.

3402
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:00,000
I bet there is mate.
 

3403
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:08,790
I bet there is mate.
Market's gone to sleep.

3404
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:08,800

 

3405
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,470

Come on, market. You should move lower

3406
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:10,480
Come on, market. You should move lower
 

3407
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,470
Come on, market. You should move lower
now. You've had so many opportunities.

3408
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:12,480
now. You've had so many opportunities.
 

3409
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,310
now. You've had so many opportunities.
These sellers are doing a terrible job

3410
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:14,320
These sellers are doing a terrible job
 

3411
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,709
These sellers are doing a terrible job

01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:36,184
the relief. Back to point of control on
the day now. This is so bad.

3424
01:11:36,184 --> 01:11:36,194
the day now. This is so bad.
 

3425
01:11:36,194 --> 01:11:40,870

Set still have an opportunity. All I'd

Set still have an opportunity. All I'd
say is I'd watch this rotation on the

Oh my god. Can we have a trade today?

3442

Oh my god. Can we have a trade today?
 

3443

Oh my god. Can we have a trade today?
Can we move away from this one way or

3444
01:12:04,709 --> 01:12:04,719
Can we move away from this one way or
 

3445

Can we move away from this one way or

Let's

Let's
 

3451
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:31,350
Let's
see where this is versus those

3452
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:31,360

 

3453
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,270

being a shell. Yeah, it's the next

3454
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:33,280
being a shell. Yeah, it's the next
 

3455
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:40,630
being a shell. Yeah, it's the next
level.

3456
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:40,640

 

3457
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:54,950

Just trying to find a beard back to it.

3458
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:54,960

 

3459
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,390

Still spy on VWAP. Still stuck. Look,

3460
01:12:58,390 --> 01:12:58,400
Still spy on VWAP. Still stuck. Look,
 

3461
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,470
Still spy on VWAP. Still stuck. Look,
just look at the spy stuck between VWAP,

3462
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:00,480
just look at the spy stuck between VWAP,
 

3463
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,470
just look at the spy stuck between VWAP,
PDC, and 20 days. Right at your mean

3464
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:02,480
PDC, and 20 days. Right at your mean
 

3465
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,390
PDC, and 20 days. Right at your mean
reversion.

3466
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:04,400
reversion.
 

3467
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,149
reversion.
We have no edge here at the moment.

3468
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:06,159
We have no edge here at the moment.
 

3469
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:08,229
We have no edge here at the moment.
Literally no edge on any time frame

3470
01:13:08,229 --> 01:13:08,239
Literally no edge on any time frame
 

3471
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:10,870
Literally no edge on any time frame
right now. back inside yesterday's

right now. back inside yesterday's
 

3473
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,229
right now. back inside yesterday's
value. Probably at the midpoint of

3474
01:13:12,229 --> 01:13:12,239
value. Probably at the midpoint of
 

3475
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:15,750
value. Probably at the midpoint of
yesterday's value, we've created

3476
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:15,760
yesterday's value, we've created
 

3477
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,149
yesterday's value, we've created
a point of control inside the midpoint

3478
01:13:18,149 --> 01:13:18,159
a point of control inside the midpoint
 

3479
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:21,030
a point of control inside the midpoint
of yesterday's value until we see until

3480
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:21,040
of yesterday's value until we see until
 

3481
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,030
of yesterday's value until we see until
we get a break outside of these levels.

3482
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:23,040
we get a break outside of these levels.
 

3483
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,950
we get a break outside of these levels.
Uh you're going to continue to see this

3484
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:24,960
Uh you're going to continue to see this
 

3485
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,870
Uh you're going to continue to see this
kind of nonsense. Right, back up to

3486
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:26,880
kind of nonsense. Right, back up to
 

3487
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,950
kind of nonsense. Right, back up to
where that buyer last got stuck. 357

3488
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:28,960
where that buyer last got stuck. 357
 

3489
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,790

lot. We're now above him at 17. We're

3490
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:30,800
lot. We're now above him at 17. We're
 

3491
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,350
lot. We're now above him at 17. We're
going 20s. Like I said, the rotation is

3492
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:33,360
going 20s. Like I said, the rotation is
 

3493
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,110
going 20s. Like I said, the rotation is
starting to take place on the mag. This

3494
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:35,120
starting to take place on the mag. This
 

3495
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,470
starting to take place on the mag. This
is the one thing you want to be careful

3496
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:36,480
is the one thing you want to be careful
 

3497
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:39,430
is the one thing you want to be careful
of. Can we get back above 40? So, I'm

3498
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:39,440
of. Can we get back above 40? So, I'm
 

3499
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,270
of. Can we get back above 40? So, I'm
interested. I'm definitely interested if

3500
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:41,280
interested. I'm definitely interested if
 

3501
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,590
interested. I'm definitely interested if
we hold dips into 18 now cuz that's

3502
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:43,600
we hold dips into 18 now cuz that's
 

3503
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,149
we hold dips into 18 now cuz that's
where buyers came in. If we hold dips

3504
01:13:46,149 --> 01:13:46,159
where buyers came in. If we hold dips
 

3505
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:48,470
where buyers came in. If we hold dips
into 18 and then we get back above 40s,

3506
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:48,480
into 18 and then we get back above 40s,
 

3507
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:56,790
into 18 and then we get back above 40s,
I'm really interested.

3508
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:56,800

 

3509
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,229

And his previous day point of control

3510
01:13:58,229 --> 01:13:58,239

rotation trader. I try and avoid these
like the plague. So, we have to wait. We

3662
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:09,040
like the plague. So, we have to wait. We
 

3663
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:13,110
like the plague. So, we have to wait. We
have to wait.

3664
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:13,120

 

3665
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,669

Do they complete the rotation all the

3666
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:15,679
Do they complete the rotation all the
 

3667
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:17,430
Do they complete the rotation all the
way back down to previous day value area

3668
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:17,440
way back down to previous day value area
 

3669
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,270
way back down to previous day value area
low? It's questionable. It's possible.

3670
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:19,280
low? It's questionable. It's possible.
 

3671
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,590
low? It's questionable. It's possible.
We can't rule anything out. Anything is

3672
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:21,600
We can't rule anything out. Anything is
 

3673
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,750
We can't rule anything out. Anything is
possible. But the moment, I'd say no one

3674
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:23,760
possible. But the moment, I'd say no one
 

3675
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,590
possible. But the moment, I'd say no one
is in control. Bears probably have the

3676
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:25,600
is in control. Bears probably have the
 

3677
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,830
is in control. Bears probably have the
edge, but no one is in control of this

3678
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:27,840
edge, but no one is in control of this
 

3679
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,390
edge, but no one is in control of this
market right now. Bears have the edge.

3680
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:30,400
market right now. Bears have the edge.
 

3681
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,990
market right now. Bears have the edge.
They should complete rotation. They've

3682
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:32,000
They should complete rotation. They've
 

3683
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,430
They should complete rotation. They've
had enough attempts to complete

3684
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:33,440
had enough attempts to complete
 

3685
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,870
had enough attempts to complete
rotation. They should really come down

3686
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:34,880
rotation. They should really come down
 

3687
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,350
rotation. They should really come down
to previous day value area low. But why

3688
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:37,360
to previous day value area low. But why
 

3689
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,310
to previous day value area low. But why
are they not aggressively leaving?

3690
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:40,320
are they not aggressively leaving?
 

3691
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:43,030
are they not aggressively leaving?
There is must be a passive buyer on this

3692
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:43,040
There is must be a passive buyer on this
 

3693
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,950
There is must be a passive buyer on this
tape on dips and there's passive selling

3694
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:46,960
tape on dips and there's passive selling
 

3695
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:47,990
tape on dips and there's passive selling
on the highs. So you got two

3696
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:48,000
on the highs. So you got two
 

3697
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,750
on the highs. So you got two
participants stuck is the way I'm seeing

3698
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:49,760
participants stuck is the way I'm seeing
 

3699
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,149
participants stuck is the way I'm seeing
this. You've got someone absorbing here.

3700
01:17:54,149 --> 01:17:54,159
this. You've got someone absorbing here.
 

3701
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:56,310
this. You've got someone absorbing here.
You got a buyer absorbing this and

3702
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:56,320
You got a buyer absorbing this and
 

3703
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,070
You got a buyer absorbing this and
you've got a seller absorbing this,

3704
01:17:58,070 --> 01:17:58,080
you've got a seller absorbing this,
 

3705
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,510
you've got a seller absorbing this,
which is why you're just getting this

3706
01:17:59,510 --> 01:17:59,520
which is why you're just getting this
 

3707
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,110
which is why you're just getting this
with no continuation. If this buyer

3708
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:01,120
with no continuation. If this buyer
 

3709
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,030
with no continuation. If this buyer
leaves, they should complete this. If

3710
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:03,040
leaves, they should complete this. If
 

3711
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,110
leaves, they should complete this. If
this seller leaves, they should complete

3712
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:05,120
this seller leaves, they should complete
 

3713
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,430
this seller leaves, they should complete
this. At the moment, there's nothing.

3714
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:07,440
this. At the moment, there's nothing.
 

3715
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:10,630
this. At the moment, there's nothing.
There's literally no trade to be had for

3716
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:10,640
There's literally no trade to be had for
 

3717
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:15,990
There's literally no trade to be had for
in my mind until we leave this value.

3718
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:16,000

 

3719
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,669

Exactly. Barcoding. Yeah. Well, that's

3720
01:18:17,669 --> 01:18:17,679
Exactly. Barcoding. Yeah. Well, that's
 

3721
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:19,430
Exactly. Barcoding. Yeah. Well, that's
it. This gray box, right? It's just a

3722
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:19,440
it. This gray box, right? It's just a
 

3723
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:24,070
it. This gray box, right? It's just a
barcode.

3724
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:24,080

 

3725
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,870

the fact that we're rejecting this.

3726
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:26,880
the fact that we're rejecting this.
 

3727
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,149
the fact that we're rejecting this.
We should should not necessarily will we

3728
01:18:30,149 --> 01:18:30,159
We should should not necessarily will we
 

3729
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:32,390
We should should not necessarily will we
should complete rotation to here, but it

3730
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:32,400
should complete rotation to here, but it
 

3731
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,510
should complete rotation to here, but it
hasn't. I

3732
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:35,520
hasn't. I
 

3733
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,390
hasn't. I
I don't know why. Why are they being so

3734
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:38,400
I don't know why. Why are they being so
 

3735
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,870
I don't know why. Why are they being so
weak? If you're going to take control,

3736
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:40,880
weak? If you're going to take control,
 

3737
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:49,910
weak? If you're going to take control,
take control.

3738
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:49,920

 

3739
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,310

Spy man can't get below its 20-day.

3740
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:52,320
Spy man can't get below its 20-day.
 

3741
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,910
Spy man can't get below its 20-day.
Can't get above PDC. It's so ugly. It's

3742
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:55,920
Can't get above PDC. It's so ugly. It's
 

3743
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:04,630
Can't get above PDC. It's so ugly. It's
so ugly in balance.

3744
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:04,640

 

3745
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,870

Yes. Uh Tom. Yeah. Current New York

3746
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:06,880
Yes. Uh Tom. Yeah. Current New York
 

3747
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:11,590
Yes. Uh Tom. Yeah. Current New York
profile on the right, my friend. Yes.

3748
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:11,600

 

3749
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:17,910

Back into gray box again.

3750
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:17,920

 

3751
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,550

Uh the big buy delta is at 18. So we're

3752
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:20,560
Uh the big buy delta is at 18. So we're
 

3753
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,669
Uh the big buy delta is at 18. So we're
probably going to come back and test

3754
01:19:21,669 --> 01:19:21,679
probably going to come back and test
 

3755
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:23,430
probably going to come back and test
that big buy delta. They should have

3756
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:23,440
that big buy delta. They should have
 

3757
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,110
that big buy delta. They should have
held that on the dip back down. They

3758
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:25,120
held that on the dip back down. They
 

3759
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,790
held that on the dip back down. They
didn't. Do they resell against it? This

3760
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:26,800
didn't. Do they resell against it? This
 

3761
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,310
didn't. Do they resell against it? This
is the 18s. They're getting back above

3762
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:28,320
is the 18s. They're getting back above
 

3763
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,910
is the 18s. They're getting back above
it again. So are we going to go all the

3764
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:29,920
it again. So are we going to go all the
 

3765
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,390
it again. So are we going to go all the
way topside? I have no idea, folks. I

3766
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:32,400
way topside? I have no idea, folks. I
 

3767
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,590
way topside? I have no idea, folks. I
don't know what they're doing with this

3768
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:33,600
don't know what they're doing with this
 

3769
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,189
don't know what they're doing with this
right now. SPY coming back to VW up

3770
01:19:35,189 --> 01:19:35,199
right now. SPY coming back to VW up
 

3771
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:37,910
right now. SPY coming back to VW up
again. So it held dips into its 20-day

3772
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:37,920
again. So it held dips into its 20-day
 

3773
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,590
again. So it held dips into its 20-day
again. It's coming back to VW up again.

3774
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:39,600
again. It's coming back to VW up again.
 

3775
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,510
again. It's coming back to VW up again.
Again, I will be interested if we can

3776
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:41,520
Again, I will be interested if we can
 

3777
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:45,669
Again, I will be interested if we can
start to get closes and bases above 40.

3778
01:19:45,669 --> 01:19:45,679
start to get closes and bases above 40.
 

3779
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,990
start to get closes and bases above 40.
I was interested in dips into 18s, but

3780
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:48,000
I was interested in dips into 18s, but
 

3781
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,229
I was interested in dips into 18s, but
we didn't hold. We just flushed straight

3782
01:19:50,229 --> 01:19:50,239
we didn't hold. We just flushed straight
 

3783
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:53,350
we didn't hold. We just flushed straight
through. So, this delta 18s is not doing

3784
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:53,360
through. So, this delta 18s is not doing
 

3785
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:57,430
through. So, this delta 18s is not doing
anything right now. We have a 269

3786
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:57,440
anything right now. We have a 269
 

3787
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:02,310
anything right now. We have a 269
or sorry, 334 lot at 18s and a 255 lot

3788
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:02,320
or sorry, 334 lot at 18s and a 255 lot
 

3789
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,149
or sorry, 334 lot at 18s and a 255 lot
at 20's buy side. So, if they protect

3790
01:20:04,149 --> 01:20:04,159
at 20's buy side. So, if they protect
 

3791
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:05,990
at 20's buy side. So, if they protect
that, they're in the money, but they

3792
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:06,000
that, they're in the money, but they
 

3793
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,510
that, they're in the money, but they
should have already protected it. We're

3794
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:07,520
should have already protected it. We're
 

3795
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,669
should have already protected it. We're
going to go back to 40. So, rotation

3796
01:20:09,669 --> 01:20:09,679
going to go back to 40. So, rotation
 

3797
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,510
going to go back to 40. So, rotation
still happening. So, top of this range.

3798
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:11,520
still happening. So, top of this range.
 

3799
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,110
still happening. So, top of this range.
I'm interested over this. I am

3800
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:13,120
I'm interested over this. I am
 

3801
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,870
I'm interested over this. I am
interested over this. If we base over

3802
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:14,880
interested over this. If we base over
 

3803
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,390
interested over this. If we base over
this for a squeeze back out upside

3804
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:18,400
this for a squeeze back out upside
 

3805
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,590
this for a squeeze back out upside
at the moment, this feels like

3806
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:19,600
at the moment, this feels like
 

3807
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,510
at the moment, this feels like
yesterday. Well, yeah, it's just like

3808
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:21,520
yesterday. Well, yeah, it's just like
 

3809
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,350
yesterday. Well, yeah, it's just like
yesterday. Yesterday, just selling the

3810
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:23,360
yesterday. Yesterday, just selling the
 

3811
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,550
yesterday. Yesterday, just selling the
highs, buying the lows, selling the

3812
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:24,560
highs, buying the lows, selling the
 

3813
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,550
highs, buying the lows, selling the

01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:26,560
highs. So, all they're going to do is
 

3815
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,229

Such a shame. But we had a great

3872
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:39,840
Such a shame. But we had a great
 

3873
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,950
Such a shame. But we had a great
afternoon yesterday. Okay, we had a

3874
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:40,960
afternoon yesterday. Okay, we had a
 

3875
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,550
afternoon yesterday. Okay, we had a
really great day Monday. We had a really

3876
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:42,560
really great day Monday. We had a really
 

3877
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:53,430
really great day Monday. We had a really
great day Friday.

3878
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:53,440

 

3879
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:57,189

Well, it's like 98% chance that Japan

3880
01:21:57,189 --> 01:21:57,199
Well, it's like 98% chance that Japan
 

3881
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:59,590
Well, it's like 98% chance that Japan
are going to raise their rates.

3882
01:21:59,590 --> 01:21:59,600
are going to raise their rates.
 

3883
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,189
are going to raise their rates.
So, if that happens,

3884
01:22:03,189 --> 01:22:03,199
So, if that happens,
 

3885
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:06,149
So, if that happens,
it is very well, it's not very likely.

3886
01:22:06,149 --> 01:22:06,159
it is very well, it's not very likely.
 

3887
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:08,390
it is very well, it's not very likely.
Historically, let's let's put this in

3888
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:08,400
Historically, let's let's put this in
 

3889
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,790
Historically, let's let's put this in
perspective. Historically, it's likely

3890
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:10,800
perspective. Historically, it's likely
 

3891
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,870
perspective. Historically, it's likely
that they will start to sell their

3892
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:12,880
that they will start to sell their
 

3893
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:15,270
that they will start to sell their
positions in the US market, especially

3894
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:15,280
positions in the US market, especially
 

3895
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,470
positions in the US market, especially
their growth positions, i.e. stock. If

3896
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:18,480
their growth positions, i.e. stock. If
 

3897
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,709
their growth positions, i.e. stock. If
they do that, all right, then you might

3898
01:22:20,709 --> 01:22:20,719
they do that, all right, then you might
 

3899
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:22,790
they do that, all right, then you might
get a cascade because if they start

3900
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:22,800
get a cascade because if they start
 

3901
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,149
get a cascade because if they start
aggressively selling, you're going to

3902
01:22:24,149 --> 01:22:24,159
aggressively selling, you're going to
 

3903
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:25,510
aggressively selling, you're going to
have a liquidity issue where everyone

3904
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:25,520
have a liquidity issue where everyone
 

3905
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,590
have a liquidity issue where everyone
else starts selling. The only thing that

3906
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:27,600
else starts selling. The only thing that
 

3907
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,310
else starts selling. The only thing that
I would say that I have in my mind is if

3908
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:30,320
I would say that I have in my mind is if
 

3909
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,070
I would say that I have in my mind is if
everyone's looking for that trade, it

3910
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:32,080
everyone's looking for that trade, it
 

3911
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,669
everyone's looking for that trade, it
won't happen. because people are more

3912
01:22:33,669 --> 01:22:33,679
won't happen. because people are more
 

3913
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:35,430
won't happen. because people are more
prepared for it after what was it August

3914
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:35,440
prepared for it after what was it August
 

3915
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,910
prepared for it after what was it August
two years ago it happening people are

3916
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:37,920
two years ago it happening people are
 

3917
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,070
two years ago it happening people are
more aware of it now so I don't know how

3918
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:40,080
more aware of it now so I don't know how
 

3919
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,750
more aware of it now so I don't know how

01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,990
actually buy side at the moment which is
uh not too good which means it probably

3940
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:02,000

3967
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,750
been moving out of the dollar. Here we
go. So, maybe now we have an imbalance

3968
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:57,760
go. So, maybe now we have an imbalance
 

3969
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,990
go. So, maybe now we have an imbalance
down here into 60s again. and sellers no

3970
01:23:59,990 --> 01:24:00,000
down here into 60s again. and sellers no
 

3971
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,229
down here into 60s again. and sellers no
follow through. Still a passive buyer on

3972
01:24:02,229 --> 01:24:02,239
follow through. Still a passive buyer on
 

3973
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:03,750
follow through. Still a passive buyer on
the tape down here. Sellers no follow

3974
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:03,760
the tape down here. Sellers no follow
 

3975
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:07,990
the tape down here. Sellers no follow
through.

3976
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:08,000

 

3977
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,189

They need to see follow through. You

3978
01:24:09,189 --> 01:24:09,199
They need to see follow through. You
 

3979
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:12,629
They need to see follow through. You
really if if we're going to leave value,

3980
01:24:12,629 --> 01:24:12,639
really if if we're going to leave value,
 

3981
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:13,830
really if if we're going to leave value,
right? If we're going to leave this

3982
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:13,840
right? If we're going to leave this
 

3983
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,310
right? If we're going to leave this
value, current day's value, I know it's

3984
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:16,320
value, current day's value, I know it's
 

3985
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,709
value, current day's value, I know it's
developing and point of control, they

3986
01:24:18,709 --> 01:24:18,719
developing and point of control, they
 

3987
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,430
developing and point of control, they
need to come and tag this. This is to

3988
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:21,440
need to come and tag this. This is to
 

3989
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,189
need to come and tag this. This is to
complete the rotation. Why are they not

3990
01:24:23,189 --> 01:24:23,199
complete the rotation. Why are they not
 

3991
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:26,390
complete the rotation. Why are they not
doing that?

3992
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:26,400
doing that?
 

3993
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:36,550
doing that?
Must be pacifying.

3994
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:36,560

 

3995
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,470

buying trying to step up here is 17 and

3996
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:38,480
buying trying to step up here is 17 and
 

3997
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,070
buying trying to step up here is 17 and
75. They should just flush him and go

3998
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:40,080
75. They should just flush him and go
 

3999
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,830
75. They should just flush him and go
down to 40 now. I wouldn't be surprised

4000
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:41,840
down to 40 now. I wouldn't be surprised
 

4001
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,790
down to 40 now. I wouldn't be surprised
if he pulls his bid.

4002
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:44,800
if he pulls his bid.
 

4003
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:49,910
if he pulls his bid.
110 lot here.

4004
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:49,920

 

4005
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,470

He's leaning on that old uh 285 delta

4006
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:54,480
He's leaning on that old uh 285 delta
 

4007
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,990
He's leaning on that old uh 285 delta
sellside that was there. We're probably

4008
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:56,000
sellside that was there. We're probably
 

4009
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,189
sellside that was there. We're probably
going to flush in there. Yep. Here we

4010
01:24:59,189 --> 01:24:59,199
going to flush in there. Yep. Here we
 

4011
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:00,709
going to flush in there. Yep. Here we
go. All right. So, we're moving lower

4012
01:25:00,709 --> 01:25:00,719
go. All right. So, we're moving lower
 

4013
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:11,910

now. Here comes the 40s.

4014
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:11,920

 

4015
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,830

They can't reclaim 70s. You've just

4016
01:25:13,830 --> 01:25:13,840
They can't reclaim 70s. You've just
 

4017
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,669
They can't reclaim 70s. You've just
worked so hard to get under 70s. Come

4018
01:25:15,669 --> 01:25:15,679
worked so hard to get under 70s. Come
 

4019

Now on Ninja Trader, I have previous day

4024
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:22,560
Now on Ninja Trader, I have previous day
 

4025
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,070
Now on Ninja Trader, I have previous day
point of control down here. Just so

4026
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:24,080
point of control down here. Just so
 

4027
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,950
point of control down here. Just so
you're aware, folks.

4028
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:26,960
you're aware, folks.
 

4029
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,790
you're aware, folks.
Here we come. Okay, finally seeing that

4030
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:28,800
Here we come. Okay, finally seeing that
 

4031
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:32,950
Here we come. Okay, finally seeing that
aggressive move. Can spy leave 78.

4032
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:32,960
aggressive move. Can spy leave 78.
 

4033
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:39,030
aggressive move. Can spy leave 78.
Here we come.

4034
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:39,040

 

4035
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,270

Can we get down into previous days value

4036
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:41,280
Can we get down into previous days value
 

4037
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,550
Can we get down into previous days value
area low? Now, that's really the

4038
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:42,560
area low? Now, that's really the
 

4039
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,990
area low? Now, that's really the
question to complete the rotation. They

4040
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:44,000
question to complete the rotation. They
 

4041
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,270
question to complete the rotation. They
took so long, but they've built out

4042
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:45,280
took so long, but they've built out
 

4043
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,430
took so long, but they've built out
enough liquidity. Now, if you did take

4044
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:47,440
enough liquidity. Now, if you did take
 

4045
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,910
enough liquidity. Now, if you did take
this, uh, your cover points are where

4046
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:49,920
this, uh, your cover points are where
 

4047
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,550
this, uh, your cover points are where
you are right now. Previous day value

4048
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:52,560
you are right now. Previous day value
 

4049
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,629
you are right now. Previous day value
area low. This is your old naked point

4050
01:25:54,629 --> 01:25:54,639
area low. This is your old naked point
 

4051
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:56,149
area low. This is your old naked point
of control. Previous day low is all the

4052
01:25:56,149 --> 01:25:56,159
of control. Previous day low is all the
 

4053
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:57,430
of control. Previous day low is all the
way down here. I don't know if you get

4054
01:25:57,430 --> 01:25:57,440
way down here. I don't know if you get
 

4055
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,350
way down here. I don't know if you get
that if I'm honest. I would imagine they

4056
01:25:59,350 --> 01:25:59,360
that if I'm honest. I would imagine they
 

4057
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,030
that if I'm honest. I would imagine they
will try and defend this area here. So,

4058
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:01,040
will try and defend this area here. So,
 

4059
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,510
will try and defend this area here. So,
just I would be very, very careful.

4060
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:03,520
just I would be very, very careful.
 

4061
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,270
just I would be very, very careful.
You're into we're still within

4062
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:05,280
You're into we're still within
 

4063
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,030
You're into we're still within
yesterday's value. Okay. So, this is

4064
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:07,040
yesterday's value. Okay. So, this is
 

4065
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,629
yesterday's value. Okay. So, this is
your cover point. If you can get this,

4066
01:26:08,629 --> 01:26:08,639
your cover point. If you can get this,
 

4067
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:10,229
your cover point. If you can get this,
this is your initial balance low. If you

4068
01:26:10,229 --> 01:26:10,239
this is your initial balance low. If you

right earlier, like it's it's losing key
 

4083
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:27,270
right earlier, like it's it's losing key
levels. I did talk about the price

4084
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:27,280
levels. I did talk about the price
 

4085
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,590
levels. I did talk about the price
alerts I had going off on it. Here's

4086
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:29,600
alerts I had going off on it. Here's
 

4087
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,510
alerts I had going off on it. Here's
previous day value area low. Make sure

then your runners beyond this. Big
 

4095
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:40,149
then your runners beyond this. Big
sellers coming in here at the lows of

4096
01:26:40,149 --> 01:26:40,159
sellers coming in here at the lows of
 

4097
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:41,669
sellers coming in here at the lows of
this. They might get themselves caught

4098
01:26:41,669 --> 01:26:41,679
this. They might get themselves caught
 

4099
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:43,750

4101
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,750

into this old point control. It's 180s

4102
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:45,760
into this old point control. It's 180s
 

4103
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:51,910
into this old point control. It's 180s
as your target.

4104
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:51,920

 

4105
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,430

[\h__\h] hell. They took all day to do

4106
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:53,440
[\h__\h] hell. They took all day to do
 

4107
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:58,229
[\h__\h] hell. They took all day to do
that. They took all day to do that.

4108
01:26:58,229 --> 01:26:58,239
that. They took all day to do that.
 

4109
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:00,070
that. They took all day to do that.
Okay, into this green box. This is your

4110
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:00,080
Okay, into this green box. This is your
 

4111
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,470
Okay, into this green box. This is your
next target. 180. If we flush 180, then

4112
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:02,480
next target. 180. If we flush 180, then
 

4113
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:03,910
next target. 180. If we flush 180, then
you got previous day low. But I would

4114
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:03,920
you got previous day low. But I would
 

4115
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,070
you got previous day low. But I would
imagine, they don't have to, but I'd

4116
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:06,080
imagine, they don't have to, but I'd
 

4117
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,709
imagine, they don't have to, but I'd
imagine bulls will try and defend here.

4118

This is a big cover point. All right,

4214
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:03,120
This is a big cover point. All right,
 

4215
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,350
This is a big cover point. All right,
around here,

4216
01:29:05,350 --> 01:29:05,360
around here,
 

4217
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,030
around here,
around here, around where we are now.

4218
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:07,040
around here, around where we are now.
 

4219
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,510
around here, around where we are now.
It's a huge cover point. If you see

4220
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:09,520
It's a huge cover point. If you see
 

4221
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:10,870
It's a huge cover point. If you see
continuation, you can think about

4222
01:29:10,870 --> 01:29:10,880
continuation, you can think about
 

4223
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,510
continuation, you can think about
previous day low. But, uh, like I said,

4224
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:13,520
previous day low. But, uh, like I said,
 

4225
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,149
previous day low. But, uh, like I said,
I would have maybe 20% left now if I was

4226
01:29:16,149 --> 01:29:16,159
I would have maybe 20% left now if I was
 

4227
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:17,910
I would have maybe 20% left now if I was
you. If you took this break or leaving

4228
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:17,920
you. If you took this break or leaving
 

4229
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:20,070
you. If you took this break or leaving
this liquidity, I'd be having some more

4230
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:20,080
this liquidity, I'd be having some more
 

4231
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,910
this liquidity, I'd be having some more
off here and then waiting to see if they

4232
01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:21,920
off here and then waiting to see if they
 

4233
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,470
off here and then waiting to see if they
want to come down in here. We are now.

4234
01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:24,480
want to come down in here. We are now.
 

4235
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,229
want to come down in here. We are now.
There are two two trades set up now.

4236
01:29:26,229 --> 01:29:26,239
There are two two trades set up now.
 

4237
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:28,550
There are two two trades set up now.
This very hard right right now. If we

4238
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:28,560
This very hard right right now. If we
 

4239
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,790
This very hard right right now. If we
reject value, we can trade lower. The

4240
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:30,800
reject value, we can trade lower. The
 

4241
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,390
reject value, we can trade lower. The
hardest thing is knowing how thick a

4242
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:32,400
hardest thing is knowing how thick a
 

4243
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,350
hardest thing is knowing how thick a
level this is. I'm going to make this uh

4244
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:35,360
level this is. I'm going to make this uh
 

4245
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:39,750
level this is. I'm going to make this uh
obvious to you guys.

4246

This is possible. This is where we're

This is possible. This is where we're
 

4249

01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:11,520
Really nice.
 

4273
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,110
Really nice.
All right, white line is the old point

4274
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:13,120
All right, white line is the old point
 

4275
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,510
All right, white line is the old point
of control. Doesn't mean we can't keep

4276
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:15,520
of control. Doesn't mean we can't keep
 

4277
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,270
of control. Doesn't mean we can't keep
selling. Uh spy might really want to

4278
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:17,280
selling. Uh spy might really want to
 

4279
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,350
selling. Uh spy might really want to
come to 675 now, which is probably the

4280
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:19,360
come to 675 now, which is probably the
 

4281
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,669
come to 675 now, which is probably the
next gamma level. It doesn't mean we

4282
01:30:21,669 --> 01:30:21,679
next gamma level. It doesn't mean we
 

4283
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:22,790
next gamma level. It doesn't mean we
can't keep selling, but you don't want

4284
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:22,800
can't keep selling, but you don't want
 

4285
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,470
can't keep selling, but you don't want
to be short down here at low of day. You

4286
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:24,480
to be short down here at low of day. You
 

4287
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,310
to be short down here at low of day. You
need to see a back test really of at

4288
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:26,320
need to see a back test really of at
 

4289
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,790
need to see a back test really of at
least previous days value area low and

4290
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:28,800
least previous days value area low and
 

4291
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,390
least previous days value area low and
maybe really even the shelf that we've

4292
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:30,400
maybe really even the shelf that we've
 

4293
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:33,270
maybe really even the shelf that we've
created. So I could argue right now, you

4294
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:33,280
created. So I could argue right now, you
 

4295
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:36,070
created. So I could argue right now, you
know, sellers.

4296
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:36,080
know, sellers.
 

4297
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:37,430
know, sellers.
It's hard for me, aren't you? You're

4298
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:37,440
It's hard for me, aren't you? You're
 

4299
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,950
It's hard for me, aren't you? You're
going to let me draw it. Sellers really

4300
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:38,960
going to let me draw it. Sellers really
 

4301
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,790
going to let me draw it. Sellers really
need to defend this. I'd even argue down

4302
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:40,800
need to defend this. I'd even argue down
 

4303
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,270
need to defend this. I'd even argue down
to here, right? Sellers are in control

4304
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:43,280
to here, right? Sellers are in control
 

4305
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,590
to here, right? Sellers are in control
if they defend this. Really, if they're

4306
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:45,600
if they defend this. Really, if they're
 

4307
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,870
if they defend this. Really, if they're
looking for expansion, they'd want to

4308
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:46,880
looking for expansion, they'd want to
 

4309
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,270
looking for expansion, they'd want to
defend this. If you see this, all right,

4310
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:49,280
defend this. If you see this, all right,
 

4311
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:51,350
defend this. If you see this, all right,
this trade here will happen. And if they

4312
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:51,360
this trade here will happen. And if they
 

4313
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,910
this trade here will happen. And if they
get through it up to here, right? If we

4314
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:53,920
get through it up to here, right? If we
 

4315
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,510
get through it up to here, right? If we
look below previous day value and

4316
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:55,520
look below previous day value and
 

4317
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,430
look below previous day value and
reclaim current day value, this trade in

4318
01:30:57,430 --> 01:30:57,440
reclaim current day value, this trade in
 

4319
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,510
reclaim current day value, this trade in
here and here. So if you're desperate to

4320
01:30:59,510 --> 01:30:59,520
here and here. So if you're desperate to
 

4321
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,350
here and here. So if you're desperate to
take the long, that's your look below

4322
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:01,360
take the long, that's your look below
 

4323
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,350
take the long, that's your look below
and fail level, right? So sellers will

4324
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:03,360
and fail level, right? So sellers will
 

4325
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,030
and fail level, right? So sellers will
need to lean on previous day value area

4326
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:05,040
need to lean on previous day value area
 

4327
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,110
need to lean on previous day value area
low. Buyers will want this to be a trap

4328
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:07,120
low. Buyers will want this to be a trap
 

4329
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:13,430
low. Buyers will want this to be a trap
underneath it.

4330
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:13,440

 

4331
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:16,629

Try and see what do we have on the tape

4332
01:31:16,629 --> 01:31:16,639
Try and see what do we have on the tape
 

4333
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:19,350
Try and see what do we have on the tape
down here at the lows. We do have some

4334
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:19,360
down here at the lows. We do have some
 

4335
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,030
down here at the lows. We do have some
sellers

4336
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:21,040
sellers
 

4337
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:24,368
sellers
caught down here under 92s right now.

4338
01:31:24,368 --> 01:31:24,378
caught down here under 92s right now.
 

4339
01:31:24,378 --> 01:31:35,510
caught down here under 92s right now.
[snorts]

4340
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:35,520

 

4341
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,990

Is it worth trading the week of

4342
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:38,000
Is it worth trading the week of
 

4343
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,398
Is it worth trading the week of
Christmas or New Year's? Uh,

4344
01:31:41,398 --> 01:31:41,408
Christmas or New Year's? Uh,
 

4345
01:31:41,408 --> 01:31:43,270
Christmas or New Year's? Uh,
[sighs and snorts]

4346
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:43,280
[sighs and snorts]
 

4347
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,430
[sighs and snorts]
it really varies year to year, mate. I

4348
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:45,440
it really varies year to year, mate. I
 

4349
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,189
it really varies year to year, mate. I
would say, you know, let's deal with

4350
01:31:47,189 --> 01:31:47,199
would say, you know, let's deal with
 

4351
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:49,750
would say, you know, let's deal with
that as we get into it. Um, it the

4352
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:49,760
that as we get into it. Um, it the
 

4353
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:51,030
that as we get into it. Um, it the
reason I'm saying that I don't know

4354
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:51,040
reason I'm saying that I don't know
 

4355
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,310
reason I'm saying that I don't know
where we're going to close this week.

4356
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:52,320
where we're going to close this week.
 

4357
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:54,070
where we're going to close this week.
Right now, we've hit my main target for

4358
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:54,080
Right now, we've hit my main target for
 

4359
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:56,149
Right now, we've hit my main target for
the week is is right where we're at now,

4360
01:31:56,149 --> 01:31:56,159
the week is is right where we're at now,
 

4361
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:57,910
the week is is right where we're at now,
right? This white dotted line that this

4362
01:31:57,910 --> 01:31:57,920
right? This white dotted line that this
 

4363
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,910
right? This white dotted line that this
was the main target for the week. We

4364
01:31:59,910 --> 01:31:59,920
was the main target for the week. We
 

4365
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:02,550
was the main target for the week. We
need to see how we close this week. Um,

4366
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:02,560
need to see how we close this week. Um,
 

4367
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,229
need to see how we close this week. Um,
and and we can only really think about

4368
01:32:04,229 --> 01:32:04,239
and and we can only really think about
 

4369
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:06,070
and and we can only really think about
what's coming ahead once we see where we

4370
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:06,080
what's coming ahead once we see where we
 

4371
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,990
what's coming ahead once we see where we
close the week, what liquidity we have

4372
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:08,000
close the week, what liquidity we have
 

4373
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,790
close the week, what liquidity we have
left to search for, and how we act. I

4374
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:10,800
left to search for, and how we act. I
 

4375
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,709
left to search for, and how we act. I
would be it would be irresponsible of me

4376
01:32:12,709 --> 01:32:12,719
would be it would be irresponsible of me
 

4377
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:15,510
would be it would be irresponsible of me
to say yes or no. Is volume likely to be

4378
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:15,520
to say yes or no. Is volume likely to be
 

4379
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,669
to say yes or no. Is volume likely to be
lighter? Absolutely. It's likely to be

4380
01:32:17,669 --> 01:32:17,679
lighter? Absolutely. It's likely to be
 

4381
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:19,430
lighter? Absolutely. It's likely to be
lighter. Does that mean there isn't a

4382
01:32:19,430 --> 01:32:19,440
lighter. Does that mean there isn't a
 

4383
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,030
lighter. Does that mean there isn't a
good trade setup? It does not mean there

4384
01:32:21,030 --> 01:32:21,040
good trade setup? It does not mean there
 

4385
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,390
good trade setup? It does not mean there
isn't a good trade setup. There might

4386
01:32:22,390 --> 01:32:22,400
isn't a good trade setup. There might
 

4387
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,910
isn't a good trade setup. There might
well be some really good trade setups

4388
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:23,920
well be some really good trade setups
 

4389
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,229
well be some really good trade setups
for you, but I don't want to say it yet.

4390
01:32:26,229 --> 01:32:26,239
for you, but I don't want to say it yet.
 

4391
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:28,390
for you, but I don't want to say it yet.
It's a little bit early. We have plenty

4392
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:28,400
It's a little bit early. We have plenty
 

4393
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:29,990
It's a little bit early. We have plenty
of time yet to develop what's coming

4394
01:32:29,990 --> 01:32:30,000
of time yet to develop what's coming
 

4395
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,830
of time yet to develop what's coming
next. All right. Someone just tried to

4396
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:31,840
next. All right. Someone just tried to
 

4397
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,830
next. All right. Someone just tried to
sell 170 and got themselves caught. So,

4398
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:33,840
sell 170 and got themselves caught. So,
 

4399
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,830
sell 170 and got themselves caught. So,
you have some sellers down here starting

4400
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:35,840
you have some sellers down here starting
 

4401
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:38,070
you have some sellers down here starting
to try and aggressively sell outside of

4402
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:38,080
to try and aggressively sell outside of
 

4403
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,910
to try and aggressively sell outside of
170. They're retesting them now. Do they

4404
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:39,920
170. They're retesting them now. Do they
 

4405
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:42,870
170. They're retesting them now. Do they
get follow through is the question.

4406
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:42,880
get follow through is the question.
 

4407
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,709
get follow through is the question.
We have a buyer at 160. So maybe we're

4408
01:32:44,709 --> 01:32:44,719
We have a buyer at 160. So maybe we're
 

4409
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:47,189
We have a buyer at 160. So maybe we're
going to come to him. Here we go.

4410
01:32:47,189 --> 01:32:47,199
going to come to him. Here we go.
 

4411
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:49,510
going to come to him. Here we go.
So here's the trade to 160. Now question

4412
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:49,520
So here's the trade to 160. Now question
 

4413
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,990
So here's the trade to 160. Now question
now is do we see expansion into previous

4414
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:52,000
now is do we see expansion into previous
 

4415
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,310
now is do we see expansion into previous
days low?

4416
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:54,320
days low?
 

4417
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,149
days low?
Do we see expansion into previous days

4418
01:32:56,149 --> 01:32:56,159
Do we see expansion into previous days
 

4419
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:59,350
Do we see expansion into previous days
low? Very possible. ES uh sorry spy got

4420
01:32:59,350 --> 01:32:59,360
low? Very possible. ES uh sorry spy got
 

4421
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:02,149
low? Very possible. ES uh sorry spy got
another one and a half bucks to get into

4422
01:33:02,149 --> 01:33:02,159
another one and a half bucks to get into
 

4423
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:04,550
another one and a half bucks to get into
75. We are seeing some excess left down

4424
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:04,560
75. We are seeing some excess left down
 

4425
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,390
75. We are seeing some excess left down
here, but sellers are very aggressive. I

4426
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:06,400
here, but sellers are very aggressive. I
 

4427
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,910
here, but sellers are very aggressive. I
would not bid on this market right now,

4428
01:33:07,910 --> 01:33:07,920
would not bid on this market right now,
 

4429
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,990
would not bid on this market right now,
guys. We've left yesterday's value.

4430
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:10,000
guys. We've left yesterday's value.
 

4431
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,830
guys. We've left yesterday's value.
Until we return back inside yesterday's

4432
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:11,840
Until we return back inside yesterday's
 

4433
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,590
Until we return back inside yesterday's
value, there is no buying opportunity in

4434
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:13,600
value, there is no buying opportunity in
 

4435
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,669
value, there is no buying opportunity in
my mind. This is probably covering

4436
01:33:15,669 --> 01:33:15,679
my mind. This is probably covering
 

4437
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:17,590
my mind. This is probably covering
opportunity, but no buying opportunity.

4438
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:17,600
opportunity, but no buying opportunity.
 

4439
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,990
opportunity, but no buying opportunity.
The buying opportunity will come right

4440
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:20,000
The buying opportunity will come right
 

4441
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,030
The buying opportunity will come right
if we do something like that. Right back

4442
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:23,040
if we do something like that. Right back
 

4443
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:26,310
if we do something like that. Right back
inside yesterday's value. This becomes

4444
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:26,320
inside yesterday's value. This becomes
 

4445
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:27,910
inside yesterday's value. This becomes
trap sellers, but right now we're

4446
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:27,920
trap sellers, but right now we're
 

4447
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,110
trap sellers, but right now we're
probably going to come into this level

4448
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:29,120
probably going to come into this level
 

4449
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:32,390
probably going to come into this level
at the moment.

4450
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:32,400
at the moment.
 

4451
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:38,629
at the moment.
Previous day low is at 25,72.

4452
01:33:38,629 --> 01:33:38,639

 

4453
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:41,189

every pot being sold into. Still some

4454
01:33:41,189 --> 01:33:41,199
every pot being sold into. Still some
 

4455
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:43,910
every pot being sold into. Still some
more uh limit covers here. Passive

4456
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:43,920
more uh limit covers here. Passive
 

4457
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:47,189
more uh limit covers here. Passive
players. 160 155 150. We probably fill

4458
01:33:47,189 --> 01:33:47,199
players. 160 155 150. We probably fill
 

4459
01:33:47,199 --> 01:34:04,229
players. 160 155 150. We probably fill
all of these guys on a little flush

4460
01:34:04,229 --> 01:34:04,239

 

4461
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:05,910

155.

4462
01:34:05,910 --> 01:34:05,920
155.
 

4463
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,430
155.
So here we go. that they're bidding

4464
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:07,440
So here we go. that they're bidding
 

4465
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,390
So here we go. that they're bidding
lower and lower. So, they're trying to

4466
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:08,400
lower and lower. So, they're trying to
 

4467
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,590
lower and lower. So, they're trying to
drag this market down. They're probably

4468
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:09,600
drag this market down. They're probably
 

4469
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,110
drag this market down. They're probably
going to come down into this.

4470
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:13,120
going to come down into this.
 

4471
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,189
going to come down into this.
This was probably it. It's kind of

4472
01:34:15,189 --> 01:34:15,199
This was probably it. It's kind of
 

4473
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:18,149
This was probably it. It's kind of
nasty. It wasn't much of a push, but

4474
01:34:18,149 --> 01:34:18,159
nasty. It wasn't much of a push, but
 

4475
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:20,310
nasty. It wasn't much of a push, but
that was probably the retest to sell.

4476
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:20,320
that was probably the retest to sell.
 

4477
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,149
that was probably the retest to sell.
This wick here, I missed it. It wasn't

4478
01:34:22,149 --> 01:34:22,159
This wick here, I missed it. It wasn't
 

4479
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:25,830
This wick here, I missed it. It wasn't
enough for me, but uh there we go. Not

4480
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:25,840
enough for me, but uh there we go. Not
 

4481
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,669
enough for me, but uh there we go. Not
going to get everything. So, this is

4482
01:34:27,669 --> 01:34:27,679
going to get everything. So, this is
 

4483
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:30,070
going to get everything. So, this is
your next target. 2573. If they're going

4484
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:30,080
your next target. 2573. If they're going
 

4485
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,550
your next target. 2573. If they're going
to go mega mega heavy, you're we are

4486
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:32,560
to go mega mega heavy, you're we are
 

4487
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,430
to go mega mega heavy, you're we are
talking about 24,800 today. If they're

4488
01:34:35,430 --> 01:34:35,440
talking about 24,800 today. If they're
 

4489
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,030
talking about 24,800 today. If they're
going to go mega puke day, you're

4490
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:37,040
going to go mega puke day, you're
 

4491
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:39,030
going to go mega puke day, you're
talking about 24,800

4492
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:39,040
talking about 24,800
 

4493
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,270
talking about 24,800
to make you aware of what is potentially

4494
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:41,280
to make you aware of what is potentially
 

4495
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:44,310
to make you aware of what is potentially
available today.

4496
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:44,320
available today.
 

4497
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,070
available today.
At the moment, I'd say previous day low

4498
01:34:46,070 --> 01:34:46,080
At the moment, I'd say previous day low
 

4499
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,910
At the moment, I'd say previous day low
is probably the target that they're

4500
01:34:47,910 --> 01:34:47,920
is probably the target that they're
 

4501
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,310
is probably the target that they're
looking at.

4502
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:50,320
looking at.
 

4503
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:51,990
looking at.
They keep bidding and moving their bids

4504
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:52,000
They keep bidding and moving their bids
 

4505
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,669
They keep bidding and moving their bids
down, which is going to help this market

4506
01:34:53,669 --> 01:34:53,679
down, which is going to help this market
 

4507
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:55,350
down, which is going to help this market
sort of look for expansion lower right

4508
01:34:55,350 --> 01:34:55,360
sort of look for expansion lower right
 

4509
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:56,709
sort of look for expansion lower right
now because it's going to just search.

4510
01:34:56,709 --> 01:34:56,719
now because it's going to just search.
 

4511
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:58,470
now because it's going to just search.
It's searching for value and it can't

4512
01:34:58,470 --> 01:34:58,480
It's searching for value and it can't
 

4513
01:34:58,480 --> 01:34:59,750
It's searching for value and it can't
find it. So, it's going to keep going

4514
01:34:59,750 --> 01:34:59,760
find it. So, it's going to keep going
 

4515
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,510
find it. So, it's going to keep going
down all the time. It's searching for

4516
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:01,520
down all the time. It's searching for
 

4517
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:02,870
down all the time. It's searching for
value and it can't find it. It's going

4518
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:02,880
value and it can't find it. It's going
 

4519
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,950
value and it can't find it. It's going
to keep auctioning lower.

4520
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:04,960
to keep auctioning lower.
 

4521
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,310
to keep auctioning lower.
It's what you're getting at the moment.

4522
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:06,320
It's what you're getting at the moment.
 

4523
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:20,826
It's what you're getting at the moment.
Constant auction lower.

4524
01:35:20,826 --> 01:35:20,836

 

4525
01:35:20,836 --> 01:35:32,149

[snorts]

4526
01:35:32,149 --> 01:35:32,159

 

4527
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,510

They're still auctioning though. And

4528
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:33,520
They're still auctioning though. And
 

4529
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,709
They're still auctioning though. And
they're still looking for value. There's

4530
01:35:34,709 --> 01:35:34,719
they're still looking for value. There's
 

4531
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:36,070
they're still looking for value. There's
some bids here at 120. It's still going

4532
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:36,080
some bids here at 120. It's still going
 

4533
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,910
some bids here at 120. It's still going
to come lower. It's got no reason to

4534
01:35:37,910 --> 01:35:37,920
to come lower. It's got no reason to
 

4535
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,590
to come lower. It's got no reason to
stop right now, right? There's zero

4536
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:39,600
stop right now, right? There's zero
 

4537
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,110
stop right now, right? There's zero
reason to stop at the moment. This is

4538
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:41,120
reason to stop at the moment. This is
 

4539
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:43,350
reason to stop at the moment. This is
very, very heavy.

4540
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:43,360
very, very heavy.
 

4541
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:46,950
very, very heavy.
Only thing, [sighs]

4542
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:46,960

 

4543
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,790

why is NQ done? This is a habit of it

4544
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:48,800
why is NQ done? This is a habit of it
 

4545
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,950
why is NQ done? This is a habit of it
doing it recently. All I would have

4546
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:50,960
doing it recently. All I would have
 

4547
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,870
doing it recently. All I would have
liked to seen today for this move was

4548
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:52,880
liked to seen today for this move was
 

4549
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:55,189
liked to seen today for this move was
just a poke into here. All I wanted to

4550
01:35:55,189 --> 01:35:55,199
just a poke into here. All I wanted to
 

4551
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:56,950
just a poke into here. All I wanted to
see today is a New York poke into there.

4552
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:56,960
see today is a New York poke into there.
 

4553
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:01,189
see today is a New York poke into there.
And that they didn't do it. They are

4554
01:36:01,189 --> 01:36:01,199
And that they didn't do it. They are
 

4555
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:03,030
And that they didn't do it. They are
They've become buggers recently. All

4556
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:03,040
They've become buggers recently. All
 

4557
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:04,709
They've become buggers recently. All
right, you're going to get your final TP

4558
01:36:04,709 --> 01:36:04,719
right, you're going to get your final TP
 

4559
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:05,990
right, you're going to get your final TP
here. You're into blue box. This is

4560
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:06,000
here. You're into blue box. This is
 

4561
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,350
here. You're into blue box. This is
where we found the man before. This is

4562
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:07,360
where we found the man before. This is
 

4563
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,030
where we found the man before. This is
previous day low. If we snap underneath

4564
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:09,040
previous day low. If we snap underneath
 

4565
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:11,990
previous day low. If we snap underneath
that, you never know what's next. If

4566
01:36:11,990 --> 01:36:12,000
that, you never know what's next. If
 

4567
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,669
that, you never know what's next. If
they snap underneath that, folks, you

4568
01:36:13,669 --> 01:36:13,679
they snap underneath that, folks, you
 

4569
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:17,030
they snap underneath that, folks, you
just never know what's next. But I would

4570
01:36:17,030 --> 01:36:17,040
just never know what's next. But I would
 

4571
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,669
just never know what's next. But I would
be trimming my positions if I was you

4572
01:36:19,669 --> 01:36:19,679
be trimming my positions if I was you
 

4573
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:28,709
be trimming my positions if I was you
right now.

4574
01:36:28,709 --> 01:36:28,719

 

4575
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:33,030

You can't rule out 24800.

4576
01:36:33,030 --> 01:36:33,040
You can't rule out 24800.
 

4577
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,870
You can't rule out 24800.
You can't rule it out. They're still

4578
01:36:34,870 --> 01:36:34,880
You can't rule it out. They're still
 

4579
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,110
You can't rule it out. They're still
searching for value. We have not found

4580
01:36:37,110 --> 01:36:37,120
searching for value. We have not found
 

4581
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,669
searching for value. We have not found
value. ES, by the way, has taken

4582
01:36:39,669 --> 01:36:39,679
value. ES, by the way, has taken
 

4583
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:42,070
value. ES, by the way, has taken
previous day low. SPY has not taken

4584
01:36:42,070 --> 01:36:42,080
previous day low. SPY has not taken
 

4585
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:46,070
previous day low. SPY has not taken
previous day low yet. QQQ has taken

4586
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:46,080
previous day low yet. QQQ has taken
 

4587
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,990
previous day low yet. QQQ has taken
previous day low. NQ hasn't. So, we got

4588
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:48,000
previous day low. NQ hasn't. So, we got
 

4589
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,990
previous day low. NQ hasn't. So, we got
divergence. Just so that you're aware,

4590
01:36:49,990 --> 01:36:50,000
divergence. Just so that you're aware,
 

4591
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,510
divergence. Just so that you're aware,
we are starting to see some divergence

4592
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:51,520
we are starting to see some divergence
 

4593
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,350
we are starting to see some divergence
across the indexes right now. Just

4594
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:53,360
across the indexes right now. Just
 

4595
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,590
across the indexes right now. Just
trying to make you aware. Um, there's no

4596
01:36:55,590 --> 01:36:55,600
trying to make you aware. Um, there's no
 

4597
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,350
trying to make you aware. Um, there's no
reason to bid on this market in my mind.

4598
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:57,360
reason to bid on this market in my mind.
 

4599
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,669
reason to bid on this market in my mind.
We are breaking outside of value now. We

4600
01:36:59,669 --> 01:36:59,679
We are breaking outside of value now. We
 

4601
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:02,149
We are breaking outside of value now. We
are trend trading lower. searching for

4602
01:37:02,149 --> 01:37:02,159
are trend trading lower. searching for
 

4603
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:04,629
are trend trading lower. searching for
value. There is no reason to try and bid

4604
01:37:04,629 --> 01:37:04,639
value. There is no reason to try and bid
 

4605
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:07,830
value. There is no reason to try and bid
on this market right now.

4606
01:37:07,830 --> 01:37:07,840
on this market right now.
 

4607
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,189
on this market right now.
You are if you try and bid on this,

4608
01:37:09,189 --> 01:37:09,199
You are if you try and bid on this,
 

4609
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:17,990
You are if you try and bid on this,
you're counter trend. No reason.

4610
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:18,000

 

4611
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,430

Every pop still being sold. There'll

4612
01:37:19,430 --> 01:37:19,440
Every pop still being sold. There'll
 

4613
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:20,870
Every pop still being sold. There'll
probably be some relief at some point.

4614
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:20,880
probably be some relief at some point.
 

4615
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,390
probably be some relief at some point.
Maybe once it takes previous day low,

4616
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:22,400
Maybe once it takes previous day low,
 

4617
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,229
Maybe once it takes previous day low,
unless they cascade it. There probably

4618
01:37:24,229 --> 01:37:24,239
unless they cascade it. There probably
 

4619
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:26,149
unless they cascade it. There probably
be some relief, but you know, I would

4620
01:37:26,149 --> 01:37:26,159
be some relief, but you know, I would
 

4621
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:27,990
be some relief, but you know, I would
not bid on that. Why bid counter trend

4622
01:37:27,990 --> 01:37:28,000
not bid on that. Why bid counter trend
 

4623
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:33,270
not bid on that. Why bid counter trend
when we're leaving value? Here

4624
01:37:33,270 --> 01:37:33,280

 

4625
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:36,470

we go. Liquidity here. 195. Still think

4626
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:36,480
we go. Liquidity here. 195. Still think
 

4627
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:37,669
we go. Liquidity here. 195. Still think
they will probably trade underneath

4628
01:37:37,669 --> 01:37:37,679
they will probably trade underneath
 

4629
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:43,030
they will probably trade underneath
that.

4630
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:43,040

 

4631
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:44,709

Once it snaps that shelf, it's probably

4632
01:37:44,709 --> 01:37:44,719
Once it snaps that shelf, it's probably
 

4633
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:46,629
Once it snaps that shelf, it's probably
going to get pretty nasty pretty quick.

4634
01:37:46,629 --> 01:37:46,639
going to get pretty nasty pretty quick.
 

4635
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:51,669
going to get pretty nasty pretty quick.
I'd imagine

4636
01:37:51,669 --> 01:37:51,679

 

4637
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:53,270

it's where buyers keep trying to step in

4638
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:53,280
it's where buyers keep trying to step in
 

4639
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:54,870
it's where buyers keep trying to step in
and they keep getting passively sold. We

4640
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:54,880
and they keep getting passively sold. We
 

4641
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,709
and they keep getting passively sold. We
haven't hit that previous day low yet on

4642
01:37:56,709 --> 01:37:56,719
haven't hit that previous day low yet on
 

4643
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:58,390
haven't hit that previous day low yet on
ENQ. We have hit it on all the other

4644
01:37:58,390 --> 01:37:58,400
ENQ. We have hit it on all the other
 

4645
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,709
ENQ. We have hit it on all the other
indexes now other than SPY. ES has hit

4646
01:38:00,709 --> 01:38:00,719
indexes now other than SPY. ES has hit
 

4647
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:03,030
indexes now other than SPY. ES has hit
it, but SPY hasn't.

4648
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:03,040
it, but SPY hasn't.
 

4649
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:05,590
it, but SPY hasn't.
So maybe a bit of relief here up to 150,

4650
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:05,600
So maybe a bit of relief here up to 150,
 

4651
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,910
So maybe a bit of relief here up to 150,
maybe up to 170 for them to resell it. I

4652
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:07,920
maybe up to 170 for them to resell it. I
 

4653
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:11,189
maybe up to 170 for them to resell it. I
don't know. I don't think they're done.

4654
01:38:11,189 --> 01:38:11,199
don't know. I don't think they're done.
 

4655
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:22,470
don't know. I don't think they're done.
I do not think they're done.

4656
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:22,480

 

4657
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:27,430

You got the dappy.

4658
01:38:27,430 --> 01:38:27,440

 

4659
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,990

You bugger.

4660
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:30,000
You bugger.
 

4661
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:44,470
You bugger.
You bugger not giving me the FBO.

4662
01:38:44,470 --> 01:38:44,480

 

4663
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:45,990

They're going to come fill this guy at

4664
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:46,000
They're going to come fill this guy at
 

4665
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,470
They're going to come fill this guy at
150 probably and then see if they resell

4666
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:48,480
150 probably and then see if they resell
 

4667
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,390
150 probably and then see if they resell
it here or 170. There's probably options

4668
01:38:50,390 --> 01:38:50,400
it here or 170. There's probably options
 

4669
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,790
it here or 170. There's probably options
right now. Here's the 150 or the move

4670
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:52,800
right now. Here's the 150 or the move
 

4671
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,790
right now. Here's the 150 or the move
into 150. It's a it's an old imbalance

4672
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:54,800
into 150. It's a it's an old imbalance
 

4673
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,870
into 150. It's a it's an old imbalance
here. Here's 150. Do they get if they

4674
01:38:56,870 --> 01:38:56,880
here. Here's 150. Do they get if they
 

4675
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:57,910
here. Here's 150. Do they get if they
get through this, they're going to go

4676
01:38:57,910 --> 01:38:57,920
get through this, they're going to go
 

4677
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,950
get through this, they're going to go
170 and then they're going to see if

4678
01:38:58,950 --> 01:38:58,960
170 and then they're going to see if
 

4679
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,270
170 and then they're going to see if
they sell that.

4680
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:01,280
they sell that.
 

4681
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:04,149
they sell that.
This is 150. It's an old imbalance.

4682
01:39:04,149 --> 01:39:04,159
This is 150. It's an old imbalance.
 

4683
01:39:04,159 --> 01:39:07,270
This is 150. It's an old imbalance.
So, this is counter trend squeeze up and

4684
01:39:07,270 --> 01:39:07,280
So, this is counter trend squeeze up and
 

4685
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,950
So, this is counter trend squeeze up and
uh if we get through here, then they're

4686
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:08,960
uh if we get through here, then they're
 

4687
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,629
uh if we get through here, then they're
going to check 170. All right. I'm just

4688
01:39:10,629 --> 01:39:10,639
going to check 170. All right. I'm just
 

4689
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:11,990
going to check 170. All right. I'm just
looking at the imbalances on the tape

4690
01:39:11,990 --> 01:39:12,000
looking at the imbalances on the tape
 

4691
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,310
looking at the imbalances on the tape
and the delta on the tape.

4692
01:39:14,310 --> 01:39:14,320
and the delta on the tape.
 

4693
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:15,990
and the delta on the tape.
It's still for me it's still a sell.

4694
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:16,000
It's still for me it's still a sell.
 

4695
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,430
It's still for me it's still a sell.
It's if you're going to [clears throat]

4696
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:17,440
It's if you're going to [clears throat]
 

4697
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:18,629
It's if you're going to [clears throat]
trade upside, you're playing counter

4698
01:39:18,629 --> 01:39:18,639
trade upside, you're playing counter
 

4699
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:19,910
trade upside, you're playing counter
trend. I'm just telling you the levels

4700
01:39:19,910 --> 01:39:19,920
trend. I'm just telling you the levels
 

4701
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,669
trend. I'm just telling you the levels
it's likely to go and back test right

4702
01:39:21,669 --> 01:39:21,679
it's likely to go and back test right
 

4703
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:23,990
it's likely to go and back test right
now.

4704
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:24,000
now.
 

4705
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,390
now.
ES did sweep previous day low, but I

4706
01:39:26,390 --> 01:39:26,400
ES did sweep previous day low, but I
 

4707
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,990
ES did sweep previous day low, but I
still think there'd be one more attempt

4708
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:28,000
still think there'd be one more attempt
 

4709
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:38,550
still think there'd be one more attempt
to move lower here.

4710
01:39:38,550 --> 01:39:38,560

 

4711
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:40,149

So, back under the 50. They're checking

4712
01:39:40,149 --> 01:39:40,159
So, back under the 50. They're checking
 

4713
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:41,510
So, back under the 50. They're checking
this 50. They're checking buy side

4714
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:41,520
this 50. They're checking buy side
 

4715
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,990
this 50. They're checking buy side
imbalance now. 43 and then what's this

4716
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:44,000
imbalance now. 43 and then what's this
 

4717
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,030
imbalance now. 43 and then what's this
level here? 35 and then 20. So, here's

4718
01:39:47,030 --> 01:39:47,040
level here? 35 and then 20. So, here's
 

4719
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:48,629
level here? 35 and then 20. So, here's
the one more attempt to move lower. If

4720
01:39:48,629 --> 01:39:48,639
the one more attempt to move lower. If
 

4721
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:51,189
the one more attempt to move lower. If
they fail to move lower now then maybe

4722
01:39:51,189 --> 01:39:51,199
they fail to move lower now then maybe
 

4723
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:53,830
they fail to move lower now then maybe
more relief but uh like I said I think

4724
01:39:53,830 --> 01:39:53,840
more relief but uh like I said I think
 

4725
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:56,070
more relief but uh like I said I think
sellers are still remain in control of

4726
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:56,080
sellers are still remain in control of
 

4727
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:58,070
sellers are still remain in control of
this market.

4728
01:39:58,070 --> 01:39:58,080
this market.
 

4729
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,859
this market.
Sounds a loss somewhere. Yeah.

4730
01:39:59,859 --> 01:39:59,869
Sounds a loss somewhere. Yeah.
 

4731
01:39:59,869 --> 01:40:02,470
Sounds a loss somewhere. Yeah.
[laughter]

4732
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:02,480

 

4733
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:09,189

His satnav went off, didn't it?

4734
01:40:09,189 --> 01:40:09,199

 

4735
01:40:09,199 --> 01:40:12,304

Japan stole him, I would say.

4736
01:40:12,304 --> 01:40:12,314
Japan stole him, I would say.
 

4737
01:40:12,314 --> 01:40:15,030
Japan stole him, I would say.
[laughter]

4738
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:15,040

 

4739
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:17,189

So good.

4740
01:40:17,189 --> 01:40:17,199
So good.
 

4741
01:40:17,199 --> 01:40:18,709
So good.
Oh, okay. Okay, there. So, there there

4742
01:40:18,709 --> 01:40:18,719
Oh, okay. Okay, there. So, there there
 

4743
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:21,270
Oh, okay. Okay, there. So, there there
we go. There's the push and fail. We're

4744
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:21,280
we go. There's the push and fail. We're
 

4745
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:22,950
we go. There's the push and fail. We're
underneath this uh old weekly point

4746
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:22,960
underneath this uh old weekly point
 

4747
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,310
underneath this uh old weekly point
control. This is the target. They still

4748
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:24,320
control. This is the target. They still
 

4749
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,510
control. This is the target. They still
want to take this out if they can.

4750
01:40:25,510 --> 01:40:25,520
want to take this out if they can.
 

4751
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,030
want to take this out if they can.
That's what they are trying to do. I

4752
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:27,040
That's what they are trying to do. I
 

4753
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:28,070
That's what they are trying to do. I
don't think the auction's finished,

4754
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:28,080
don't think the auction's finished,
 

4755
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:32,550
don't think the auction's finished,
folks. When I look at the lows,

4756
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:32,560

 

4757
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:33,910

I don't think this auction's finished,

4758
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:33,920
I don't think this auction's finished,
 

4759
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,149
I don't think this auction's finished,
but we'll see.

4760
01:40:36,149 --> 01:40:36,159
but we'll see.
 

4761
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:37,590
but we'll see.
Bit of a wiggle here. Still don't think

4762
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:37,600
Bit of a wiggle here. Still don't think
 

4763
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:45,109
Bit of a wiggle here. Still don't think
the auction's finished.

4764
01:40:45,109 --> 01:40:45,119

 

4765
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:46,629

I think we're going to trade lower here.

4766
01:40:46,629 --> 01:40:46,639
I think we're going to trade lower here.
 

4767
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:48,984
I think we're going to trade lower here.
They're trying. They're trying.

4768
01:40:48,984 --> 01:40:48,994
They're trying. They're trying.
 

4769
01:40:48,994 --> 01:40:55,590
They're trying. They're trying.
[snorts]

4770
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:55,600

 

4771
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:56,790

Here we go. They're going to try and

4772
01:40:56,790 --> 01:40:56,800
Here we go. They're going to try and
 

4773
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:57,750
Here we go. They're going to try and
sell this down. This is what I was

4774
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:57,760
sell this down. This is what I was
 

4775
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:58,790
sell this down. This is what I was
saying. I didn't think it was finished

4776
01:40:58,790 --> 01:40:58,800
saying. I didn't think it was finished
 

4777
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:01,990
saying. I didn't think it was finished
yet. There they go. So, they just poked

4778
01:41:01,990 --> 01:41:02,000
yet. There they go. So, they just poked
 

4779
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,350
yet. There they go. So, they just poked
above the 50. What did I say? 50 was

4780
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:03,360
above the 50. What did I say? 50 was
 

4781
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,030
above the 50. What did I say? 50 was
probably the level. 59 they got to. If

4782
01:41:05,030 --> 01:41:05,040
probably the level. 59 they got to. If
 

4783
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,390
probably the level. 59 they got to. If
they got If they closed above that, they

4784
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:06,400
they got If they closed above that, they
 

4785
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,070
they got If they closed above that, they
were going to test 70. So, probably new

4786
01:41:08,070 --> 01:41:08,080
were going to test 70. So, probably new
 

4787
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:10,070
were going to test 70. So, probably new
low of day coming here, folks. There's

4788
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:10,080
low of day coming here, folks. There's
 

4789
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,750
low of day coming here, folks. There's
some covers into 100, but you're

4790
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:11,760
some covers into 100, but you're
 

4791
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:13,270
some covers into 100, but you're
probably looking for previous day low if

4792
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:13,280
probably looking for previous day low if
 

4793
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,750
probably looking for previous day low if
they flush 100. So, it be interesting

4794
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:15,760
they flush 100. So, it be interesting
 

4795
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,510
they flush 100. So, it be interesting
how they act here. Can they get back

4796
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:17,520
how they act here. Can they get back
 

4797
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:31,189
how they act here. Can they get back
through this 100 mark?

4798
01:41:31,189 --> 01:41:31,199

 

4799
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:32,870

Back to the 100 again. There still

4800
01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:32,880
Back to the 100 again. There still
 

4801
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:35,189
Back to the 100 again. There still
there's someone front running this 100.

4802
01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:35,199
there's someone front running this 100.
 

4803
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:36,390
there's someone front running this 100.
I think we're going to sell through it

4804
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:36,400
I think we're going to sell through it
 

4805
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:37,750
I think we're going to sell through it
honestly. And I think you might get a

4806
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:37,760
honestly. And I think you might get a
 

4807
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,109
honestly. And I think you might get a
little flush here. If you're still in

4808
01:41:39,109 --> 01:41:39,119
little flush here. If you're still in
 

4809
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:40,550
little flush here. If you're still in
the short, you want to cover some onto

4810
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:40,560
the short, you want to cover some onto
 

4811
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:41,910
the short, you want to cover some onto
the next flush because it might be

4812
01:41:41,910 --> 01:41:41,920
the next flush because it might be
 

4813
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,590
the next flush because it might be
excess.

4814
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:43,600
excess.
 

4815
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,030
excess.
And if you get lucky, you get all the

4816
01:41:45,030 --> 01:41:45,040
And if you get lucky, you get all the
 

4817
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:46,310
And if you get lucky, you get all the
way down to previous day low, but

4818
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:46,320
way down to previous day low, but
 

4819
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,590
way down to previous day low, but
definitely want to be covering some if

4820
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:47,600
definitely want to be covering some if
 

4821
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,109
definitely want to be covering some if
you're still short in this into the next

4822
01:41:49,109 --> 01:41:49,119
you're still short in this into the next
 

4823
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:51,750
you're still short in this into the next
flush. Big sellers keep trying here, not

4824
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:51,760
flush. Big sellers keep trying here, not
 

4825
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,510
flush. Big sellers keep trying here, not
getting their way. Be careful. I think

4826
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:53,520
getting their way. Be careful. I think
 

4827
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:54,950
getting their way. Be careful. I think
it will come, but I don't know it will

4828
01:41:54,950 --> 01:41:54,960
it will come, but I don't know it will
 

4829
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,669
it will come, but I don't know it will
come. You should be runners only really

4830
01:41:57,669 --> 01:41:57,679
come. You should be runners only really
 

4831
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:01,590
come. You should be runners only really
now anyway.

4832
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:01,600

 

4833
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,030

So, they're front running that 100. I

4834
01:42:03,030 --> 01:42:03,040
So, they're front running that 100. I
 

4835
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,550
So, they're front running that 100. I
still think they let go of that 100, but

4836
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:04,560
still think they let go of that 100, but
 

4837
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:05,830
still think they let go of that 100, but
it might just take some time. They might

4838
01:42:05,830 --> 01:42:05,840
it might just take some time. They might
 

4839
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,950
it might just take some time. They might
need more relief.

4840
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:08,960
need more relief.
 

4841
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:10,470
need more relief.
Buyers are trying and trying and trying

4842
01:42:10,470 --> 01:42:10,480
Buyers are trying and trying and trying
 

4843
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:12,870
Buyers are trying and trying and trying
and trying here. I think they're going

4844
01:42:12,870 --> 01:42:12,880
and trying here. I think they're going
 

4845
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:14,870
and trying here. I think they're going
to get hurt. Here we go. Back to the 100

4846
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:14,880
to get hurt. Here we go. Back to the 100
 

4847
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:17,270
to get hurt. Here we go. Back to the 100
again.

4848
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:17,280
again.
 

4849
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,550
again.
They can't get through this 100. So,

4850
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:18,560
They can't get through this 100. So,
 

4851
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,790
They can't get through this 100. So,
there's passive buying. Front loading in

4852
01:42:20,790 --> 01:42:20,800
there's passive buying. Front loading in
 

4853
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,070
there's passive buying. Front loading in
front of 100. I'm very surprised we

4854
01:42:22,070 --> 01:42:22,080
front of 100. I'm very surprised we
 

4855
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:23,189
front of 100. I'm very surprised we
haven't broken it yet. It's probably

4856
01:42:23,189 --> 01:42:23,199
haven't broken it yet. It's probably
 

4857
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:25,270
haven't broken it yet. It's probably
coming 108.

4858
01:42:25,270 --> 01:42:25,280
coming 108.
 

4859
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,350
coming 108.
Here comes the 100. Check. And we will

4860
01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:27,360
Here comes the 100. Check. And we will
 

4861
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:29,270
Here comes the 100. Check. And we will
probably snap underneath this. You must

4862
01:42:29,270 --> 01:42:29,280
probably snap underneath this. You must
 

4863
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:32,470
probably snap underneath this. You must
be covering un in into this region here.

4864
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:32,480
be covering un in into this region here.
 

4865
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:39,030
be covering un in into this region here.
Huge level.

4866
01:42:39,030 --> 01:42:39,040

 

4867
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,629

Here it comes. Here it comes, folks.

4868
01:42:40,629 --> 01:42:40,639
Here it comes. Here it comes, folks.
 

4869
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:41,830
Here it comes. Here it comes, folks.
Make sure you're covering some onto

4870
01:42:41,830 --> 01:42:41,840
Make sure you're covering some onto
 

4871
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,430
Make sure you're covering some onto
this. There you go. Here comes previous

4872
01:42:43,430 --> 01:42:43,440
this. There you go. Here comes previous
 

4873
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,189
this. There you go. Here comes previous
day low. All right. Be careful now

4874
01:42:45,189 --> 01:42:45,199
day low. All right. Be careful now
 

4875
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:46,709
day low. All right. Be careful now
because the auction can end here. I want

4876
01:42:46,709 --> 01:42:46,719
because the auction can end here. I want
 

4877
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:48,229
because the auction can end here. I want
to be make that very, very clear. The

4878
01:42:48,229 --> 01:42:48,239
to be make that very, very clear. The
 

4879
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:50,950
to be make that very, very clear. The
auction can end here. So, previous day

4880
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:50,960
auction can end here. So, previous day
 

4881
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:52,390
auction can end here. So, previous day
low is your target. Below that is a

4882
01:42:52,390 --> 01:42:52,400
low is your target. Below that is a
 

4883
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:53,990
low is your target. Below that is a

01:46:21,990 --> 01:46:22,000
yesterday's value. Once we reject
 

4993
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,470

4997
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:29,030

01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,390
opportunity right now in this market. We

01:46:41,510 --> 01:46:41,520
they feel like they need a pullback and
 

5011
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,510
they feel like they need a pullback and

a potential small squeeze can happen
back over 100. That would be like the

5040
01:47:17,189 --> 01:47:17,199
back over 100. That would be like the
 

5041
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:20,149
back over 100. That would be like the
level of that countertrend squeeze where

5042
01:47:20,149 --> 01:47:20,159
level of that countertrend squeeze where
 

5043
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:22,470
level of that countertrend squeeze where
it could take place would be back over

5044
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:22,480
it could take place would be back over
 

5045
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:24,709
it could take place would be back over
100. But I'd be very careful about

5046
01:47:24,709 --> 01:47:24,719
100. But I'd be very careful about
 

5047
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:27,030
100. But I'd be very careful about
thinking about any longs in this market

5048
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:27,040
thinking about any longs in this market
 

5049
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,790
thinking about any longs in this market
environment. But there were definitely

5050
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:28,800
environment. But there were definitely
 

5051
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:32,070
environment. But there were definitely
some sellers caught down underneath uh

5052
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:32,080
some sellers caught down underneath uh
 

5053
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:35,189
some sellers caught down underneath uh
56s, but I really would not be touching

5054
01:47:35,189 --> 01:47:35,199
56s, but I really would not be touching
 

5055
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:37,590
56s, but I really would not be touching
this long. I think it's very very risky

5056
01:47:37,590 --> 01:47:37,600
this long. I think it's very very risky
 

5057
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,910
this long. I think it's very very risky
to touch this long.

5058
01:47:39,910 --> 01:47:39,920
to touch this long.
 

5059
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,709
to touch this long.
Nvidia now 3.26% down. That thing's

5060
01:47:42,709 --> 01:47:42,719
Nvidia now 3.26% down. That thing's
 

5061
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:44,149
Nvidia now 3.26% down. That thing's
breaking those key levels we talked

5062
01:47:44,149 --> 01:47:44,159
breaking those key levels we talked
 

5063
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:45,910
breaking those key levels we talked
about.

5064
01:47:45,910 --> 01:47:45,920
about.
 

5065
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:48,790
about.

Okay, watch uh you can set us a price

5078
01:48:02,950 --> 01:48:02,960
Okay, watch uh you can set us a price
 

5079
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:05,350
Okay, watch uh you can set us a price
alert on spy. I'd watch that 75 over

5080
01:48:05,350 --> 01:48:05,360
alert on spy. I'd watch that 75 over
 

5081
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:06,870
alert on spy. I'd watch that 75 over
under.

5082
01:48:06,870 --> 01:48:06,880
under.
 

5083
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,870
under.
Uh if we fade that, I know that there's

5084
01:48:08,870 --> 01:48:08,880
Uh if we fade that, I know that there's
 

5085
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,950
Uh if we fade that, I know that there's
gamma at 70. It's a [\h__\h] long way

5086
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:10,960
gamma at 70. It's a [\h__\h] long way
 

5087
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:13,590
gamma at 70. It's a [\h__\h] long way
down. Another 50 points for ES if we get

5088
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:13,600
down. Another 50 points for ES if we get
 

5089
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:14,709
down. Another 50 points for ES if we get
there.

5090
01:48:14,709 --> 01:48:14,719
there.
 

5091
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:16,310
there.
I don't know if we do it today. It's

5092
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:16,320
I don't know if we do it today. It's
 

5093
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:20,310
I don't know if we do it today. It's
exposure for the end of the week.

5094
01:48:20,310 --> 01:48:20,320

 

5095
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:26,470

Yeah, I know. It's mad, Adam.

5096
01:48:26,470 --> 01:48:26,480

 

5097
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:27,990

Vick's trying to take out previous day

5098
01:48:27,990 --> 01:48:28,000
Vick's trying to take out previous day
 

5099

Vick's trying to take out previous day

So, we just had to wait for that chop to

5102
01:48:32,709 --> 01:48:32,719
So, we just had to wait for that chop to
 

5103
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:36,470
So, we just had to wait for that chop to
end. Still more selling here.

5104
01:48:36,470 --> 01:48:36,480
end. Still more selling here.
 

5105
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,910
end. Still more selling here.
Still more selling here. I'm going to go

5106
01:48:37,910 --> 01:48:37,920
Still more selling here. I'm going to go
 

5107
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,350
Still more selling here. I'm going to go
back to that daily level. Got to have a

5108
01:48:39,350 --> 01:48:39,360
back to that daily level. Got to have a
 

5109
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:40,629
back to that daily level. Got to have a
look here. We're coming right into the

5110
01:48:40,629 --> 01:48:40,639
look here. We're coming right into the
 

5111
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:41,910
look here. We're coming right into the
edge of this shelf. All right, the edge

5112
01:48:41,910 --> 01:48:41,920
edge of this shelf. All right, the edge
 

5113
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:44,149
edge of this shelf. All right, the edge
of this daily shelf is basically 25 and

5114
01:48:44,149 --> 01:48:44,159
of this daily shelf is basically 25 and
 

5115
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:45,830
of this daily shelf is basically 25 and
33. Maybe they bleed it a little bit

5116
01:48:45,830 --> 01:48:45,840
33. Maybe they bleed it a little bit
 

5117
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,510
33. Maybe they bleed it a little bit
extra. I'm just looking at the volume

5118
01:48:47,510 --> 01:48:47,520
extra. I'm just looking at the volume
 

5119
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:50,149
extra. I'm just looking at the volume
profile on the daily. All right. Um,

5120
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:50,159
profile on the daily. All right. Um,
 

5121
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:51,990
profile on the daily. All right. Um,
that's for the yearly volume. If we lose

5122
01:48:51,990 --> 01:48:52,000
that's for the yearly volume. If we lose
 

5123
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,830
that's for the yearly volume. If we lose
this, let me get you over here. This is

5124
01:48:53,830 --> 01:48:53,840
this, let me get you over here. This is
 

5125
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,669
this, let me get you over here. This is
what I'm very aware of. I wouldn't be a

5126
01:48:55,669 --> 01:48:55,679
what I'm very aware of. I wouldn't be a
 

5127
01:48:55,679 --> 01:48:59,430
what I'm very aware of. I wouldn't be a
new seller down here. This node, this is

5128
01:48:59,430 --> 01:48:59,440
new seller down here. This node, this is
 

5129
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:01,590
new seller down here. This node, this is
this is your volume from the whole year.

5130
01:49:01,590 --> 01:49:01,600
this is your volume from the whole year.
 

5131
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,830
this is your volume from the whole year.
This is a big node. If they lose that,

5132
01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:03,840
This is a big node. If they lose that,
 

5133
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:07,109
This is a big node. If they lose that,
the next one is at well, basically 25K.

5134
01:49:07,109 --> 01:49:07,119
the next one is at well, basically 25K.
 

5135
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:09,109
the next one is at well, basically 25K.
There's a tiny little node at 25K. If we

5136
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:09,119
There's a tiny little node at 25K. If we
 

5137
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:11,750
There's a tiny little node at 25K. If we
lose that, we're thin all the way down

5138
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:11,760
lose that, we're thin all the way down
 

5139
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,109
lose that, we're thin all the way down
into this. Oh my god. Let's just move

5140
01:49:15,109 --> 01:49:15,119
into this. Oh my god. Let's just move
 

5141
01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:16,790
into this. Oh my god. Let's just move
this out a bit. We're thin all the way

5142
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:16,800
this out a bit. We're thin all the way
 

5143
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,870
this out a bit. We're thin all the way
down into that. All right. So, I'd be

5144
01:49:18,870 --> 01:49:18,880
down into that. All right. So, I'd be
 

5145
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,189
down into that. All right. So, I'd be
watching. Either buyers come in now or

5146
01:49:21,189 --> 01:49:21,199
watching. Either buyers come in now or
 

5147
01:49:21,199 --> 01:49:23,669
watching. Either buyers come in now or
they come in at 25,000 basically even.

5148
01:49:23,669 --> 01:49:23,679
they come in at 25,000 basically even.
 

5149
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:26,229
they come in at 25,000 basically even.
If they don't, well, we get that 800

5150
01:49:26,229 --> 01:49:26,239
If they don't, well, we get that 800
 

5151
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:34,390
If they don't, well, we get that 800
move I've been talking about.

5152
01:49:34,390 --> 01:49:34,400

 

5153
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:36,310

So, they're trying to come in now.

5154
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:36,320
So, they're trying to come in now.
 

5155
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,790
So, they're trying to come in now.
They're like, "Fuck, please.

5156
01:49:38,790 --> 01:49:38,800
They're like, "Fuck, please.
 

5157
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,910
They're like, "Fuck, please.
Please, Santa, come back. Save my

5158
01:49:41,910 --> 01:49:41,920
Please, Santa, come back. Save my
 

5159
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:48,229
Please, Santa, come back. Save my
swings. [laughter]

5160
01:49:48,229 --> 01:49:48,239

 

5161
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:49,510

Oh, that's all right, Troy. Look, all

5162
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:49,520
Oh, that's all right, Troy. Look, all

Big selling delta came in there at 56 is

5176
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:04,400
Big selling delta came in there at 56 is
 

5177
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:09,270
Big selling delta came in there at 56 is
where we are right now.

5178
01:50:09,270 --> 01:50:09,280

 

5179
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:10,470

Are they going to offer a little bit of

5180
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:10,480
Are they going to offer a little bit of
 

5181
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:11,990
Are they going to offer a little bit of
relief there? Because they just caught a

5182
01:50:11,990 --> 01:50:12,000
relief there? Because they just caught a
 

5183
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:17,590
relief there? Because they just caught a
few people there. The answer maybe yes.

5184
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:17,600

 

5185
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:21,510

Where can they relieve up to 77s and

Where can they relieve up to 77s and
 

5187
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:28,149
Where can they relieve up to 77s and
95s?

5188

5189
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:30,790

What is the exact pair? I'm trading NQ.

What is the exact pair? I'm trading NQ.
 

5191
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:33,669

concides with SPX 67750. Really

5198
01:50:45,830 --> 01:50:45,840
concides with SPX 67750. Really
 

5199
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,270
concides with SPX 67750. Really
interesting. Here's the relief that we

5200
01:50:47,270 --> 01:50:47,280
interesting. Here's the relief that we
 

5201
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:48,709
interesting. Here's the relief that we
just talked about. You might have heard

5202
01:50:48,709 --> 01:50:48,719
just talked about. You might have heard
 

5203
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:51,030
just talked about. You might have heard
me just whisper it. If they get over 57,

5204
01:50:51,030 --> 01:50:51,040
me just whisper it. If they get over 57,
 

5205
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:52,550
me just whisper it. If they get over 57,
where are they going to go? Probably 77

5206
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:52,560
where are they going to go? Probably 77
 

5207
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:55,270
where are they going to go? Probably 77
and then above that 95. So, we're just

5208
01:50:55,270 --> 01:50:55,280
and then above that 95. So, we're just
 

5209
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:56,629
and then above that 95. So, we're just
in like a little liquidity building

5210
01:50:56,629 --> 01:50:56,639
in like a little liquidity building
 

5211
01:50:56,639 --> 01:50:58,149
in like a little liquidity building
phase of this market because we've done

5212
01:50:58,149 --> 01:50:58,159
phase of this market because we've done
 

5213
01:50:58,159 --> 01:50:59,830
phase of this market because we've done
a strong move down, right? Strong move

5214
01:50:59,830 --> 01:50:59,840
a strong move down, right? Strong move
 

5215
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,790
a strong move down, right? Strong move
down. They're going to have to build

5216
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:00,800
down. They're going to have to build
 

5217
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:02,470
down. They're going to have to build
more liquidity before they decide what

5218
01:51:02,470 --> 01:51:02,480
more liquidity before they decide what
 

5219
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:04,870
more liquidity before they decide what
next. We can't just move one direction

5220
01:51:04,870 --> 01:51:04,880
next. We can't just move one direction
 

5221
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,470
next. We can't just move one direction
all the time. All right. They have to

5222
01:51:06,470 --> 01:51:06,480
all the time. All right. They have to
 

5223
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:09,030
all the time. All right. They have to
rebuild people into the levels to then

5224
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:09,040
rebuild people into the levels to then
 

5225
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:42,149
rebuild people into the levels to then
play use their pain to play with

5226
01:51:42,149 --> 01:51:42,159

it is bleak out there. I've been saying
this for a very, very long time, right?

5260
01:52:34,870 --> 01:52:34,880
this for a very, very long time, right?

[laughter]
 

5317
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:39,830
[laughter]
But I think what you're going to see is

5318
01:53:39,830 --> 01:53:39,840
But I think what you're going to see is
 

5319
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:41,910
But I think what you're going to see is
a crack in the economy. I think you're

5320
01:53:41,910 --> 01:53:41,920
a crack in the economy. I think you're
 

5321
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:44,790
a crack in the economy. I think you're
going to see some major flushes coming

5322
01:53:44,790 --> 01:53:44,800
going to see some major flushes coming
 

5323
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:48,629
going to see some major flushes coming
Q1 next year. Um, and then I think

5324
01:53:48,629 --> 01:53:48,639
Q1 next year. Um, and then I think
 

5325
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:50,629
Q1 next year. Um, and then I think
you're going to see a rush for the Fed

5326
01:53:50,629 --> 01:53:50,639
you're going to see a rush for the Fed
 

5327
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:51,990
you're going to see a rush for the Fed
to cut. I think this whole we're going

5328
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:52,000
to cut. I think this whole we're going
 

5329
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,229
to cut. I think this whole we're going
to cut one time next year bollocks they

5330
01:53:54,229 --> 01:53:54,239
to cut one time next year bollocks they
 

5331
01:53:54,239 --> 01:53:55,990
to cut one time next year bollocks they
will [\h__\h] panic and they will go into

5332
01:53:55,990 --> 01:53:56,000
will [\h__\h] panic and they will go into
 

5333
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,310
will [\h__\h] panic and they will go into
three or four cuts and big cuts because

5334
01:53:58,310 --> 01:53:58,320
three or four cuts and big cuts because
 

5335
01:53:58,320 --> 01:53:59,350
three or four cuts and big cuts because
they will feel like they've got to

5336
01:53:59,350 --> 01:53:59,360
they will feel like they've got to
 

5337
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:01,350
they will feel like they've got to
inject some capital back into the

5338
01:54:01,350 --> 01:54:01,360
inject some capital back into the
 

5339
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:04,310
inject some capital back into the
economy and and I think you'll see the

5340
01:54:04,310 --> 01:54:04,320
economy and and I think you'll see the
 

5341
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:06,470
economy and and I think you'll see the
range that we created this year could

5342
01:54:06,470 --> 01:54:06,480
range that we created this year could
 

5343
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:08,870
range that we created this year could
very well be retested a little bit. It's

5344
01:54:08,870 --> 01:54:08,880
very well be retested a little bit. It's
 

5345
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:10,470
very well be retested a little bit. It's
been a big big year. Remember we're up

5346
01:54:10,470 --> 01:54:10,480
been a big big year. Remember we're up
 

5347
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:13,669
been a big big year. Remember we're up
50 60% off the lows of year. you know,

5348
01:54:13,669 --> 01:54:13,679
50 60% off the lows of year. you know,
 

5349
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:16,709
50 60% off the lows of year. you know,
your job, your job, but the way I see

5350
01:54:16,709 --> 01:54:16,719
your job, your job, but the way I see
 

5351
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:18,229
your job, your job, but the way I see
it, if you're a swing trader, if you're

5352
01:54:18,229 --> 01:54:18,239
it, if you're a swing trader, if you're
 

5353
01:54:18,239 --> 01:54:21,669
it, if you're a swing trader, if you're
trading a a lowrisk like IER account, if

5354
01:54:21,669 --> 01:54:21,679
trading a a lowrisk like IER account, if
 

5355
01:54:21,679 --> 01:54:23,990
trading a a lowrisk like IER account, if
you're from the UK or 401k or whatever

5356
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:24,000
you're from the UK or 401k or whatever
 

5357
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,070
you're from the UK or 401k or whatever
it's called here, um your job is to make

5358
01:54:26,070 --> 01:54:26,080
it's called here, um your job is to make
 

5359
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:29,430
it's called here, um your job is to make
10% a year. That's the average growth of

5360
01:54:29,430 --> 01:54:29,440
10% a year. That's the average growth of
 

5361
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:31,589
10% a year. That's the average growth of
the S&P and the Q's, right? 10% a year.

5362
01:54:31,589 --> 01:54:31,599
the S&P and the Q's, right? 10% a year.
 

5363
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:34,550
the S&P and the Q's, right? 10% a year.
10% a year is decent year. Uh if you

5364
01:54:34,550 --> 01:54:34,560
10% a year is decent year. Uh if you
 

5365
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:36,470
10% a year is decent year. Uh if you
bought the lows, you're up 50 60% of the

5366
01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:36,480
bought the lows, you're up 50 60% of the
 

5367
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:39,430
bought the lows, you're up 50 60% of the
year. So, it it needs to calm down,

5368
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:39,440
year. So, it it needs to calm down,
 

5369
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:40,870
year. So, it it needs to calm down,
folks, right? It needs to calm down.

5370
01:54:40,870 --> 01:54:40,880
folks, right? It needs to calm down.
 

5371
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:43,464
folks, right? It needs to calm down.
Everyone got a bit AI trigger happy.

5372
01:54:43,464 --> 01:54:43,474
Everyone got a bit AI trigger happy.
 

5373
01:54:43,474 --> 01:54:44,070
Everyone got a bit AI trigger happy.

[snorts]
 

5375
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:45,189
[snorts]
Okay, so we're going to come and test

5376
01:54:45,189 --> 01:54:45,199
Okay, so we're going to come and test
 

5377
01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:48,550
Okay, so we're going to come and test
these 94s now by the looks of it.

5378
01:54:48,550 --> 01:54:48,560
these 94s now by the looks of it.
 

5379
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:50,870
these 94s now by the looks of it.
So, so far underneath previous day low,

5380
01:54:50,870 --> 01:54:50,880
So, so far underneath previous day low,
 

5381
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,470
So, so far underneath previous day low,
starting to reclaim previous day low.

5382
01:54:52,470 --> 01:54:52,480
starting to reclaim previous day low.
 

5383
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:54,790
starting to reclaim previous day low.
We're in inside this little volume node.

5384
01:54:54,790 --> 01:54:54,800
We're in inside this little volume node.
 

5385
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:56,709
We're in inside this little volume node.
We're probably going to test sort of 94s

5386
01:54:56,709 --> 01:54:56,719
We're probably going to test sort of 94s
 

5387
01:54:56,719 --> 01:54:58,149
We're probably going to test sort of 94s
and if this is an old sellside

5388
01:54:58,149 --> 01:54:58,159
and if this is an old sellside
 

5389
01:54:58,159 --> 01:54:59,910
and if this is an old sellside
imbalance, which we're coming right into

5390
01:54:59,910 --> 01:54:59,920
imbalance, which we're coming right into
 

5391
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:02,070
imbalance, which we're coming right into
now, and let's see if they get through

5392
01:55:02,070 --> 01:55:02,080
now, and let's see if they get through
 

5393
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:03,430
now, and let's see if they get through
that, we probably go back up to value

5394
01:55:03,430 --> 01:55:03,440
that, we probably go back up to value
 

5395
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,189
that, we probably go back up to value
area low on the day. But if if they

5396
01:55:05,189 --> 01:55:05,199
area low on the day. But if if they
 

5397
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:06,390
area low on the day. But if if they
resell this, then they're going to

5398
01:55:06,390 --> 01:55:06,400
resell this, then they're going to
 

5399
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:09,430
resell this, then they're going to
retest the low. So, there's a node 94.

5400
01:55:09,430 --> 01:55:09,440
retest the low. So, there's a node 94.
 

5401
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,350
retest the low. So, there's a node 94.
Where is 94? somewhere around here,

5402
01:55:11,350 --> 01:55:11,360
Where is 94? somewhere around here,
 

5403
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:13,189
Where is 94? somewhere around here,
right? Sellers will want to retest this

5404
01:55:13,189 --> 01:55:13,199
right? Sellers will want to retest this
 

5405
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:15,270
right? Sellers will want to retest this
and if they do, they get a break. Buyers

5406
01:55:15,270 --> 01:55:15,280
and if they do, they get a break. Buyers
 

5407
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:17,030
and if they do, they get a break. Buyers
will just want to get this move back

5408
01:55:17,030 --> 01:55:17,040
will just want to get this move back
 

5409
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:20,550
will just want to get this move back
into this level for the day, right? Be I

5410
01:55:20,550 --> 01:55:20,560
into this level for the day, right? Be I
 

5411
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:22,870
into this level for the day, right? Be I
would be very skeptical.

5412
01:55:22,870 --> 01:55:22,880
would be very skeptical.
 

5413
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,070
would be very skeptical.
I was going to put this those who have

5414
01:55:24,070 --> 01:55:24,080
I was going to put this those who have
 

5415
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:26,149
I was going to put this those who have
traded with me a long time will know.

5421
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,430
hanging fruit's been taken. Um if you're
going to trade long today, you counter

01:55:31,430 --> 01:55:31,440
going to trade long today, you counter
 

5423
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:33,030
going to trade long today, you counter
trend. Maybe you catch a bit of a

01:55:33,030 --> 01:55:33,040
trend. Maybe you catch a bit of a
 

5425
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:34,550
trend. Maybe you catch a bit of a
squeeze, but the easy money was the

5426
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:34,560
squeeze, but the easy money was the
 

5427
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:37,174
squeeze, but the easy money was the
short back down once we left value.

5428
01:55:37,174 --> 01:55:37,184
short back down once we left value.

01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:44,080
And you're also watching ES into
 

5435
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:46,470
And you're also watching ES into
previous day low here. And if they sell

5436
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:46,480
previous day low here. And if they sell
 

5437
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:49,430

current value area low, then I'd be

5444
01:55:53,750 --> 01:55:53,760
current value area low, then I'd be
 

5445
01:55:53,760 --> 01:56:02,390
current value area low, then I'd be
watching that 170

01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:53,440
that against 107. They didn't even make
 

5475
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:56,390
that against 107. They didn't even make
it there. And buyers will want to hold

it there. And buyers will want to hold
 

5477
01:56:56,400 --> 01:57:07,589

sellers are trying to lean on. If they
 

5485
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:16,229

01:57:16,229 --> 01:57:16,239
don't lean on this shelf, we're going to
 

5487
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:17,750
don't lean on this shelf, we're going to
go 30s. They're trying to lean on this

go 30s. They're trying to lean on this
shelf for sellers. We've reclaimed

5490
01:57:20,070 --> 01:57:20,080
shelf for sellers. We've reclaimed
 

5491
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:22,390
shelf for sellers. We've reclaimed
previous day low. Now, I'd say this

01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:22,400
previous day low. Now, I'd say this
 

5493
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:24,070
previous day low. Now, I'd say this
weekly point of control becomes pretty

5494
01:57:24,070 --> 01:57:24,080
weekly point of control becomes pretty
 

5495
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:28,149
weekly point of control becomes pretty
key up here.

5496
01:57:28,149 --> 01:57:28,159

 

5497
01:57:28,159 --> 01:57:29,669

Make sure you're zoomed out. All right.

5498
01:57:29,669 --> 01:57:29,679
Make sure you're zoomed out. All right.
 

5499
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:31,189
Make sure you're zoomed out. All right.
So, think about what we're doing right

5500
01:57:31,189 --> 01:57:31,199
So, think about what we're doing right
 

5501
01:57:31,199 --> 01:57:33,669
So, think about what we're doing right
now.

5502
01:57:33,669 --> 01:57:33,679
now.
 

5503
01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:35,830
now.
All right, two leg.

5504
01:57:35,830 --> 01:57:35,840
All right, two leg.
 

5505
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:37,270
All right, two leg.
They didn't take this high, which is

5506
01:57:37,270 --> 01:57:37,280
They didn't take this high, which is
 

5507
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:39,990
They didn't take this high, which is
naughty of them. They've sold it. We're

5508
01:57:39,990 --> 01:57:40,000
naughty of them. They've sold it. We're
 

5509
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,149
naughty of them. They've sold it. We're
going to repric. We might well build out

5510
01:57:42,149 --> 01:57:42,159
going to repric. We might well build out
 

5511
01:57:42,159 --> 01:57:43,990
going to repric. We might well build out
some liquidity here, which will offer

5512
01:57:43,990 --> 01:57:44,000
some liquidity here, which will offer
 

5513
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,149
some liquidity here, which will offer
either this trade down or this one back

5514
01:57:46,149 --> 01:57:46,159
either this trade down or this one back
 

5515
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:48,550
either this trade down or this one back
up. Um, which means, you know, today and

5516
01:57:48,550 --> 01:57:48,560
up. Um, which means, you know, today and
 

5517
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:50,310
up. Um, which means, you know, today and
tomorrow we might just go into a rebuild

5518
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:50,320
tomorrow we might just go into a rebuild
 

5519
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:51,669
tomorrow we might just go into a rebuild
of liquidity unless they're going to

5520
01:57:51,669 --> 01:57:51,679
of liquidity unless they're going to
 

5521
01:57:51,679 --> 01:57:57,430
of liquidity unless they're going to
really hammer this thing.

5522
01:57:57,430 --> 01:57:57,440

 

5523
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:59,669

I can't believe

5524
01:57:59,669 --> 01:57:59,679
I can't believe
 

5525
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:02,870
I can't believe
that they left that [\h__\h] high at 517.

5526
01:58:02,870 --> 01:58:02,880
that they left that [\h__\h] high at 517.
 

5527
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:05,030
that they left that [\h__\h] high at 517.
That is naughty.

5528
01:58:05,030 --> 01:58:05,040
That is naughty.
 

5529
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:20,950
That is naughty.
That is naughty of them to do that.

5530
01:58:20,950 --> 01:58:20,960

 

5531
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:23,109

I mean, it's not that big a puke. It It

5532
01:58:23,109 --> 01:58:23,119
I mean, it's not that big a puke. It It
 

5533
01:58:23,119 --> 01:58:25,189
I mean, it's not that big a puke. It It
feels big, Peter. But if if you think

5534
01:58:25,189 --> 01:58:25,199
feels big, Peter. But if if you think
 

5535
01:58:25,199 --> 01:58:27,589
feels big, Peter. But if if you think
about what we've done, if you think

5536
01:58:27,589 --> 01:58:27,599
about what we've done, if you think
 

5537
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:31,109
about what we've done, if you think
about what we've done, um all we've done

5538
01:58:31,109 --> 01:58:31,119
about what we've done, um all we've done
 

5539
01:58:31,119 --> 01:58:34,709
about what we've done, um all we've done
is to trade into previous day low,

5540
01:58:34,709 --> 01:58:34,719
is to trade into previous day low,
 

5541
01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:40,070
is to trade into previous day low,
right? And all VIX has done

5542
01:58:40,070 --> 01:58:40,080

 

5543
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:42,390

is to trade just shy of previous day

5544
01:58:42,390 --> 01:58:42,400
is to trade just shy of previous day
 

5545
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:46,310
is to trade just shy of previous day
high. All right? So, it's it's in it's

5546
01:58:46,310 --> 01:58:46,320
high. All right? So, it's it's in it's
 

5547
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:47,910
high. All right? So, it's it's in it's
in confluence with the move, right? It's

5548
01:58:47,910 --> 01:58:47,920
in confluence with the move, right? It's
 

5549
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:49,350
in confluence with the move, right? It's
not like we've broken out previous day

5550
01:58:49,350 --> 01:58:49,360
not like we've broken out previous day
 

5551
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:50,550
not like we've broken out previous day
low. We do that and we start breaking

5552
01:58:50,550 --> 01:58:50,560
low. We do that and we start breaking
 

5553
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:52,470
low. We do that and we start breaking
out previous day high on the VIX. Give

5554
01:58:52,470 --> 01:58:52,480
out previous day high on the VIX. Give
 

5555
01:58:52,480 --> 01:59:01,589
out previous day high on the VIX. Give
it time.

5556

inside of value if they're going to see

5648
02:00:51,990 --> 02:00:52,000
inside of value if they're going to see
 

5649
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,310
inside of value if they're going to see
a rotation. Otherwise, sellers are going

5650
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:54,320
a rotation. Otherwise, sellers are going
 

5651
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:55,750
a rotation. Otherwise, sellers are going
to defend that level and look for

5652
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:55,760
to defend that level and look for
 

5653
02:00:55,760 --> 02:01:00,093
to defend that level and look for
expansion lower.

5654
02:01:00,093 --> 02:01:00,103

5657
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:05,830

50 minutes left, folks. We're going to

5658
02:01:05,830 --> 02:01:05,840
50 minutes left, folks. We're going to
 

5659
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:09,830
50 minutes left, folks. We're going to
do an Apex giveaway as well.

5660
02:01:09,830 --> 02:01:09,840
do an Apex giveaway as well.
 

5661
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:12,950
do an Apex giveaway as well.
Thanks for all the new uh new people

Thanks for all the new uh new people

learning, getting some nice trades as we
 

5667
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:19,270
learning, getting some nice trades as we
go. Not the easiest model today. They

5668
02:01:19,270 --> 02:01:19,280
go. Not the easiest model today. They
 

5669
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:20,950
go. Not the easiest model today. They
made it a little bit tricky not taking

5670
02:01:20,950 --> 02:01:20,960
made it a little bit tricky not taking
 

5671
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:23,030
made it a little bit tricky not taking
the liquidity at the highs and fuffing

5672
02:01:23,030 --> 02:01:23,040
the liquidity at the highs and fuffing
 

5673
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:25,350
the liquidity at the highs and fuffing
around in that gray box for so long, but

5674
02:01:25,350 --> 02:01:25,360
around in that gray box for so long, but
 

5675
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:31,669
around in that gray box for so long, but
we are now starting to see expansion.

5676
02:01:31,669 --> 02:01:31,679

 

5677
02:01:31,679 --> 02:01:33,750

All good, Joe. No, look, there's no

5678
02:01:33,750 --> 02:01:33,760
All good, Joe. No, look, there's no
 

5679
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:35,990
All good, Joe. No, look, there's no
stupid questions in this stream, man.

5680
02:01:35,990 --> 02:01:36,000
stupid questions in this stream, man.
 

5681
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:47,669
stupid questions in this stream, man.
Ask away. No stupid questions.

5682
02:01:47,669 --> 02:01:47,679

 

5683
02:01:47,679 --> 02:01:49,030

This is the level we just talked about

5684
02:01:49,030 --> 02:01:49,040
This is the level we just talked about
 

5685
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:50,470
This is the level we just talked about
that buyers need to defend this little

5686
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:50,480
that buyers need to defend this little
 

5687
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:52,149
that buyers need to defend this little
shelf. And this is the rotation we just

5688
02:01:52,149 --> 02:01:52,159
shelf. And this is the rotation we just
 

5689
02:01:52,159 --> 02:01:53,910
shelf. And this is the rotation we just
talked about. So if we just just put

5690
02:01:53,910 --> 02:01:53,920
talked about. So if we just just put
 

5691
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,109
talked about. So if we just just put
this in here. Buyers are trying to

5692
02:01:55,109 --> 02:01:55,119
this in here. Buyers are trying to
 

5693
02:01:55,119 --> 02:01:57,669
this in here. Buyers are trying to
defend this.

5694
02:01:57,669 --> 02:01:57,679
defend this.
 

5695
02:01:57,679 --> 02:02:01,910
defend this.
And I'd say 57s,

5696
02:02:01,910 --> 02:02:01,920

 

5697
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:04,229

right? They don't want it below 57s. The

5698
02:02:04,229 --> 02:02:04,239
right? They don't want it below 57s. The
 

5699
02:02:04,239 --> 02:02:05,589
right? They don't want it below 57s. The
reason I'm saying that is it's all

5700
02:02:05,589 --> 02:02:05,599
reason I'm saying that is it's all
 

5701
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:07,910
reason I'm saying that is it's all
sellside delta underneath that. Buyers

5702
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:07,920
sellside delta underneath that. Buyers
 

5703
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:09,830
sellside delta underneath that. Buyers
need to defend that gray box there if

5704
02:02:09,830 --> 02:02:09,840
need to defend that gray box there if
 

5705
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:11,430
need to defend that gray box there if
they've got a hope of going higher. I

5706
02:02:11,430 --> 02:02:11,440
they've got a hope of going higher. I
 

5707
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:13,030
they've got a hope of going higher. I
wouldn't be buying this today. You

5708
02:02:13,030 --> 02:02:13,040
wouldn't be buying this today. You
 

5709
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:14,390
wouldn't be buying this today. You
counter trend even though low hanging

5710
02:02:14,390 --> 02:02:14,400
counter trend even though low hanging
 

5711
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,070
counter trend even though low hanging
fruit's gone. But if they're going to

5712
02:02:16,070 --> 02:02:16,080
fruit's gone. But if they're going to
 

5713
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:17,910
fruit's gone. But if they're going to
buy, that gray box is where they need to

5714
02:02:17,910 --> 02:02:17,920
buy, that gray box is where they need to
 

5715
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:20,709
buy, that gray box is where they need to
buy under that.

5716
02:02:20,709 --> 02:02:20,719
buy under that.
 

5717
02:02:20,719 --> 02:02:23,030
buy under that.
Like I say, good night, sweetheart. Or

5718
02:02:23,030 --> 02:02:23,040
Like I say, good night, sweetheart. Or
 

5719
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:24,870
Like I say, good night, sweetheart. Or
any of my older English friends, maybe

5720
02:02:24,870 --> 02:02:24,880
any of my older English friends, maybe
 

5721
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:26,790
any of my older English friends, maybe
you watched that back in the day. Great

5722
02:02:26,790 --> 02:02:26,800
you watched that back in the day. Great
 

5723
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:37,270
you watched that back in the day. Great
show.

5724
02:02:37,270 --> 02:02:37,280

 

5725
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:41,750

Your value area low is 263. Well,

5726
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:41,760
Your value area low is 263. Well,
 

5727
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:43,830
Your value area low is 263. Well,
that's 100. And even if you were on

5728
02:02:43,830 --> 02:02:43,840
that's 100. And even if you were on
 

5729
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:48,550
that's 100. And even if you were on
here, that's considerably higher.

5730
02:02:48,550 --> 02:02:48,560
here, that's considerably higher.
 

5731
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:51,750
here, that's considerably higher.
Previous day value low is 222.

5732
02:02:51,750 --> 02:02:51,760
Previous day value low is 222.
 

5733
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:54,149
Previous day value low is 222.
Current day value low, which is

5734
02:02:54,149 --> 02:02:54,159
Current day value low, which is
 

5735
02:02:54,159 --> 02:02:55,669
Current day value low, which is
adjusting based on tick, is actually

5736
02:02:55,669 --> 02:02:55,679
adjusting based on tick, is actually
 

5737
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:57,830
adjusting based on tick, is actually
115. So, this has got to catch up, but

5738
02:02:57,830 --> 02:02:57,840
115. So, this has got to catch up, but
 

5739
02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:00,310
115. So, this has got to catch up, but
it's actually here 115. Here you go. So

5740
02:03:00,310 --> 02:03:00,320
it's actually here 115. Here you go. So
 

5741
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:02,629
it's actually here 115. Here you go. So
buyers are failing to take control of

5742
02:03:02,629 --> 02:03:02,639
buyers are failing to take control of
 

5743
02:03:02,639 --> 02:03:04,229
buyers are failing to take control of
the market here. We're testing that

5744
02:03:04,229 --> 02:03:04,239
the market here. We're testing that
 

5745
02:03:04,239 --> 02:03:05,750
the market here. We're testing that
delta level I just talked about, the

5746
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:05,760
delta level I just talked about, the
 

5747
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:08,629
delta level I just talked about, the
edge of that gray box, 56. Underneath

5748
02:03:08,629 --> 02:03:08,639
edge of that gray box, 56. Underneath
 

5749
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:11,270
edge of that gray box, 56. Underneath
that, it is all sellers that are stuck.

5750
02:03:11,270 --> 02:03:11,280
that, it is all sellers that are stuck.
 

5751
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:13,189
that, it is all sellers that are stuck.
If we get acceptance back into there, we

5752
02:03:13,189 --> 02:03:13,199
If we get acceptance back into there, we
 

5753
02:03:13,199 --> 02:03:17,750
If we get acceptance back into there, we
will probably make a new low.

5754
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:17,760

 

5755
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:19,990

They are not done with this. They are

5756
02:03:19,990 --> 02:03:20,000
They are not done with this. They are
 

5757
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,550
They are not done with this. They are
not done with this by the looks of it.

5758
02:03:22,550 --> 02:03:22,560
not done with this by the looks of it.
 

5759
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:24,470
not done with this by the looks of it.
So value area low was defended. This

5760
02:03:24,470 --> 02:03:24,480
So value area low was defended. This
 

5761
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:25,990
So value area low was defended. This
white line on the screen, you can see

5762
02:03:25,990 --> 02:03:26,000
white line on the screen, you can see
 

5763
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,510
white line on the screen, you can see
how accurate these levels are. white

5764
02:03:27,510 --> 02:03:27,520
how accurate these levels are. white
 

5765
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:30,070
how accurate these levels are. white
line defended back into gray box. If

5766
02:03:30,070 --> 02:03:30,080
line defended back into gray box. If
 

5767
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:31,750
line defended back into gray box. If
they resell this gray box, we will

5768
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:31,760
they resell this gray box, we will
 

5769
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:34,709
they resell this gray box, we will
probably make all a new low because all

5770
02:03:34,709 --> 02:03:34,719
probably make all a new low because all
 

5771
02:03:34,719 --> 02:03:36,790
probably make all a new low because all
the sellers who are stuck here are going

5772
02:03:36,790 --> 02:03:36,800
the sellers who are stuck here are going
 

5773
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:41,270
the sellers who are stuck here are going
to be let out.

5774
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:41,280

 

5775
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:43,350

We just got to watch here. Big sellers

5776
02:03:43,350 --> 02:03:43,360
We just got to watch here. Big sellers
 

5777
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:47,430
We just got to watch here. Big sellers
came in here at 49. So 56 and 49 are the

5778
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:47,440
came in here at 49. So 56 and 49 are the
 

5779
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:49,189
came in here at 49. So 56 and 49 are the
levels for sellers now to defend. They

5780
02:03:49,189 --> 02:03:49,199
levels for sellers now to defend. They
 

5781
02:03:49,199 --> 02:03:51,750
levels for sellers now to defend. They
will not want a reclaim of those levels.

5782
02:03:51,750 --> 02:03:51,760
will not want a reclaim of those levels.
 

5783
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:55,589
will not want a reclaim of those levels.
Big big seller came in here 89 s 4950.

5784
02:03:55,589 --> 02:03:55,599
Big big seller came in here 89 s 4950.
 

5785
02:03:55,599 --> 02:03:57,030
Big big seller came in here 89 s 4950.
We're testing him. He will want to

5786
02:03:57,030 --> 02:03:57,040
We're testing him. He will want to
 

5787
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:59,189
We're testing him. He will want to
resell this down. He will not want to

5788
02:03:59,189 --> 02:03:59,199
resell this down. He will not want to
 

5789
02:03:59,199 --> 02:04:01,430
resell this down. He will not want to
get caught here selling the lows. I

5790
02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:01,440
get caught here selling the lows. I
 

5791
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:02,870
get caught here selling the lows. I
mean, I would not be selling these lows.

5792
02:04:02,870 --> 02:04:02,880
mean, I would not be selling these lows.
 

5793
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:04,550
mean, I would not be selling these lows.
It's psychopath, but they are trying to

5794
02:04:04,550 --> 02:04:04,560
It's psychopath, but they are trying to
 

5795
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:07,990
It's psychopath, but they are trying to
sell these lows.

5796
02:04:07,990 --> 02:04:08,000

 

5797
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,629

Do we have divergence there to ES? I

5798
02:04:10,629 --> 02:04:10,639
Do we have divergence there to ES? I
 

5799
02:04:10,639 --> 02:04:12,790
Do we have divergence there to ES? I
think we do. Yes, we do. So, ES made a

5800
02:04:12,790 --> 02:04:12,800
think we do. Yes, we do. So, ES made a
 

5801
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:14,229
think we do. Yes, we do. So, ES made a
new low there, folks. So, slight

5802
02:04:14,229 --> 02:04:14,239
new low there, folks. So, slight
 

5803
02:04:14,239 --> 02:04:17,589
new low there, folks. So, slight
divergence there be aware of.

5804
02:04:17,589 --> 02:04:17,599
divergence there be aware of.
 

5805
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:19,430
divergence there be aware of.
If we don't go lower, do I think we go

5806
02:04:19,430 --> 02:04:19,440
If we don't go lower, do I think we go
 

5807
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:22,070
If we don't go lower, do I think we go
back to 300

5808
02:04:22,070 --> 02:04:22,080
back to 300
 

5809
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:26,310
back to 300
uh today?

5810
02:04:26,310 --> 02:04:26,320

 

5811
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:28,790

unlikely. I think we probably make a

5812
02:04:28,790 --> 02:04:28,800
unlikely. I think we probably make a
 

5813
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:32,310
unlikely. I think we probably make a
B-shaped profile.

5814
02:04:32,310 --> 02:04:32,320
B-shaped profile.
 

5815
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:34,070
B-shaped profile.
I think what you probably get like a

5816
02:04:34,070 --> 02:04:34,080
I think what you probably get like a
 

5817
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:35,990
I think what you probably get like a
double distribution, I would imagine. If

5818
02:04:35,990 --> 02:04:36,000
double distribution, I would imagine. If
 

5819
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,149
double distribution, I would imagine. If
we don't go lower, I think what you

5820
02:04:38,149 --> 02:04:38,159
we don't go lower, I think what you
 

5821
02:04:38,159 --> 02:04:39,910
we don't go lower, I think what you
probably get is like this distribution

5822
02:04:39,910 --> 02:04:39,920
probably get is like this distribution
 

5823
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:41,910
probably get is like this distribution
here and this starting to thicken up and

5824
02:04:41,910 --> 02:04:41,920
here and this starting to thicken up and
 

5825
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:43,669
here and this starting to thicken up and
something like this and like a rotation

5826
02:04:43,669 --> 02:04:43,679
something like this and like a rotation
 

5827
02:04:43,679 --> 02:04:45,990
something like this and like a rotation
for a day.

5828
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:46,000
for a day.
 

5829
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,750
for a day.
If we don't go lower, if we break, then

5830
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:47,760
If we don't go lower, if we break, then
 

5831
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:49,189
If we don't go lower, if we break, then
obviously we're going to leave the shelf

5832
02:04:49,189 --> 02:04:49,199
obviously we're going to leave the shelf
 

5833
02:04:49,199 --> 02:04:50,950
obviously we're going to leave the shelf
and this is still the target down here.

5834
02:04:50,950 --> 02:04:50,960
and this is still the target down here.
 

5835
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:53,109
and this is still the target down here.
So, what did we say? 25,000 is a big

5836
02:04:53,109 --> 02:04:53,119
So, what did we say? 25,000 is a big
 

5837
02:04:53,119 --> 02:04:55,030
So, what did we say? 25,000 is a big
target. whole number and it's the uh

5838
02:04:55,030 --> 02:04:55,040
target. whole number and it's the uh
 

5839
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:57,750
target. whole number and it's the uh
little sort of uh high volume node, the

5840
02:04:57,750 --> 02:04:57,760
little sort of uh high volume node, the
 

5841
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:59,270
little sort of uh high volume node, the
micro high volume node. Think about the

5842
02:04:59,270 --> 02:04:59,280
micro high volume node. Think about the
 

5843
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:01,910
micro high volume node. Think about the
daily profile based on the year. We have

5844
02:05:01,910 --> 02:05:01,920
daily profile based on the year. We have
 

5845
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:03,510
daily profile based on the year. We have
a little thing like this and then we

5846
02:05:03,510 --> 02:05:03,520
a little thing like this and then we
 

5847
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:05,589
a little thing like this and then we
have nothing until we get like this. All

5848
02:05:05,589 --> 02:05:05,599
have nothing until we get like this. All
 

5849
02:05:05,599 --> 02:05:07,270
have nothing until we get like this. All
right, so if this was a yearly profile,

5850
02:05:07,270 --> 02:05:07,280
right, so if this was a yearly profile,
 

5851
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:09,189
right, so if this was a yearly profile,
this is what it would look like. So we

5852
02:05:09,189 --> 02:05:09,199
this is what it would look like. So we
 

5853
02:05:09,199 --> 02:05:11,270
this is what it would look like. So we
can mark this out. I'll put a little box

5854
02:05:11,270 --> 02:05:11,280
can mark this out. I'll put a little box
 

5855
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:13,350
can mark this out. I'll put a little box
in here. Sorry guys, I've got building

5856
02:05:13,350 --> 02:05:13,360
in here. Sorry guys, I've got building
 

5857
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:14,790
in here. Sorry guys, I've got building
worked outside my house right now.

5858
02:05:14,790 --> 02:05:14,800
worked outside my house right now.
 

5859
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:16,070
worked outside my house right now.
Hopefully that's not too loud for you

5860
02:05:16,070 --> 02:05:16,080
Hopefully that's not too loud for you
 

5861
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:18,870
Hopefully that's not too loud for you
guys. It's pretty annoying, right?

5862
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:18,880
guys. It's pretty annoying, right?
 

5863
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:20,870
guys. It's pretty annoying, right?
Right. So, I'd say here is a high volume

5864
02:05:20,870 --> 02:05:20,880
Right. So, I'd say here is a high volume
 

5865
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:23,589
Right. So, I'd say here is a high volume
node on the yearly

5866
02:05:23,589 --> 02:05:23,599
node on the yearly
 

5867
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:25,750
node on the yearly
and here's the break. So, sellers taking

5868
02:05:25,750 --> 02:05:25,760
and here's the break. So, sellers taking
 

5869
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:27,030
and here's the break. So, sellers taking
control and now they're going to look

5870
02:05:27,030 --> 02:05:27,040
control and now they're going to look
 

5871
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:29,109
control and now they're going to look
for 25,000. Like I said, I would not be

5872
02:05:29,109 --> 02:05:29,119
for 25,000. Like I said, I would not be
 

5873
02:05:29,119 --> 02:05:31,270
for 25,000. Like I said, I would not be
a buyer in this market. Like your

5874
02:05:31,270 --> 02:05:31,280
a buyer in this market. Like your
 

5875
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:34,149
a buyer in this market. Like your
counter trend if you're buying today and

5876
02:05:34,149 --> 02:05:34,159
counter trend if you're buying today and
 

5877
02:05:34,159 --> 02:05:36,149
counter trend if you're buying today and
how they act into here will be key. And

5878
02:05:36,149 --> 02:05:36,159
how they act into here will be key. And
 

5879
02:05:36,159 --> 02:05:37,750
how they act into here will be key. And
if they break that, there's nothing

5880
02:05:37,750 --> 02:05:37,760
if they break that, there's nothing
 

5881
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:52,709
if they break that, there's nothing
really until we get down into here.

5882
02:05:52,709 --> 02:05:52,719

 

5883
02:05:52,719 --> 02:05:54,470

I still watch Good Night Sweetheart now.

5884
02:05:54,470 --> 02:05:54,480
I still watch Good Night Sweetheart now.
 

5885
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:55,910
I still watch Good Night Sweetheart now.
Great show. Shame they never bought it

5886
02:05:55,910 --> 02:05:55,920
Great show. Shame they never bought it
 

5887
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:57,669
Great show. Shame they never bought it
back off the the one-off episode in

5888
02:05:57,669 --> 02:05:57,679
back off the the one-off episode in
 

5889
02:05:57,679 --> 02:05:59,589
back off the the one-off episode in
2016. I never I didn't even know there

5890
02:05:59,589 --> 02:05:59,599
2016. I never I didn't even know there
 

5891
02:05:59,599 --> 02:06:01,830
2016. I never I didn't even know there
was a one-off episode in 2016. I'd love

5892
02:06:01,830 --> 02:06:01,840
was a one-off episode in 2016. I'd love
 

5893
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:03,910
was a one-off episode in 2016. I'd love
to watch that. Maybe I'll check that

5894
02:06:03,910 --> 02:06:03,920
to watch that. Maybe I'll check that
 

5895
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:07,910
to watch that. Maybe I'll check that
out. Okay, here we come. 25K coming up.

5896
02:06:07,910 --> 02:06:07,920
out. Okay, here we come. 25K coming up.
 

5897
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:09,910
out. Okay, here we come. 25K coming up.
And under that, really only looking at

5898
02:06:09,910 --> 02:06:09,920
And under that, really only looking at
 

5899
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:11,109
And under that, really only looking at
800. I don't know if any of you

5900
02:06:11,109 --> 02:06:11,119
800. I don't know if any of you
 

5901
02:06:11,119 --> 02:06:14,229
800. I don't know if any of you
reshorted uh this move into current

5902
02:06:14,229 --> 02:06:14,239
reshorted uh this move into current
 

5903
02:06:14,239 --> 02:06:16,550
reshorted uh this move into current
value area low on the session, but

5904
02:06:16,550 --> 02:06:16,560
value area low on the session, but
 

5905
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:18,470
value area low on the session, but
here's your 25,000. So, you better be

5906
02:06:18,470 --> 02:06:18,480
here's your 25,000. So, you better be
 

5907
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:21,430
here's your 25,000. So, you better be
covering some into 25,000. If you get

5908
02:06:21,430 --> 02:06:21,440
covering some into 25,000. If you get
 

5909
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:23,189
covering some into 25,000. If you get
800 today, I'll be very, very happy. I'm

5910
02:06:23,189 --> 02:06:23,199
800 today, I'll be very, very happy. I'm
 

5911
02:06:23,199 --> 02:06:24,229
800 today, I'll be very, very happy. I'm
going to have to find a way of getting

5912
02:06:24,229 --> 02:06:24,239
going to have to find a way of getting
 

5913
02:06:24,239 --> 02:06:27,350
going to have to find a way of getting
involved if we're going to do that.

5914
02:06:27,350 --> 02:06:27,360
involved if we're going to do that.
 

5915
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:28,950
involved if we're going to do that.
So, a little reaction here in front of

5916
02:06:28,950 --> 02:06:28,960
So, a little reaction here in front of
 

5917
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:34,390
So, a little reaction here in front of
that 25,000.

5918
02:06:34,390 --> 02:06:34,400

 

5919
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:35,830

Sellers got caught down there into the

5920
02:06:35,830 --> 02:06:35,840
Sellers got caught down there into the
 

5921
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:38,709
Sellers got caught down there into the
lows. They missed 25K by like 10 points.

5922
02:06:38,709 --> 02:06:38,719
lows. They missed 25K by like 10 points.
 

5923
02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:44,550
lows. They missed 25K by like 10 points.
It's pretty big reaction here.

5924
02:06:44,550 --> 02:06:44,560

 

5925
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:48,550

So, sellers came flying in 14s and 10

5926
02:06:48,550 --> 02:06:48,560
So, sellers came flying in 14s and 10
 

5927
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:58,950
So, sellers came flying in 14s and 10
here. I still want it to hit that 25K.

5928
02:06:58,950 --> 02:06:58,960

 

5929
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:01,189

Come on, market. Down you come. Come and

5930
02:07:01,189 --> 02:07:01,199
Come on, market. Down you come. Come and
 

5931
02:07:01,199 --> 02:07:22,310
Come on, market. Down you come. Come and
take out all the liquidity.

Why can't I say that? You're welcome.

5938
02:07:27,990 --> 02:07:28,000
Why can't I say that? You're welcome.
 

5939

Why can't I say that? You're welcome.
It's the only way to be with trading. We

5940
02:07:29,910 --> 02:07:29,920
It's the only way to be with trading. We
 

5941
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:32,149
It's the only way to be with trading. We
can't uh you're not detail orientated. I

5942
02:07:32,149 --> 02:07:32,159
can't uh you're not detail orientated. I
 

5943
02:07:32,159 --> 02:07:33,990
can't uh you're not detail orientated. I
don't know what you're doing. Kind of

5944
02:07:33,990 --> 02:07:34,000
don't know what you're doing. Kind of
 

5945
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,350
don't know what you're doing. Kind of
risky, but I'm sure there's plenty of

5946
02:07:35,350 --> 02:07:35,360
risky, but I'm sure there's plenty of
 

5947
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:38,870
risky, but I'm sure there's plenty of
YouTube out YouTubers out there who uh

5948
02:07:38,870 --> 02:07:38,880
YouTube out YouTubers out there who uh
 

5949
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:41,350
YouTube out YouTubers out there who uh
are not. No sellers down there under 14.

5950
02:07:41,350 --> 02:07:41,360
are not. No sellers down there under 14.
 

5951
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:43,910
are not. No sellers down there under 14.
Still stuck right now. I still think we

5952
02:07:43,910 --> 02:07:43,920
Still stuck right now. I still think we
 

5953
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:46,950
Still stuck right now. I still think we
should trade lower, but uh look,

5954
02:07:46,950 --> 02:07:46,960
should trade lower, but uh look,
 

5955
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:48,310
should trade lower, but uh look,
can only say what I'm seeing on the

5956
02:07:48,310 --> 02:07:48,320
can only say what I'm seeing on the
 

5957
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:49,589
can only say what I'm seeing on the
tape. I still think we should trade

5958
02:07:49,589 --> 02:07:49,599
tape. I still think we should trade
 

5959
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:51,910
tape. I still think we should trade
lower, but what I'm seeing right now is

5960
02:07:51,910 --> 02:07:51,920
lower, but what I'm seeing right now is
 

5961
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:53,990
lower, but what I'm seeing right now is
there were a few of them caught at 14.

5962
02:07:53,990 --> 02:07:54,000
there were a few of them caught at 14.
 

5963
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,149
there were a few of them caught at 14.
The big sellers came in at You can mark

5964
02:07:56,149 --> 02:07:56,159
The big sellers came in at You can mark
 

5965
02:07:56,159 --> 02:07:59,830
The big sellers came in at You can mark
these levels above you. 20,50 20,56.

5966
02:07:59,830 --> 02:07:59,840
these levels above you. 20,50 20,56.
 

5967
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:01,270
these levels above you. 20,50 20,56.
That's where the big sellers came flying

5968
02:08:01,270 --> 02:08:01,280
That's where the big sellers came flying
 

5969
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:03,830
That's where the big sellers came flying
in. So, they don't get squeezed out

5970
02:08:03,830 --> 02:08:03,840
in. So, they don't get squeezed out
 

5971
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,430
in. So, they don't get squeezed out
until we get above back above them,

5972
02:08:05,430 --> 02:08:05,440
until we get above back above them,
 

5973
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:08,069
until we get above back above them,
right? So, sellers still in control. We

5974
02:08:08,069 --> 02:08:08,079
right? So, sellers still in control. We
 

5975
02:08:08,079 --> 02:08:10,069
right? So, sellers still in control. We
can very well come and test where those

5976
02:08:10,069 --> 02:08:10,079
can very well come and test where those
 

5977
02:08:10,079 --> 02:08:11,430
can very well come and test where those
big sellers came in, which is what we're

5978
02:08:11,430 --> 02:08:11,440
big sellers came in, which is what we're
 

5979
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:12,470
big sellers came in, which is what we're
trying to do now. So, we're going to

5980
02:08:12,470 --> 02:08:12,480
trying to do now. So, we're going to
 

5981
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:14,950
trying to do now. So, we're going to
come back up to 50 and 56 and see if

5982
02:08:14,950 --> 02:08:14,960
come back up to 50 and 56 and see if
 

5983
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:16,470
come back up to 50 and 56 and see if
these sellers reload here. If they if

5984
02:08:16,470 --> 02:08:16,480
these sellers reload here. If they if
 

5985
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:17,990
these sellers reload here. If they if
they get squeezed out here, we can go

5986
02:08:17,990 --> 02:08:18,000
they get squeezed out here, we can go
 

5987
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,910
they get squeezed out here, we can go
back up towards value area low on the

5988
02:08:19,910 --> 02:08:19,920
back up towards value area low on the
 

5989
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:22,229
back up towards value area low on the
date, which is basically just above 100.

5990
02:08:22,229 --> 02:08:22,239
date, which is basically just above 100.
 

5991
02:08:22,239 --> 02:08:24,550
date, which is basically just above 100.
So, we're testing those 50s and 56s

5992
02:08:24,550 --> 02:08:24,560
So, we're testing those 50s and 56s
 

5993
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:26,790
So, we're testing those 50s and 56s
where those sellers last came in. See if

5994
02:08:26,790 --> 02:08:26,800
where those sellers last came in. See if
 

5995
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:28,709
where those sellers last came in. See if
they refresh sell this. The answer

5996
02:08:28,709 --> 02:08:28,719
they refresh sell this. The answer
 

5997
02:08:28,719 --> 02:08:30,550
they refresh sell this. The answer
currently is yes, they are trying to

5998
02:08:30,550 --> 02:08:30,560
currently is yes, they are trying to
 

5999
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:31,990
currently is yes, they are trying to
refresh sell it. We have not seen much

6000
02:08:31,990 --> 02:08:32,000
refresh sell it. We have not seen much
 

6001
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,069
refresh sell it. We have not seen much
liquidity.

6002
02:08:34,069 --> 02:08:34,079
liquidity.
 

6003
02:08:34,079 --> 02:08:35,430
liquidity.
Watching the book to see if someone

6004
02:08:35,430 --> 02:08:35,440
Watching the book to see if someone
 

6005
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:38,470
Watching the book to see if someone
jumps in here. Not seeing much yet. They

6006
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:38,480
jumps in here. Not seeing much yet. They
 

6007
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:41,030
jumps in here. Not seeing much yet. They
might get squeezed out here. Here's the

6008
02:08:41,030 --> 02:08:41,040
might get squeezed out here. Here's the
 

6009
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:43,030
might get squeezed out here. Here's the
56s.

6010
02:08:43,030 --> 02:08:43,040
56s.
 

6011
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:44,629
56s.
This is where they need to defend. These

6012
02:08:44,629 --> 02:08:44,639
This is where they need to defend. These
 

6013
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:46,950
This is where they need to defend. These
sellers will need to defend this level.

6014
02:08:46,950 --> 02:08:46,960
sellers will need to defend this level.
 

6015
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:48,390
sellers will need to defend this level.
There we go. They come back in. There

6016
02:08:48,390 --> 02:08:48,400
There we go. They come back in. There
 

6017
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:50,709
There we go. They come back in. There
you go. So, it was a ride to 56s.

6018
02:08:50,709 --> 02:08:50,719
you go. So, it was a ride to 56s.
 

6019
02:08:50,719 --> 02:08:52,470
you go. So, it was a ride to 56s.
Couldn't been more accurate if I tried.

6020
02:08:52,470 --> 02:08:52,480
Couldn't been more accurate if I tried.
 

6021
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:55,350
Couldn't been more accurate if I tried.
We got to 58. Sorry. But you can see

6022
02:08:55,350 --> 02:08:55,360
We got to 58. Sorry. But you can see
 

6023
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:57,270
We got to 58. Sorry. But you can see
that's where they needed to defend. 50s

6024
02:08:57,270 --> 02:08:57,280
that's where they needed to defend. 50s
 

6025
02:08:57,280 --> 02:08:59,669
that's where they needed to defend. 50s
to 56s. So, there's still a passive

6026
02:08:59,669 --> 02:08:59,679
to 56s. So, there's still a passive
 

6027
02:08:59,679 --> 02:09:01,910
to 56s. So, there's still a passive
seller up there right now. Willing to

6028
02:09:01,910 --> 02:09:01,920
seller up there right now. Willing to
 

6029
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:11,830
seller up there right now. Willing to
defend that level.

6030
02:09:11,830 --> 02:09:11,840

 

6031
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:14,790

You are seeing uh positive cumulative

6032
02:09:14,790 --> 02:09:14,800
You are seeing uh positive cumulative
 

6033
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:17,030
You are seeing uh positive cumulative
delta trying to come into the tape off

6034
02:09:17,030 --> 02:09:17,040
delta trying to come into the tape off
 

6035
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:19,270
delta trying to come into the tape off
the lows here. We had divergence at low

6036
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:19,280
the lows here. We had divergence at low
 

6037
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:22,069
the lows here. We had divergence at low
of day. So delta didn't make a new low.

6038
02:09:22,069 --> 02:09:22,079
of day. So delta didn't make a new low.
 

6039
02:09:22,079 --> 02:09:25,430
of day. So delta didn't make a new low.
Price did make a new low.

6040
02:09:25,430 --> 02:09:25,440
Price did make a new low.
 

6041
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:27,030
Price did make a new low.
Think about that in terms of who's

6042
02:09:27,030 --> 02:09:27,040
Think about that in terms of who's
 

6043
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:28,790
Think about that in terms of who's
passive, who's aggressive. You're seeing

6044
02:09:28,790 --> 02:09:28,800
passive, who's aggressive. You're seeing
 

6045
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:30,790
passive, who's aggressive. You're seeing
more aggressive buying up here and we

6046
02:09:30,790 --> 02:09:30,800
more aggressive buying up here and we
 

6047
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:33,030
more aggressive buying up here and we
are absorbing it sell side at the

6048
02:09:33,030 --> 02:09:33,040
are absorbing it sell side at the
 

6049
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:38,069
are absorbing it sell side at the
moment. I'd say those 56s is key.

6050
02:09:38,069 --> 02:09:38,079
moment. I'd say those 56s is key.
 

6051
02:09:38,079 --> 02:09:40,310
moment. I'd say those 56s is key.
Tapping back into it again. These 56s,

6052
02:09:40,310 --> 02:09:40,320
Tapping back into it again. These 56s,
 

6053
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:42,390
Tapping back into it again. These 56s,
56s. Those sellers will want to defend

6054
02:09:42,390 --> 02:09:42,400
56s. Those sellers will want to defend
 

6055
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:45,030
56s. Those sellers will want to defend
this. They will not want this over 56s.

6056
02:09:45,030 --> 02:09:45,040
this. They will not want this over 56s.
 

6057
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:46,950
this. They will not want this over 56s.
If it gets over these 56s, you might get

6058
02:09:46,950 --> 02:09:46,960
If it gets over these 56s, you might get
 

6059
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:49,189
If it gets over these 56s, you might get
some of those bigger guys forced to

6060
02:09:49,189 --> 02:09:49,199
some of those bigger guys forced to
 

6061
02:09:49,199 --> 02:09:54,950
some of those bigger guys forced to
cover.

6062
02:09:54,950 --> 02:09:54,960

 

6063
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:56,870

They're trying to get over 56. There's a

6064
02:09:56,870 --> 02:09:56,880
They're trying to get over 56. There's a
 

6065
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:58,870
They're trying to get over 56. There's a
little node here at 65s. I think over

6066
02:09:58,870 --> 02:09:58,880
little node here at 65s. I think over
 

6067
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:01,510
little node here at 65s. I think over
that there's a squeeze. I would not play

6068
02:10:01,510 --> 02:10:01,520
that there's a squeeze. I would not play
 

6069
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:02,950
that there's a squeeze. I would not play
this long. I'm just telling you what I'm

6070
02:10:02,950 --> 02:10:02,960
this long. I'm just telling you what I'm
 

6071
02:10:02,960 --> 02:10:04,709
this long. I'm just telling you what I'm
seeing. Like if you want to play it long

6072
02:10:04,709 --> 02:10:04,719
seeing. Like if you want to play it long
 

6073
02:10:04,719 --> 02:10:06,149
seeing. Like if you want to play it long
and you're a counter trend trader, by

6074
02:10:06,149 --> 02:10:06,159
and you're a counter trend trader, by
 

6075
02:10:06,159 --> 02:10:07,830
and you're a counter trend trader, by
all means, but I'm just going to tell

6076
02:10:07,830 --> 02:10:07,840
all means, but I'm just going to tell
 

6077
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:09,189
all means, but I'm just going to tell
you what I'm seeing at this point. We're

6078
02:10:09,189 --> 02:10:09,199
you what I'm seeing at this point. We're
 

6079
02:10:09,199 --> 02:10:11,030
you what I'm seeing at this point. We're
tapping into that high volume node of 65

6080
02:10:11,030 --> 02:10:11,040
tapping into that high volume node of 65
 

6081
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:12,470
tapping into that high volume node of 65
over that. There is a squeeze

6082
02:10:12,470 --> 02:10:12,480
over that. There is a squeeze
 

6083
02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:14,790
over that. There is a squeeze
potentially all the way back up to 100.

6084
02:10:14,790 --> 02:10:14,800
potentially all the way back up to 100.
 

6085
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:17,189
potentially all the way back up to 100.
Here it goes.

6086
02:10:17,189 --> 02:10:17,199
Here it goes.
 

6087
02:10:17,199 --> 02:10:18,870
Here it goes.
Tempted to jump in a bit on an email,

6088
02:10:18,870 --> 02:10:18,880
Tempted to jump in a bit on an email,
 

6089
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:20,870
Tempted to jump in a bit on an email,
but

6090
02:10:20,870 --> 02:10:20,880
but
 

6091
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:23,589
but
here it goes, folks. So, over the 56s

6092
02:10:23,589 --> 02:10:23,599
here it goes, folks. So, over the 56s
 

6093
02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:25,830
here it goes, folks. So, over the 56s
all the time, we're over 50s. 56s. Those

6094
02:10:25,830 --> 02:10:25,840
all the time, we're over 50s. 56s. Those
 

6095
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:28,870
all the time, we're over 50s. 56s. Those
sellers are a little bit stuck. I don't

6096
02:10:28,870 --> 02:10:28,880
sellers are a little bit stuck. I don't
 

6097
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:30,149
sellers are a little bit stuck. I don't
think we finished the auction because we

6098
02:10:30,149 --> 02:10:30,159
think we finished the auction because we
 

6099
02:10:30,159 --> 02:10:32,870
think we finished the auction because we
didn't hit that 25,000. But here we go.

6100
02:10:32,870 --> 02:10:32,880
didn't hit that 25,000. But here we go.
 

6101
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:34,310

02:13:02,870 --> 02:13:02,880
you're going to need to see this and
 

6217
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:04,550
you're going to need to see this and
this and you'd want this little nugget

6218
02:13:04,550 --> 02:13:04,560
this and you'd want this little nugget
 

6219
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:07,030
this and you'd want this little nugget
here and this here to hold if you're

6220
02:13:07,030 --> 02:13:07,040
here and this here to hold if you're
 

6221
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:08,629
here and this here to hold if you're
looking for that break upside just for a

02:13:08,629 --> 02:13:08,639
looking for that break upside just for a
 

6223
02:13:08,639 --> 02:13:11,669
looking for that break upside just for a
reprice right but we've had a big dump

6224
02:13:11,669 --> 02:13:11,679
reprice right but we've had a big dump
 

6225
02:13:11,679 --> 02:13:13,830
reprice right but we've had a big dump
right since the last pullback right if

6226
02:13:13,830 --> 02:13:13,840
right since the last pullback right if
 

6227
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:15,910
right since the last pullback right if
we think if we're going to get relief if

6228
02:13:15,910 --> 02:13:15,920
we think if we're going to get relief if
 

6229
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:18,310
we think if we're going to get relief if
we just think about the swing points

6230
02:13:18,310 --> 02:13:18,320
we just think about the swing points
 

6231
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:20,069
we just think about the swing points
right then we can expect some relief

6232
02:13:20,069 --> 02:13:20,079
right then we can expect some relief
 

6233
02:13:20,079 --> 02:13:22,470
right then we can expect some relief
maybe to 82s which is the look at that

6234
02:13:22,470 --> 02:13:22,480
maybe to 82s which is the look at that
 

6235
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:25,430
maybe to 82s which is the look at that
the 50% retracement is right to the old

6236
02:13:25,430 --> 02:13:25,440
the 50% retracement is right to the old
 

6237
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:27,350
the 50% retracement is right to the old
naked point of control based on the

6238
02:13:27,350 --> 02:13:27,360
naked point of control based on the
 

6239
02:13:27,360 --> 02:13:28,709
naked point of control based on the
current low of day. Let's just move this

6240
02:13:28,709 --> 02:13:28,719
current low of day. Let's just move this
 

6241
02:13:28,719 --> 02:13:30,870
current low of day. Let's just move this
out to 25 cuz I think we might come down

6242
02:13:30,870 --> 02:13:30,880
out to 25 cuz I think we might come down
 

6243
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:32,550
out to 25 cuz I think we might come down
to there. But yeah, there there is

6244
02:13:32,550 --> 02:13:32,560
to there. But yeah, there there is
 

6245
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:34,629
to there. But yeah, there there is
potential for a relief rally. No doubt

6246
02:13:34,629 --> 02:13:34,639
potential for a relief rally. No doubt
 

6247
02:13:34,639 --> 02:13:36,470
potential for a relief rally. No doubt
about it. Timing it will not be easy.

6248
02:13:36,470 --> 02:13:36,480
about it. Timing it will not be easy.
 

6249
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:37,750
about it. Timing it will not be easy.
Counter trend trade is probably the

6250
02:13:37,750 --> 02:13:37,760
Counter trend trade is probably the
 

6251
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:52,149
Counter trend trade is probably the
hardest trade in the book.

6252
02:13:52,149 --> 02:13:52,159

 

6253
02:13:52,159 --> 02:13:54,629

Here we go. So, relief up to the 70s.

6254
02:13:54,629 --> 02:13:54,639
Here we go. So, relief up to the 70s.
 

6255
02:13:54,639 --> 02:13:56,310
Here we go. So, relief up to the 70s.
We've got a little bit of a shelf here.

6256
02:13:56,310 --> 02:13:56,320
We've got a little bit of a shelf here.
 

6257
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:57,830
We've got a little bit of a shelf here.
You can see that. And then we thin out

6258
02:13:57,830 --> 02:13:57,840
You can see that. And then we thin out
 

6259
02:13:57,840 --> 02:14:12,069
You can see that. And then we thin out
to 106s.

6260
02:14:12,069 --> 02:14:12,079

 

6261
02:14:12,079 --> 02:14:14,149

And you're watching ES for a retest of

6262
02:14:14,149 --> 02:14:14,159
And you're watching ES for a retest of
 

6263
02:14:14,159 --> 02:14:16,149
And you're watching ES for a retest of
uh previous day low. SPY is already

6264
02:14:16,149 --> 02:14:16,159
uh previous day low. SPY is already
 

6265
02:14:16,159 --> 02:14:18,709
uh previous day low. SPY is already
retesting it. And the 50-day SPY is

6266
02:14:18,709 --> 02:14:18,719
retesting it. And the 50-day SPY is
 

6267
02:14:18,719 --> 02:14:20,709
retesting it. And the 50-day SPY is
retesting that 75 level. Remember that

6268
02:14:20,709 --> 02:14:20,719
retesting that 75 level. Remember that
 

6269
02:14:20,719 --> 02:14:22,950
retesting that 75 level. Remember that
gamma level at 75 we talked about. Maybe

6270
02:14:22,950 --> 02:14:22,960
gamma level at 75 we talked about. Maybe
 

6271
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:24,550
gamma level at 75 we talked about. Maybe
you get a little bit of a squeeze up to

6272
02:14:24,550 --> 02:14:24,560
you get a little bit of a squeeze up to
 

6273
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:27,270
you get a little bit of a squeeze up to
that value area low which now is at 93.

6274
02:14:27,270 --> 02:14:27,280
that value area low which now is at 93.
 

6275
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:28,870
that value area low which now is at 93.
All right. So value area low has moved

6276
02:14:28,870 --> 02:14:28,880
All right. So value area low has moved
 

6277
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:32,149
All right. So value area low has moved
down to 93.

6278
02:14:32,149 --> 02:14:32,159
down to 93.
 

6279
02:14:32,159 --> 02:14:33,830
down to 93.
All right, just remember Trading View is

6280
02:14:33,830 --> 02:14:33,840
All right, just remember Trading View is
 

6281
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:35,750
All right, just remember Trading View is
lagging slightly.

6282
02:14:35,750 --> 02:14:35,760
lagging slightly.
 

6283
02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:37,669
lagging slightly.
It reads volume slightly differently,

6284
02:14:37,669 --> 02:14:37,679
It reads volume slightly differently,
 

6285
02:14:37,679 --> 02:14:40,550
It reads volume slightly differently,
but value area value area low on the day

6286
02:14:40,550 --> 02:14:40,560
but value area value area low on the day
 

6287
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:42,470
but value area value area low on the day
based on tick volume is currently at

6288
02:14:42,470 --> 02:14:42,480
based on tick volume is currently at
 

6289
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:45,109
based on tick volume is currently at
9293.

6290
02:14:45,109 --> 02:14:45,119
9293.
 

6291
02:14:45,119 --> 02:14:46,709
9293.
So maybe they retest that and you have

6292
02:14:46,709 --> 02:14:46,719
So maybe they retest that and you have
 

6293
02:14:46,719 --> 02:14:51,990
So maybe they retest that and you have
to see if sellers defend it again.

6294
02:14:51,990 --> 02:14:52,000

 

6295
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,430

Lots of things to think about here. Uh

6296
02:14:53,430 --> 02:14:53,440
Lots of things to think about here. Uh
 

6297
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:55,430
Lots of things to think about here. Uh
VIX, by the way, took out the previous

6298
02:14:55,430 --> 02:14:55,440
VIX, by the way, took out the previous
 

6299
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:57,669
VIX, by the way, took out the previous
day high and has traded back inside the

6300
02:14:57,669 --> 02:14:57,679
day high and has traded back inside the
 

6301
02:14:57,679 --> 02:14:59,189
day high and has traded back inside the
range. Just be aware of that. We're

6302
02:14:59,189 --> 02:14:59,199
range. Just be aware of that. We're
 

6303
02:14:59,199 --> 02:15:01,109
range. Just be aware of that. We're
building a shelf here into and around

6304
02:15:01,109 --> 02:15:01,119
building a shelf here into and around
 

6305
02:15:01,119 --> 02:15:03,510
building a shelf here into and around
17. If VIX loses 17s, we trade back down

6306
02:15:03,510 --> 02:15:03,520
17. If VIX loses 17s, we trade back down
 

6307
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:06,390
17. If VIX loses 17s, we trade back down
to 1650. That is the moment you will get

6308
02:15:06,390 --> 02:15:06,400
to 1650. That is the moment you will get
 

6309
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:07,990
to 1650. That is the moment you will get
relief on the market. The VIX is like,

6310
02:15:07,990 --> 02:15:08,000
relief on the market. The VIX is like,
 

6311
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:09,990
relief on the market. The VIX is like,
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, calm down.

6312
02:15:09,990 --> 02:15:10,000
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, calm down.
 

6313
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:18,790
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, calm down.
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

6314
02:15:18,790 --> 02:15:18,800

 

6315
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:20,470

I would not want to be short under

took the breakdown under here once we

6332
02:15:38,069 --> 02:15:38,079
took the breakdown under here once we
 

6333
02:15:38,079 --> 02:15:39,910
took the breakdown under here once we
left this volume or they would have

02:15:39,910 --> 02:15:39,920
left this volume or they would have
 

6335
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:41,589
left this volume or they would have
taken this retest here and the cover

taken this retest here and the cover
 

6337

points were here and here and the runner
 

6339
02:15:44,079 --> 02:15:45,350

is here. And if you get really lucky,

6340
02:15:45,350 --> 02:15:45,360
is here. And if you get really lucky,
 

6341
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:47,109
is here. And if you get really lucky,
it's here. I would not be you're not a

it's here. I would not be you're not a
 

6343
02:15:47,119 --> 02:15:48,790
it's here. I would not be you're not a
new money short down there. Think about

6344
02:15:48,790 --> 02:15:48,800
new money short down there. Think about
 

6345
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:51,030
new money short down there. Think about
value on the day. All right, there's

6346
02:15:51,030 --> 02:15:51,040
value on the day. All right, there's
 

6347
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:54,229
value on the day. All right, there's
value area high. There's value area low.

6348
02:15:54,229 --> 02:15:54,239
value area high. There's value area low.
 

6349
02:15:54,239 --> 02:15:55,910
value area high. There's value area low.
There is point of control. you are

6350
02:15:55,910 --> 02:15:55,920
There is point of control. you are
 

6351
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:58,390
There is point of control. you are
currently at deep deep discount. You do

6352
02:15:58,390 --> 02:15:58,400
currently at deep deep discount. You do
 

6353
02:15:58,400 --> 02:15:59,910
currently at deep deep discount. You do
not want to be a short seller and

6354
02:15:59,910 --> 02:15:59,920
not want to be a short seller and
 

6355
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:03,189
not want to be a short seller and
discount.

6356
02:16:03,189 --> 02:16:03,199

 

6357
02:16:03,199 --> 02:16:04,470

It is more likely that we're going to

6358
02:16:04,470 --> 02:16:04,480
It is more likely that we're going to
 

6359
02:16:04,480 --> 02:16:06,470
It is more likely that we're going to
see relief at this point. It's a shame

6360
02:16:06,470 --> 02:16:06,480
see relief at this point. It's a shame
 

6361
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:07,750
see relief at this point. It's a shame
we haven't taken that out, but it's the

6362
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:07,760
we haven't taken that out, but it's the
 

6363
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:09,270
we haven't taken that out, but it's the
same as we didn't take the high pivot

6364
02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:09,280
same as we didn't take the high pivot
 

6365
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:12,229
same as we didn't take the high pivot
out this morning. And ENQ's just being a

6366
02:16:12,229 --> 02:16:12,239
out this morning. And ENQ's just being a
 

6367
02:16:12,239 --> 02:16:13,750
out this morning. And ENQ's just being a
little bit of a [\h__\h] recently when it

6368
02:16:13,750 --> 02:16:13,760
little bit of a [\h__\h] recently when it
 

6369
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:15,669
little bit of a [\h__\h] recently when it
comes to uh taking liquidity out of the

6370
02:16:15,669 --> 02:16:15,679
comes to uh taking liquidity out of the
 

6371
02:16:15,679 --> 02:16:17,990
comes to uh taking liquidity out of the
game first. But there we go. Okay. Value

6372
02:16:17,990 --> 02:16:18,000
game first. But there we go. Okay. Value
 

6373
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,629
game first. But there we go. Okay. Value
area low here. This white line I put on.

6374
02:16:20,629 --> 02:16:20,639
area low here. This white line I put on.
 

6375
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:22,790
area low here. This white line I put on.
Make sure that's accurate. Uh it's at

6376
02:16:22,790 --> 02:16:22,800
Make sure that's accurate. Uh it's at
 

6377
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:27,990
Make sure that's accurate. Uh it's at
89. Sorry. 89 right here. There we go.

6378
02:16:27,990 --> 02:16:28,000
89. Sorry. 89 right here. There we go.
 

6379
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:29,350
89. Sorry. 89 right here. There we go.
If you're wondering why it's just

6380
02:16:29,350 --> 02:16:29,360
If you're wondering why it's just
 

6381
02:16:29,360 --> 02:16:30,790
If you're wondering why it's just
different on here. All right. So, I'm

6382
02:16:30,790 --> 02:16:30,800
different on here. All right. So, I'm
 

6383
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:32,709
different on here. All right. So, I'm
having to look at both screens, but I

6384
02:16:32,709 --> 02:16:32,719
having to look at both screens, but I
 

6385
02:16:32,719 --> 02:16:37,669
having to look at both screens, but I
trust the value areas uh on Ninja Trader

6386
02:16:37,669 --> 02:16:37,679
trust the value areas uh on Ninja Trader
 

6387
02:16:37,679 --> 02:16:39,750
trust the value areas uh on Ninja Trader
because they're based on tick. All

6388
02:16:39,750 --> 02:16:39,760
because they're based on tick. All
 

6389
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:41,589
because they're based on tick. All
right. So, bulls now. Well, if I was

6390
02:16:41,589 --> 02:16:41,599
right. So, bulls now. Well, if I was
 

6391
02:16:41,599 --> 02:16:43,990
right. So, bulls now. Well, if I was
going to defend bulls, I'd want dips

6392
02:16:43,990 --> 02:16:44,000
going to defend bulls, I'd want dips
 

6393
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:47,110
going to defend bulls, I'd want dips
into 65 and 57s to hold. And I'd want

6394
02:16:47,110 --> 02:16:47,120
into 65 and 57s to hold. And I'd want
 

6395
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:48,709
into 65 and 57s to hold. And I'd want
reclaims. And I think it was Nihal that

6396
02:16:48,709 --> 02:16:48,719
reclaims. And I think it was Nihal that
 

6397
02:16:48,719 --> 02:16:50,709
reclaims. And I think it was Nihal that
was talking about the 110s break above

6398
02:16:50,709 --> 02:16:50,719
was talking about the 110s break above
 

6399
02:16:50,719 --> 02:16:53,509
was talking about the 110s break above
110s and a hold. I would also want that.

6400
02:16:53,509 --> 02:16:53,519
110s and a hold. I would also want that.
 

6401
02:16:53,519 --> 02:16:55,669
110s and a hold. I would also want that.
So here's the squeeze testing value area

6402
02:16:55,669 --> 02:16:55,679
So here's the squeeze testing value area
 

6403
02:16:55,679 --> 02:16:57,110
So here's the squeeze testing value area
low. We still have sellers here on the

6404
02:16:57,110 --> 02:16:57,120
low. We still have sellers here on the
 

6405
02:16:57,120 --> 02:16:59,830
low. We still have sellers here on the
tape right now passively selling spy

6406
02:16:59,830 --> 02:16:59,840
tape right now passively selling spy
 

6407
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:03,030
tape right now passively selling spy
back through previous day low and 75s.

6408
02:17:03,030 --> 02:17:03,040
back through previous day low and 75s.
 

6409
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:05,030
back through previous day low and 75s.
ES is not quite there yet. All right, ES

6410
02:17:05,030 --> 02:17:05,040
ES is not quite there yet. All right, ES
 

6411
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:06,549
ES is not quite there yet. All right, ES
is coming up to test this same level.

6412
02:17:06,549 --> 02:17:06,559
is coming up to test this same level.
 

6413
02:17:06,559 --> 02:17:08,309
is coming up to test this same level.
This is where they keep selling ES over

6414
02:17:08,309 --> 02:17:08,319
This is where they keep selling ES over
 

6415
02:17:08,319 --> 02:17:09,990
This is where they keep selling ES over
and over and over again. You might see

6416
02:17:09,990 --> 02:17:10,000
and over and over again. You might see
 

6417
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,990
and over and over again. You might see
some relief here as we squeeze back

6418
02:17:11,990 --> 02:17:12,000
some relief here as we squeeze back
 

6419
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:16,230
some relief here as we squeeze back
through value area low

6420
02:17:16,230 --> 02:17:16,240

 

6421
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:17,990

and see if they come and passively sell

6422
02:17:17,990 --> 02:17:18,000
and see if they come and passively sell
 

6423
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,830
and see if they come and passively sell
this. There are dips being offered at 20

6424
02:17:21,830 --> 02:17:21,840
this. There are dips being offered at 20
 

6425
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:23,669
this. There are dips being offered at 20
40s. That's a bit low, man. You don't

6426
02:17:23,669 --> 02:17:23,679
40s. That's a bit low, man. You don't
 

6427
02:17:23,679 --> 02:17:26,709
40s. That's a bit low, man. You don't
really want it down there.

6428
02:17:26,709 --> 02:17:26,719
really want it down there.
 

6429
02:17:26,719 --> 02:17:29,349
really want it down there.
So that's the pop above value.

6430
02:17:29,349 --> 02:17:29,359
So that's the pop above value.
 

6431
02:17:29,359 --> 02:17:30,870
So that's the pop above value.
If buyers are going to step in here

6432
02:17:30,870 --> 02:17:30,880
If buyers are going to step in here
 

6433
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:32,790
If buyers are going to step in here
again, I would not be personally today.

6434
02:17:32,790 --> 02:17:32,800
again, I would not be personally today.
 

6435
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:34,629
again, I would not be personally today.
I would not be a buyer. But if you are

6436
02:17:34,629 --> 02:17:34,639
I would not be a buyer. But if you are
 

6437
02:17:34,639 --> 02:17:35,990
I would not be a buyer. But if you are
adamant on playing the counter trend,

6438
02:17:35,990 --> 02:17:36,000
adamant on playing the counter trend,
 

6439
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,070
adamant on playing the counter trend,
you would want this to hold 57s and then

6440
02:17:38,070 --> 02:17:38,080
you would want this to hold 57s and then
 

6441
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:46,309
you would want this to hold 57s and then
you'd want to get back above those 110s.

6442
02:17:46,309 --> 02:17:46,319

 

6443
02:17:46,319 --> 02:17:47,990

ES can't get back above previous day

6444
02:17:47,990 --> 02:17:48,000
ES can't get back above previous day
 

6445
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,469
ES can't get back above previous day
low. Right? So, this gray box here,

6446
02:17:50,469 --> 02:17:50,479
low. Right? So, this gray box here,
 

6447
02:17:50,479 --> 02:17:51,589
low. Right? So, this gray box here,
you're starting to build out a bit of a

6448
02:17:51,589 --> 02:17:51,599
you're starting to build out a bit of a
 

6449
02:17:51,599 --> 02:17:54,150
you're starting to build out a bit of a
node here. Um, if I was a buyer, what

6450
02:17:54,150 --> 02:17:54,160
node here. Um, if I was a buyer, what
 

6451
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:55,750
node here. Um, if I was a buyer, what
would I want to see? If I really thought

6452
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:55,760
would I want to see? If I really thought
 

6453
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:57,030
would I want to see? If I really thought
we were going to squeeze back up today,

6454
02:17:57,030 --> 02:17:57,040
we were going to squeeze back up today,
 

6455
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:59,589
we were going to squeeze back up today,
I'd want this to hold a reclaim, a pull

6456
02:17:59,589 --> 02:17:59,599
I'd want this to hold a reclaim, a pull
 

6457
02:17:59,599 --> 02:18:01,589
I'd want this to hold a reclaim, a pull
back inside, and I'd be looking for this

6458
02:18:01,589 --> 02:18:01,599
back inside, and I'd be looking for this
 

6459
02:18:01,599 --> 02:18:03,990
back inside, and I'd be looking for this
drift back into value or or at least

6460
02:18:03,990 --> 02:18:04,000
drift back into value or or at least
 

6461
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,389
drift back into value or or at least
into here into here was 50% of the

6462
02:18:06,389 --> 02:18:06,399
into here into here was 50% of the
 

6463
02:18:06,399 --> 02:18:08,790
into here into here was 50% of the
today's move. So, 180 is maybe a

6464
02:18:08,790 --> 02:18:08,800
today's move. So, 180 is maybe a
 

6465
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:11,349
today's move. So, 180 is maybe a
possible target if they are ready. All

6466
02:18:11,349 --> 02:18:11,359
possible target if they are ready. All
 

6467
02:18:11,359 --> 02:18:12,870
possible target if they are ready. All
right, you're going to need to see some

6468
02:18:12,870 --> 02:18:12,880
right, you're going to need to see some
 

6469
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:15,110
right, you're going to need to see some
compression down here, right? You need

6470
02:18:15,110 --> 02:18:15,120
compression down here, right? You need
 

6471
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:16,389
compression down here, right? You need
to see something like this and that's

6472
02:18:16,389 --> 02:18:16,399
to see something like this and that's
 

6473
02:18:16,399 --> 02:18:17,990
to see something like this and that's
the relief and expect sellers to come

6474
02:18:17,990 --> 02:18:18,000
the relief and expect sellers to come
 

6475
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,990
the relief and expect sellers to come
back in and sell that. Okay? So you if

6476
02:18:19,990 --> 02:18:20,000
back in and sell that. Okay? So you if
 

6477
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,830
back in and sell that. Okay? So you if
you're trading the buy today, if you're

6478
02:18:21,830 --> 02:18:21,840
you're trading the buy today, if you're
 

6479
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:23,910
you're trading the buy today, if you're
going to be adamant looking for the buy,

6480
02:18:23,910 --> 02:18:23,920
going to be adamant looking for the buy,
 

6481
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:26,150
going to be adamant looking for the buy,
this is your sell, that's the counter

6482
02:18:26,150 --> 02:18:26,160
this is your sell, that's the counter
 

6483
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:27,990
this is your sell, that's the counter
trend. The expectation is that they

6484
02:18:27,990 --> 02:18:28,000
trend. The expectation is that they
 

6485
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:31,509
trend. The expectation is that they
resell that. Do not be trying to, you

6486
02:18:31,509 --> 02:18:31,519
resell that. Do not be trying to, you
 

6487
02:18:31,519 --> 02:18:33,669
resell that. Do not be trying to, you
know, buy high in this session or

6488
02:18:33,669 --> 02:18:33,679
know, buy high in this session or
 

6489
02:18:33,679 --> 02:18:35,349
know, buy high in this session or
expecting too much. You are, you're

6490
02:18:35,349 --> 02:18:35,359
expecting too much. You are, you're
 

6491
02:18:35,359 --> 02:18:36,549
expecting too much. You are, you're
going to be a buyer, you're a counter

6492
02:18:36,549 --> 02:18:36,559
going to be a buyer, you're a counter
 

6493
02:18:36,559 --> 02:18:38,549
going to be a buyer, you're a counter
trend buyer, you better be locking in

6494
02:18:38,549 --> 02:18:38,559
trend buyer, you better be locking in
 

6495
02:18:38,559 --> 02:18:47,030
trend buyer, you better be locking in
profits.

6496
02:18:47,030 --> 02:18:47,040

 

6497
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:49,429

What indicators are you using for order

6498
02:18:49,429 --> 02:18:49,439
What indicators are you using for order
 

6499
02:18:49,439 --> 02:18:51,509
What indicators are you using for order
flow and the bands? Uh the bands are

6500
02:18:51,509 --> 02:18:51,519
flow and the bands? Uh the bands are
 

6501
02:18:51,519 --> 02:18:53,110
flow and the bands? Uh the bands are
just my flow zone pros. These are

6502
02:18:53,110 --> 02:18:53,120
just my flow zone pros. These are
 

6503
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:55,750
just my flow zone pros. These are
rolling Fibonacci EMAs.

6504
02:18:55,750 --> 02:18:55,760
rolling Fibonacci EMAs.
 

6505
02:18:55,760 --> 02:18:57,669
rolling Fibonacci EMAs.
Um

6506
02:18:57,669 --> 02:18:57,679
Um
 

6507
02:18:57,679 --> 02:19:00,150
Um
and uh for order flow, I'm looking at

6508
02:19:00,150 --> 02:19:00,160
and uh for order flow, I'm looking at
 

6509
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:02,629
and uh for order flow, I'm looking at
bookmap above and the footprint chart. I

6510
02:19:02,629 --> 02:19:02,639
bookmap above and the footprint chart. I
 

6511
02:19:02,639 --> 02:19:04,150
bookmap above and the footprint chart. I
have footprint chart on Ninja. I also

6512
02:19:04,150 --> 02:19:04,160
have footprint chart on Ninja. I also
 

6513
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:08,389
have footprint chart on Ninja. I also
have it on here when I need to show you.

6514
02:19:08,389 --> 02:19:08,399

 

6515
02:19:08,399 --> 02:19:09,830

All right. So you can also have it on

6516
02:19:09,830 --> 02:19:09,840
All right. So you can also have it on
 

6517
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:12,150
All right. So you can also have it on
trading view. As you can see at the

6518
02:19:12,150 --> 02:19:12,160
trading view. As you can see at the
 

6519
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:13,750
trading view. As you can see at the
bottom of this auction today, we have

6520
02:19:13,750 --> 02:19:13,760
bottom of this auction today, we have
 

6521
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:16,150
bottom of this auction today, we have
some sellers caught down here, right? We

6522
02:19:16,150 --> 02:19:16,160
some sellers caught down here, right? We
 

6523
02:19:16,160 --> 02:19:17,990
some sellers caught down here, right? We
didn't quite make it in. So, Delta

6524
02:19:17,990 --> 02:19:18,000
didn't quite make it in. So, Delta
 

6525
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,150
didn't quite make it in. So, Delta
flipped and they've tried to sell here

6526
02:19:20,150 --> 02:19:20,160
flipped and they've tried to sell here
 

6527
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:22,389
flipped and they've tried to sell here
aggressively a few times. It's why I'm

6528
02:19:22,389 --> 02:19:22,399
aggressively a few times. It's why I'm
 

6529
02:19:22,399 --> 02:19:23,830
aggressively a few times. It's why I'm
saying you wouldn't want it back below

6530
02:19:23,830 --> 02:19:23,840
saying you wouldn't want it back below
 

6531
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:25,669
saying you wouldn't want it back below
this. You'd want this imbalance here to

6532
02:19:25,669 --> 02:19:25,679
this. You'd want this imbalance here to
 

6533
02:19:25,679 --> 02:19:27,750
this. You'd want this imbalance here to
hold. All right, buyers would really

6534
02:19:27,750 --> 02:19:27,760
hold. All right, buyers would really
 

6535
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:29,589
hold. All right, buyers would really
need this to hold. If you if you see it

6536
02:19:29,589 --> 02:19:29,599
need this to hold. If you if you see it
 

6537
02:19:29,599 --> 02:19:31,190
need this to hold. If you if you see it
back under there, buyers are failing to

6538
02:19:31,190 --> 02:19:31,200
back under there, buyers are failing to
 

6539
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:35,349
back under there, buyers are failing to
take control for that rotation

6540
02:19:35,349 --> 02:19:35,359

 

6541
02:19:35,359 --> 02:19:37,110

back into this gray box. All right, this

6542
02:19:37,110 --> 02:19:37,120
back into this gray box. All right, this
 

6543
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:38,549
back into this gray box. All right, this
is where buyers will need to step in.

6544
02:19:38,549 --> 02:19:38,559
is where buyers will need to step in.
 

6545
02:19:38,559 --> 02:19:40,389
is where buyers will need to step in.
failing to step in. We just go back down

6546
02:19:40,389 --> 02:19:40,399
failing to step in. We just go back down
 

6547
02:19:40,399 --> 02:19:42,309
failing to step in. We just go back down
for a new low. Remember, 25,000 hasn't

6548
02:19:42,309 --> 02:19:42,319
for a new low. Remember, 25,000 hasn't
 

6549
02:19:42,319 --> 02:19:45,830
for a new low. Remember, 25,000 hasn't
been tagged yet.

there any way to see both in Ninja at
 

6557
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:54,309
there any way to see both in Ninja at

02:20:10,309 --> 02:20:10,319
So this is the level bulls need to hold.
 

6567

Be careful. Like I said if I would not

6578
02:20:26,469 --> 02:20:26,479
Be careful. Like I said if I would not
 

6579
02:20:26,479 --> 02:20:27,830
Be careful. Like I said if I would not
be a buyer. I'm going to make this

6580
02:20:27,830 --> 02:20:27,840
be a buyer. I'm going to make this
 

6581
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:29,990
be a buyer. I'm going to make this
clear. You guys trade your accounts as

6582
02:20:29,990 --> 02:20:30,000
clear. You guys trade your accounts as
 

6583
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,230
clear. You guys trade your accounts as
you want. I would not be a seller down

6584
02:20:32,230 --> 02:20:32,240
you want. I would not be a seller down
 

6585
02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:34,070
you want. I would not be a seller down
here but I would not be a buyer either.

6586
02:20:34,070 --> 02:20:34,080
here but I would not be a buyer either.
 

6587
02:20:34,080 --> 02:20:35,750
here but I would not be a buyer either.
I would not be convinced that we have

6588
02:20:35,750 --> 02:20:35,760
I would not be convinced that we have
 

6589
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:37,990
I would not be convinced that we have
finished this to the downside. But each

6590
02:20:37,990 --> 02:20:38,000
finished this to the downside. But each
 

6591
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:43,830
finished this to the downside. But each
to their own, here comes the flush.

6592
02:20:43,830 --> 02:20:43,840

 

6593
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:45,990

Like any buy today is counter trend. I

6594
02:20:45,990 --> 02:20:46,000
Like any buy today is counter trend. I
 

6595
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,070
Like any buy today is counter trend. I
think that's the worst trade in the

6596
02:20:48,070 --> 02:20:48,080
think that's the worst trade in the
 

6597
02:20:48,080 --> 02:21:02,790
think that's the worst trade in the
book. Personally,

6598
02:21:02,790 --> 02:21:02,800

 

6599
02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:05,910

more follow through here. They want they

6600
02:21:05,910 --> 02:21:05,920
more follow through here. They want they
 

6601
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:08,070
more follow through here. They want they
want that 25k, you know, they want that

6602
02:21:08,070 --> 02:21:08,080
want that 25k, you know, they want that
 

6603
02:21:08,080 --> 02:21:10,309
want that 25k, you know, they want that
whole number. They want that fib level.

6604
02:21:10,309 --> 02:21:10,319
whole number. They want that fib level.
 

6605
02:21:10,319 --> 02:21:14,230
whole number. They want that fib level.
They want that little volume node.

6606
02:21:14,230 --> 02:21:14,240
They want that little volume node.
 

6607
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:17,110
They want that little volume node.
We're not seeing I mean we're not seeing

6608
02:21:17,110 --> 02:21:17,120
We're not seeing I mean we're not seeing
 

6609
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:18,710
We're not seeing I mean we're not seeing
higher highs and higher lows in this

6610
02:21:18,710 --> 02:21:18,720
higher highs and higher lows in this
 

6611
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:20,309
higher highs and higher lows in this
market. We haven't seen a pivot yet.

6612
02:21:20,309 --> 02:21:20,319
market. We haven't seen a pivot yet.
 

6613
02:21:20,319 --> 02:21:21,990
market. We haven't seen a pivot yet.
It's not to say we don't get relief and

6614
02:21:21,990 --> 02:21:22,000
It's not to say we don't get relief and
 

6615
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:23,429
It's not to say we don't get relief and
it doesn't come. But at the moment we

6616
02:21:23,429 --> 02:21:23,439
it doesn't come. But at the moment we
 

6617
02:21:23,439 --> 02:21:26,070
it doesn't come. But at the moment we
are seeing a trend day,

6618
02:21:26,070 --> 02:21:26,080
are seeing a trend day,
 

6619
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:28,230
are seeing a trend day,
right? And we are seeing a move outside

6620
02:21:28,230 --> 02:21:28,240
right? And we are seeing a move outside
 

6621
02:21:28,240 --> 02:21:29,990
right? And we are seeing a move outside
of previous days value, outside of

6622
02:21:29,990 --> 02:21:30,000
of previous days value, outside of
 

6623
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:31,190
of previous days value, outside of
initial balance, right? We're not

6624
02:21:31,190 --> 02:21:31,200
initial balance, right? We're not
 

6625
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:33,349
initial balance, right? We're not
reclaiming any of these levels. So

6626
02:21:33,349 --> 02:21:33,359
reclaiming any of these levels. So
 

6627
02:21:33,359 --> 02:21:34,950
reclaiming any of these levels. So
you're going to be long your counter

6628
02:21:34,950 --> 02:21:34,960
you're going to be long your counter
 

6629
02:21:34,960 --> 02:21:36,469
you're going to be long your counter
trend of everything that's going. That's

6630
02:21:36,469 --> 02:21:36,479
trend of everything that's going. That's
 

6631
02:21:36,479 --> 02:21:39,429
trend of everything that's going. That's
not to say, right, that at some point we

6632
02:21:39,429 --> 02:21:39,439
not to say, right, that at some point we
 

6633
02:21:39,439 --> 02:21:41,910
not to say, right, that at some point we
don't see

6634
02:21:41,910 --> 02:21:41,920
don't see
 

6635
02:21:41,920 --> 02:21:43,750
don't see
something like this, but that's your

6636
02:21:43,750 --> 02:21:43,760
something like this, but that's your
 

6637
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:45,830
something like this, but that's your
counter trend leg,

6638
02:21:45,830 --> 02:21:45,840
counter trend leg,
 

6639
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:51,158
counter trend leg,
right? And I expect them to resell that

6640
02:21:51,158 --> 02:21:51,168

Remember, the government's been closed
 

6653
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:15,110
Remember, the government's been closed
for a long time. We're finally getting

6654
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:15,120
for a long time. We're finally getting
 

6655
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:17,429
for a long time. We're finally getting
the data out. We're going to have that

02:22:17,429 --> 02:22:17,439
the data out. We're going to have that
 

6657
02:22:17,439 --> 02:22:22,950
the data out. We're going to have that
uh JP carry trade. Um if we have a look

6658
02:22:22,950 --> 02:22:22,960
uh JP carry trade. Um if we have a look
 

6659
02:22:22,960 --> 02:22:27,590
uh JP carry trade. Um if we have a look
20 year, 30 years, sorry. Uh

6660
02:22:27,590 --> 02:22:27,600

 

6661
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:29,349

we pull back inside. We pull back

6662
02:22:29,349 --> 02:22:29,359
we pull back inside. We pull back
 

6663
02:22:29,359 --> 02:22:30,950
we pull back inside. We pull back
inside. I mean, everyone's watching that

6664
02:22:30,950 --> 02:22:30,960
inside. I mean, everyone's watching that
 

6665
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:33,349
inside. I mean, everyone's watching that
420 break.

6666
02:22:33,349 --> 02:22:33,359

6671
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:41,750
for 420 break. Everyone's watching this
knowing if we do this QQQ

6672
02:22:41,750 --> 02:22:41,760
knowing if we do this QQQ
 

6673
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:45,190
knowing if we do this QQQ
down. All right. So, traditionally,

6674
02:22:45,190 --> 02:22:45,200
down. All right. So, traditionally,
 

6675
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:47,030
down. All right. So, traditionally,
yeah, I'd say like lower volume, lower

6676
02:22:47,030 --> 02:22:47,040
yeah, I'd say like lower volume, lower
 

6677
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:48,870
yeah, I'd say like lower volume, lower
volume, I think you'll find quite a lot

6678
02:22:48,870 --> 02:22:48,880
volume, I think you'll find quite a lot
 

6679
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:50,389
volume, I think you'll find quite a lot
of people might stick around at the

6680
02:22:50,389 --> 02:22:50,399
of people might stick around at the
 

6681
02:22:50,399 --> 02:22:51,990
of people might stick around at the
moment

6682
02:22:51,990 --> 02:22:52,000
moment
 

6683
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,190
moment
because they're going to need to manage

6684
02:22:53,190 --> 02:22:53,200
because they're going to need to manage
 

6685
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:55,510
because they're going to need to manage
positions into end of year. I think the

6686
02:22:55,510 --> 02:22:55,520
positions into end of year. I think the
 

6687
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:58,070
positions into end of year. I think the
rotations happened out of tech into

6688
02:22:58,070 --> 02:22:58,080
rotations happened out of tech into
 

6689
02:22:58,080 --> 02:23:00,950
rotations happened out of tech into
small cap. I think MM are uh they're

6690
02:23:00,950 --> 02:23:00,960
small cap. I think MM are uh they're
 

6691
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:02,150
small cap. I think MM are uh they're
like, "Well, we're not going to make our

6692
02:23:02,150 --> 02:23:02,160
like, "Well, we're not going to make our
 

6693
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:03,590
like, "Well, we're not going to make our
money on the cues, so we're going to

6694
02:23:03,590 --> 02:23:03,600
money on the cues, so we're going to
 

6695
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:04,950
money on the cues, so we're going to
have to find some way to make it." And

6696
02:23:04,950 --> 02:23:04,960
have to find some way to make it." And
 

6697
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:07,110
have to find some way to make it." And
they're probably trying to make it in

6698
02:23:07,110 --> 02:23:07,120
they're probably trying to make it in
 

6699
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:10,630
they're probably trying to make it in
safe names and in some of those sort of

6700
02:23:10,630 --> 02:23:10,640
safe names and in some of those sort of
 

6701
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:12,630
safe names and in some of those sort of
small cap names. Probably playing some

6702
02:23:12,630 --> 02:23:12,640
small cap names. Probably playing some
 

6703
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:19,510
small cap names. Probably playing some
nasty squeeze outs.

6704
02:23:19,510 --> 02:23:19,520

 

6705
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:23,590

One of you short from 57. Uh 57's

6706
02:23:23,590 --> 02:23:23,600
One of you short from 57. Uh 57's
 

6707
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:26,070
One of you short from 57. Uh 57's
leaving the edge of that. It's not bad.

6708
02:23:26,070 --> 02:23:26,080
leaving the edge of that. It's not bad.
 

6709
02:23:26,080 --> 02:23:27,670
leaving the edge of that. It's not bad.
It's risky because you're you're near

6710
02:23:27,670 --> 02:23:27,680
It's risky because you're you're near
 

6711
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:29,190
It's risky because you're you're near
low of day, but it's not bad. Just make

6712
02:23:29,190 --> 02:23:29,200
low of day, but it's not bad. Just make
 

6713
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:30,469
low of day, but it's not bad. Just make
sure you're covering some into here.

6714
02:23:30,469 --> 02:23:30,479
sure you're covering some into here.
 

6715
02:23:30,479 --> 02:23:32,550
sure you're covering some into here.
You're uh

6716
02:23:32,550 --> 02:23:32,560
You're uh
 

6717
02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:34,309
You're uh
this last candle sellers came flying in

6718
02:23:34,309 --> 02:23:34,319
this last candle sellers came flying in
 

6719
02:23:34,319 --> 02:23:35,910
this last candle sellers came flying in
at the lows. You're starting to break it

6720
02:23:35,910 --> 02:23:35,920
at the lows. You're starting to break it
 

6721
02:23:35,920 --> 02:23:37,510
at the lows. You're starting to break it
now. You should get a low of day now

6722
02:23:37,510 --> 02:23:37,520
now. You should get a low of day now
 

6723
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:39,190
now. You should get a low of day now
after this last candle. You I wouldn't

6724
02:23:39,190 --> 02:23:39,200
after this last candle. You I wouldn't
 

6725
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:41,670
after this last candle. You I wouldn't
want to repric here. You should get a

6726
02:23:41,670 --> 02:23:41,680
want to repric here. You should get a
 

6727
02:23:41,680 --> 02:23:43,910
want to repric here. You should get a
low of day now. I would just watch 14s.

6728
02:23:43,910 --> 02:23:43,920
low of day now. I would just watch 14s.
 

6729
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:45,590
low of day now. I would just watch 14s.
All right, that on that low of day

6730
02:23:45,590 --> 02:23:45,600
All right, that on that low of day
 

6731
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:48,790
All right, that on that low of day
candle. That was your PC on that candle.

6732
02:23:48,790 --> 02:23:48,800
candle. That was your PC on that candle.
 

6733
02:23:48,800 --> 02:23:51,670
candle. That was your PC on that candle.
That was where sellers got stuck at 14s,

6734
02:23:51,670 --> 02:23:51,680
That was where sellers got stuck at 14s,
 

6735
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:53,510
That was where sellers got stuck at 14s,
right? So, I'd be watching 14s. Flush

6736
02:23:53,510 --> 02:23:53,520
right? So, I'd be watching 14s. Flush
 

6737
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:56,920
right? So, I'd be watching 14s. Flush
14s. You should get 25k

6738
02:23:56,920 --> 02:23:56,930
14s. You should get 25k
 

6739
02:23:56,930 --> 02:24:03,190
14s. You should get 25k
[snorts]

6740
02:24:03,190 --> 02:24:03,200

 

6741

25k. Nice mate. Yeah, nice.
I think I think you will get there. It's

6746
02:24:11,349 --> 02:24:11,359
I think I think you will get there. It's
 

6747
02:24:11,359 --> 02:24:13,510
I think I think you will get there. It's
just like because your entry your entry

6748
02:24:13,510 --> 02:24:13,520
just like because your entry your entry
 

6749
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:15,510
just like because your entry your entry
isn't a terrible entry, but because if

6750
02:24:15,510 --> 02:24:15,520
isn't a terrible entry, but because if
 

6751
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:17,510
isn't a terrible entry, but because if
we think about the whole swing, right,

6752
02:24:17,510 --> 02:24:17,520
we think about the whole swing, right,
 

6753
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:18,790
we think about the whole swing, right,
the best entries are all the way up

6754
02:24:18,790 --> 02:24:18,800
the best entries are all the way up
 

6755
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:19,830
the best entries are all the way up
here. Because you're entering here,

6756
02:24:19,830 --> 02:24:19,840
here. Because you're entering here,
 

6757
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:20,790
here. Because you're entering here,
you're just going to have to be a bit

6758
02:24:20,790 --> 02:24:20,800
you're just going to have to be a bit
 

6759
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:22,469
you're just going to have to be a bit
more careful managing your position. But

6760
02:24:22,469 --> 02:24:22,479
more careful managing your position. But
 

6761
02:24:22,479 --> 02:24:25,110
more careful managing your position. But
we are leaving volume. We are rejecting

6762
02:24:25,110 --> 02:24:25,120
we are leaving volume. We are rejecting
 

6763
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:27,190
we are leaving volume. We are rejecting
this. We are rejecting this. We never

6764
02:24:27,190 --> 02:24:27,200
this. We are rejecting this. We never
 

6765
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:30,309
this. We are rejecting this. We never
reclaimed uh value on the day. This

6766
02:24:30,309 --> 02:24:30,319
reclaimed uh value on the day. This
 

6767
02:24:30,319 --> 02:24:32,150
reclaimed uh value on the day. This
should happen. And under there, I would

6768
02:24:32,150 --> 02:24:32,160
should happen. And under there, I would
 

6769
02:24:32,160 --> 02:24:34,070
should happen. And under there, I would
say again a bit like on this move that

6770
02:24:34,070 --> 02:24:34,080
say again a bit like on this move that
 

6771
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:35,670
say again a bit like on this move that
we talked about, was it this move here?

6772
02:24:35,670 --> 02:24:35,680
we talked about, was it this move here?
 

6773
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:37,030
we talked about, was it this move here?
I forget where it was. And I was like,

6774
02:24:37,030 --> 02:24:37,040
I forget where it was. And I was like,
 

6775
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:39,110
I forget where it was. And I was like,
you've got to cover on the snap. If we

6776
02:24:39,110 --> 02:24:39,120
you've got to cover on the snap. If we
 

6777
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:41,590
you've got to cover on the snap. If we
snap here, you must be trimming, right?

6778
02:24:41,590 --> 02:24:41,600
snap here, you must be trimming, right?
 

6779
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:43,190
snap here, you must be trimming, right?
If they do a liquidity run here, you

6780
02:24:43,190 --> 02:24:43,200
If they do a liquidity run here, you
 

6781
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:44,309
If they do a liquidity run here, you
must be trimming because you got to be

6782
02:24:44,309 --> 02:24:44,319
must be trimming because you got to be
 

6783
02:24:44,319 --> 02:24:46,870
must be trimming because you got to be
careful of that move because your entry

6784
02:24:46,870 --> 02:24:46,880
careful of that move because your entry
 

6785
02:24:46,880 --> 02:24:48,230
careful of that move because your entry
is a little bit later. All right?

6786
02:24:48,230 --> 02:24:48,240
is a little bit later. All right?
 

6787
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:49,670
is a little bit later. All right?
Because you've entered from 52s. the

6788
02:24:49,670 --> 02:24:49,680
Because you've entered from 52s. the
 

6789
02:24:49,680 --> 02:24:52,950
Because you've entered from 52s. the
snap of 25,000. Cover some on the flush,

6790
02:24:52,950 --> 02:24:52,960
snap of 25,000. Cover some on the flush,
 

6791
02:24:52,960 --> 02:24:55,750
snap of 25,000. Cover some on the flush,
right? If they're bidding here and they

6792
02:24:55,750 --> 02:24:55,760
right? If they're bidding here and they
 

6793
02:24:55,760 --> 02:24:58,230
right? If they're bidding here and they
flush it, you must be covering some in

6794
02:24:58,230 --> 02:24:58,240
flush it, you must be covering some in
 

6795
02:24:58,240 --> 02:25:00,309
flush it, you must be covering some in
into their wash.

6796
02:25:00,309 --> 02:25:00,319
into their wash.
 

6797
02:25:00,319 --> 02:25:02,230
into their wash.
It's so much like a small cap right now.

6798

It's so much like a small cap right now.
 

6799
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:09,349
It's so much like a small cap right now.
It's insane.

week into January.
Here we come. But these 14s I keep

Here we come. But these 14s I keep
 

6809
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:19,830
Here we come. But these 14s I keep
talking about, that's that old PC from

6810
02:25:19,830 --> 02:25:19,840
talking about, that's that old PC from
 

6811
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:21,750
talking about, that's that old PC from
this candle. The PC on this candle is

6812
02:25:21,750 --> 02:25:21,760
this candle. The PC on this candle is
 

6813
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:24,150
this candle. The PC on this candle is
14s. So I'll be watching 14s. And can

6814
02:25:24,150 --> 02:25:24,160
14s. So I'll be watching 14s. And can
 

6815
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:25,830
14s. So I'll be watching 14s. And can
you trade under 14s? If you trade under

6816
02:25:25,830 --> 02:25:25,840
you trade under 14s? If you trade under
 

6817
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:29,750
you trade under 14s? If you trade under
14s, you should hit a new low.

6818
02:25:29,750 --> 02:25:29,760
14s, you should hit a new low.
 

6819

comfortable now. 25,000 coming up. And
 

6859
02:26:13,280 --> 02:26:16,790
comfortable now. 25,000 coming up. And
then 985 is on the bid. So if you break

6860
02:26:16,790 --> 02:26:16,800
then 985 is on the bid. So if you break
 

6861
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:18,230
then 985 is on the bid. So if you break
25,000, you've got a new lower day here,

6862
02:26:18,230 --> 02:26:18,240
25,000, you've got a new lower day here,
 

6863
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:19,830
25,000, you've got a new lower day here,
which is good. 25,000 coming up. Make

6864
02:26:19,830 --> 02:26:19,840
which is good. 25,000 coming up. Make
 

6865
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:21,670
which is good. 25,000 coming up. Make
sure you're covering some into the wash

6866
02:26:21,670 --> 02:26:21,680
sure you're covering some into the wash
 

6867
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:23,349
sure you're covering some into the wash
under here. All right. Make sure you are

6868
02:26:23,349 --> 02:26:23,359
under here. All right. Make sure you are
 

6869
02:26:23,359 --> 02:26:34,389
under here. All right. Make sure you are
covering some into the wash. [snorts]

6870
02:26:34,389 --> 02:26:34,399

 

6871
02:26:34,399 --> 02:26:37,030

You tapped 25K there. Make sure if you

6872
02:26:37,030 --> 02:26:37,040
You tapped 25K there. Make sure if you
 

6873
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:38,710
You tapped 25K there. Make sure if you
snap 25 or you should have covered some

6874
02:26:38,710 --> 02:26:38,720
snap 25 or you should have covered some
 

6875
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:40,870
snap 25 or you should have covered some
anyway into the gray box like I said.

6876
02:26:40,870 --> 02:26:40,880
anyway into the gray box like I said.
 

6877
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:43,349
anyway into the gray box like I said.
But if you snap this gray box, you must

6878
02:26:43,349 --> 02:26:43,359
But if you snap this gray box, you must
 

6879
02:26:43,359 --> 02:26:47,590
But if you snap this gray box, you must
be out the majority of your position.

6880
02:26:47,590 --> 02:26:47,600
be out the majority of your position.
 

6881
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:50,070
be out the majority of your position.
Back into a shelf here at 21s now.

6882
02:26:50,070 --> 02:26:50,080
Back into a shelf here at 21s now.
 

6883
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:52,710
Back into a shelf here at 21s now.
Relief here. Relief here coming. So they

6884
02:26:52,710 --> 02:26:52,720
Relief here. Relief here coming. So they
 

6885
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:55,190
Relief here. Relief here coming. So they
probably trade up to 40s now. Maybe even

6886
02:26:55,190 --> 02:26:55,200
probably trade up to 40s now. Maybe even
 

6887
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:58,150
probably trade up to 40s now. Maybe even
up to 55s where you got in. I think

6888
02:26:58,150 --> 02:26:58,160
up to 55s where you got in. I think
 

6889
02:26:58,160 --> 02:26:59,990
up to 55s where you got in. I think
there will be one more sell opportunity

6890
02:26:59,990 --> 02:27:00,000
there will be one more sell opportunity
 

6891
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,750
there will be one more sell opportunity
that not opportunity, but they should

6892
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:01,760
that not opportunity, but they should
 

6893
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:05,349
that not opportunity, but they should
try and resell this one more time.

6894
02:27:05,349 --> 02:27:05,359
try and resell this one more time.
 

6895
02:27:05,359 --> 02:27:07,590
try and resell this one more time.
Looks thinned out quite a lot here. So

6896
02:27:07,590 --> 02:27:07,600
Looks thinned out quite a lot here. So
 

6897
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:10,710
Looks thinned out quite a lot here. So
up to this 56 we go. the same level as

6898
02:27:10,710 --> 02:27:10,720
up to this 56 we go. the same level as
 

6899
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:12,870
up to this 56 we go. the same level as
before. This is why you have to cover

6900
02:27:12,870 --> 02:27:12,880
before. This is why you have to cover
 

6901
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:14,870
before. This is why you have to cover
those lows.

6902
02:27:14,870 --> 02:27:14,880
those lows.
 

6903
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:18,230
those lows.
Flat now plus 800. Really nice. Really

6904
02:27:18,230 --> 02:27:18,240
Flat now plus 800. Really nice. Really
 

6905
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:20,550
Flat now plus 800. Really nice. Really
nice. What do I mean by relief? Uh well,

6906
02:27:20,550 --> 02:27:20,560
nice. What do I mean by relief? Uh well,
 

6907
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:23,670
nice. What do I mean by relief? Uh well,
if everyone's selling down,

6908
02:27:23,670 --> 02:27:23,680
if everyone's selling down,
 

6909
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:25,590
if everyone's selling down,
if everyone's selling down, the relief

6910
02:27:25,590 --> 02:27:25,600
if everyone's selling down, the relief
 

6911
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:27,990
if everyone's selling down, the relief
is this move here. So, relief rally,

6912
02:27:27,990 --> 02:27:28,000
is this move here. So, relief rally,
 

6913
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:29,670
is this move here. So, relief rally,
right? We're going to test 56 is

6914
02:27:29,670 --> 02:27:29,680
right? We're going to test 56 is
 

6915
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:35,590
right? We're going to test 56 is
probably same level as before.

6916
02:27:35,590 --> 02:27:35,600

 

6917
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:37,030

It's where all that delta came in. So,

6918
02:27:37,030 --> 02:27:37,040
It's where all that delta came in. So,
 

6919
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:38,309
It's where all that delta came in. So,
we're going to test it, test it, test

6920
02:27:38,309 --> 02:27:38,319
we're going to test it, test it, test
 

6921
02:27:38,319 --> 02:27:40,630
we're going to test it, test it, test
it, test it. right into it. There we go.

6922
02:27:40,630 --> 02:27:40,640
it, test it. right into it. There we go.
 

6923
02:27:40,640 --> 02:27:42,710
it, test it. right into it. There we go.
So, can we poke through this now? And if

6924
02:27:42,710 --> 02:27:42,720
So, can we poke through this now? And if
 

6925
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:43,990
So, can we poke through this now? And if
we do, we're going to go back to value,

6926
02:27:43,990 --> 02:27:44,000
we do, we're going to go back to value,
 

6927
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:45,910
we do, we're going to go back to value,
which is 77. Sellers will want to sell

6928
02:27:45,910 --> 02:27:45,920
which is 77. Sellers will want to sell
 

6929
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:48,389
which is 77. Sellers will want to sell
this where we are now. And if they don't

6930
02:27:48,389 --> 02:27:48,399
this where we are now. And if they don't
 

6931
02:27:48,399 --> 02:27:50,150
this where we are now. And if they don't
sell it, then all those guys at the

6932
02:27:50,150 --> 02:27:50,160
sell it, then all those guys at the
 

6933
02:27:50,160 --> 02:27:56,870
sell it, then all those guys at the
lower day are going to get caught.

6934
02:27:56,870 --> 02:27:56,880

 

6935
02:27:56,880 --> 02:27:58,710

Yes, still sorry. SPY still not through

6936
02:27:58,710 --> 02:27:58,720
Yes, still sorry. SPY still not through
 

6937
02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:00,230
Yes, still sorry. SPY still not through
its 50 days. Still not through previous

6938
02:28:00,230 --> 02:28:00,240
its 50 days. Still not through previous
 

6939
02:28:00,240 --> 02:28:02,790
its 50 days. Still not through previous
day low. VIX is turning back down to 17s

6940
02:28:02,790 --> 02:28:02,800
day low. VIX is turning back down to 17s
 

6941
02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:05,750
day low. VIX is turning back down to 17s
again.

6942
02:28:05,750 --> 02:28:05,760
again.
 

6943
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:07,750
again.
What was the edge of bottom of that

6944
02:28:07,750 --> 02:28:07,760
What was the edge of bottom of that
 

6945
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:11,590
What was the edge of bottom of that
auction like? Let me have a look.

6946
02:28:11,590 --> 02:28:11,600
auction like? Let me have a look.
 

6947
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:16,550
auction like? Let me have a look.
Uh 80 lot, 60 lot, 21 lot.

6948
02:28:16,550 --> 02:28:16,560
Uh 80 lot, 60 lot, 21 lot.
 

6949
02:28:16,560 --> 02:28:18,790
Uh 80 lot, 60 lot, 21 lot.
Not huge excess. Not bad, but not

6950
02:28:18,790 --> 02:28:18,800
Not huge excess. Not bad, but not
 

6951
02:28:18,800 --> 02:28:26,150
Not huge excess. Not bad, but not
massive excess at the lows.

6952
02:28:26,150 --> 02:28:26,160

 

6953
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:27,349

So, they couldn't get back through the

6954
02:28:27,349 --> 02:28:27,359
So, they couldn't get back through the
 

6955
02:28:27,359 --> 02:28:30,389
So, they couldn't get back through the
56s. They poked it, but no close above.

6956
02:28:30,389 --> 02:28:30,399
56s. They poked it, but no close above.
 

6957
02:28:30,399 --> 02:28:32,309
56s. They poked it, but no close above.
Buyers will want to defend 30 now.

6958
02:28:32,309 --> 02:28:32,319
Buyers will want to defend 30 now.
 

6959
02:28:32,319 --> 02:28:34,070
Buyers will want to defend 30 now.
Sellers still want a new low. They want

6960
02:28:34,070 --> 02:28:34,080
Sellers still want a new low. They want
 

6961
02:28:34,080 --> 02:28:36,230
Sellers still want a new low. They want
to take out 25,000. That is what they

6962
02:28:36,230 --> 02:28:36,240
to take out 25,000. That is what they
 

6963
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:37,830
to take out 25,000. That is what they
would really like to do. Here they come.

6964
02:28:37,830 --> 02:28:37,840
would really like to do. Here they come.
 

6965
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:40,870
would really like to do. Here they come.
So imbalance here into 30 and through

6966
02:28:40,870 --> 02:28:40,880
So imbalance here into 30 and through
 

6967
02:28:40,880 --> 02:28:45,190
So imbalance here into 30 and through
that should go lows.

6968
02:28:45,190 --> 02:28:45,200

 

6969
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:46,389

Should go lows. We're through the

6970
02:28:46,389 --> 02:28:46,399
Should go lows. We're through the
 

6971
02:28:46,399 --> 02:28:51,510
Should go lows. We're through the
imbalance. Should go lows now.

6972
02:28:51,510 --> 02:28:51,520

 

6973
02:28:51,520 --> 02:28:53,270

Wasn't that much excess on that last

6974
02:28:53,270 --> 02:28:53,280
Wasn't that much excess on that last
 

6975
02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:56,389
Wasn't that much excess on that last
run. I think once we dump under 25,000

6976
02:28:56,389 --> 02:28:56,399
run. I think once we dump under 25,000
 

6977
02:28:56,399 --> 02:29:02,870
run. I think once we dump under 25,000
that's when you get a bigger stop run.

6978
02:29:02,870 --> 02:29:02,880

 

6979
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:04,870

They are defending it with all their

6980
02:29:04,870 --> 02:29:04,880
They are defending it with all their
 

6981
02:29:04,880 --> 02:29:10,389
They are defending it with all their
might. So 6,800 ES 25,000 NQ

6982
02:29:10,389 --> 02:29:10,399
might. So 6,800 ES 25,000 NQ
 

6983
02:29:10,399 --> 02:29:12,630
might. So 6,800 ES 25,000 NQ
is the level. You know, I would expect a

6984
02:29:12,630 --> 02:29:12,640
is the level. You know, I would expect a
 

6985
02:29:12,640 --> 02:29:17,349
is the level. You know, I would expect a
stop run under these. I really would

6986
02:29:17,349 --> 02:29:17,359

 

6987
02:29:17,359 --> 02:29:26,630

absorption down there again though.

6988
02:29:26,630 --> 02:29:26,640

 

6989
02:29:26,640 --> 02:29:28,710

It's gray box to gray box rotation

6990
02:29:28,710 --> 02:29:28,720
It's gray box to gray box rotation
 

6991
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:36,150
It's gray box to gray box rotation
again.

6992
02:29:36,150 --> 02:29:36,160

 

6993
02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:37,990

sellers still in control of this market.

6994
02:29:37,990 --> 02:29:38,000
sellers still in control of this market.
 

6995
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,230
sellers still in control of this market.
They've still got targets below, right?

6996
02:29:40,230 --> 02:29:40,240
They've still got targets below, right?
 

6997
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:41,990
They've still got targets below, right?
Liquidity is at 25,000. They're going to

6998
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:42,000
Liquidity is at 25,000. They're going to
 

6999
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:43,750
Liquidity is at 25,000. They're going to
snap that and they're going to cover

7000
02:29:43,750 --> 02:29:43,760
snap that and they're going to cover
 

7001
02:29:43,760 --> 02:29:45,750
snap that and they're going to cover
that or they don't have to. That's what

7002
02:29:45,750 --> 02:29:45,760
that or they don't have to. That's what
 

7003
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:46,870
that or they don't have to. That's what
they're looking to do. They've had two

7004
02:29:46,870 --> 02:29:46,880
they're looking to do. They've had two
 

7005
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:49,030
they're looking to do. They've had two
attempts now. This needs to do it right

7006
02:29:49,030 --> 02:29:49,040
attempts now. This needs to do it right
 

7007
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:52,150
attempts now. This needs to do it right
here, right now. Um you would want not

7008
02:29:52,150 --> 02:29:52,160
here, right now. Um you would want not
 

7009
02:29:52,160 --> 02:29:53,590
here, right now. Um you would want not
want to see this hold. You'd want to see

7010
02:29:53,590 --> 02:29:53,600
want to see this hold. You'd want to see
 

7011
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:54,870
want to see this hold. You'd want to see
this flush it right here, right now

7012
02:29:54,870 --> 02:29:54,880
this flush it right here, right now
 

7013
02:29:54,880 --> 02:29:55,990
this flush it right here, right now
because they've just poked back up to

7014
02:29:55,990 --> 02:29:56,000
because they've just poked back up to
 

7015
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:57,590
because they've just poked back up to
value and failed. Here they come. So,

7016
02:29:57,590 --> 02:29:57,600
value and failed. Here they come. So,
 

7017
02:29:57,600 --> 02:29:58,710
value and failed. Here they come. So,
they're going to have one more attempt.

7018
02:29:58,710 --> 02:29:58,720
they're going to have one more attempt.
 

7019
02:29:58,720 --> 02:30:00,230
they're going to have one more attempt.
Again, if you have been short in this,

7020
02:30:00,230 --> 02:30:00,240
Again, if you have been short in this,
 

7021
02:30:00,240 --> 02:30:02,150
Again, if you have been short in this,
you must be covering into the wash,

7022
02:30:02,150 --> 02:30:02,160
you must be covering into the wash,
 

7023
02:30:02,160 --> 02:30:04,389
you must be covering into the wash,
which hopefully for you guys is about to

02:30:04,389 --> 02:30:04,399
which hopefully for you guys is about to
 

7025
02:30:04,399 --> 02:30:05,830
which hopefully for you guys is about to
start coming. I've got to move book back

7026
02:30:05,830 --> 02:30:05,840

7027
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:07,830
start coming. I've got to move book back
up. It's moving so quick. I can't see

7028
02:30:07,830 --> 02:30:07,840
up. It's moving so quick. I can't see
 

7029
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:09,429
up. It's moving so quick. I can't see
it.

7030
02:30:09,429 --> 02:30:09,439

7031
02:30:09,439 --> 02:30:11,510
it.
You do not want a defend of these 20s.

7032
02:30:11,510 --> 02:30:11,520
You do not want a defend of these 20s.
 

7033
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:12,870
You do not want a defend of these 20s.
We've got a little node starting to

02:30:12,870 --> 02:30:12,880
We've got a little node starting to
 

7035
02:30:12,880 --> 02:30:14,309
We've got a little node starting to
develop here. You do not want that to be

7036
02:30:14,309 --> 02:30:14,319
develop here. You do not want that to be
 

7037
02:30:14,319 --> 02:30:16,469
develop here. You do not want that to be
defended. You want a wash and a cover

7038
02:30:16,469 --> 02:30:16,479
defended. You want a wash and a cover
 

7039
02:30:16,479 --> 02:30:18,070
defended. You want a wash and a cover
into here. If you get really, really,

longer they're here without snapping,

7078
02:31:08,550 --> 02:31:08,560
longer they're here without snapping,
 

7079
02:31:08,560 --> 02:31:09,590
longer they're here without snapping,
the more of them that are going to get

7080
02:31:09,590 --> 02:31:09,600
the more of them that are going to get
 

7081

7103
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:43,349

They're trying to aggressively sell this

They're trying to aggressively sell this

They're trying to aggressively sell this
low. Someone's absorbing here. I think

02:31:44,630 --> 02:31:44,640
low. Someone's absorbing here. I think
 

7107
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:47,110

They need to get back under 20s and 15s.
 

7117
02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:56,469
They need to get back under 20s and 15s.
They're unable to do it right now. I'm

7118
02:31:56,469 --> 02:31:56,479
They're unable to do it right now. I'm
 

7119
02:31:56,479 --> 02:31:57,830
They're unable to do it right now. I'm
still I would not bid on this market

7120
02:31:57,830 --> 02:31:57,840
still I would not bid on this market
 

7121
02:31:57,840 --> 02:32:00,070
still I would not bid on this market
right now until we've washed out, done a

right now until we've washed out, done a
 

7123
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:02,070
right now until we've washed out, done a
huge stop run, left lots and lots of

02:32:02,070 --> 02:32:02,080
huge stop run, left lots and lots of
 

7125
02:32:02,080 --> 02:32:04,150
huge stop run, left lots and lots of
excess of the low. I would not be

7126
02:32:04,150 --> 02:32:04,160
excess of the low. I would not be
 

7127
02:32:04,160 --> 02:32:05,590
excess of the low. I would not be
thinking about the counter trend. I know

7128
02:32:05,590 --> 02:32:05,600
thinking about the counter trend. I know
 

7129
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:06,630
thinking about the counter trend. I know
a few of you are looking for that

7130
02:32:06,630 --> 02:32:06,640
a few of you are looking for that
 

7131
02:32:06,640 --> 02:32:11,990
a few of you are looking for that
reversal. I don't think it's ready yet.

Rejecting those 20s

because we're not going to get a long
 

7155
02:32:36,160 --> 02:32:37,670
because we're not going to get a long

02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:44,230
Okay, they were there too long. So, they
get relief now. Too many shorts.

7162
02:32:44,230 --> 02:32:44,240
get relief now. Too many shorts.
 

7163
02:32:44,240 --> 02:32:45,590
get relief now. Too many shorts.
Couldn't get their way. And there's the

7164
02:32:45,590 --> 02:32:45,600
Couldn't get their way. And there's the
 

7165
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:47,670
Couldn't get their way. And there's the
relief. They should have broken down

7166
02:32:47,670 --> 02:32:47,680
relief. They should have broken down
 

7167
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:49,830
relief. They should have broken down
there. this little ledge right here. So,

7168
02:32:49,830 --> 02:32:49,840
there. this little ledge right here. So,
 

7169
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:51,510
there. this little ledge right here. So,
they've repriced this low volume node.

7170
02:32:51,510 --> 02:32:51,520
they've repriced this low volume node.
 

7171
02:32:51,520 --> 02:32:53,270
they've repriced this low volume node.
They should have broken down there. They

7172
02:32:53,270 --> 02:32:53,280
They should have broken down there. They
 

7173
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:55,030
They should have broken down there. They
had numerous opportunities. They might

7174
02:32:55,030 --> 02:32:55,040
had numerous opportunities. They might
 

7175
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:56,790
had numerous opportunities. They might
not still be done, but because they all

7176
02:32:56,790 --> 02:32:56,800
not still be done, but because they all
 

7177
02:32:56,800 --> 02:32:58,389
not still be done, but because they all
got caught here, we relieve back to this

7178
02:32:58,389 --> 02:32:58,399
got caught here, we relieve back to this
 

7179
02:32:58,399 --> 02:33:00,150
got caught here, we relieve back to this
gray box. Right. The rotation is here

7180
02:33:00,150 --> 02:33:00,160
gray box. Right. The rotation is here
 

7181
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:02,710
gray box. Right. The rotation is here
now. Right over here. Rotation up under

7182
02:33:02,710 --> 02:33:02,720
now. Right over here. Rotation up under
 

7183
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:04,550
now. Right over here. Rotation up under
here. They should snap this. This is

7184
02:33:04,550 --> 02:33:04,560
here. They should snap this. This is
 

7185
02:33:04,560 --> 02:33:06,309
here. They should snap this. This is
your cover point for all your shorts.

7186
02:33:06,309 --> 02:33:06,319
your cover point for all your shorts.
 

7187
02:33:06,319 --> 02:33:08,150
your cover point for all your shorts.
But this is uh I would be slightly

7188
02:33:08,150 --> 02:33:08,160
But this is uh I would be slightly
 

7189
02:33:08,160 --> 02:33:11,030
But this is uh I would be slightly
concerned here.

7190
02:33:11,030 --> 02:33:11,040
concerned here.
 

7191
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:13,830
concerned here.
We made a new low on Delta and we didn't

7192
02:33:13,830 --> 02:33:13,840
We made a new low on Delta and we didn't
 

7193
02:33:13,840 --> 02:33:16,150
We made a new low on Delta and we didn't
make a new low on the chart which means

7194
02:33:16,150 --> 02:33:16,160
make a new low on the chart which means
 

7195
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:18,070
make a new low on the chart which means
we have passive buying taking place here

7196
02:33:18,070 --> 02:33:18,080
we have passive buying taking place here
 

7197
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:20,389
we have passive buying taking place here
because we had aggressive selling and we

7198
02:33:20,389 --> 02:33:20,399
because we had aggressive selling and we
 

7199
02:33:20,399 --> 02:33:21,830
because we had aggressive selling and we
have passive buying down there. Someone

7200
02:33:21,830 --> 02:33:21,840
have passive buying down there. Someone
 

7201
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:23,830
have passive buying down there. Someone
is starting to absorb this take down in

7202
02:33:23,830 --> 02:33:23,840
is starting to absorb this take down in
 

7203
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:26,309
is starting to absorb this take down in
front of 25,000 because Delta made a new

7204
02:33:26,309 --> 02:33:26,319
front of 25,000 because Delta made a new
 

7205
02:33:26,319 --> 02:33:28,790
front of 25,000 because Delta made a new
low and price did not. So you've

7206
02:33:28,790 --> 02:33:28,800
low and price did not. So you've
 

7207
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:30,710
low and price did not. So you've
definitely got absorption under there

7208
02:33:30,710 --> 02:33:30,720
definitely got absorption under there
 

7209
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:34,950
definitely got absorption under there
right now.

7210
02:33:34,950 --> 02:33:34,960

 

7211
02:33:34,960 --> 02:33:37,190

Uh I wouldn't say so Troy. I mean I mean

7212
02:33:37,190 --> 02:33:37,200
Uh I wouldn't say so Troy. I mean I mean
 

7213
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:42,230
Uh I wouldn't say so Troy. I mean I mean
we only missed it by a tick, right? Or

7214
02:33:42,230 --> 02:33:42,240
we only missed it by a tick, right? Or
 

7215
02:33:42,240 --> 02:33:44,790
we only missed it by a tick, right? Or
did we actually hit it? Look, 25.25

7216
02:33:44,790 --> 02:33:44,800
did we actually hit it? Look, 25.25
 

7217
02:33:44,800 --> 02:33:54,950
did we actually hit it? Look, 25.25
25,000 25,000 and one tick.

7218
02:33:54,950 --> 02:33:54,960

 

7219
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:58,230

The concept behind relief. Um

7220
02:33:58,230 --> 02:33:58,240
The concept behind relief. Um
 

7221
02:33:58,240 --> 02:34:02,309
The concept behind relief. Um
it's Yeah, absolutely. Okay. So why

7222
02:34:02,309 --> 02:34:02,319
it's Yeah, absolutely. Okay. So why
 

7223
02:34:02,319 --> 02:34:05,190
it's Yeah, absolutely. Okay. So why
why did we get relief here? Why didn't

7224
02:34:05,190 --> 02:34:05,200
why did we get relief here? Why didn't
 

7225
02:34:05,200 --> 02:34:08,070
why did we get relief here? Why didn't
we roll over here and do this? Because

7226
02:34:08,070 --> 02:34:08,080
we roll over here and do this? Because
 

7227
02:34:08,080 --> 02:34:10,309
we roll over here and do this? Because
at this level here, right, we've got

7228
02:34:10,309 --> 02:34:10,319
at this level here, right, we've got
 

7229
02:34:10,319 --> 02:34:12,790
at this level here, right, we've got
aggressive sellers, market sellers

7230
02:34:12,790 --> 02:34:12,800
aggressive sellers, market sellers
 

7231
02:34:12,800 --> 02:34:14,230
aggressive sellers, market sellers
trying to hammer the market down. But

7232
02:34:14,230 --> 02:34:14,240
trying to hammer the market down. But
 

7233
02:34:14,240 --> 02:34:16,870
trying to hammer the market down. But
what we also have is someone in this

7234
02:34:16,870 --> 02:34:16,880
what we also have is someone in this
 

7235
02:34:16,880 --> 02:34:19,510
what we also have is someone in this
region, probably an institution,

7236
02:34:19,510 --> 02:34:19,520
region, probably an institution,
 

7237
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:22,630
region, probably an institution,
passively or limit buying. And he's

7238
02:34:22,630 --> 02:34:22,640
passively or limit buying. And he's
 

7239
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:24,389
passively or limit buying. And he's
absorbing and absorbing and absorbing

7240
02:34:24,389 --> 02:34:24,399
absorbing and absorbing and absorbing
 

7241
02:34:24,399 --> 02:34:26,550
absorbing and absorbing and absorbing
and absorbing. And once the first one of

7242
02:34:26,550 --> 02:34:26,560
and absorbing. And once the first one of
 

7243
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:28,710
and absorbing. And once the first one of
these starts to cover, it's a rush to

7244
02:34:28,710 --> 02:34:28,720
these starts to cover, it's a rush to
 

7245
02:34:28,720 --> 02:34:30,389
these starts to cover, it's a rush to
cover. And that's what gives the relief

7246
02:34:30,389 --> 02:34:30,399
cover. And that's what gives the relief
 

7247
02:34:30,399 --> 02:34:32,150
cover. And that's what gives the relief
higher. And then what you get is

7248
02:34:32,150 --> 02:34:32,160
higher. And then what you get is
 

7249
02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:35,030
higher. And then what you get is
probably this guy here who becomes a

7250
02:34:35,030 --> 02:34:35,040
probably this guy here who becomes a
 

7251
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:37,110
probably this guy here who becomes a
limit seller up here because the best

7252
02:34:37,110 --> 02:34:37,120
limit seller up here because the best
 

7253
02:34:37,120 --> 02:34:39,910
limit seller up here because the best
trades to take are passive limit limit.

7254
02:34:39,910 --> 02:34:39,920
trades to take are passive limit limit.
 

7255
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:41,510
trades to take are passive limit limit.
The guys that get stuck are the guys

7256
02:34:41,510 --> 02:34:41,520
The guys that get stuck are the guys
 

7257
02:34:41,520 --> 02:34:44,070
The guys that get stuck are the guys
trying to sell the lows on a market

7258
02:34:44,070 --> 02:34:44,080
trying to sell the lows on a market
 

7259
02:34:44,080 --> 02:34:46,070
trying to sell the lows on a market
order, right? That's why you get relief.

7260
02:34:46,070 --> 02:34:46,080
order, right? That's why you get relief.
 

7261
02:34:46,080 --> 02:34:48,309
order, right? That's why you get relief.
It's when one side stuck and you get a

7262
02:34:48,309 --> 02:34:48,319
It's when one side stuck and you get a
 

7263
02:34:48,319 --> 02:34:50,469
It's when one side stuck and you get a
rush to cover. Imagine you've got one

7264
02:34:50,469 --> 02:34:50,479
rush to cover. Imagine you've got one
 

7265
02:34:50,479 --> 02:34:52,469
rush to cover. Imagine you've got one
guy thousand lot short, another guy

7266
02:34:52,469 --> 02:34:52,479
guy thousand lot short, another guy
 

7267
02:34:52,479 --> 02:34:54,070
guy thousand lot short, another guy
thousand lot short, another guy thousand

7268
02:34:54,070 --> 02:34:54,080
thousand lot short, another guy thousand
 

7269
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:56,870
thousand lot short, another guy thousand
lot short. All on market order, right?

7270
02:34:56,870 --> 02:34:56,880
lot short. All on market order, right?
 

7271
02:34:56,880 --> 02:34:59,190
lot short. All on market order, right?
Once the first one covers, it's a rush

7272
02:34:59,190 --> 02:34:59,200
Once the first one covers, it's a rush
 

7273
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:01,990
Once the first one covers, it's a rush
then because you got three 3,000 lots

7274
02:35:01,990 --> 02:35:02,000
then because you got three 3,000 lots
 

7275
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:03,670
then because you got three 3,000 lots
which need to cover and you get that

7276
02:35:03,670 --> 02:35:03,680
which need to cover and you get that
 

7277
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:20,710
which need to cover and you get that
rush up.

7278
02:35:20,710 --> 02:35:20,720

 

7279
02:35:20,720 --> 02:35:24,389

7303
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:53,830
I bet Yeah. Uh, the dude 2004. I bet it
has, man, because those gamma levels

7304
02:35:53,830 --> 02:35:53,840
has, man, because those gamma levels
 

7305
02:35:53,840 --> 02:35:55,910
has, man, because those gamma levels
have been coming in clutch.

7306
02:35:55,910 --> 02:35:55,920
have been coming in clutch.
 

7307
02:35:55,920 --> 02:35:59,270

Okay, back to 65. So that your value

7310
02:36:01,429 --> 02:36:01,439
Okay, back to 65. So that your value
 

7311
02:36:01,439 --> 02:36:05,910
Okay, back to 65. So that your value
area low now is right.

7312
02:36:05,910 --> 02:36:05,920
area low now is right.
 

7313
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:09,030
area low now is right.
No, it's not 65. It's 71.

7314
02:36:09,030 --> 02:36:09,040
No, it's not 65. It's 71.
 

7315
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:10,790
No, it's not 65. It's 71.
71. All right. This is value area low,

7316
02:36:10,790 --> 02:36:10,800
71. All right. This is value area low,
 

7317
02:36:10,800 --> 02:36:12,389
71. All right. This is value area low,
which is also previous day low. That's a

7318
02:36:12,389 --> 02:36:12,399
which is also previous day low. That's a
 

7319
02:36:12,399 --> 02:36:14,070
which is also previous day low. That's a
big overunder. Right now, you're

7320
02:36:14,070 --> 02:36:14,080
big overunder. Right now, you're
 

7321
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:16,150
big overunder. Right now, you're
starting to develop like this coiling.

7322
02:36:16,150 --> 02:36:16,160
starting to develop like this coiling.
 

7323
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:19,750
starting to develop like this coiling.
Look, three attempts to move lower here.

7324
02:36:19,750 --> 02:36:19,760
Look, three attempts to move lower here.
 

7325

Look, three attempts to move lower here.
This isn't good for shorts. One, two,

7326
02:36:22,870 --> 02:36:22,880
This isn't good for shorts. One, two,
 

7327
02:36:22,880 --> 02:36:25,270
This isn't good for shorts. One, two,
three. Higher, low, higher, low. If we

7328
02:36:25,270 --> 02:36:25,280
three. Higher, low, higher, low. If we
 

7329
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:26,790
three. Higher, low, higher, low. If we
start doing one of these, you will see

7330
02:36:26,790 --> 02:36:26,800
start doing one of these, you will see
 

7331
02:36:26,800 --> 02:36:28,630
start doing one of these, you will see
relief probably back into this range.

7332
02:36:28,630 --> 02:36:28,640
relief probably back into this range.
 

7333
02:36:28,640 --> 02:36:30,790
relief probably back into this range.
All right, so shorts are starting to get

7334
02:36:30,790 --> 02:36:30,800
All right, so shorts are starting to get
 

7335
02:36:30,800 --> 02:36:32,389
All right, so shorts are starting to get
themselves caught at these lows. If they

7336
02:36:32,389 --> 02:36:32,399
themselves caught at these lows. If they
 

7337
02:36:32,399 --> 02:36:34,630
themselves caught at these lows. If they
don't get a breakdown soon, they will

7338
02:36:34,630 --> 02:36:34,640
don't get a breakdown soon, they will
 

7339
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:36,070
don't get a breakdown soon, they will
find themselves caught at these lows.

7340
02:36:36,070 --> 02:36:36,080
find themselves caught at these lows.
 

7341
02:36:36,080 --> 02:36:37,429
find themselves caught at these lows.
They've had three attempts to move

They've had three attempts to move

02:36:37,439 --> 02:36:39,990
They've had three attempts to move
lower. They need a wash for their exit.

Imagine if you are a short seller, your

7346
02:36:42,230 --> 02:36:42,240
Imagine if you are a short seller, your
 

7347
02:36:42,240 --> 02:36:44,150
Imagine if you are a short seller, your
target is here. If you've been short and

7348
02:36:44,150 --> 02:36:44,160
target is here. If you've been short and
 

7349
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:46,630
target is here. If you've been short and
short and short and short and you don't

7350
02:36:46,630 --> 02:36:46,640
short and short and short and you don't
 

7351
02:36:46,640 --> 02:36:48,070
short and short and short and you don't
get that target and your average is

7352
02:36:48,070 --> 02:36:48,080
get that target and your average is
 

7353
02:36:48,080 --> 02:36:49,510
get that target and your average is
here, you're going to start to cover,

7354
02:36:49,510 --> 02:36:49,520
here, you're going to start to cover,
 

7355
02:36:49,520 --> 02:36:51,190
here, you're going to start to cover,
which causes the squeeze. All right? And

7356
02:36:51,190 --> 02:36:51,200
which causes the squeeze. All right? And
 

7357
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:52,550
which causes the squeeze. All right? And
then they're going to resell it from up

7358
02:36:52,550 --> 02:36:52,560
then they're going to resell it from up
 

7359
02:36:52,560 --> 02:36:54,790
then they're going to resell it from up
here. So, just be aware of that. If

7360
02:36:54,790 --> 02:36:54,800
here. So, just be aware of that. If
 

7361
02:36:54,800 --> 02:36:57,590
here. So, just be aware of that. If
shorts don't get a breakdown soon,

shorts don't get a breakdown soon,

I would be very very uh concerned for
 

7365
02:37:00,240 --> 02:37:01,830
I would be very very uh concerned for
those of you who are have been short and

those of you who are have been short and

02:37:03,510 --> 02:37:03,520
holding a runner. You want to see this
 

7369
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:04,870
holding a runner. You want to see this
breakdown soon. If it doesn't come soon,

7370
02:37:04,870 --> 02:37:04,880
breakdown soon. If it doesn't come soon,
 

7371
02:37:04,880 --> 02:37:09,590
breakdown soon. If it doesn't come soon,
I would just get out of it.

Fourth test. Yeah, they're try. They're

value on the day we haven't taken out
 

7411
02:37:56,319 --> 02:37:57,990
value on the day we haven't taken out
25,000. They're going to have one more

7412
02:37:57,990 --> 02:37:58,000
25,000. They're going to have one more
 

7413
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,309
25,000. They're going to have one more
attempt. They really need that. We're

02:38:00,309 --> 02:38:00,319
attempt. They really need that. We're
 

7415
02:38:00,319 --> 02:38:02,550
attempt. They really need that. We're
going gray box to gray box. Remember the

7416
02:38:02,550 --> 02:38:02,560
going gray box to gray box. Remember the
 

7417
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:06,630
going gray box to gray box. Remember the
cover point is under here.

7418

I I'm desperate for a P. Do you reckon I

7420
02:38:08,469 --> 02:38:08,479
I I'm desperate for a P. Do you reckon I
 

7421
02:38:08,479 --> 02:38:10,070
I I'm desperate for a P. Do you reckon I
can go for a P and make it back in time?

7422
02:38:10,070 --> 02:38:10,080
can go for a P and make it back in time?
 

7423
02:38:10,080 --> 02:39:23,349
can go for a P and make it back in time?
I'm going to try. Let's try.

7424
02:39:23,349 --> 02:39:23,359

 

7425
02:39:23,359 --> 02:39:25,270

They done it yet. They still not done

7426
02:39:25,270 --> 02:39:25,280
They done it yet. They still not done
 

7427
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:27,670
They done it yet. They still not done
it. Very close. Gray box again. It will

7428
02:39:27,670 --> 02:39:27,680
it. Very close. Gray box again. It will
 

7429
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:29,510
it. Very close. Gray box again. It will
come now. There's no way they come down

7430
02:39:29,510 --> 02:39:29,520
come now. There's no way they come down
 

7431
02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:30,870
come now. There's no way they come down
here and don't do it again. It will come

7432
02:39:30,870 --> 02:39:30,880
here and don't do it again. It will come
 

7433
02:39:30,880 --> 02:39:34,070
here and don't do it again. It will come
now. They will snap 25,000. You if

7434
02:39:34,070 --> 02:39:34,080
now. They will snap 25,000. You if
 

7435
02:39:34,080 --> 02:39:35,590
now. They will snap 25,000. You if
you're short, you must cover into this

7436
02:39:35,590 --> 02:39:35,600
you're short, you must cover into this
 

7437
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:37,110
you're short, you must cover into this
wash which is about to come. You

7438
02:39:37,110 --> 02:39:37,120
wash which is about to come. You
 

7439
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:38,710
wash which is about to come. You
absolutely must be covering into this

7440
02:39:38,710 --> 02:39:38,720
absolutely must be covering into this
 

7441
02:39:38,720 --> 02:39:43,110
absolutely must be covering into this
watch. They're going to snap it.

7442
02:39:43,110 --> 02:39:43,120

 

7443
02:39:43,120 --> 02:39:44,870

They

7444
02:39:44,870 --> 02:39:44,880
They
 

7445
02:39:44,880 --> 02:39:46,870
They
maybe they defend 20 here. They should

7446
02:39:46,870 --> 02:39:46,880
maybe they defend 20 here. They should
 

7447
02:39:46,880 --> 02:39:48,309
maybe they defend 20 here. They should
snap it and you must cover into the

7448
02:39:48,309 --> 02:39:48,319
snap it and you must cover into the
 

7449
02:39:48,319 --> 02:39:50,950
snap it and you must cover into the
wash. I cannot believe that they defend

7450
02:39:50,950 --> 02:39:50,960
wash. I cannot believe that they defend
 

7451
02:39:50,960 --> 02:39:53,590
wash. I cannot believe that they defend
this. No, no, no, no. Cannot believe

7452
02:39:53,590 --> 02:39:53,600
this. No, no, no, no. Cannot believe
 

7453
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:57,990
this. No, no, no, no. Cannot believe
that they do this.

7454
02:39:57,990 --> 02:39:58,000

 

7455
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,750

Got to defend 20 here. They don't defend

7456
02:39:59,750 --> 02:39:59,760
Got to defend 20 here. They don't defend
 

7457
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:01,750
Got to defend 20 here. They don't defend
20 here. There's a shove all the way up

7458
02:40:01,750 --> 02:40:01,760
20 here. There's a shove all the way up
 

7459
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:04,790
20 here. There's a shove all the way up
to 40 very quickly.

7460
02:40:04,790 --> 02:40:04,800
to 40 very quickly.
 

7461
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:06,550
to 40 very quickly.
I think they will defend 20 and wash

7462
02:40:06,550 --> 02:40:06,560
I think they will defend 20 and wash
 

7463
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:08,790
I think they will defend 20 and wash
this back down.

7464
02:40:08,790 --> 02:40:08,800
this back down.
 

7465
02:40:08,800 --> 02:40:10,469
this back down.
Trying to defend 20. Oh, they've got

7525
02:41:16,880 --> 02:41:19,429
you get really lucky, you get 800. But I
think that is a good chance that in the

think that is a good chance that in the
 

7527
02:41:19,439 --> 02:41:21,030
think that is a good chance that in the
next couple minutes, we see the end of

02:41:21,030 --> 02:41:21,040
next couple minutes, we see the end of
 

7529
02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:23,270
next couple minutes, we see the end of
the auction. All right. So, even there,

02:41:23,270 --> 02:41:23,280
the auction. All right. So, even there,

I called it for you. Even before this

02:41:24,870 --> 02:41:24,880
I called it for you. Even before this
 

7533
02:41:24,880 --> 02:41:26,070
I called it for you. Even before this
happened, I said, "Whoa, there's a big

7534
02:41:26,070 --> 02:41:26,080
happened, I said, "Whoa, there's a big
 

7535

going to go 20 to 40." Boom. Boom. All

Now, you can hold runners for bleeding,

7542
02:41:33,190 --> 02:41:33,200
Now, you can hold runners for bleeding,
 

7543
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:35,510
Now, you can hold runners for bleeding,
but I would not expect it. If you get

7544
02:41:35,510 --> 02:41:35,520
but I would not expect it. If you get
 

7545
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:38,309
but I would not expect it. If you get
down into the 800s, amazing. It's more

7546
02:41:38,309 --> 02:41:38,319
down into the 800s, amazing. It's more
 

7547
02:41:38,319 --> 02:41:40,630
down into the 800s, amazing. It's more
likely that they use the next trade

7548
02:41:40,630 --> 02:41:40,640
likely that they use the next trade
 

7549
02:41:40,640 --> 02:41:43,510
likely that they use the next trade
inside as the point at which shorts get

7550
02:41:43,510 --> 02:41:43,520
inside as the point at which shorts get
 

7551
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:45,990
inside as the point at which shorts get
trapped trying to play the 25,000 break.

play the long, you're going to have to
wait for it.

All right, like I said, if they start
reclaiming 25,000, you will probably see

7606
02:43:06,309 --> 02:43:06,319
reclaiming 25,000, you will probably see
 

7607
02:43:06,319 --> 02:43:08,230
reclaiming 25,000, you will probably see

02:43:16,870 --> 02:43:16,880
it it is it, but that is what they are
 

7617
02:43:16,880 --> 02:43:18,950
it it is it, but that is what they are
trying to do.

7618
02:43:18,950 --> 02:43:18,960
trying to do.
 

7619
02:43:18,960 --> 02:43:20,550
trying to do.
So, if there is not a break and a new

7620
02:43:20,550 --> 02:43:20,560
So, if there is not a break and a new
 

7621
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:22,710
So, if there is not a break and a new
low and they reclaim 25,000 here, you

7622
02:43:22,710 --> 02:43:22,720
low and they reclaim 25,000 here, you
 

7623
02:43:22,720 --> 02:43:27,190
low and they reclaim 25,000 here, you
will potentially see relief.

7624
02:43:27,190 --> 02:43:27,200

 

7625
02:43:27,200 --> 02:43:28,870

They've helped 25 good there. Actually,

7626
02:43:28,870 --> 02:43:28,880
They've helped 25 good there. Actually,
 

7627
02:43:28,880 --> 02:43:31,590
They've helped 25 good there. Actually,
it's a good hold. Let's see if they

7628
02:43:31,590 --> 02:43:31,600
it's a good hold. Let's see if they
 

7629
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:35,590
it's a good hold. Let's see if they
break lower. What's left to go for?

7630
02:43:35,590 --> 02:43:35,600
break lower. What's left to go for?
 

7631
02:43:35,600 --> 02:43:38,469
break lower. What's left to go for?
That's the only thing. Reclaim 25.

7632
02:43:38,469 --> 02:43:38,479
That's the only thing. Reclaim 25.
 

7633
02:43:38,479 --> 02:43:39,990
That's the only thing. Reclaim 25.
They're going to try relief. I think if

7634
02:43:39,990 --> 02:43:40,000
They're going to try relief. I think if
 

7635
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:41,349
They're going to try relief. I think if
they get through 20s, there's a bigger

7636
02:43:41,349 --> 02:43:41,359
they get through 20s, there's a bigger
 

7637
02:43:41,359 --> 02:43:42,790
they get through 20s, there's a bigger
squeeze to 40s. If they get through

7638
02:43:42,790 --> 02:43:42,800
squeeze to 40s. If they get through
 

7639
02:43:42,800 --> 02:43:48,309
squeeze to 40s. If they get through
that, it's 64s.

7640
02:43:48,309 --> 02:43:48,319

 

7641
02:43:48,319 --> 02:43:50,950

So, potential trigger long counter trend

7642
02:43:50,950 --> 02:43:50,960
So, potential trigger long counter trend
 

7643
02:43:50,960 --> 02:43:53,429
So, potential trigger long counter trend
or the end of auction trade. Here's the

7644
02:43:53,429 --> 02:43:53,439
or the end of auction trade. Here's the
 

7645
02:43:53,439 --> 02:43:54,950
or the end of auction trade. Here's the
move to 20s. If they get through this,

7646
02:43:54,950 --> 02:43:54,960
move to 20s. If they get through this,
 

7647
02:43:54,960 --> 02:43:59,429
move to 20s. If they get through this,
you go 40s. Here we go. Here we go.

7648
02:43:59,429 --> 02:43:59,439
you go 40s. Here we go. Here we go.
 

7649
02:43:59,439 --> 02:44:02,550
you go 40s. Here we go. Here we go.
Don't say I didn't [\h__\h] tell you. I

7650
02:44:02,550 --> 02:44:02,560
Don't say I didn't [\h__\h] tell you. I
 

7651
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:04,630
Don't say I didn't [\h__\h] tell you. I
don't want to hear anything like that. I

7652
02:44:04,630 --> 02:44:04,640
don't want to hear anything like that. I
 

7653
02:44:04,640 --> 02:44:06,230
don't want to hear anything like that. I
can't call this out ahead of time

7654
02:44:06,230 --> 02:44:06,240
can't call this out ahead of time
 

7655
02:44:06,240 --> 02:44:11,110
can't call this out ahead of time
enough. Okay, so here's 20s to 40s.

7656
02:44:11,110 --> 02:44:11,120
enough. Okay, so here's 20s to 40s.
 

7657
02:44:11,120 --> 02:44:13,510
enough. Okay, so here's 20s to 40s.
Relief here.

7658
02:44:13,510 --> 02:44:13,520
Relief here.
 

7659
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:15,670
Relief here.
Old imbalance right now is at 48. So

7660
02:44:15,670 --> 02:44:15,680
Old imbalance right now is at 48. So
 

7661
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:16,950
Old imbalance right now is at 48. So
they might come and test that. I would

7662
02:44:16,950 --> 02:44:16,960
they might come and test that. I would
 

7663
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:18,550
they might come and test that. I would
tell you now if we start popping through

7664
02:44:18,550 --> 02:44:18,560
tell you now if we start popping through
 

7665
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:20,870
tell you now if we start popping through
65, there is a bigger squeeze on on the

7666
02:44:20,870 --> 02:44:20,880
65, there is a bigger squeeze on on the
 

7667
02:44:20,880 --> 02:44:22,950
65, there is a bigger squeeze on on the
table here. So I think that is a good

7668
02:44:22,950 --> 02:44:22,960
table here. So I think that is a good
 

7669
02:44:22,960 --> 02:44:24,150
table here. So I think that is a good
chance that we've made the end of

7670
02:44:24,150 --> 02:44:24,160
chance that we've made the end of
 

7671
02:44:24,160 --> 02:44:26,389
chance that we've made the end of
auction. There's a good chance that this

7672
02:44:26,389 --> 02:44:26,399
auction. There's a good chance that this
 

7673
02:44:26,399 --> 02:44:28,630
auction. There's a good chance that this
can be the end of auction. Look at the

7674
02:44:28,630 --> 02:44:28,640
can be the end of auction. Look at the
 

7675
02:44:28,640 --> 02:44:29,990
can be the end of auction. Look at the
volume here. Look at the delta at the

7676
02:44:29,990 --> 02:44:30,000
volume here. Look at the delta at the
 

7677
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:31,910
volume here. Look at the delta at the
lows. Look at the squeeze out. Watch

7678
02:44:31,910 --> 02:44:31,920
lows. Look at the squeeze out. Watch
 

7679
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:35,830
lows. Look at the squeeze out. Watch
this node here.

7680
02:44:35,830 --> 02:44:35,840

 

7681
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:37,269

It's up to you if you want to trade the

7682
02:44:37,269 --> 02:44:37,279
It's up to you if you want to trade the
 

7683
02:44:37,279 --> 02:44:38,950
It's up to you if you want to trade the
counter trend squeeze, but I'm telling

7684
02:44:38,950 --> 02:44:38,960
counter trend squeeze, but I'm telling
 

7685
02:44:38,960 --> 02:44:40,469
counter trend squeeze, but I'm telling
you what I'm seeing right now. We're

7686
02:44:40,469 --> 02:44:40,479
you what I'm seeing right now. We're
 

7687
02:44:40,479 --> 02:44:42,150
you what I'm seeing right now. We're
into a low volume node. If we start

7688
02:44:42,150 --> 02:44:42,160
into a low volume node. If we start
 

7689
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:43,590
into a low volume node. If we start
getting through this and we get through

7690
02:44:43,590 --> 02:44:43,600
getting through this and we get through
 

7691
02:44:43,600 --> 02:44:45,269
getting through this and we get through
50s, we're going to go value area low.

7692
02:44:45,269 --> 02:44:45,279
50s, we're going to go value area low.
 

7693
02:44:45,279 --> 02:44:46,309
50s, we're going to go value area low.
If we get through that, we're going to

7694
02:44:46,309 --> 02:44:46,319
If we get through that, we're going to
 

7695
02:44:46,319 --> 02:44:48,309
If we get through that, we're going to
go straight back inside value for the

7696
02:44:48,309 --> 02:44:48,319
go straight back inside value for the
 

7697
02:44:48,319 --> 02:44:49,670
go straight back inside value for the
day.

7698
02:44:49,670 --> 02:44:49,680
day.
 

7699
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:51,190
day.
If you're if you're going to trade

7700
02:44:51,190 --> 02:44:51,200
If you're if you're going to trade
 

7701
02:44:51,200 --> 02:44:55,910
If you're if you're going to trade
counter trend, you must move stops into

7702
02:44:55,910 --> 02:44:55,920
counter trend, you must move stops into
 

7703
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:58,710
counter trend, you must move stops into
the money aggressively based on pivots.

7704
02:44:58,710 --> 02:44:58,720
the money aggressively based on pivots.
 

7705
02:44:58,720 --> 02:45:01,110
the money aggressively based on pivots.
All right.

7706
02:45:01,110 --> 02:45:01,120
All right.
 

7707
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:02,870
All right.
Is that the NASDAQ? Sorry, I'm new here.

7708
02:45:02,870 --> 02:45:02,880
Is that the NASDAQ? Sorry, I'm new here.
 

7709
02:45:02,880 --> 02:45:19,750
Is that the NASDAQ? Sorry, I'm new here.
Yeah, NQ. So futures not QQQ but yes.

7710
02:45:19,750 --> 02:45:19,760

 

7711
02:45:19,760 --> 02:45:22,070

So this shelf here I would say sellers

7712
02:45:22,070 --> 02:45:22,080
So this shelf here I would say sellers
 

7713
02:45:22,080 --> 02:45:24,070
So this shelf here I would say sellers
are caught under tens. If they defend

7714
02:45:24,070 --> 02:45:24,080
are caught under tens. If they defend
 

7715
02:45:24,080 --> 02:45:25,910
are caught under tens. If they defend
tens

7716
02:45:25,910 --> 02:45:25,920
tens
 

7717
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:28,550
tens
relief is possible. If they defend tens

7718
02:45:28,550 --> 02:45:28,560
relief is possible. If they defend tens
 

7719
02:45:28,560 --> 02:45:40,950
relief is possible. If they defend tens
relief is possible.

7720
02:45:40,950 --> 02:45:40,960

 

7721
02:45:40,960 --> 02:45:43,670

Uh for here I do it as two ticks, row

7722
02:45:43,670 --> 02:45:43,680
Uh for here I do it as two ticks, row
 

7723
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:45,670
Uh for here I do it as two ticks, row
size two. But if you want it as number

7724
02:45:45,670 --> 02:45:45,680
size two. But if you want it as number
 

7725
02:45:45,680 --> 02:45:47,510
size two. But if you want it as number
of rows, I would do it as a thousand.

7726
02:45:47,510 --> 02:45:47,520
of rows, I would do it as a thousand.
 

7727
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:50,389
of rows, I would do it as a thousand.
Right? So you could do it a th00and.

7728
02:45:50,389 --> 02:45:50,399
Right? So you could do it a th00and.
 

7729
02:45:50,399 --> 02:45:52,710
Right? So you could do it a th00and.
It's up to you. This would be the same.

7730
02:45:52,710 --> 02:45:52,720
It's up to you. This would be the same.
 

7731
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:55,269
It's up to you. This would be the same.
There you go. Same same. Right? But I I

7732
02:45:55,269 --> 02:45:55,279
There you go. Same same. Right? But I I
 

7733
02:45:55,279 --> 02:46:03,030
There you go. Same same. Right? But I I
tend to have it um set to ticks.

7734
02:46:03,030 --> 02:46:03,040

 

7735
02:46:03,040 --> 02:46:04,790

Two ticks because that actually matches

7736
02:46:04,790 --> 02:46:04,800
Two ticks because that actually matches
 

7737
02:46:04,800 --> 02:46:06,309
Two ticks because that actually matches
what I have on footprint. It's the main

7738
02:46:06,309 --> 02:46:06,319
what I have on footprint. It's the main
 

7739
02:46:06,319 --> 02:46:09,670
what I have on footprint. It's the main
reason.

7740
02:46:09,670 --> 02:46:09,680

 

7741
02:46:09,680 --> 02:46:11,349

Okay. They're not defending 10. So they

7742
02:46:11,349 --> 02:46:11,359
Okay. They're not defending 10. So they
 

7743
02:46:11,359 --> 02:46:12,550
Okay. They're not defending 10. So they
need to defend these lows. They don't

7744
02:46:12,550 --> 02:46:12,560
need to defend these lows. They don't
 

7745
02:46:12,560 --> 02:46:13,990
need to defend these lows. They don't
defend the lows. We will break down.

7746
02:46:13,990 --> 02:46:14,000
defend the lows. We will break down.
 

7747
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:15,830
defend the lows. We will break down.
They need to defend 25,000 now on a

7748
02:46:15,830 --> 02:46:15,840
They need to defend 25,000 now on a
 

7749
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:17,190
They need to defend 25,000 now on a
retest. Failing to do that will break

7750
02:46:17,190 --> 02:46:17,200
retest. Failing to do that will break
 

7751
02:46:17,200 --> 02:46:18,550
retest. Failing to do that will break
down new lows. Like I said, if you're

7752
02:46:18,550 --> 02:46:18,560
down new lows. Like I said, if you're
 

7753
02:46:18,560 --> 02:46:19,590
down new lows. Like I said, if you're
going to play counter trend, hardest

7754
02:46:19,590 --> 02:46:19,600
going to play counter trend, hardest
 

7755
02:46:19,600 --> 02:46:20,389
going to play counter trend, hardest
trade in the book, you're going to have

7756
02:46:20,389 --> 02:46:20,399
trade in the book, you're going to have
 

7757
02:46:20,399 --> 02:46:22,070
trade in the book, you're going to have
to be aggressive.

7758
02:46:22,070 --> 02:46:22,080
to be aggressive.
 

7759
02:46:22,080 --> 02:46:25,670
to be aggressive.
lock money in with my account setup. I

7760
02:46:25,670 --> 02:46:25,680
lock money in with my account setup. I
 

7761
02:46:25,680 --> 02:46:27,910
lock money in with my account setup. I
trade options on QQQ based off your

7762
02:46:27,910 --> 02:46:27,920
trade options on QQQ based off your
 

7763
02:46:27,920 --> 02:46:29,990
trade options on QQQ based off your
chart. Bit different game, but stop

7764
02:46:29,990 --> 02:46:30,000
chart. Bit different game, but stop
 

7765
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,309
chart. Bit different game, but stop
losses and profit targets because Greeks

7766
02:46:32,309 --> 02:46:32,319
losses and profit targets because Greeks
 

7767
02:46:32,319 --> 02:46:34,230
losses and profit targets because Greeks
and whatnot. Yeah, I mean it's the same.

7768
02:46:34,230 --> 02:46:34,240
and whatnot. Yeah, I mean it's the same.
 

7769
02:46:34,240 --> 02:46:36,389
and whatnot. Yeah, I mean it's the same.
It it's exactly the same, right? Like I

7770
02:46:36,389 --> 02:46:36,399
It it's exactly the same, right? Like I
 

7771
02:46:36,399 --> 02:46:37,990
It it's exactly the same, right? Like I
watch the cues. I'm watching it right

7772
02:46:37,990 --> 02:46:38,000
watch the cues. I'm watching it right
 

7773
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,389
watch the cues. I'm watching it right
now breaking down around those 603s. I

7774
02:46:40,389 --> 02:46:40,399
now breaking down around those 603s. I
 

7775
02:46:40,399 --> 02:46:41,750
now breaking down around those 603s. I
know if we break under here, we've got

7776
02:46:41,750 --> 02:46:41,760
know if we break under here, we've got
 

7777
02:46:41,760 --> 02:46:45,269
know if we break under here, we've got
the 602 and the 600 level. And I I also

7778
02:46:45,269 --> 02:46:45,279
the 602 and the 600 level. And I I also
 

7779
02:46:45,279 --> 02:46:49,830
the 602 and the 600 level. And I I also
know on spy 670 was a huge level of a

7780
02:46:49,830 --> 02:46:49,840
know on spy 670 was a huge level of a
 

7781
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:54,150
know on spy 670 was a huge level of a
huge put wall 670. So uh fix looks like

7782
02:46:54,150 --> 02:46:54,160
huge put wall 670. So uh fix looks like
 

7783
02:46:54,160 --> 02:46:55,349
huge put wall 670. So uh fix looks like
it's going to go again. So we might get

7784
02:46:55,349 --> 02:46:55,359
it's going to go again. So we might get
 

7785
02:46:55,359 --> 02:46:57,910
it's going to go again. So we might get
a new low here folks

7786
02:46:57,910 --> 02:46:57,920
a new low here folks
 

7787
02:46:57,920 --> 02:47:00,070
a new low here folks
and they are adding bids downside for

7788
02:47:00,070 --> 02:47:00,080
and they are adding bids downside for
 

7789
02:47:00,080 --> 02:47:01,670
and they are adding bids downside for
covers here. So maybe still breaking

7790
02:47:01,670 --> 02:47:01,680
covers here. So maybe still breaking
 

7791
02:47:01,680 --> 02:47:03,510
covers here. So maybe still breaking
down. Like I said I don't trade counter

7792
02:47:03,510 --> 02:47:03,520
down. Like I said I don't trade counter
 

7793
02:47:03,520 --> 02:47:07,269
down. Like I said I don't trade counter
trend squeezes but uh even that pop over

7794
02:47:07,269 --> 02:47:07,279
trend squeezes but uh even that pop over
 

7795
02:47:07,279 --> 02:47:09,910
trend squeezes but uh even that pop over
what did it offer you there? 35 points

7796
02:47:09,910 --> 02:47:09,920
what did it offer you there? 35 points
 

7797
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:12,550
what did it offer you there? 35 points
not bad.

7798
02:47:12,550 --> 02:47:12,560
not bad.
 

7799
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:13,830
not bad.
If you're going to play counter trend,

7800
02:47:13,830 --> 02:47:13,840
If you're going to play counter trend,
 

7801
02:47:13,840 --> 02:47:15,990
If you're going to play counter trend,
you'll be uh very very careful,

7802
02:47:15,990 --> 02:47:16,000
you'll be uh very very careful,
 

7803
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:20,630
you'll be uh very very careful,
especially in a washy market.

7804
02:47:20,630 --> 02:47:20,640

 

7805
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:22,150

Not much excess here. That's the only

7806
02:47:22,150 --> 02:47:22,160
Not much excess here. That's the only
 

7807
02:47:22,160 --> 02:47:23,590
Not much excess here. That's the only
thing. We need a wick like this

7808
02:47:23,590 --> 02:47:23,600
thing. We need a wick like this
 

7809
02:47:23,600 --> 02:47:25,670
thing. We need a wick like this
underneath. What would be really nice is

7810
02:47:25,670 --> 02:47:25,680
underneath. What would be really nice is
 

7811
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:29,910
underneath. What would be really nice is
a nice long wick like this with massive

7812
02:47:29,910 --> 02:47:29,920
a nice long wick like this with massive
 

7813
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:32,150
a nice long wick like this with massive
sellside delta in down here. That would

7814
02:47:32,150 --> 02:47:32,160
sellside delta in down here. That would
 

7815
02:47:32,160 --> 02:47:33,910
sellside delta in down here. That would
be really nice. And then this and this

7816
02:47:33,910 --> 02:47:33,920
be really nice. And then this and this
 

7817
02:47:33,920 --> 02:47:35,429
be really nice. And then this and this
and then you get that move. It' be

7818
02:47:35,429 --> 02:47:35,439
and then you get that move. It' be
 

7819
02:47:35,439 --> 02:47:38,550
and then you get that move. It' be
really, really good. Just kind of what

7820
02:47:38,550 --> 02:47:38,560
really, really good. Just kind of what
 

7821
02:47:38,560 --> 02:47:48,870
really, really good. Just kind of what
uh ES looks a bit more like.

7822
02:47:48,870 --> 02:47:48,880

 

7823
02:47:48,880 --> 02:47:52,389

25,000 again. They're reselling 25,000.

7824
02:47:52,389 --> 02:47:52,399
25,000 again. They're reselling 25,000.
 

7825
02:47:52,399 --> 02:47:53,830
25,000 again. They're reselling 25,000.
It's starting to look a little bit messy

7826
02:47:53,830 --> 02:47:53,840
It's starting to look a little bit messy
 

7827
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:55,190
It's starting to look a little bit messy
here. Oh, it's not surprising we're

7828
02:47:55,190 --> 02:47:55,200
here. Oh, it's not surprising we're
 

7829
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:56,230
here. Oh, it's not surprising we're
getting into lunch. Might get a

02:47:56,230 --> 02:47:56,240
getting into lunch. Might get a
 

7831
02:47:56,240 --> 02:48:01,269
getting into lunch. Might get a
lunchtime sort of relief.

7832
02:48:01,269 --> 02:48:01,279

 

7833
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:03,030

You know, if they've all been slamming

7834
02:48:03,030 --> 02:48:03,040
You know, if they've all been slamming
 

7835
02:48:03,040 --> 02:48:05,429
You know, if they've all been slamming
puts all morning, do they cover them

7836
02:48:05,429 --> 02:48:05,439
puts all morning, do they cover them
 

7837
02:48:05,439 --> 02:48:07,670
puts all morning, do they cover them
into lunch? I don't know. I don't know.

02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:56,870
covering down here, but you are not a
new money short down here. You will get

7884
02:48:56,870 --> 02:48:56,880
new money short down here. You will get
 

7885
02:48:56,880 --> 02:48:59,110
new money short down here. You will get
stuck. I promise you. Unless you get

7886
02:48:59,110 --> 02:48:59,120
stuck. I promise you. Unless you get
 

7887
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:01,030
stuck. I promise you. Unless you get
very lucky and it does this, but we

7888
02:49:01,030 --> 02:49:01,040
very lucky and it does this, but we
 

7889
02:49:01,040 --> 02:49:02,790
very lucky and it does this, but we
don't trade based on luck. We trade

7890
02:49:02,790 --> 02:49:02,800
don't trade based on luck. We trade
 

7891
02:49:02,800 --> 02:49:05,269
don't trade based on luck. We trade
based on stats. This is getting tighter

7892
02:49:05,269 --> 02:49:05,279
based on stats. This is getting tighter
 

7893
02:49:05,279 --> 02:49:06,950
based on stats. This is getting tighter
and tighter and tighter. At some point,

7894
02:49:06,950 --> 02:49:06,960
and tighter and tighter. At some point,
 

7895
02:49:06,960 --> 02:49:08,710
and tighter and tighter. At some point,
they will come topside. All right. At

7896
02:49:08,710 --> 02:49:08,720
they will come topside. All right. At
 

7897
02:49:08,720 --> 02:49:10,389
they will come topside. All right. At
some point, too many are likely to get

02:49:10,389 --> 02:49:10,399
some point, too many are likely to get
 

7899
02:49:10,399 --> 02:49:12,469
some point, too many are likely to get
stuck and they will come topside. Do not

7900
02:49:12,469 --> 02:49:12,479
stuck and they will come topside. Do not
 

7901
02:49:12,479 --> 02:49:18,070
stuck and they will come topside. Do not

7931
02:50:08,080 --> 02:50:10,630
they get through that value, I'm very
tempted to start joining here for that

[snorts] See if they hold a dip here

7956
02:50:38,630 --> 02:50:38,640
[snorts] See if they hold a dip here
 

7957
02:50:38,640 --> 02:50:40,550
[snorts] See if they hold a dip here
into this low volume node. If we get

7958
02:50:40,550 --> 02:50:40,560
into this low volume node. If we get
 

7959
02:50:40,560 --> 02:50:42,150
into this low volume node. If we get
through this, I think the squeeze out

7960
02:50:42,150 --> 02:50:42,160
through this, I think the squeeze out
 

7961
02:50:42,160 --> 02:50:43,910
through this, I think the squeeze out
into this gray box. Value area low right

7962
02:50:43,910 --> 02:50:43,920
into this gray box. Value area low right
 

7963
02:50:43,920 --> 02:50:45,990
into this gray box. Value area low right
now is 60. They will need to hold dips

7964
02:50:45,990 --> 02:50:46,000
now is 60. They will need to hold dips
 

7965
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:49,269
now is 60. They will need to hold dips
into sort of 20s and 18s for me to

7966
02:50:49,269 --> 02:50:49,279
into sort of 20s and 18s for me to
 

7967
02:50:49,279 --> 02:50:51,429
into sort of 20s and 18s for me to
consider adding otherwise not

7968
02:50:51,429 --> 02:50:51,439
consider adding otherwise not
 

7969
02:50:51,439 --> 02:50:53,269
consider adding otherwise not
interested. Already paying myself along

7970
02:50:53,269 --> 02:50:53,279
interested. Already paying myself along
 

7971
02:50:53,279 --> 02:50:55,269
interested. Already paying myself along
the way. I'm not looking for too much

7972
02:50:55,269 --> 02:50:55,279
the way. I'm not looking for too much
 

7973
02:50:55,279 --> 02:50:56,950
the way. I'm not looking for too much
because it's counter trend. Right here's

7974
02:50:56,950 --> 02:50:56,960
because it's counter trend. Right here's
 

7975
02:50:56,960 --> 02:50:59,670
because it's counter trend. Right here's
the dip. So you want this to hold 18s.

7976
02:50:59,670 --> 02:50:59,680
the dip. So you want this to hold 18s.
 

7977
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:00,950
the dip. So you want this to hold 18s.
Now if they're really going to give

7978
02:51:00,950 --> 02:51:00,960
Now if they're really going to give
 

7979
02:51:00,960 --> 02:51:03,110
Now if they're really going to give
relief they have to hold 18s. You would

7980
02:51:03,110 --> 02:51:03,120
relief they have to hold 18s. You would
 

7981
02:51:03,120 --> 02:51:04,630
relief they have to hold 18s. You would
not want this little You can't even see

7982
02:51:04,630 --> 02:51:04,640
not want this little You can't even see
 

7983
02:51:04,640 --> 02:51:06,469
not want this little You can't even see
it on here. It's annoying. You There is

7984
02:51:06,469 --> 02:51:06,479
it on here. It's annoying. You There is
 

7985
02:51:06,479 --> 02:51:08,710
it on here. It's annoying. You There is
a little shelf at sort of 20s. You don't

7986
02:51:08,710 --> 02:51:08,720
a little shelf at sort of 20s. You don't
 

7987
02:51:08,720 --> 02:51:12,309
a little shelf at sort of 20s. You don't
want that to give. This is actually

7988
02:51:12,309 --> 02:51:12,319
want that to give. This is actually
 

7989
02:51:12,319 --> 02:51:15,349
want that to give. This is actually
here. Here we go, folks. Nice. And let's

7990
02:51:15,349 --> 02:51:15,359
here. Here we go, folks. Nice. And let's
 

7991
02:51:15,359 --> 02:51:18,790
here. Here we go, folks. Nice. And let's
see if we can get up to 61s here.

7992
02:51:18,790 --> 02:51:18,800
see if we can get up to 61s here.
 

7993
02:51:18,800 --> 02:51:20,309
see if we can get up to 61s here.
There's a little sellside imbalance here

7994
02:51:20,309 --> 02:51:20,319
There's a little sellside imbalance here
 

7995
02:51:20,319 --> 02:51:21,750
There's a little sellside imbalance here
at 50. So, if you want to cover some

7996
02:51:21,750 --> 02:51:21,760
at 50. So, if you want to cover some
 

7997
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:23,349
at 50. So, if you want to cover some
into this or sell some into this, you

7998
02:51:23,349 --> 02:51:23,359
into this or sell some into this, you
 

7999
02:51:23,359 --> 02:51:25,030
into this or sell some into this, you
can. We're looking for value area low.

8000
02:51:25,030 --> 02:51:25,040
can. We're looking for value area low.
 

8001
02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:27,349
can. We're looking for value area low.
Remember, it's counter trend squeeze.

8002
02:51:27,349 --> 02:51:27,359
Remember, it's counter trend squeeze.
 

8003
02:51:27,359 --> 02:51:29,190
Remember, it's counter trend squeeze.
Once we get over value area low, if we

8004
02:51:29,190 --> 02:51:29,200
Once we get over value area low, if we
 

8005
02:51:29,200 --> 02:51:31,750
Once we get over value area low, if we
find acceptance over 60, we can actually

8006
02:51:31,750 --> 02:51:31,760
find acceptance over 60, we can actually
 

8007
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:34,790
find acceptance over 60, we can actually
think about a trade back upside. Um, if

8008
02:51:34,790 --> 02:51:34,800
think about a trade back upside. Um, if
 

8009
02:51:34,800 --> 02:51:38,790
think about a trade back upside. Um, if
we get acceptance over 60, right, we can

8010
02:51:38,790 --> 02:51:38,800
we get acceptance over 60, right, we can
 

8011
02:51:38,800 --> 02:51:40,790
we get acceptance over 60, right, we can
think about that move up here. And then

8012
02:51:40,790 --> 02:51:40,800
think about that move up here. And then
 

8013
02:51:40,800 --> 02:51:43,030
think about that move up here. And then
we can think about reselling it up here

8014
02:51:43,030 --> 02:51:43,040
we can think about reselling it up here
 

8015
02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:51,349
we can think about reselling it up here
back down.

8016
02:51:51,349 --> 02:51:51,359

 

8017
02:51:51,359 --> 02:51:52,950

Getting stuck at these 50s right now.

8018
02:51:52,950 --> 02:51:52,960
Getting stuck at these 50s right now.
 

8019
02:51:52,960 --> 02:51:54,550
Getting stuck at these 50s right now.
Big the big seller trying to come in. I

8020
02:51:54,550 --> 02:51:54,560
Big the big seller trying to come in. I
 

8021
02:51:54,560 --> 02:51:55,590
Big the big seller trying to come in. I
don't think he's going to get his way,

8022
02:51:55,590 --> 02:51:55,600
don't think he's going to get his way,
 

8023
02:51:55,600 --> 02:51:57,349
don't think he's going to get his way,
but we're into a big node. So now I want

8024
02:51:57,349 --> 02:51:57,359
but we're into a big node. So now I want
 

8025
02:51:57,359 --> 02:51:59,830
but we're into a big node. So now I want
it to hold 40s really. I don't really

8026
02:51:59,830 --> 02:51:59,840
it to hold 40s really. I don't really
 

8027
02:51:59,840 --> 02:52:02,230
it to hold 40s really. I don't really
want to go in that low volume node. 37s,

8028
02:52:02,230 --> 02:52:02,240
want to go in that low volume node. 37s,
 

8029
02:52:02,240 --> 02:52:03,830
want to go in that low volume node. 37s,
let's say. Don't want it under 37s on

8030
02:52:03,830 --> 02:52:03,840
let's say. Don't want it under 37s on
 

8031
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:05,830
let's say. Don't want it under 37s on
this runner. And I'm happy to add back

8032
02:52:05,830 --> 02:52:05,840
this runner. And I'm happy to add back
 

8033
02:52:05,840 --> 02:52:09,190
this runner. And I'm happy to add back
in if we base over value.

8034
02:52:09,190 --> 02:52:09,200
in if we base over value.
 

8035
02:52:09,200 --> 02:52:10,389
in if we base over value.
Coming in. You're going to take me out,

8036
02:52:10,389 --> 02:52:10,399
Coming in. You're going to take me out,
 

8037
02:52:10,399 --> 02:52:12,550
Coming in. You're going to take me out,
aren't you? You prick. Okay. So, it's

8038
02:52:12,550 --> 02:52:12,560
aren't you? You prick. Okay. So, it's
 

8039
02:52:12,560 --> 02:52:14,469
aren't you? You prick. Okay. So, it's
going to go back down into these 20s

8040
02:52:14,469 --> 02:52:14,479
going to go back down into these 20s
 

8041
02:52:14,479 --> 02:52:16,950
going to go back down into these 20s
again to pick up this imbalance that it

8042
02:52:16,950 --> 02:52:16,960
again to pick up this imbalance that it
 

8043
02:52:16,960 --> 02:52:19,190
again to pick up this imbalance that it
left. Can always add back in if I want.

8044
02:52:19,190 --> 02:52:19,200
left. Can always add back in if I want.
 

8045
02:52:19,200 --> 02:52:20,630
left. Can always add back in if I want.
But this is why if I'm going to trade

8046
02:52:20,630 --> 02:52:20,640
But this is why if I'm going to trade
 

8047
02:52:20,640 --> 02:52:24,469
But this is why if I'm going to trade
counter trend, I'm very careful.

8048
02:52:24,469 --> 02:52:24,479
counter trend, I'm very careful.
 

8049
02:52:24,479 --> 02:52:26,630
counter trend, I'm very careful.

[laughter]
You [\h__\h] And we're into lunchtime.

8068
02:52:44,870 --> 02:52:44,880
You [\h__\h] And we're into lunchtime.
 

8069
02:52:44,880 --> 02:52:46,469
You [\h__\h] And we're into lunchtime.
We're going to do Apex giveaway here as

8070
02:52:46,469 --> 02:52:46,479
We're going to do Apex giveaway here as
 

8071
02:52:46,479 --> 02:52:49,030
We're going to do Apex giveaway here as
well. Give me just a second for this

8072
02:52:49,030 --> 02:52:49,040
well. Give me just a second for this
 

8073
02:52:49,040 --> 02:52:51,910
well. Give me just a second for this
just in case I want to pick it up again.

8074
02:52:51,910 --> 02:52:51,920
just in case I want to pick it up again.
 

8075
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:53,590
just in case I want to pick it up again.
Not liking what I'm seeing now. Let's

8076
02:52:53,590 --> 02:52:53,600
Not liking what I'm seeing now. Let's
 

8077
02:52:53,600 --> 02:53:07,110
Not liking what I'm seeing now. Let's
just see.

8078
02:53:07,110 --> 02:53:07,120

 

8079
02:53:07,120 --> 02:53:08,630

Waiting to see. There's a there's an

8080
02:53:08,630 --> 02:53:08,640
Waiting to see. There's a there's an
 

8081
02:53:08,640 --> 02:53:10,950
Waiting to see. There's a there's an
imbalance here that I'm looking at. I

8082
02:53:10,950 --> 02:53:10,960
imbalance here that I'm looking at. I
 

8083
02:53:10,960 --> 02:53:12,389
imbalance here that I'm looking at. I
still don't love the excess, but there's

8084
02:53:12,389 --> 02:53:12,399
still don't love the excess, but there's
 

8085
02:53:12,399 --> 02:53:14,070
still don't love the excess, but there's
an imbalance here. So, if they do this,

8086
02:53:14,070 --> 02:53:14,080
an imbalance here. So, if they do this,
 

8087
02:53:14,080 --> 02:53:16,150
an imbalance here. So, if they do this,
I'm interested. If if they slice through

8088
02:53:16,150 --> 02:53:16,160
I'm interested. If if they slice through
 

8089
02:53:16,160 --> 02:53:17,830
I'm interested. If if they slice through
it, there's no play for me. They're

8090
02:53:17,830 --> 02:53:17,840
it, there's no play for me. They're
 

8091
02:53:17,840 --> 02:53:19,910
it, there's no play for me. They're
coming into it now. Now, I want one more

8092
02:53:19,910 --> 02:53:19,920
coming into it now. Now, I want one more
 

8093
02:53:19,920 --> 02:53:21,269
coming into it now. Now, I want one more
little bit to fill, which they've now

8094
02:53:21,269 --> 02:53:21,279
little bit to fill, which they've now
 

8095
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:23,429
little bit to fill, which they've now
filled. If they slice this lower day, so

8096
02:53:23,429 --> 02:53:23,439
filled. If they slice this lower day, so
 

8097
02:53:23,439 --> 02:53:24,710
filled. If they slice this lower day, so
they need to absorb right here right

8098
02:53:24,710 --> 02:53:24,720
they need to absorb right here right
 

8099
02:53:24,720 --> 02:53:27,510
they need to absorb right here right
now. Don't like what I'm seeing. No, no,

8100
02:53:27,510 --> 02:53:27,520
now. Don't like what I'm seeing. No, no,
 

8101
02:53:27,520 --> 02:53:29,750
now. Don't like what I'm seeing. No, no,
no, no, no, no. Leave alone. Excellent

8102
02:53:29,750 --> 02:53:29,760
no, no, no, no. Leave alone. Excellent
 

8103
02:53:29,760 --> 02:53:31,110
no, no, no, no. Leave alone. Excellent
still involved. We can wait for a

8104
02:53:31,110 --> 02:53:31,120
still involved. We can wait for a
 

8105
02:53:31,120 --> 02:53:39,190
still involved. We can wait for a
reclaim.

8106
02:53:39,190 --> 02:53:39,200

 

8107
02:53:39,200 --> 02:53:44,150

Yeah, you guys are early. [laughter]

8108
02:53:44,150 --> 02:53:44,160

 

8109
02:53:44,160 --> 02:53:46,070

You typing the code in for We haven't

8110
02:53:46,070 --> 02:53:46,080
You typing the code in for We haven't
 

8111
02:53:46,080 --> 02:53:48,230
You typing the code in for We haven't
even said it yet. We can do it now. I'm

8112
02:53:48,230 --> 02:53:48,240
even said it yet. We can do it now. I'm
 

8113
02:53:48,240 --> 02:53:50,389
even said it yet. We can do it now. I'm
like I was out of that trade. It like I

8114
02:53:50,389 --> 02:53:50,399
like I was out of that trade. It like I
 

8115
02:53:50,399 --> 02:53:51,910
like I was out of that trade. It like I
said probably go lower a day now once it

8116
02:53:51,910 --> 02:53:51,920
said probably go lower a day now once it
 

8117
02:53:51,920 --> 02:53:53,429
said probably go lower a day now once it
lost that imbalance. They had a chance

8118
02:53:53,429 --> 02:53:53,439
lost that imbalance. They had a chance
 

8119
02:53:53,439 --> 02:53:54,870
lost that imbalance. They had a chance
to hold that little shelf. It's really

8120
02:53:54,870 --> 02:53:54,880
to hold that little shelf. It's really
 

8121
02:53:54,880 --> 02:53:57,429
to hold that little shelf. It's really
annoying. You can't really see, but if I

8122
02:53:57,429 --> 02:53:57,439
annoying. You can't really see, but if I
 

8123
02:53:57,439 --> 02:54:01,030
annoying. You can't really see, but if I
show you

8124
02:54:01,030 --> 02:54:01,040

 

8125
02:54:01,040 --> 02:54:05,190

22s basically on the tick, there's like

8126
02:54:05,190 --> 02:54:05,200
22s basically on the tick, there's like
 

8127
02:54:05,200 --> 02:54:07,750
22s basically on the tick, there's like
this here. All they needed to do was

8128
02:54:07,750 --> 02:54:07,760
this here. All they needed to do was
 

8129
02:54:07,760 --> 02:54:11,510
this here. All they needed to do was
hold that and they failed. So now this

8130
02:54:11,510 --> 02:54:11,520
hold that and they failed. So now this
 

8131
02:54:11,520 --> 02:54:12,790
hold that and they failed. So now this
is looking more and more likely. We

8132
02:54:12,790 --> 02:54:12,800
is looking more and more likely. We
 

8133
02:54:12,800 --> 02:54:14,309
is looking more and more likely. We
still don't have huge amount of excess

8134
02:54:14,309 --> 02:54:14,319
still don't have huge amount of excess
 

8135
02:54:14,319 --> 02:54:17,670
still don't have huge amount of excess
here. So we did catch some at the lows.

8136
02:54:17,670 --> 02:54:17,680
here. So we did catch some at the lows.
 

8137
02:54:17,680 --> 02:54:21,429
here. So we did catch some at the lows.
Like the sell candles was 356 delta, 134

8138
02:54:21,429 --> 02:54:21,439
Like the sell candles was 356 delta, 134
 

8139
02:54:21,439 --> 02:54:23,590
Like the sell candles was 356 delta, 134
delta before we turned around. We're

8140
02:54:23,590 --> 02:54:23,600
delta before we turned around. We're
 

8141
02:54:23,600 --> 02:54:26,870
delta before we turned around. We're
into lunchtime now as well. So, you

8142
02:54:26,870 --> 02:54:26,880
into lunchtime now as well. So, you
 

8143
02:54:26,880 --> 02:54:28,469
into lunchtime now as well. So, you
know, main trend is down on the day. The

8144
02:54:28,469 --> 02:54:28,479
know, main trend is down on the day. The
 

8145
02:54:28,479 --> 02:54:29,910
know, main trend is down on the day. The
easier trade is lower, but I don't want

8146
02:54:29,910 --> 02:54:29,920
easier trade is lower, but I don't want
 

8147
02:54:29,920 --> 02:54:32,710
easier trade is lower, but I don't want
to sell lower day.

8148
02:54:32,710 --> 02:54:32,720
to sell lower day.
 

8149
02:54:32,720 --> 02:54:34,550
to sell lower day.
I'm already out. Like I said, if it if

8150
02:54:34,550 --> 02:54:34,560
I'm already out. Like I said, if it if
 

8151
02:54:34,560 --> 02:54:37,510
I'm already out. Like I said, if it if
it I was out. I was selling into that

8152
02:54:37,510 --> 02:54:37,520
it I was out. I was selling into that
 

8153
02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:40,309
it I was out. I was selling into that
move of 50 and I was fully out. If it

8154
02:54:40,309 --> 02:54:40,319
move of 50 and I was fully out. If it
 

8155
02:54:40,319 --> 02:54:41,990
move of 50 and I was fully out. If it
couldn't hold that imbalance in 20s and

8156
02:54:41,990 --> 02:54:42,000
couldn't hold that imbalance in 20s and
 

8157
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:43,510
couldn't hold that imbalance in 20s and
the teens, like I said, if it can't hold

8158
02:54:43,510 --> 02:54:43,520
the teens, like I said, if it can't hold
 

8159
02:54:43,520 --> 02:54:45,590
the teens, like I said, if it can't hold
it, I'm not going to hold on to it. It's

8160
02:54:45,590 --> 02:54:45,600
it, I'm not going to hold on to it. It's
 

8161
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:55,190
it, I'm not going to hold on to it. It's
gone. The trade's gone. Been and gone.

8162
02:54:55,190 --> 02:54:55,200

 

8163
02:54:55,200 --> 02:54:56,950

Yeah, Peter. Yeah. Yeah. The last stop

8164
02:54:56,950 --> 02:54:56,960
Yeah, Peter. Yeah. Yeah. The last stop
 

8165
02:54:56,960 --> 02:55:00,070
Yeah, Peter. Yeah. Yeah. The last stop
today would be this down here. Um, let's

8166
02:55:00,070 --> 02:55:00,080
today would be this down here. Um, let's
 

8167
02:55:00,080 --> 02:55:02,070
today would be this down here. Um, let's
go over that now. If they if they're

8168
02:55:02,070 --> 02:55:02,080
go over that now. If they if they're
 

8169
02:55:02,080 --> 02:55:03,349
go over that now. If they if they're
really going to do that move, I'm

8170
02:55:03,349 --> 02:55:03,359
really going to do that move, I'm
 

8171
02:55:03,359 --> 02:55:05,190
really going to do that move, I'm
somewhat surprised, but if they're

8172
02:55:05,190 --> 02:55:05,200
somewhat surprised, but if they're
 

8173
02:55:05,200 --> 02:55:07,429
somewhat surprised, but if they're
really going to do that move, that would

8174
02:55:07,429 --> 02:55:07,439
really going to do that move, that would
 

8175
02:55:07,439 --> 02:55:09,269
really going to do that move, that would
be the last stop. Let's just put a fib

8176
02:55:09,269 --> 02:55:09,279
be the last stop. Let's just put a fib
 

8177
02:55:09,279 --> 02:55:10,950
be the last stop. Let's just put a fib
in as well. Just make sure we see where

8178
02:55:10,950 --> 02:55:10,960
in as well. Just make sure we see where
 

8179
02:55:10,960 --> 02:55:14,630
in as well. Just make sure we see where
this 61 is as well.

8180
02:55:14,630 --> 02:55:14,640
this 61 is as well.
 

8181
02:55:14,640 --> 02:55:17,590
this 61 is as well.
All right. I'd watch 900.

8182
02:55:17,590 --> 02:55:17,600
All right. I'd watch 900.
 

8183
02:55:17,600 --> 02:55:21,750
All right. I'd watch 900.
What's the edge of this shelf?

8184
02:55:21,750 --> 02:55:21,760

 

8185
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:25,510

I'd watch 940 and 900 900 to the 61 of

8186
02:55:25,510 --> 02:55:25,520
I'd watch 940 and 900 900 to the 61 of
 

8187
02:55:25,520 --> 02:55:27,750
I'd watch 940 and 900 900 to the 61 of
the daily swing move from so from the

8188
02:55:27,750 --> 02:55:27,760
the daily swing move from so from the
 

8189
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:30,150
the daily swing move from so from the
low of November to the high that we put

8190
02:55:30,150 --> 02:55:30,160
low of November to the high that we put
 

8191
02:55:30,160 --> 02:55:33,910
low of November to the high that we put
in that peak high. I'd watch that move

8192
02:55:33,910 --> 02:55:33,920
in that peak high. I'd watch that move
 

8193
02:55:33,920 --> 02:55:36,630
in that peak high. I'd watch that move
where we are now all the way down to

8194
02:55:36,630 --> 02:55:36,640
where we are now all the way down to
 

8195
02:55:36,640 --> 02:55:38,950
where we are now all the way down to
909. If we fail that, I'd be watching

8196
02:55:38,950 --> 02:55:38,960
909. If we fail that, I'd be watching
 

8197
02:55:38,960 --> 02:55:42,150
909. If we fail that, I'd be watching
this node. Okay, so those are the two

8198
02:55:42,150 --> 02:55:42,160
this node. Okay, so those are the two
 

8199
02:55:42,160 --> 02:55:43,830
this node. Okay, so those are the two
levels. So you could mark it out. So I'd

8200
02:55:43,830 --> 02:55:43,840
levels. So you could mark it out. So I'd
 

8201
02:55:43,840 --> 02:55:48,150
levels. So you could mark it out. So I'd
mark out 900. I'd mark out 992 and I'd

8202
02:55:48,150 --> 02:55:48,160
mark out 900. I'd mark out 992 and I'd
 

8203
02:55:48,160 --> 02:55:51,110
mark out 900. I'd mark out 992 and I'd
mark out 809s. Just call it 810s. That's

8204
02:55:51,110 --> 02:55:51,120
mark out 809s. Just call it 810s. That's
 

8205
02:55:51,120 --> 02:55:52,790
mark out 809s. Just call it 810s. That's
what I'd mark out. Those are the those

8206
02:55:52,790 --> 02:55:52,800
what I'd mark out. Those are the those
 

8207
02:55:52,800 --> 02:55:54,950
what I'd mark out. Those are the those
are the sort of areas that I think you

8208
02:55:54,950 --> 02:55:54,960
are the sort of areas that I think you
 

8209
02:55:54,960 --> 02:56:02,230
are the sort of areas that I think you
could think about. Um you know how

8210
02:56:02,230 --> 02:56:02,240

 

8211
02:56:02,240 --> 02:56:03,590

just want to measure this. Sorry folks.

8212
02:56:03,590 --> 02:56:03,600
just want to measure this. Sorry folks.
 

8213
02:56:03,600 --> 02:56:04,790
just want to measure this. Sorry folks.
Give me a second. So we're rejecting

8214
02:56:04,790 --> 02:56:04,800

8636
03:05:18,150 --> 03:05:18,160
bar. So, what I look for is things like
 

8637
03:05:18,160 --> 03:05:22,070
bar. So, what I look for is things like
this at the lows, right? If I want a low

8638
03:05:22,070 --> 03:05:22,080
this at the lows, right? If I want a low
 

8639
03:05:22,080 --> 03:05:23,990
this at the lows, right? If I want a low
of day, I'd want a nice long wick. And

8640
03:05:23,990 --> 03:05:24,000
of day, I'd want a nice long wick. And
 

8641
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:25,830
of day, I'd want a nice long wick. And
in here at the lows, I'd want it to be

8642
03:05:25,830 --> 03:05:25,840
in here at the lows, I'd want it to be
 

8643
03:05:25,840 --> 03:05:28,309
in here at the lows, I'd want it to be
all sellside delta. And the way I would

8644
03:05:28,309 --> 03:05:28,319
all sellside delta. And the way I would
 

8645
03:05:28,319 --> 03:05:30,950
all sellside delta. And the way I would
really see that and it doesn't look very

8646
03:05:30,950 --> 03:05:30,960
really see that and it doesn't look very
 

8647
03:05:30,960 --> 03:05:33,590
really see that and it doesn't look very
good. You out. See you later. All right,

8648
03:05:33,590 --> 03:05:33,600
good. You out. See you later. All right,
 

8649
03:05:33,600 --> 03:05:35,590
good. You out. See you later. All right,
darling. This actually doesn't look very

8650
03:05:35,590 --> 03:05:35,600
darling. This actually doesn't look very
 

8651
03:05:35,600 --> 03:05:36,870
darling. This actually doesn't look very
good for an end of auction because this

8652
03:05:36,870 --> 03:05:36,880
good for an end of auction because this
 

8653
03:05:36,880 --> 03:05:38,950
good for an end of auction because this
is buy side delta at the low. We don't

8654
03:05:38,950 --> 03:05:38,960
is buy side delta at the low. We don't
 

8655
03:05:38,960 --> 03:05:40,309
is buy side delta at the low. We don't
actually want to see that. What we want

8656
03:05:40,309 --> 03:05:40,319
actually want to see that. What we want
 

8657
03:05:40,319 --> 03:05:43,590
actually want to see that. What we want
to see is this sellside delta all the

8658
03:05:43,590 --> 03:05:43,600
to see is this sellside delta all the
 

8659
03:05:43,600 --> 03:05:44,950
to see is this sellside delta all the
way down to the low. So just Well, I

8660
03:05:44,950 --> 03:05:44,960
way down to the low. So just Well, I
 

8661
03:05:44,960 --> 03:05:47,030
way down to the low. So just Well, I
just had a little peek at that now. So I

8662
03:05:47,030 --> 03:05:47,040
just had a little peek at that now. So I
 

8663
03:05:47,040 --> 03:05:48,870
just had a little peek at that now. So I
would say this auction probably has not

8664
03:05:48,870 --> 03:05:48,880
would say this auction probably has not
 

8665
03:05:48,880 --> 03:05:50,950
would say this auction probably has not
finished yet. It probably may well have

8666
03:05:50,950 --> 03:05:50,960
finished yet. It probably may well have
 

8667
03:05:50,960 --> 03:05:53,830
finished yet. It probably may well have
more in it lower. Um, which is good that

8668
03:05:53,830 --> 03:05:53,840
more in it lower. Um, which is good that
 

8669
03:05:53,840 --> 03:05:56,070
more in it lower. Um, which is good that
I finally had a chance to look at it.

8670
03:05:56,070 --> 03:05:56,080
I finally had a chance to look at it.
 

8671
03:05:56,080 --> 03:05:57,269
I finally had a chance to look at it.

mean we can't keep going down into
these, but if you're short here, you

8798
03:08:17,190 --> 03:08:17,200
these, but if you're short here, you
 

8799
03:08:17,200 --> 03:08:19,670
these, but if you're short here, you
want to be short on some pop up which

8800
03:08:19,670 --> 03:08:19,680
want to be short on some pop up which
 

8801
03:08:19,680 --> 03:08:21,750
want to be short on some pop up which
creates liquidity. You do not want to be

short at the low of day down here. You
 

8805
03:08:23,600 --> 03:08:25,429

8811
03:08:30,399 --> 03:08:32,710

8813
03:08:32,720 --> 03:08:34,230
right? Where does it want to stop? Where
is the swing point from this morning

8814
03:08:34,230 --> 03:08:34,240
is the swing point from this morning
 

8815
03:08:34,240 --> 03:08:36,950
is the swing point from this morning
since we left this range? Where could we

8816
03:08:36,950 --> 03:08:36,960
since we left this range? Where could we
 

8817
03:08:36,960 --> 03:08:39,830
since we left this range? Where could we
price back into?

8818
03:08:39,830 --> 03:08:39,840
price back into?
 

8819
03:08:39,840 --> 03:08:42,150
price back into?
Right. I'd be really interested in a

8820
03:08:42,150 --> 03:08:42,160
Right. I'd be really interested in a
 

8821
03:08:42,160 --> 03:08:44,550
Right. I'd be really interested in a
price into sort of 150 160. Where's high

8822
03:08:44,550 --> 03:08:44,560
price into sort of 150 160. Where's high
 

8823

8825
03:08:48,319 --> 03:08:50,950

and 200. So I'd be looking at 150, 160,

8826
03:08:50,950 --> 03:08:50,960
and 200. So I'd be looking at 150, 160,
 

8827
03:08:50,960 --> 03:08:53,030
and 200. So I'd be looking at 150, 160,
and 200s. That's if I was going to

8828

8879
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:57,830

Yeah, I mean yes, basically uh simply

8880
03:09:57,830 --> 03:09:57,840
Yeah, I mean yes, basically uh simply
 

8881
03:09:57,840 --> 03:10:01,990
Yeah, I mean yes, basically uh simply
put uh dogee yes I I think what is

8882
03:10:01,990 --> 03:10:02,000
put uh dogee yes I I think what is
 

8883
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:04,070
put uh dogee yes I I think what is
likely to get to happen is we will get

8884
03:10:04,070 --> 03:10:04,080
likely to get to happen is we will get
 

8885
03:10:04,080 --> 03:10:06,389
likely to get to happen is we will get
relief like I said right we will see

8886
03:10:06,389 --> 03:10:06,399
relief like I said right we will see
 

8887
03:10:06,399 --> 03:10:08,710
relief like I said right we will see
some form of relief if we think about

8888
03:10:08,710 --> 03:10:08,720
some form of relief if we think about
 

8889
03:10:08,720 --> 03:10:11,510
some form of relief if we think about
this is selling continuation

8890
03:10:11,510 --> 03:10:11,520
this is selling continuation
 

8891
03:10:11,520 --> 03:10:13,670
this is selling continuation
this is not selling continuation this is

8892
03:10:13,670 --> 03:10:13,680
this is not selling continuation this is
 

8893
03:10:13,680 --> 03:10:15,750
this is not selling continuation this is
likely to see a relief up which is then

8894
03:10:15,750 --> 03:10:15,760
likely to see a relief up which is then
 

8895
03:10:15,760 --> 03:10:17,349
likely to see a relief up which is then
sold back down all right so I think

8896
03:10:17,349 --> 03:10:17,359
sold back down all right so I think
 

8897
03:10:17,359 --> 03:10:19,750
sold back down all right so I think
we'll probably get relief up and then I

8898
03:10:19,750 --> 03:10:19,760
we'll probably get relief up and then I
 

8899
03:10:19,760 --> 03:10:21,590
we'll probably get relief up and then I
think you'll see sellers step in. They

8900
03:10:21,590 --> 03:10:21,600
think you'll see sellers step in. They
 

8901
03:10:21,600 --> 03:10:23,269
think you'll see sellers step in. They
won't. Smart money will not want to sell

8902
03:10:23,269 --> 03:10:23,279
won't. Smart money will not want to sell
 

8903
03:10:23,279 --> 03:10:25,990
won't. Smart money will not want to sell
the lows. They just won't.

8904
03:10:25,990 --> 03:10:26,000
the lows. They just won't.
 

8905
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:28,870
the lows. They just won't.
All right. This is not a selling

8906
03:10:28,870 --> 03:10:28,880
All right. This is not a selling
 

8907
03:10:28,880 --> 03:10:30,710
All right. This is not a selling
pattern, is it? Right. It's not a

8908
03:10:30,710 --> 03:10:30,720
pattern, is it? Right. It's not a
 

8909
03:10:30,720 --> 03:10:32,630
pattern, is it? Right. It's not a
selling pattern. This is going to get

8910
03:10:32,630 --> 03:10:32,640
selling pattern. This is going to get
 

8911
03:10:32,640 --> 03:10:35,030
selling pattern. This is going to get
tight and you're going to see sellers at

8912
03:10:35,030 --> 03:10:35,040
tight and you're going to see sellers at
 

8913
03:10:35,040 --> 03:10:36,710
tight and you're going to see sellers at
the lows get caught and then sellers

8914
03:10:36,710 --> 03:10:36,720
the lows get caught and then sellers
 

8915
03:10:36,720 --> 03:10:38,230
the lows get caught and then sellers
come and then buyers probably chase too

8916
03:10:38,230 --> 03:10:38,240
come and then buyers probably chase too
 

8917
03:10:38,240 --> 03:10:39,830
come and then buyers probably chase too
high and then that resell. That would be

8918
03:10:39,830 --> 03:10:39,840
high and then that resell. That would be
 

8919
03:10:39,840 --> 03:10:41,590
high and then that resell. That would be
my anticipation for what's probably

8920
03:10:41,590 --> 03:10:41,600
my anticipation for what's probably
 

8921
03:10:41,600 --> 03:10:43,110
my anticipation for what's probably
about to come and it's already starting.

8922
03:10:43,110 --> 03:10:43,120
about to come and it's already starting.
 

8923
03:10:43,120 --> 03:10:44,790
about to come and it's already starting.
We've been talking about this for god

8925
03:10:44,800 --> 03:10:46,230
We've been talking about this for god
the best part of an hour probably and

8926
03:10:46,230 --> 03:10:46,240
the best part of an hour probably and
 

8927
03:10:46,240 --> 03:10:48,150
the best part of an hour probably and
it's finally starting to develop. that

8928
03:10:48,150 --> 03:10:48,160
it's finally starting to develop. that
 

8929
03:10:48,160 --> 03:10:50,550
it's finally starting to develop. that
kept saying under 25,000 I would be

8930
03:10:50,550 --> 03:10:50,560
kept saying under 25,000 I would be
 

8931
03:10:50,560 --> 03:10:52,469
kept saying under 25,000 I would be
covering my positions. You are not

8932
03:10:52,469 --> 03:10:52,479
covering my positions. You are not
 

8933
03:10:52,479 --> 03:10:54,309
covering my positions. You are not
seeing acceptance under it. You are

8934
03:10:54,309 --> 03:10:54,319
seeing acceptance under it. You are
 

8935
03:10:54,319 --> 03:10:56,150
seeing acceptance under it. You are
going to see relief higher. All right?

8936
03:10:56,150 --> 03:10:56,160
going to see relief higher. All right?
 

8937
03:10:56,160 --> 03:10:57,269
going to see relief higher. All right?
They're going to squeeze this out

8938
03:10:57,269 --> 03:10:57,279
They're going to squeeze this out
 

8939
03:10:57,279 --> 03:10:59,910
They're going to squeeze this out
higher. Imagine you were short at 25K.

8940
03:10:59,910 --> 03:10:59,920
higher. Imagine you were short at 25K.
 

8941
03:10:59,920 --> 03:11:01,750
higher. Imagine you were short at 25K.
You are about to get squeezed out. Then

8942
03:11:01,750 --> 03:11:01,760
You are about to get squeezed out. Then
 

8943
03:11:01,760 --> 03:11:03,190
You are about to get squeezed out. Then
you're going to see buyers come and join

8944
03:11:03,190 --> 03:11:03,200
you're going to see buyers come and join
 

8945
03:11:03,200 --> 03:11:05,110
you're going to see buyers come and join
in too high and then sellers come and

8946
03:11:05,110 --> 03:11:05,120
in too high and then sellers come and
 

8947
03:11:05,120 --> 03:11:06,710
in too high and then sellers come and
slam this back down. That's what you're

8948
03:11:06,710 --> 03:11:06,720
slam this back down. That's what you're
 

8949
03:11:06,720 --> 03:11:13,110
slam this back down. That's what you're
going to see. I would anticipate.

03:11:43,590 --> 03:11:43,600
day. So the other thing I'd be looking
 

8975
03:11:43,600 --> 03:11:45,349
