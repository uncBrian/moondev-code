00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
morning team. Sorry, running slightly
 

3
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,790
morning team. Sorry, running slightly
late there, but hope you're all good.

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,150
late there, but hope you're all good.
Hopefully everyone's doing well. Had a

6
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
Hopefully everyone's doing well. Had a
 

7
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,590
Hopefully everyone's doing well. Had a
good afternoon session. Wasn't much

8
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600
good afternoon session. Wasn't much
 

9
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,189
good afternoon session. Wasn't much
going on, and I doubt there'll be too

10
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
going on, and I doubt there'll be too
 

11
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,790
going on, and I doubt there'll be too
much going on today, but let's get into

12
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
much going on today, but let's get into
 

13
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,590
much going on today, but let's get into
it in case. All right, as always,

14
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
it in case. All right, as always,
 

15
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,430
it in case. All right, as always,
starting off in the daily chart. You can

16
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
starting off in the daily chart. You can
 

17
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,670
starting off in the daily chart. You can
see we're opening up currently inside

18
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
see we're opening up currently inside
 

19
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,189
see we're opening up currently inside
previous day. All right, there's your

20
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
previous day. All right, there's your
 

21
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,510
previous day. All right, there's your
previous day [snorts] inside previous

22
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,520
previous day [snorts] inside previous
 

23
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,189
previous day [snorts] inside previous
week.

24
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
week.
 

25
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,950
week.
And so we're expecting rotation and

26
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
And so we're expecting rotation and
 

27
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,469
And so we're expecting rotation and
chop. If we think about where we're

28
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
chop. If we think about where we're
 

29
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,590
chop. If we think about where we're
opening up right at this 20-day, 50-day,

30
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:51,600
opening up right at this 20-day, 50-day,
 

31
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,070
opening up right at this 20-day, 50-day,
5day overhead, we have a little bit of

32
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
5day overhead, we have a little bit of
 

33
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,990
5day overhead, we have a little bit of
supply up here. And we have this low

34
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
supply up here. And we have this low
 

35
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,749
supply up here. And we have this low
volume node down here. All right, so

36
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
volume node down here. All right, so
 

37
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,909
volume node down here. All right, so
that's what we're aware of. We are very

38
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
that's what we're aware of. We are very
 

39
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,830
that's what we're aware of. We are very
aware that we can just continue

40
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:01,840
aware that we can just continue
 

41
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,670
aware that we can just continue
especially in low volume to build

42
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
especially in low volume to build
 

43
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,230
especially in low volume to build
liquidity between these. All right. If

44
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
liquidity between these. All right. If
 

45
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,230
liquidity between these. All right. If
we get back above this, then we've got a

46
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,240
we get back above this, then we've got a
 

47
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,749
we get back above this, then we've got a
shot of coming up here. If we get back

48
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
shot of coming up here. If we get back
 

49
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,589
shot of coming up here. If we get back
below this, then we've got a shot of

50
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599
below this, then we've got a shot of
 

51
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,270
below this, then we've got a shot of
filling some of this in this big

52
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
filling some of this in this big
 

53
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,589
filling some of this in this big
imbalance candle here. Until we see a

54
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
imbalance candle here. Until we see a
 

55
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,230
imbalance candle here. Until we see a
break uh of one of those sides, we can't

56
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240
break uh of one of those sides, we can't
 

57
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,909
break uh of one of those sides, we can't
really think about much else, right? The

58
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
really think about much else, right? The
 

59
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,309
really think about much else, right? The
only other option would be a fail break,

60
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
only other option would be a fail break,
 

61
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,469
only other option would be a fail break,
fail break. All right, and just dance

62
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
fail break. All right, and just dance
 

63
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,309
fail break. All right, and just dance
back into range. This is your liquidity

64
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
back into range. This is your liquidity
 

65
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,749
back into range. This is your liquidity
building stage of this market. So, we're

66
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
building stage of this market. So, we're
 

67
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,749
building stage of this market. So, we're
just going to be patient. It is possible

68
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
just going to be patient. It is possible
 

69
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,110
just going to be patient. It is possible
that the market wants to complete

70
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,120
that the market wants to complete
 

71
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,230
that the market wants to complete
rotation higher but you know this time

72
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
rotation higher but you know this time
 

73
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,350
rotation higher but you know this time
of year uh the only way I see us doing

74
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
of year uh the only way I see us doing
 

75
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,629
of year uh the only way I see us doing
something like that is uh if they start

76
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
something like that is uh if they start
 

77
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,309
something like that is uh if they start
they will need to go risk on which means

78
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
they will need to go risk on which means
 

79
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,070
they will need to go risk on which means
it will all be about tax to be quite

80
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
it will all be about tax to be quite
 

81
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,749
it will all be about tax to be quite
honest with you. Um if they feel like

82
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
honest with you. Um if they feel like
 

83
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,309
honest with you. Um if they feel like
they can put some tax risk back on into

84
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
they can put some tax risk back on into
 

85
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,990
they can put some tax risk back on into
end of year maybe we get [snorts] that.

86
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
end of year maybe we get [snorts] that.
 

87
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,350
end of year maybe we get [snorts] that.
But at the moment I'm not seeing it. So

88
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,360
But at the moment I'm not seeing it. So
 

89
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,950
But at the moment I'm not seeing it. So
I'm prepared for rotation. I'm prepared

90
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
I'm prepared for rotation. I'm prepared
 

91
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,510
I'm prepared for rotation. I'm prepared
for a very small inside day. And that's

92
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:57,520
for a very small inside day. And that's
 

93
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,350
for a very small inside day. And that's
what I'm thinking about. And uh beyond

94
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,360
what I'm thinking about. And uh beyond
 

95
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,230
what I'm thinking about. And uh beyond
that we can think about what next. Let's

96
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
that we can think about what next. Let's
 

97
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,710
that we can think about what next. Let's
have a look at the hourly. You can see

98
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
have a look at the hourly. You can see
 

99
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,390
have a look at the hourly. You can see
right here these key levels. All right,

100
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
right here these key levels. All right,
 

101
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,629
right here these key levels. All right,
this is previous week. Uh we're well

102
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
this is previous week. Uh we're well
 

103
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,390
this is previous week. Uh we're well
inside previous week's value. If we look

104
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
inside previous week's value. If we look
 

105
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,309
inside previous week's value. If we look
at previous days value, right, previous

106
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
at previous days value, right, previous
 

107
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,110
at previous days value, right, previous
day's value was set inside. Oh, sorry,

108
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
day's value was set inside. Oh, sorry,
 

109
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,909
day's value was set inside. Oh, sorry,
that's too big. Was set inside previous

110
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
that's too big. Was set inside previous
 

111
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,270
that's too big. Was set inside previous
week's value. All right, that was

112
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280
week's value. All right, that was
 

113
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,950
week's value. All right, that was
yesterday's value. This is previous

114
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
yesterday's value. This is previous
 

115
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,869
yesterday's value. This is previous
week's value. All right, we're not

116
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
week's value. All right, we're not
 

117
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,790
week's value. All right, we're not
finding acceptance outside of anything

118
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
finding acceptance outside of anything
 

119
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,070
finding acceptance outside of anything
right now. You can see this is getting

120
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
right now. You can see this is getting
 

121
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,830
right now. You can see this is getting
very very tight. So, the [snorts]

122
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
very very tight. So, the [snorts]
 

123
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,950
very very tight. So, the [snorts]
options really are uh look above or look

124
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
options really are uh look above or look
 

125
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,029
options really are uh look above or look
below and fails or continuation trades.

126
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
below and fails or continuation trades.
 

127
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,870
below and fails or continuation trades.
All right, I'm not really interested in

128
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:34,880
All right, I'm not really interested in
 

129
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,709
All right, I'm not really interested in
doing anything in here. All right, if if

130
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
doing anything in here. All right, if if
 

131
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,350
doing anything in here. All right, if if
this is your your jam, all right, if you

132
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
this is your your jam, all right, if you
 

133
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,909
this is your your jam, all right, if you
if you like trading over these uh you

134
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
if you like trading over these uh you
 

135
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,870
if you like trading over these uh you
know, 30 40 rotate point rotations, by

136
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
know, 30 40 rotate point rotations, by
 

137
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,150
know, 30 40 rotate point rotations, by
all means, go for it. All right, if

138
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
all means, go for it. All right, if
 

139
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,310
all means, go for it. All right, if
that's your jam, if you love playing the

140
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,320
that's your jam, if you love playing the
 

141
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,070
that's your jam, if you love playing the
rotations, [snorts] that's what you

142
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
rotations, [snorts] that's what you
 

143
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,030
rotations, [snorts] that's what you
should look at. Um

144
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
should look at. Um
 

145
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,710
should look at. Um
am I disconnected here? Can you guys

146
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
am I disconnected here? Can you guys
 

147
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:02,870
am I disconnected here? Can you guys
hear me?

148
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880

 

149
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,470

Hang on. Is there an issue here?

150
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
Hang on. Is there an issue here?
 

151
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,910
Hang on. Is there an issue here?
Yeah, you can hear. Okay, good. It's

152
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:07,920
Yeah, you can hear. Okay, good. It's
 

153
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,310
Yeah, you can hear. Okay, good. It's
just OBS playing up. [snorts] Okay, so

154
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
just OBS playing up. [snorts] Okay, so
 

155
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,829
just OBS playing up. [snorts] Okay, so
that's that's what I'd be looking at.

156
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
that's that's what I'd be looking at.
 

157
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,630
that's that's what I'd be looking at.
I'd be expecting rotation outside of

158
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640
I'd be expecting rotation outside of
 

159
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,030
I'd be expecting rotation outside of
rotation. You know, you can if we base

160
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
rotation. You know, you can if we base
 

161
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,269
rotation. You know, you can if we base
and hold, you can look for this push up

162
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
and hold, you can look for this push up
 

163
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,110
and hold, you can look for this push up
to previous week value or a high below

164
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
to previous week value or a high below
 

165
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,870
to previous week value or a high below
rotation. All right, you have to be

166
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
rotation. All right, you have to be
 

167
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,949
rotation. All right, you have to be
careful with previous day and previous

168
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:24,959
careful with previous day and previous
 

169
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,509
careful with previous day and previous
week. But if we get underneath these and

170
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
week. But if we get underneath these and
 

171
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,949
week. But if we get underneath these and
we base and hold, then you're looking

172
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
we base and hold, then you're looking
 

173
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,070
we base and hold, then you're looking
for a drive into this little gap here

174
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,080
for a drive into this little gap here
 

175
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,509
for a drive into this little gap here
into this week and maybe all the way

176
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
into this week and maybe all the way
 

177
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,870
into this week and maybe all the way
down to here. These are the options,

178
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
down to here. These are the options,
 

179
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,389
down to here. These are the options,
right? So, we're building out liquidity.

180
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
right? So, we're building out liquidity.
 

181
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,150
right? So, we're building out liquidity.
It's either going to be this or this. It

182
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
It's either going to be this or this. It
 

183
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,470
It's either going to be this or this. It
doesn't have to be today. It does not

184
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
doesn't have to be today. It does not
 

185
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,910
doesn't have to be today. It does not
have to be today. I want to make that

186
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
have to be today. I want to make that
 

187
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,070
have to be today. I want to make that
clear. Uh if you just look above here,

188
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
clear. Uh if you just look above here,
 

189
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,430
clear. Uh if you just look above here,
you can see overnight we've done

190
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
you can see overnight we've done
 

191
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,590
you can see overnight we've done
absolutely nothing. Right? Low of day

192
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
absolutely nothing. Right? Low of day
 

193
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,829
absolutely nothing. Right? Low of day
yesterday, high of day yesterday.

194
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:49,839
yesterday, high of day yesterday.
 

195
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,550
yesterday, high of day yesterday.
There's Asia, there's London. Here's

196
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
There's Asia, there's London. Here's
 

197
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,070
There's Asia, there's London. Here's
where we're opening up. Right? were

198
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
where we're opening up. Right? were
 

199
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,990
where we're opening up. Right? were
boxed in. Right? So, you're either

200
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,000
boxed in. Right? So, you're either
 

201
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,630
boxed in. Right? So, you're either
playing an edge, playing an edge, or

202
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
playing an edge, playing an edge, or
 

203
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,150
playing an edge, playing an edge, or
waiting for the break, or waiting for

204
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,160
waiting for the break, or waiting for
 

205
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,829
waiting for the break, or waiting for
the break, or looking for a fail break,

206
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
the break, or looking for a fail break,
 

207
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,910
the break, or looking for a fail break,
or looking for a fail break. That's it.

208
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:03,920
or looking for a fail break. That's it.
 

209
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,230
or looking for a fail break. That's it.
That is it. These my least favorite

210
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
That is it. These my least favorite
 

211
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,470
That is it. These my least favorite
markets right now. [snorts]

212
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,480
markets right now. [snorts]
 

213
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,310
markets right now. [snorts]
Okay, let's go up. We're going to look

214
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
Okay, let's go up. We're going to look
 

215
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,910
Okay, let's go up. We're going to look
at some of the divergences at play here.

216
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
at some of the divergences at play here.
 

217
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,670
at some of the divergences at play here.
Just clean this up.

218
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680

 

219
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,829

Okay, into ES.

220
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:19,839
Okay, into ES.
 

221
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,190
Okay, into ES.
All right. What you need to be aware of

222
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
All right. What you need to be aware of
 

223
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,230
All right. What you need to be aware of
with ES

224
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
with ES
 

225
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,150
with ES
is the relative strength it has right

226
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160
is the relative strength it has right
 

227
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,230
is the relative strength it has right
now,

228
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
now,
 

229
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,550
now,
right? Is forming a bigger, we just zoom

230
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
right? Is forming a bigger, we just zoom
 

231
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,110
right? Is forming a bigger, we just zoom
out of this, a bigger divergence, right?

232
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120
out of this, a bigger divergence, right?
 

233
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,910
out of this, a bigger divergence, right?
Here's old all-time highs on the futures

234
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
Here's old all-time highs on the futures
 

235
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,750
Here's old all-time highs on the futures
market.

236
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
market.
 

237
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,350
market.
Here's your higher low. There's your

238
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
Here's your higher low. There's your
 

239
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,910
Here's your higher low. There's your
pivot low in November. There's your

240
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920
pivot low in November. There's your
 

241
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,230
pivot low in November. There's your
higher low. Maybe it has the ability to

242
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
higher low. Maybe it has the ability to
 

243
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,910
higher low. Maybe it has the ability to
do that. That's what ES is looking to

244
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:45,920
do that. That's what ES is looking to
 

245
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:54,230
do that. That's what ES is looking to
do. If we look at the spiders,

246
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240

 

247
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,949

right, you'll see it's already done it,

248
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
right, you'll see it's already done it,
 

249
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,350
right, you'll see it's already done it,
right? So, the ETFs have already put new

250
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
right? So, the ETFs have already put new
 

251
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,069
right? So, the ETFs have already put new
highs in,

252
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079
highs in,
 

253
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,167
highs in,
right? ETFs have already done it.

254
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:04,177
right? ETFs have already done it.
 

255
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:05,990
right? ETFs have already done it.
[snorts] Futures market haven't. All

256
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,000
[snorts] Futures market haven't. All
 

257
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,269
[snorts] Futures market haven't. All
right. So, that for me at the moment is

258
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
right. So, that for me at the moment is
 

259
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,590
right. So, that for me at the moment is
a look above and fail on the spiders.

260
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
a look above and fail on the spiders.
 

261
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,870
a look above and fail on the spiders.
All right. Where are they trying to go?

262
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
All right. Where are they trying to go?
 

263
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,190
All right. Where are they trying to go?
Probably the 700s. There's been a lot of

264
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,200
Probably the 700s. There's been a lot of
 

265
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,190
Probably the 700s. There's been a lot of
action up here for a long time. It

266
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
action up here for a long time. It
 

267
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,030
action up here for a long time. It
hasn't been able to do it yet. So, there

268
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
hasn't been able to do it yet. So, there
 

269
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,509
hasn't been able to do it yet. So, there
is clearly an issue up there on the

270
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
is clearly an issue up there on the
 

271
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,990
is clearly an issue up there on the
spiders. Uh we have gap fill potential

272
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
spiders. Uh we have gap fill potential
 

273
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,990
spiders. Uh we have gap fill potential
down here. I'd be slightly concerned if

274
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
down here. I'd be slightly concerned if
 

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,910
down here. I'd be slightly concerned if
we come down here and start doing this.

276
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:27,920
we come down here and start doing this.
 

277
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,990
we come down here and start doing this.
This looks pretty drastic as not a very

278
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
This looks pretty drastic as not a very
 

279
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,430
This looks pretty drastic as not a very
nice move. But again, because we're in

280
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
nice move. But again, because we're in
 

281
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,910
nice move. But again, because we're in
light volume, I want to be careful. So,

282
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
light volume, I want to be careful. So,
 

283
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,430
light volume, I want to be careful. So,
we are starting to see divergence. If

284
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
we are starting to see divergence. If
 

285
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,350
we are starting to see divergence. If
you go back historically and look,

286
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
you go back historically and look,
 

287
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,430
you go back historically and look,
especially when the sales have happened

288
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
especially when the sales have happened
 

289
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,190
especially when the sales have happened
across the market, you've seen stuff

290
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
across the market, you've seen stuff
 

291
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,710
across the market, you've seen stuff
like this where the spiders oh have done

292
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
like this where the spiders oh have done
 

293
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,630
like this where the spiders oh have done
a false break and where you've had

294
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:46,640
a false break and where you've had
 

295
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,790
a false break and where you've had
things like QQQ,

296
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
things like QQQ,
 

297
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,069
things like QQQ,
right, having divergence

298
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
right, having divergence
 

299
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,190
right, having divergence
lower high, lower high, lower high.

300
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
lower high, lower high, lower high.
 

301
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,949
lower high, lower high, lower high.
Okay, so you want to be careful there. I

302
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
Okay, so you want to be careful there. I
 

303
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,949
Okay, so you want to be careful there. I
don't want to be too uber bullish. We

304
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959
don't want to be too uber bullish. We
 

305
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,230
don't want to be too uber bullish. We
can just let this play out, especially

306
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
can just let this play out, especially
 

307
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,910
can just let this play out, especially
in the low volume. I want to have a

308
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
in the low volume. I want to have a
 

309
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,990
in the low volume. I want to have a
quick look at the VIX so you guys

310
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
quick look at the VIX so you guys
 

311
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,310
quick look at the VIX so you guys
understand where we're at. Right, we're

312
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
understand where we're at. Right, we're
 

313
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,230
understand where we're at. Right, we're
drifting lower. We can stay down here

314
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,240
drifting lower. We can stay down here
 

315
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,269
drifting lower. We can stay down here
for a while. Um, if you look

316
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
for a while. Um, if you look
 

317
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,670
for a while. Um, if you look
historically, we're more than happy to

318
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
historically, we're more than happy to
 

319
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,190
historically, we're more than happy to
be down underneath these 20s and 18s for

320
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,200
be down underneath these 20s and 18s for
 

321
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,670
be down underneath these 20s and 18s for
50 plus days. All right, so I'm not it's

322
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,680
50 plus days. All right, so I'm not it's
 

323
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,590
50 plus days. All right, so I'm not it's
not like I'm expecting a huge volatility

324
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
not like I'm expecting a huge volatility
 

325
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,110
not like I'm expecting a huge volatility
spike this side of the year unless

326
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,120
spike this side of the year unless
 

327
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,550
spike this side of the year unless
something drastically changes. I just

328
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560
something drastically changes. I just
 

329
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,389
something drastically changes. I just
don't see it happening. Right. I see us

330
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399
don't see it happening. Right. I see us
 

331
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,470
don't see it happening. Right. I see us
doing sort of stuff like this, which is

332
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
doing sort of stuff like this, which is
 

333
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,350
doing sort of stuff like this, which is
that low vol kind of grind move. Um, if

334
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
that low vol kind of grind move. Um, if
 

335
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,269
that low vol kind of grind move. Um, if
we go and we can have a quick look at

336
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
we go and we can have a quick look at
 

337
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,550
we go and we can have a quick look at
silver. Some of you talking about silver

338
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
silver. Some of you talking about silver
 

339
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,910
silver. Some of you talking about silver
and I said yesterday, you know, we

340
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
and I said yesterday, you know, we
 

341
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,430
and I said yesterday, you know, we
expect a bounce back. There's a big

342
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,440
expect a bounce back. There's a big
 

343
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,910
expect a bounce back. There's a big
flush out based on the CME stuff. Now,

344
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
flush out based on the CME stuff. Now,
 

345
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,310
flush out based on the CME stuff. Now,
we have to see how we act when we start

346
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
we have to see how we act when we start
 

347
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,829
we have to see how we act when we start
coming into there. Is this the first

348
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:43,839
coming into there. Is this the first
 

349
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,910
coming into there. Is this the first
time where we see failed follow through,

350
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
time where we see failed follow through,
 

351
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,150
time where we see failed follow through,
right? Or was this just a big flush out

352
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,160
right? Or was this just a big flush out
 

353
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,230
right? Or was this just a big flush out
based on that margin requirement and

354
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
based on that margin requirement and
 

355
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,829
based on that margin requirement and
we're going to go again? Right. I would

356
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:51,839
we're going to go again? Right. I would
 

357
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,750
we're going to go again? Right. I would
imagine we just get some form of inside

358
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
imagine we just get some form of inside
 

359
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,389
imagine we just get some form of inside

361
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,269

00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
right. If we get above there, it looks
 

409
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,470
right. If we get above there, it looks
like there's a bit of a gap to fill up

410
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
like there's a bit of a gap to fill up
 

411
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,670
like there's a bit of a gap to fill up
into 190. So, we can set

412
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,680
into 190. So, we can set
 

413
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,590
into 190. So, we can set
price alert each side. Let's just set it

414
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:01,600
price alert each side. Let's just set it
 

415
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,310
price alert each side. Let's just set it
above pre-market high.

416
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,320
above pre-market high.
 

417
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,350

00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
to claw its way back. Remember, we
 

423
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,509
to claw its way back. Remember, we
talked about this level here on Tesla.

There's the failure. Does it come back

430
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
There's the failure. Does it come back
 

431
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,750
There's the failure. Does it come back
and retest that? Big question mark. Does

432
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
and retest that? Big question mark. Does
 

433
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,310
and retest that? Big question mark. Does
it retest that? If it does, do they

434
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:26,320
it retest that? If it does, do they
 

435
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,910
it retest that? If it does, do they
leave all these buyers trapped and

436
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:27,920
leave all these buyers trapped and
 

437
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,550
leave all these buyers trapped and
resell it? Or is this a look below and a

438
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
resell it? Or is this a look below and a
 

439
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,790
resell it? Or is this a look below and a
fail and a reclaim back to 500? So, we

440
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:32,800
fail and a reclaim back to 500? So, we
 

441
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,509
fail and a reclaim back to 500? So, we
can set a price low up here. 5 minutes

442
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
can set a price low up here. 5 minutes
 

443
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,710

leaving this range, big squeeze out,

480
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:24,800
leaving this range, big squeeze out,
 

481
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,590
leaving this range, big squeeze out,
right? Does it fail and come back down

482
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
right? Does it fail and come back down
 

483
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,509
right? Does it fail and come back down
or is that a look below and fail on a

00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
or is that a look below and fail on a
 

485
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,430

487
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,870

on some of these. Uh, some of the beta

488
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:32,880
on some of these. Uh, some of the beta
 

489
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,629
on some of these. Uh, some of the beta

491
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,790

got much going on there inside
 

499
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,750
got much going on there inside
yesterday. That's a big opening drive

500
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:45,760
yesterday. That's a big opening drive
 

501
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,910
yesterday. That's a big opening drive

00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
caught in that. There we go. IQ that's a
 

505
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,870
caught in that. There we go. IQ that's a
decent move starting to try and get

506
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
decent move starting to try and get
 

507
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,389
decent move starting to try and get
going. I did see some news on that

508
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
going. I did see some news on that
 

509
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,030
going. I did see some news on that
somewhere this morning. MVTS

510
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
somewhere this morning. MVTS
 

511
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,430
somewhere this morning. MVTS
no follow through there. RGTI trying to

512
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
no follow through there. RGTI trying to
 

513
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,269
no follow through there. RGTI trying to
do the same thing. So these big gamma

514
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
do the same thing. So these big gamma
 

515
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,990
do the same thing. So these big gamma
exposure names, these move pretty wild.

516
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,000
exposure names, these move pretty wild.
 

517
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,590
exposure names, these move pretty wild.
Lots of people stuck in some of these at

518
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:05,600
Lots of people stuck in some of these at
 

519
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,030
Lots of people stuck in some of these at
the moment. So I want to see if they can

520
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
the moment. So I want to see if they can
 

521
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,030
the moment. So I want to see if they can
get going upside and if they're faded

522
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,040
get going upside and if they're faded
 

523
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,670
get going upside and if they're faded

00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,000
have a look at this. Uh 30 year
 

527
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,710
have a look at this. Uh 30 year

looking dangerous. 42 is the dangerous
 

529
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,069
looking dangerous. 42 is the dangerous
bit we've been talking about for a

530
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079
bit we've been talking about for a
 

531
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,710
bit we've been talking about for a
while. Looking dangerous here, folks.

532
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
while. Looking dangerous here, folks.
 

533
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,550

This is not good for the market. This is

534
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560
This is not good for the market. This is
 

535
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,389
This is not good for the market. This is
looking very dangerous in my mind. If

536
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:26,399
looking very dangerous in my mind. If
 

537
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,150
looking very dangerous in my mind. If
this gets going, we should be risk off

538
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
this gets going, we should be risk off
 

539
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,350
this gets going, we should be risk off
on the market. If there's good

540
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,360
on the market. If there's good
 

541
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,629
on the market. If there's good
correlation, sometimes it takes a moment

542
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:32,639
correlation, sometimes it takes a moment
 

543
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,470
correlation, sometimes it takes a moment
or two for it to come through and start

544
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,480
or two for it to come through and start
 

545
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,150
or two for it to come through and start
to happen. Let's have a quick look at

546
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
to happen. Let's have a quick look at
 

547
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,230
to happen. Let's have a quick look at
move.

00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
happening this side of the year, I would
 

557
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:59,829
happening this side of the year, I would
imagine. But let's see.

558

So bid here is 7:15

894
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:03,600
So bid here is 7:15
 

895
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,710
So bid here is 7:15
and they're going to fill and sell

896
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:04,720
and they're going to fill and sell
 

897
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,269
and they're going to fill and sell
through this. Can ES get back through

898
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:07,279
through this. Can ES get back through
 

899
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,909
through this. Can ES get back through
its New York open?

900
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:09,919
its New York open?

Waiting as a skill. Absolutely is a

1264
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:14,399
skill. Yeah, it's probably the most
 

1265
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,669
skill. Yeah, it's probably the most
important skill you're going to need

1266
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:15,679
important skill you're going to need
 

1267
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,869
important skill you're going to need
trading.

1268
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:20,879

 

1269
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,710

Okay, we've seen a decent amount of

1270
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,720
Okay, we've seen a decent amount of
 

1271
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,629
Okay, we've seen a decent amount of
selling come in down here at the lows

1272
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:24,639
selling come in down here at the lows
 

1273
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,030
selling come in down here at the lows
under 90s and they're not breaking lower

1274
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:27,040
under 90s and they're not breaking lower
 

1275
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,869
under 90s and they're not breaking lower
yet. So, I'm just being aware of that

1276
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:28,879
yet. So, I'm just being aware of that
 

1277
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,950
yet. So, I'm just being aware of that
where the volume is

1278
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:30,960
where the volume is
 

1279
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,510
where the volume is
non-existent really.

1280
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:35,520

 

1281
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,109

They're going to have another take

1282
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:37,119
They're going to have another take
 

1283
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,790
They're going to have another take
attempt to get into that value area low

1284
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:38,800
attempt to get into that value area low
 

1285
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,190
attempt to get into that value area low
by the looks of it. What they're

1286
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,200
by the looks of it. What they're
 

1287
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,950
by the looks of it. What they're
attempting to do and they've been soaked

1288
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:42,960
attempting to do and they've been soaked
 

1289
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,950
attempting to do and they've been soaked
off value area low or in front of it

1290
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:44,960
off value area low or in front of it
 

1291
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,109
off value area low or in front of it
again.

1293
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,030
again.
So every attempt to get down into here,

1294
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,040
So every attempt to get down into here,
 

1295
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,349
So every attempt to get down into here,
they are failing to do right now. We're

1296
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:51,359
they are failing to do right now. We're
 

1297
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,829
they are failing to do right now. We're
failing to expand value at the moment.

00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:53,839
failing to expand value at the moment.

00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,750
failing to expand value at the moment.
Doesn't mean they can't do it, but it's

I have a question for you, Alex. I have

I have a question for you, Alex. I have

I have a question for you, Alex. I have
100k Apex funding and two 50k accounts.

All right, here comes previous day value

1316
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:15,280
All right, here comes previous day value
 

1317
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,510
All right, here comes previous day value
area low. See if they defend it or not.

1318
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:17,520
area low. See if they defend it or not.
 

1319
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,829
area low. See if they defend it or not.
If they don't, then it's possible we go

1320
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:19,839
If they don't, then it's possible we go
 

1321
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,829
If they don't, then it's possible we go
down to previous day low into sort of

1322
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:21,839
down to previous day low into sort of
 

1323
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,069
down to previous day low into sort of
47s and previous week value into 40s and

1324
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:26,079
47s and previous week value into 40s and
 

1325
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,069
47s and previous week value into 40s and
previous week open into 35. So, it all

1326
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:28,079
previous week open into 35. So, it all
 

1327
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,470
previous week open into 35. So, it all
depends how we act once we get to this

1328
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:30,480
depends how we act once we get to this
 

1329
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,230
depends how we act once we get to this
edge. Are we going to bid off this edge

1330
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:32,240
edge. Are we going to bid off this edge
 

1331
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,670
edge. Are we going to bid off this edge
or we going to see some follow through?

1332
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:33,680
or we going to see some follow through?
 

1333
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,270
or we going to see some follow through?
The follow through won't be huge. Might

1334
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:35,280
The follow through won't be huge. Might
 

1335
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,630
The follow through won't be huge. Might
be 30 plus points, but we will see.

1336
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:40,640

 

1337
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:52,999

Moment they can't even get through it.

Here come the sellers. They're trying to

1342
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:55,520
Here come the sellers. They're trying to
 

1343
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,030
Here come the sellers. They're trying to
step on the tape. There's been a passive

1344
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,040
step on the tape. There's been a passive
 

1345
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,990
step on the tape. There's been a passive
buyer here at 80 all day. So why I say

1346
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,000
buyer here at 80 all day. So why I say
 

1347
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,750
buyer here at 80 all day. So why I say
all day? this morning. Once he moves,

1348
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:01,760
all day? this morning. Once he moves,
 

1349
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,030
all day? this morning. Once he moves,
might see a bit more of a flush down

1350
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,040
might see a bit more of a flush down
 

1351
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,190
might see a bit more of a flush down
into value. There we go. So, he's

1352
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,200
into value. There we go. So, he's
 

1353
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,870
into value. There we go. So, he's
starting to move and value is 73s. If we

1354
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:08,880
starting to move and value is 73s. If we
 

1355
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,630
starting to move and value is 73s. If we
get through 73s, you got to be careful

1356
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:10,640
get through 73s, you got to be careful
 

1357
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,790
get through 73s, you got to be careful
for fail breakout versus breakout. And

1358
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:12,800
for fail breakout versus breakout. And
 

1359
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,190
for fail breakout versus breakout. And
50s or 48s will be the next spot. All

1360
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:15,200
50s or 48s will be the next spot. All
 

1361
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,349
50s or 48s will be the next spot. All
right. So, here comes the move into

1362
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:17,359
right. So, here comes the move into
 

1363
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,950
right. So, here comes the move into
value. Previous day value area low is

1364
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:18,960
value. Previous day value area low is
 

1365
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,710
value. Previous day value area low is
right here. See, there's a slight bid

1366
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:20,720
right here. See, there's a slight bid
 

1367
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,670
right here. See, there's a slight bid
off it. That blue line unsurprisingly,

1368
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:23,680
off it. That blue line unsurprisingly,
 

1369
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,950
off it. That blue line unsurprisingly,
you know, bulls will want to defend

1370
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:24,960
you know, bulls will want to defend
 

1371
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,790
you know, bulls will want to defend
that. If they are unsuccessful in

that. If they are unsuccessful in
 

1373
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,990
that. If they are unsuccessful in
defending that, you will see a wash

1374
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,000
defending that, you will see a wash
 

1375
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,270
defending that, you will see a wash
through. There you go. They defended it

1376
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:29,280
through. There you go. They defended it
 

1377
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:36,390
through. There you go. They defended it
very well.

1378
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:36,400

 

1379
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,310

Well, someone just stepped on the tape,

1380
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:38,320
Well, someone just stepped on the tape,
 

1381
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,750
Well, someone just stepped on the tape,
didn't they? They said, "Fuck off. We're

1382
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:39,760
didn't they? They said, "Fuck off. We're
 

1383
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,710
didn't they? They said, "Fuck off. We're
covering here." And this is what happens

1384
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:42,720
covering here." And this is what happens
 

1385
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,750
covering here." And this is what happens
when you get low volume.

1386
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:45,760
when you get low volume.
 

1387
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,829
when you get low volume.
Hilarious. Absolutely hilarious.

So, we said we will wait to see what

1390
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:53,520
So, we said we will wait to see what
 

1391
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,430
So, we said we will wait to see what
happens. Well, [laughter] I can't I

1392
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:55,440
happens. Well, [laughter] I can't I
 

1393
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,630
happens. Well, [laughter] I can't I
can't do anything with that. I'll tell

1394
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:56,640
can't do anything with that. I'll tell
 

1395
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,845
can't do anything with that. I'll tell

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:33,829

It is messy out here. Very very messy.

1412
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:33,839

 

1413
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,470

So maybe down into this imbalance uh

1414
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:36,480
So maybe down into this imbalance uh
 

1415
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,550
So maybe down into this imbalance uh
which starts at 90 and goes all the way

1416
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:38,560
which starts at 90 and goes all the way
 

1417
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,870
which starts at 90 and goes all the way
down to 82s if they are actually willing

1418
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:40,880
down to 82s if they are actually willing
 

1419
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,270
down to 82s if they are actually willing
to hold. But there's no one on the tape

1420
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:43,280
to hold. But there's no one on the tape
 

1421
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:52,950
to hold. But there's no one on the tape
right now. I I'm not trusting anything.

1422
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:52,960

 

1423
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,109

and uh value area high on the session

1424
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:55,119
and uh value area high on the session
 

1425
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,349
and uh value area high on the session
currently at these tens. All right, so

1426
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:57,359
currently at these tens. All right, so
 

1427
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,069
currently at these tens. All right, so
we're you're really looking at

1428
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:00,079
we're you're really looking at
 

1429
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,150
we're you're really looking at
30 points at the moment in this session

1430
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,160
30 points at the moment in this session
 

1431
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,589
30 points at the moment in this session
unless we can start getting through this

1432
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:03,599
unless we can start getting through this
 

1433
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,190
unless we can start getting through this
and accelerating up here which would be

1434
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,200
and accelerating up here which would be
 

1435
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,030
and accelerating up here which would be
nice. They are now trying to do there's

1436
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,040
nice. They are now trying to do there's
 

1437
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,630
nice. They are now trying to do there's
VWAP. Can we find a bid now? This is the

1438
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:10,640
VWAP. Can we find a bid now? This is the
 

1439
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,390
VWAP. Can we find a bid now? This is the
question. Remember the buyers this

1440
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:12,400
question. Remember the buyers this
 

1441
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,270
question. Remember the buyers this
morning have been stuck at 20 and above.

1442
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:15,280
morning have been stuck at 20 and above.
 

1443
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,950
morning have been stuck at 20 and above.
Yeah, definitely 20 and above is where

1444
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:16,960
Yeah, definitely 20 and above is where
 

1445
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,710
Yeah, definitely 20 and above is where
the buyers have been stuck so far this

1446
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:18,720
the buyers have been stuck so far this
 

1447
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,310
the buyers have been stuck so far this
morning.

1448
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:20,320
morning.
 

1449
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,670
morning.
again. I mean, I don't see you again

1450
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:23,680
again. I mean, I don't see you again
 

1451
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,310
again. I mean, I don't see you again
have to be big bollocks to just bid

1452
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:26,320
have to be big bollocks to just bid
 

1453
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,349
have to be big bollocks to just bid
there with nothing. And uh if you did

1454
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:29,359
there with nothing. And uh if you did
 

1455
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,829
there with nothing. And uh if you did
have the big bollocks or you bid rebid

1456
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:31,839
have the big bollocks or you bid rebid
 

1457
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,390
have the big bollocks or you bid rebid
this, you're trimming some here and then

1458
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:34,400
this, you're trimming some here and then
 

1459
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,990
this, you're trimming some here and then
you're looking for this now. All right,

1460
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,000
you're looking for this now. All right,
 

1461
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,750
you're looking for this now. All right,
someone's in a [\h__\h] hurry all of a

1462
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:39,760
someone's in a [\h__\h] hurry all of a
 

1463
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,109
someone's in a [\h__\h] hurry all of a
sudden. ES has got going. All right, ES

1464
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:43,119
sudden. ES has got going. All right, ES
 

1465
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,550
sudden. ES has got going. All right, ES
just filled the gap. So, just be careful

1466
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:44,560
just filled the gap. So, just be careful
 

1467
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,270
just filled the gap. So, just be careful
of that. We've had gap fill on ES. Now

1468
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:47,280
of that. We've had gap fill on ES. Now
 

1469
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,310
of that. We've had gap fill on ES. Now
your next target if you are long is into

1470
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:50,320
your next target if you are long is into
 

1471
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,790
your next target if you are long is into
the value above. All right. So gap fill

1472
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:52,800
the value above. All right. So gap fill
 

1473
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,030
the value above. All right. So gap fill
for us would be 40s gap fill above. And

1474
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,040
for us would be 40s gap fill above. And
 

1475
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,109
for us would be 40s gap fill above. And
if you if you're really lucky you get

1476
00:38:57,109 --> 00:38:57,119
if you if you're really lucky you get
 

1477
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,190
if you if you're really lucky you get
going into 20s and maybe even all the

1478
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,200
going into 20s and maybe even all the
 

1479
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,390
going into 20s and maybe even all the
way up there if they're if they're going

1480
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:00,400
way up there if they're if they're going
 

1481
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,230
way up there if they're if they're going
to turn the booster jets on today. We

1482
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:02,240
to turn the booster jets on today. We
 

1483
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,470
to turn the booster jets on today. We
will see. We'll just have to see exactly

1484
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:04,480
will see. We'll just have to see exactly
 

1485
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,589
will see. We'll just have to see exactly
what we thought about here. We're going

1486
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:05,599
what we thought about here. We're going
 

1487
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,030
what we thought about here. We're going
to have to see how we act up here right

1488
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,040
to have to see how we act up here right
 

1489
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,670
to have to see how we act up here right
into the other edge.

1490
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:09,680
into the other edge.
 

1491
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,670
into the other edge.
So see how we act into previous days

1492
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:11,680
So see how we act into previous days
 

1493
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:17,109
So see how we act into previous days
value area high here.

1494
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:17,119

 

1495
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,270

So just a rotation, right? One side of

1496
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:19,280
So just a rotation, right? One side of
 

1497
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,790
So just a rotation, right? One side of
the previous day's value to the other

1498
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:20,800
the previous day's value to the other
 

1499
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,990
the previous day's value to the other
side. Dshape yesterday, we're trading an

1500
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,000
side. Dshape yesterday, we're trading an
 

1501
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,069
side. Dshape yesterday, we're trading an
inside bar. It's a rotation until it

1502
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:26,079
inside bar. It's a rotation until it
 

1503
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,750
inside bar. It's a rotation until it
proves otherwise. Okay, it's all we're

1504
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:27,760
proves otherwise. Okay, it's all we're
 

1505
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,510
proves otherwise. Okay, it's all we're
looking at.

1506
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:29,520
looking at.
 

1507
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,710
looking at.
Gap filled on the ES. Next stop, stop

1508
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:32,720
Gap filled on the ES. Next stop, stop
 

1509
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,510
Gap filled on the ES. Next stop, stop
step stop. Get your words out, mate.

1510
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:35,520
step stop. Get your words out, mate.
 

1511
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,230
step stop. Get your words out, mate.
Will be 57s. Break through 57s. Maybe

1512
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:38,240
Will be 57s. Break through 57s. Maybe
 

1513
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,550
Will be 57s. Break through 57s. Maybe
then we can look for the fiveday on ES.

1514
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:40,560
then we can look for the fiveday on ES.
 

1515
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,670
then we can look for the fiveday on ES.
So here goes the cues. Can they get up?

1516
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:43,680
So here goes the cues. Can they get up?
 

1517
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,069
So here goes the cues. Can they get up?
They've just closed the gap. So once

1518
00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:46,079
They've just closed the gap. So once
 

1519
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,910
They've just closed the gap. So once
they got back above the 20s, remember

1520
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:47,920
they got back above the 20s, remember
 

1521
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,670
they got back above the 20s, remember
buyers were stuck at 20s we talked about

1522
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:49,680
buyers were stuck at 20s we talked about
 

1523
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,430
buyers were stuck at 20s we talked about
this morning. Those buyers are now let

1524
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:51,440
this morning. Those buyers are now let
 

1525
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,150
this morning. Those buyers are now let
out. So buyers were stuck at 20s. All

1526
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:54,160
out. So buyers were stuck at 20s. All
 

1527
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,109
out. So buyers were stuck at 20s. All
right. Oh my gosh. Right here. They're

1528
00:39:57,109 --> 00:39:57,119
right. Oh my gosh. Right here. They're
 

1529
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,550
right. Oh my gosh. Right here. They're
getting let out. Let me see if I can get

1530
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:58,560
getting let out. Let me see if I can get
 

1531
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,950
getting let out. Let me see if I can get
you on to see my buyers were stuck in

1532
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:00,960
you on to see my buyers were stuck in
 

1533
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,270
you on to see my buyers were stuck in
here in this big node here. 20s. All

1534
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:05,280
here in this big node here. 20s. All
 

1535
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,870
here in this big node here. 20s. All
right. And can we move back above that

1536
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:06,880
right. And can we move back above that
 

1537
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,550
right. And can we move back above that
now is the question. The answer right

1538
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:08,560
now is the question. The answer right
 

1539
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,310
now is the question. The answer right
now is yes. There's previous days value

1540
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:10,320
now is yes. There's previous days value
 

1541
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,150
now is yes. There's previous days value
area high. Are we going to look to

1542
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:12,160
area high. Are we going to look to
 

1543
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,750
area high. Are we going to look to
auction above this or are they going to

1544
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:13,760
auction above this or are they going to
 

1545
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,150
auction above this or are they going to
sell this at this point? Now that's all

1546
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,160
sell this at this point? Now that's all
 

1547
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,910
sell this at this point? Now that's all
we're thinking about now. Can we hold a

1548
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:17,920
we're thinking about now. Can we hold a
 

1549
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,190
we're thinking about now. Can we hold a
bid above this? Come and clean out

1550
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,200
bid above this? Come and clean out
 

1551
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,109
bid above this? Come and clean out
GlobeEx high time frame algo get into

1552
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:21,119
GlobeEx high time frame algo get into
 

1553
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,589
GlobeEx high time frame algo get into
23s, right? And if we get acceptance,

1554
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:23,599
23s, right? And if we get acceptance,
 

1555
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,430
23s, right? And if we get acceptance,
can we get up into here? So the plays

1556
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:25,440
can we get up into here? So the plays
 

1557
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,670
can we get up into here? So the plays
right now are very simple. Can we build

1558
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:27,680
right now are very simple. Can we build
 

1559
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,510
right now are very simple. Can we build
some structure here to come here and

1560
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:29,520
some structure here to come here and
 

1561
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,589
some structure here to come here and
here? Or is this going to be look above

1562
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:31,599
here? Or is this going to be look above
 

1563
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,790
here? Or is this going to be look above
and we're going to come straight back

1564
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:32,800
and we're going to come straight back
 

1565
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,589
and we're going to come straight back
down and keep rotating in yesterday's

1566
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:35,599
down and keep rotating in yesterday's
 

1567
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,750
down and keep rotating in yesterday's
profile? That's the option. Those two

1568
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:37,760
profile? That's the option. Those two
 

1569
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:43,168

things are the option right now.

Okay, let's see then. No acceptance

00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,670
Okay, let's see then. No acceptance
above value. Are they going to offer

1614
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:47,680
above value. Are they going to offer
 

1615
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,589
above value. Are they going to offer
rotation or do we see continuation up

1616
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:49,599
rotation or do we see continuation up
 

1617

rotation or do we see continuation up
into here? Wait to see some volume steps

1618

into here? Wait to see some volume steps
 

1619

we're going to drift back down into

we're going to drift back down into
 

1623
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,309
we're going to drift back down into
those 20s. Remember, 20s is where the

1624
00:41:58,309 --> 00:41:58,319
those 20s. Remember, 20s is where the
 

1625
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,750
those 20s. Remember, 20s is where the
buyers got stuck this morning. It's

1626
00:41:59,750 --> 00:41:59,760
buyers got stuck this morning. It's
 

1627
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,270
buyers got stuck this morning. It's
where they came back in for the

1628
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:01,280
where they came back in for the
 

1629
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,270
where they came back in for the
acceleration. You'd want to see them

1630
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:03,280
acceleration. You'd want to see them
 

1631
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,790
acceleration. You'd want to see them
hold above 20s if you're going to look

1632
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:04,800
hold above 20s if you're going to look
 

1633
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,150
hold above 20s if you're going to look
for a continuation. So if big if you

1634
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:08,160
for a continuation. So if big if you
 

1635
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,470
for a continuation. So if big if you
would want to see a buildout into here

1636
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:10,480
would want to see a buildout into here
 

1637
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,309
would want to see a buildout into here
if we're going to look for acceptance

1638
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:12,319
if we're going to look for acceptance
 

1639
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,670
if we're going to look for acceptance
above all these TPS failing to hold 20s

1640
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:15,680
above all these TPS failing to hold 20s
 

1641
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,510
above all these TPS failing to hold 20s
would mean more buyers just get trapped

1642
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:17,520
would mean more buyers just get trapped
 

1643
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,430
would mean more buyers just get trapped
above 20s and we are going to continue

1644
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:19,440
above 20s and we are going to continue
 

1645
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,829
above 20s and we are going to continue
to do a small rotation. So we're bullish

1646
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:21,839
to do a small rotation. So we're bullish
 

1647
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,910
to do a small rotation. So we're bullish
if we can look for this. If we fail to

1648
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:23,920
if we can look for this. If we fail to
 

1649
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,550
if we can look for this. If we fail to
hold 20s I'd expect this to be priced

1650
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:26,560
hold 20s I'd expect this to be priced
 

1651
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,309
hold 20s I'd expect this to be priced
back in again. All right. And we haven't

1652
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:28,319
back in again. All right. And we haven't
 

1653
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,870
back in again. All right. And we haven't
got much room or much ATR to play with.

1654
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:30,880
got much room or much ATR to play with.
 

1655
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,519
got much room or much ATR to play with.
So just be aware of that.

1656
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:34,529
So just be aware of that.

00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:37,750

00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,710

currently the longer we're up here, we

currently the longer we're up here, we
 

1667
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,349
currently the longer we're up here, we
will move current days value up. But

1668
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:47,359
will move current days value up. But
 

1669
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,030
will move current days value up. But
just remember, all that matters is where

1670
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:49,040
just remember, all that matters is where
 

1671
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,109
just remember, all that matters is where
those buyers came in. Right? Can they

those buyers came in. Right? Can they
 

1673
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,309
those buyers came in. Right? Can they
stay aggressive? Can they get something

1674
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:54,319
stay aggressive? Can they get something
 

1675
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:55,910

like this? All right. If they can't,

1677
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,990
like this? All right. If they can't,
then this is a look above value again.

1678
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:58,000
then this is a look above value again.
 

1679
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,349
then this is a look above value again.
If they can't hold this, then guess

If they can't hold this, then guess
 

1681
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,349
If they can't hold this, then guess
what? We're going to go right back down

what? We're going to go right back down
 

1683
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,710
what? We're going to go right back down

Here's the 20 check that we just talked

00:43:11,109 --> 00:43:11,119
Here's the 20 check that we just talked
 

1695
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,270
Here's the 20 check that we just talked
about. This is what's going to be key

1696
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:13,280
about. This is what's going to be key
 

1697
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,109
about. This is what's going to be key
now is do some passive buyers start to

1698
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:17,119
now is do some passive buyers start to
 

1699
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,510
now is do some passive buyers start to
absorb here into these 20s. If the

1700
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:19,520
absorb here into these 20s. If the
 

1701
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,950
absorb here into these 20s. If the
answer is yes and they can get back

1702
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:20,960
answer is yes and they can get back
 

1703
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,710
answer is yes and they can get back
above value, it's got a rebid

1704
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:22,720
above value, it's got a rebid
 

1705
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,030
above value, it's got a rebid
possibility higher. If the answer is no,

1706
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:25,040
possibility higher. If the answer is no,
 

1707
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,870
possibility higher. If the answer is no,
then we're going to go right back inside

1708
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:26,880
then we're going to go right back inside
 

1709
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,230
then we're going to go right back inside
current day's value because we're

1710
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:28,240
current day's value because we're
 

1711
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,870
current day's value because we're
already in previous days value. So

1712
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:30,880
already in previous days value. So
 

1713
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,630
already in previous days value. So
question is, can they hold 20s here? The

1714
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:32,640
question is, can they hold 20s here? The
 

1715
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,190
question is, can they hold 20s here? The
answer at the moment is they are trying

1716
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:35,200
answer at the moment is they are trying
 

1717
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,670
answer at the moment is they are trying
to offer a bid here at 25. So the volume

1718
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:37,680
to offer a bid here at 25. So the volume
 

1719
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,150
to offer a bid here at 25. So the volume
is so small folks. It's very very small,

1720
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,160
is so small folks. It's very very small,
 

1721
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,550
is so small folks. It's very very small,
but they are trying to hold above the

1722
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:42,560
but they are trying to hold above the
 

1723
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,069
but they are trying to hold above the
20s like we just talked about. But

1724
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:44,079
20s like we just talked about. But
 

1725
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,190
20s like we just talked about. But
again, for that absolute [\h__\h] in chat,

1726
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:47,200
again, for that absolute [\h__\h] in chat,
 

1727
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,710
again, for that absolute [\h__\h] in chat,
you know, if you can't decipher what

1728
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:48,720
you know, if you can't decipher what
 

1729
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,150
you know, if you can't decipher what
I've just given you, you've got no

1730
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:50,160
I've just given you, you've got no
 

1731
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,550
I've just given you, you've got no
chance.

1732
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:52,560
chance.
 

1733
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,550
chance.
[\h__\h] in chat. I quite like the rhyme of

1734
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:54,560
[\h__\h] in chat. I quite like the rhyme of
 

1735
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,790
[\h__\h] in chat. I quite like the rhyme of
that. There's another [\h__\h] in chat. All

1736
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:56,800
that. There's another [\h__\h] in chat. All
 

1737
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,349
that. There's another [\h__\h] in chat. All
right, let's see then if they can absorb

1738
00:43:59,349 --> 00:43:59,359
right, let's see then if they can absorb
 

1739
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,030
right, let's see then if they can absorb
around here and get acceptance back

1740
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:01,040
around here and get acceptance back
 

1741
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,710
around here and get acceptance back
above previous days value or not.

1742
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:04,720
above previous days value or not.
 

1743
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,910
above previous days value or not.
Okay, here they go. They are trying.

1744
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:07,920
Okay, here they go. They are trying.
 

1745
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,990
Okay, here they go. They are trying.
Guess what we are looking at at the

1746
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:10,000
Guess what we are looking at at the
 

1747
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,870
Guess what we are looking at at the
moment? Looking to see if we can drive

1748
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:12,880
moment? Looking to see if we can drive
 

1749
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,829
moment? Looking to see if we can drive
through and find acceptance above PDC,

1750
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:15,839
through and find acceptance above PDC,
 

1751
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,069
through and find acceptance above PDC,
above previous day value area high. Is

1752
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:18,079
above previous day value area high. Is
 

1753
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,030
above previous day value area high. Is
there a move here? Big sellers came in,

1754
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,040
there a move here? Big sellers came in,
 

1755
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,630
there a move here? Big sellers came in,
well, not big, but big in this session

1756
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:22,640
well, not big, but big in this session
 

1757
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,470
well, not big, but big in this session
came in at 30s and below and didn't find

1758
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:24,480
came in at 30s and below and didn't find
 

1759
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,829
came in at 30s and below and didn't find
acceptance lower. So, at the moment,

1760
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:25,839
acceptance lower. So, at the moment,
 

1761
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,150
acceptance lower. So, at the moment,
we're looking bullish. If we can find a

1762
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:28,160
we're looking bullish. If we can find a
 

1763
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,030
we're looking bullish. If we can find a
squeeze out here. Looking good. And I

1764
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:31,040
squeeze out here. Looking good. And I
 

1765
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,950
squeeze out here. Looking good. And I
want to see them clear up to 55s because

1766
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:32,960
want to see them clear up to 55s because
 

1767
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,710
want to see them clear up to 55s because
we've got lots on the book here to 55s.

1768
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:34,720
we've got lots on the book here to 55s.
 

1769
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,750
we've got lots on the book here to 55s.
Here we go. Here we go.

1770
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:39,760
Here we go. Here we go.
 

1771
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,550
Here we go. Here we go.
Really nice hold reclaim. Can we get

1772
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:42,560
Really nice hold reclaim. Can we get
 

1773
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,069
Really nice hold reclaim. Can we get
through this? All right. So, I'd be

1774
00:44:44,069 --> 00:44:44,079
through this? All right. So, I'd be
 

1775
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,390
through this? All right. So, I'd be
tping out on any drive into this. Now,

1776
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:46,400
tping out on any drive into this. Now,
 

1777
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,750
tping out on any drive into this. Now,
if you took any of this soak in here,

1778
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:49,760
if you took any of this soak in here,
 

1779
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,870
if you took any of this soak in here,
right, you want to be very careful

1780
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:50,880
right, you want to be very careful
 

1781
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,710
right, you want to be very careful
because we're so light on volume. But if

1782
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:52,720
because we're so light on volume. But if
 

1783
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,790
because we're so light on volume. But if
we hold this TP1, TP2, TP3, and the full

1784
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:56,800
we hold this TP1, TP2, TP3, and the full
 

1785
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,270
we hold this TP1, TP2, TP3, and the full
rotation will be up into 830s. Here we

1786
00:44:59,270 --> 00:44:59,280
rotation will be up into 830s. Here we
 

1787
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,030
rotation will be up into 830s. Here we
go.

1788
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:01,040
go.
 

1789
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,349
go.
Didn't give me anything. Shut the [\h__\h]

1790
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:03,359
Didn't give me anything. Shut the [\h__\h]
 

1791
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:08,446
Didn't give me anything. Shut the [\h__\h]
up, you [\h__\h]

1792
00:45:08,446 --> 00:45:08,456

 

1793
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:09,910

[snorts]

1794
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:09,920
[snorts]
 

1795
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,630
[snorts]
All right, there's TP1 into the orange

1796
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:12,640
All right, there's TP1 into the orange
 

1797
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,430
All right, there's TP1 into the orange
bars.

1798
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:17,440

 

1799
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,190

Oh, it's always nice to end the year

1800
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:19,200
Oh, it's always nice to end the year
 

1801
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,710
Oh, it's always nice to end the year
with a complete knob end.

1802
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:22,720
with a complete knob end.
 

1803
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,069
with a complete knob end.
Right, let's see if we can keep going

1804
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:24,079
Right, let's see if we can keep going
 

1805
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,150
Right, let's see if we can keep going
here. It'd be nice if we could. So, this

1806
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:26,160
here. It'd be nice if we could. So, this
 

1807
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,109
here. It'd be nice if we could. So, this
is GloEx and a higher time frame algo

1808
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:29,119
is GloEx and a higher time frame algo
 

1809
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,430
is GloEx and a higher time frame algo
that I use. This is based on higher time

1810
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:31,440
that I use. This is based on higher time
 

1811
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,390
that I use. This is based on higher time
frames, uh, EMA, fib EMA off higher time

1812
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:34,400
frames, uh, EMA, fib EMA off higher time
 

1813
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,750
frames, uh, EMA, fib EMA off higher time
frames. If we can get a squeeze into

1814
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:35,760
frames. If we can get a squeeze into
 

1815
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,069
frames. If we can get a squeeze into
gray, it'd be great. Here we go. Locking

1816
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:38,079
gray, it'd be great. Here we go. Locking
 

1817
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,150
gray, it'd be great. Here we go. Locking
some in here through this. And really

1818
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:40,160
some in here through this. And really
 

1819
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,750
some in here through this. And really
now it's just can we get all the way up

1820
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:41,760
now it's just can we get all the way up
 

1821
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,230
now it's just can we get all the way up
into sort of 830s that would be

1822
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:44,240
into sort of 830s that would be
 

1823
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,150
into sort of 830s that would be
fantastic. All right, so we have

1824
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:46,160
fantastic. All right, so we have
 

1825
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,230
fantastic. All right, so we have
liquidity in this gray box. All right,

1826
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:48,240
liquidity in this gray box. All right,
 

1827
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,069
liquidity in this gray box. All right,
this is a big pivot. So, you want to

1828
00:45:50,069 --> 00:45:50,079
this is a big pivot. So, you want to
 

1829
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,710
this is a big pivot. So, you want to
peel some off.

1830
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:52,720
peel some off.
 

1831
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,069
peel some off.
Oh, this is going to be trade of the

1832
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:54,079
Oh, this is going to be trade of the
 

1833
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:54,950
Oh, this is going to be trade of the
day. I'm telling you, there's not going

1834
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:54,960
day. I'm telling you, there's not going
 

1835
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,230
day. I'm telling you, there's not going
to be anything better than this coming

1836
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:56,240
to be anything better than this coming
 

1837
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,150
to be anything better than this coming
today. All right, let's see if we can

1838
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:58,160
today. All right, let's see if we can
 

1839
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,829
today. All right, let's see if we can
get going then. If we get lucky, we get

1840
00:45:59,829 --> 00:45:59,839
get going then. If we get lucky, we get
 

1841
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:04,870
get going then. If we get lucky, we get
up into here now, folks.

1842
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:04,880

 

1843
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,990

I've been here two days. I want him to

1844
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:08,000
I've been here two days. I want him to
 

1845
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,870
I've been here two days. I want him to
hold my dick while I go to the toilet.

1846
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:10,880
hold my dick while I go to the toilet.
 

1847
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:17,349
hold my dick while I go to the toilet.
Get the [\h__\h] out of here.

1848
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:17,359

 

1849
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,710

Beautiful move, guys. Make sure you're

1850
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:18,720
Beautiful move, guys. Make sure you're
 

1851
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,710
Beautiful move, guys. Make sure you're
trimming some into this runners only.

1852
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:20,720
trimming some into this runners only.
 

1853
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,430
trimming some into this runners only.
Now, if we get lucky, we will get up

1854
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:23,440
Now, if we get lucky, we will get up
 

1855
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,349
Now, if we get lucky, we will get up
into here, right? But remember, we're in

1856
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:25,359
into here, right? But remember, we're in
 

1857
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:26,870
into here, right? But remember, we're in
light volume day. We don't know if we're

1858
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:26,880
light volume day. We don't know if we're
 

1859
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,710
light volume day. We don't know if we're
going to get that. So, we're going to

1860
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:28,720
going to get that. So, we're going to
 

1861
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,550
going to get that. So, we're going to
protect ourselves. We're going to assume

1862
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:30,560
protect ourselves. We're going to assume
 

1863
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,950
protect ourselves. We're going to assume
we're not. Finally, we're getting some

1864
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:32,960
we're not. Finally, we're getting some
 

1865
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,790
we're not. Finally, we're getting some
confluence here. VIX moving down with

1866
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:34,800
confluence here. VIX moving down with
 

1867
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,190
confluence here. VIX moving down with
the ES moving up. So, finally, those

1868
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:37,200
the ES moving up. So, finally, those
 

1869
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,470
the ES moving up. So, finally, those
things are aligned. They haven't been

1870
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:38,480
things are aligned. They haven't been
 

1871
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,150
things are aligned. They haven't been
aligned yesterday. They weren't aligned

1872
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:40,160
aligned yesterday. They weren't aligned
 

1873
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,829
aligned yesterday. They weren't aligned
this morning, but we're seeing a small

1874
00:46:41,829 --> 00:46:41,839
this morning, but we're seeing a small
 

1875
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:52,470
this morning, but we're seeing a small
amount of alignment.

1876
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:52,480

 

1877
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,309

They're still offering here at 75s and

1878
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:54,319
They're still offering here at 75s and
 

1879
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,550
They're still offering here at 75s and
80s which is good. So they are providing

1880
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:56,560
80s which is good. So they are providing
 

1881
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,950
80s which is good. So they are providing
some liquidity here. Let's have a look.

1882
00:46:58,950 --> 00:46:58,960
some liquidity here. Let's have a look.
 

1883
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,390
some liquidity here. Let's have a look.
800 817 is on there. 840 850. So it's

1884
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:02,400
800 817 is on there. 840 850. So it's
 

1885
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,230
800 817 is on there. 840 850. So it's
good. They are providing some liquidity.

1886
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:04,240
good. They are providing some liquidity.
 

1887
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,670
good. They are providing some liquidity.
We just want to see if buyers are going

1888
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:05,680
We just want to see if buyers are going
 

1889
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,950
We just want to see if buyers are going
to be aggressive here. But we had the

1890
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:06,960
to be aggressive here. But we had the
 

1891
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,309
to be aggressive here. But we had the
best buy of the day there. All right.

1892
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:08,319
best buy of the day there. All right.
 

1893
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,069
best buy of the day there. All right.
Unfortunately, you know, I'm not going

1894
00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:10,079
Unfortunately, you know, I'm not going
 

1895
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,670
Unfortunately, you know, I'm not going
to bid down here and just wait. I would

1896
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:11,680
to bid down here and just wait. I would
 

1897
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,870
to bid down here and just wait. I would
have loved to have been a buyer down

1898
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:12,880
have loved to have been a buyer down
 

1899
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,230
have loved to have been a buyer down
there if it just done something like

1900
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:14,240
there if it just done something like
 

1901
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,150
there if it just done something like
this. But this was the move here where

1902
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:16,160
this. But this was the move here where
 

1903
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,390
this. But this was the move here where
we backtracked to 20 and we're getting

1904
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:18,400
we backtracked to 20 and we're getting
 

1905
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,309
we backtracked to 20 and we're getting
going now. And we called it out ahead of

1906
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:20,319
going now. And we called it out ahead of
 

1907
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,990
going now. And we called it out ahead of
time. Told you what I was looking at and

1908
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:22,000
time. Told you what I was looking at and
 

1909
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,470
time. Told you what I was looking at and
why. And uh this is the next stop. So

1910
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:24,480
why. And uh this is the next stop. So
 

1911
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,230
why. And uh this is the next stop. So
let's just see. Really nice here. We

1912
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:26,240
let's just see. Really nice here. We
 

1913
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,670
let's just see. Really nice here. We
have some old imbalances here just so

1914
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:27,680
have some old imbalances here just so
 

1915
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,470
have some old imbalances here just so
you're aware from yesterday. So uh I'd

1916
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:30,480
you're aware from yesterday. So uh I'd
 

1917
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,829
you're aware from yesterday. So uh I'd
say sort of 77 to 80s and then through

1918
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:33,839
say sort of 77 to 80s and then through
 

1919
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,990
say sort of 77 to 80s and then through
that 800s.

1920
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:36,000
that 800s.
 

1921
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,098
that 800s.
So make sure you pay yourself.

1922
00:47:39,098 --> 00:47:39,108
So make sure you pay yourself.
 

1923
00:47:39,108 --> 00:47:42,309
So make sure you pay yourself.

1925
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,790

I know. I know. I know. I know, guys.

1926

I know. I know. I know. I know, guys.
 

1927
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,270
I know. I know. I know. I know, guys.
It's uh trust me, it drives me more

1928
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:47,280
It's uh trust me, it drives me more
 

1929
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,670
It's uh trust me, it drives me more
insane than you when I sit here

1930
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:49,680
insane than you when I sit here
 

1931
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,990
insane than you when I sit here
literally calling level two and tape out

1932
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:52,000
literally calling level two and tape out
 

1933

literally calling level two and tape out
and and order flow as it moves, which is

00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:54,400

I'm telling you now, it's a skill. You

1936
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:56,000
I'm telling you now, it's a skill. You
 

1937
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,589
I'm telling you now, it's a skill. You
don't get that skill overnight. It takes

1938
00:47:57,589 --> 00:47:57,599
don't get that skill overnight. It takes
 

1939
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,630
don't get that skill overnight. It takes
time. And uh I do it for free and still

1940
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:00,640
time. And uh I do it for free and still
 

1941
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,950
time. And uh I do it for free and still
I get questions. It's incredible. There

1942
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:02,960
I get questions. It's incredible. There
 

1943
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,030
I get questions. It's incredible. There
we go.

1944
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
we go.
 

1945
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,309
we go.
It's okay.

1946
00:48:08,309 --> 00:48:08,319
It's okay.
 

1947
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,349
It's okay.
It's okay. Right. Positive attitude. All

1948
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:11,359
It's okay. Right. Positive attitude. All
 

1949
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:12,870
It's okay. Right. Positive attitude. All
right. And all we're seeing now, you

1950
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:12,880
right. And all we're seeing now, you
 

1951
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,910
right. And all we're seeing now, you
just want to be careful. You want to see

1952
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:15,920
just want to be careful. You want to see
 

1953
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,910
just want to be careful. You want to see
rebids come in at these same levels,

1954
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:17,920
rebids come in at these same levels,
 

1955
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,309
rebids come in at these same levels,
right? So structurally, we have a low

1956
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:20,319
right? So structurally, we have a low
 

1957
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,309
right? So structurally, we have a low
volume node here. Now, you want to see

1958
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:22,319
volume node here. Now, you want to see
 

1959
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,910
volume node here. Now, you want to see
buyers protect this, right? So, we'd

1960
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:23,920
buyers protect this, right? So, we'd
 

1961
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,349
buyers protect this, right? So, we'd
like it, if we're going to go higher, we

1962
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:25,359
like it, if we're going to go higher, we
 

1963
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:26,630
like it, if we're going to go higher, we
want a bear trap. But remember, this is

1964
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:26,640
want a bear trap. But remember, this is
 

1965
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,910
want a bear trap. But remember, this is
a liquidity level. We've talked about

1966
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:27,920
a liquidity level. We've talked about
 

1967
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,589
a liquidity level. We've talked about
this. This is from yesterday and from

1968
00:48:29,589 --> 00:48:29,599
this. This is from yesterday and from
 

1969
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,190
this. This is from yesterday and from
last week, right? So, if we're going to

1970
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:31,200
last week, right? So, if we're going to
 

1971
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,109
last week, right? So, if we're going to
go higher, uh, you definitely don't want

1972
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:33,119
go higher, uh, you definitely don't want
 

1973
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,950
go higher, uh, you definitely don't want
it beneath this. And you'd want sort of

1974
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:34,960
it beneath this. And you'd want sort of
 

1975
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,390
it beneath this. And you'd want sort of
a little bare trap like that if you're

1976
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:36,400
a little bare trap like that if you're
 

1977
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,670
a little bare trap like that if you're
going to hold on. What you don't want to

1978
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:37,680
going to hold on. What you don't want to
 

1979
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,589
going to hold on. What you don't want to
see is a volume shelf built out. If you

1980
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:39,599
see is a volume shelf built out. If you
 

1981
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,270
see is a volume shelf built out. If you
remember the play yesterday that I took

1982
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:41,280
remember the play yesterday that I took
 

1983
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,270
remember the play yesterday that I took
short, what you do not want to see is a

1984
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:43,280
short, what you do not want to see is a
 

1985
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,349
short, what you do not want to see is a
big volume shelf being built out here.

1986
00:48:45,349 --> 00:48:45,359
big volume shelf being built out here.
 

1987
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:46,710
big volume shelf being built out here.
All right? And then a failure underneath

1988
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:46,720
All right? And then a failure underneath
 

1989
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,549
All right? And then a failure underneath
and a rotation. So, make sure you're

1990
00:48:48,549 --> 00:48:48,559
and a rotation. So, make sure you're
 

1991
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,069
and a rotation. So, make sure you're
locking in. That's why that gray box is

1992
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:50,079
locking in. That's why that gray box is
 

1993
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,349
locking in. That's why that gray box is
here. We know it's a big liquidity

1994
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:51,359
here. We know it's a big liquidity
 

1995
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,510
here. We know it's a big liquidity
level. We've just traded into it. Buyers

1996
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:53,520
level. We've just traded into it. Buyers
 

1997
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,190
level. We've just traded into it. Buyers
must step up now in front of previous

1998
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:55,200
must step up now in front of previous
 

1999
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,190
must step up now in front of previous
day's value area high. Ideally, a bear

2000
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:57,200
day's value area high. Ideally, a bear
 

2001
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,349
day's value area high. Ideally, a bear
trap in low volume and that your

2002
00:48:59,349 --> 00:48:59,359
trap in low volume and that your
 

2003
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,910
trap in low volume and that your
continuation. Do not let it build out a

2004
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:01,920
continuation. Do not let it build out a
 

2005
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,549
continuation. Do not let it build out a
big fat shelf and then reject and come

2006
00:49:04,549 --> 00:49:04,559
big fat shelf and then reject and come
 

2007
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,630
big fat shelf and then reject and come
lower and be holding on to your buys.

2008
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:06,640
lower and be holding on to your buys.
 

2009
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,230
lower and be holding on to your buys.
All right? You don't do not want to see

2010
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:08,240
All right? You don't do not want to see
 

2011
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,950
All right? You don't do not want to see
that. If we get back underneath value,

2012
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:10,960
that. If we get back underneath value,
 

2013
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,230
that. If we get back underneath value,

2167
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,430
acceptance and a break back out above
this or break below. If we go below,

2168
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:39,440
this or break below. If we go below,
 

2169
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,430
this or break below. If we go below,
we're going to go back inside value and

2170
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:41,440
we're going to go back inside value and
 

2171
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,109
we're going to go back inside value and
that can be a rotation down. So you can

2172
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:43,119
that can be a rotation down. So you can
 

2173
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,549
that can be a rotation down. So you can
see these passive buyers sitting on the

2174
00:52:44,549 --> 00:52:44,559
see these passive buyers sitting on the
 

2175
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,790
see these passive buyers sitting on the
book right now trying to absorb from 30

2176
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:46,800
book right now trying to absorb from 30
 

2177
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,710
book right now trying to absorb from 30
to 25. Right? That's where the passive

2178
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:48,720
to 25. Right? That's where the passive
 

2179
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,790
to 25. Right? That's where the passive
buyers are sat right now. Everything in

2180
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:50,800
buyers are sat right now. Everything in
 

2181
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,710
buyers are sat right now. Everything in
here is choppy while they make their

2182
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:52,720
here is choppy while they make their
 

2183
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,549
here is choppy while they make their
mind up. Remember, this is value area

2184
00:52:54,549 --> 00:52:54,559
mind up. Remember, this is value area
 

2185
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,230
mind up. Remember, this is value area
high, previous day value area high in

2186
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:56,240
high, previous day value area high in
 

2187
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,750
high, previous day value area high in
here. The question is, did do these

2188
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:57,760
here. The question is, did do these
 

2189
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,589
here. The question is, did do these
buyers do a little look below, fail,

2190
00:52:59,589 --> 00:52:59,599
buyers do a little look below, fail,
 

2191
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,069
buyers do a little look below, fail,
absorb, and then send it back up, or are

2192
00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:02,079
absorb, and then send it back up, or are
 

2193
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,349
absorb, and then send it back up, or are
sellers going to come with strength here

2194
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:03,359
sellers going to come with strength here
 

2195
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,710
sellers going to come with strength here
for a break? Right? So, that's what

2196
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:04,720
for a break? Right? So, that's what
 

2197
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,829
for a break? Right? So, that's what
we're looking at when we're looking at

2198
00:53:05,829 --> 00:53:05,839
we're looking at when we're looking at
 

2199
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:14,309
we're looking at when we're looking at
the level two at the moment. [snorts]

2200
00:53:14,309 --> 00:53:14,319

 

2201
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,950

So, into this pacifier at 35, if they

2202
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:16,960
So, into this pacifier at 35, if they
 

2203
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,190
So, into this pacifier at 35, if they
snap him, there's a 10point shove down

2204
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:19,200
snap him, there's a 10point shove down
 

2205
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,950
snap him, there's a 10point shove down
very, very quickly. So, he's starting to

2206
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:20,960
very, very quickly. So, he's starting to
 

2207
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,710
very, very quickly. So, he's starting to
be filled, but we're talking about small

2208
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:22,720
be filled, but we're talking about small
 

2209
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,069
be filled, but we're talking about small
size here, folks. When we look at the

2210
00:53:24,069 --> 00:53:24,079
size here, folks. When we look at the
 

2211
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,230
size here, folks. When we look at the
book at the moment, we're talking about

2212
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:26,240
book at the moment, we're talking about
 

2213
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,910
book at the moment, we're talking about
45 lot on the book. We're not talking

2214
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:27,920
45 lot on the book. We're not talking
 

2215
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,150
45 lot on the book. We're not talking
about hundreds of lots absorbing the

2216
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:30,160
about hundreds of lots absorbing the
 

2217
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,069
about hundreds of lots absorbing the
tape.

2218
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:32,079
tape.
 

2219
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:33,670
tape.
Lots of you getting the wind there. Nice

2220
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:33,680
Lots of you getting the wind there. Nice

00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:40,400

 

2223
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,870

Still absorbing around here for now. But

2224
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:42,880
Still absorbing around here for now. But
 

2225
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,430
Still absorbing around here for now. But
you can see you got to be careful here

2226
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:45,440
you can see you got to be careful here
 

2227
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,790
you can see you got to be careful here
because we're building out volume. All

2228
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:46,800
because we're building out volume. All
 

2229
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,510
because we're building out volume. All
right, you can see this.

2230
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:49,520
right, you can see this.
 

2231
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,950
right, you can see this.
All right, buyers will be looking for

2232
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:50,960
All right, buyers will be looking for
 

2233
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,390
All right, buyers will be looking for
this. Sellers will be looking for this

2234
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:52,400
this. Sellers will be looking for this
 

2235
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,030
this. Sellers will be looking for this
break below. We're thin down here. All

2236
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:55,040
break below. We're thin down here. All
 

2237
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,710
break below. We're thin down here. All
right. So, if sellers win this, they

2238
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:56,720
right. So, if sellers win this, they
 

2239
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,470
right. So, if sellers win this, they
complete rotation. If buyers win this,

2240
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:58,480
complete rotation. If buyers win this,
 

2241
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,309
complete rotation. If buyers win this,
then they will try and get through the

2242
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:00,319
then they will try and get through the
 

2243
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:01,990
then they will try and get through the
gray box and get up into there. Those

2244
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:02,000
gray box and get up into there. Those
 

2245
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,910
gray box and get up into there. Those
are the moves, right? Those are the

2246
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:03,920
are the moves, right? Those are the
 

2247

delta, my big big participants who are
 

2291
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,790
delta, my big big participants who are
stuck. That's uh where my edge comes

2292
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:02,800
stuck. That's uh where my edge comes

have to use bookmap. It's just what I

2296
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:06,000
have to use bookmap. It's just what I
 

2297
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,710

I'd need a strong reclaimed levels. So,

2302
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:16,319
I'd need a strong reclaimed levels. So,
 

2303
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,390
I'd need a strong reclaimed levels. So,
I'm not I'm not bidding in here. Oh,

2304
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:18,400
I'm not I'm not bidding in here. Oh,
 

2305

we're not finding acceptance above
 

2311
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,349
we're not finding acceptance above
value. So, I'd need to see something

2312
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:25,359
value. So, I'd need to see something
 

2313
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,430
value. So, I'd need to see something
like this to get back long. All right.

2314
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:27,440
like this to get back long. All right.
 

2315
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,030
like this to get back long. All right.
Maybe a trigger here. And maybe I'd

2316
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:29,040
Maybe a trigger here. And maybe I'd
 

2317
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,309
Maybe a trigger here. And maybe I'd
consider an ad up there. Although, it'd

2318
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:30,319
consider an ad up there. Although, it'd
 

2319
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:33,910
consider an ad up there. Although, it'd
be very risky. Right. Right now, we

2320
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:33,920
be very risky. Right. Right now, we
 

2321
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,309
be very risky. Right. Right now, we
cannot get above previous days value.

2322
00:55:36,309 --> 00:55:36,319
cannot get above previous days value.
 

2323
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,790
cannot get above previous days value.
So, it is possible that they rotate all

2324
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:38,800
So, it is possible that they rotate all
 

2325
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,190
So, it is possible that they rotate all
the way down to here. Right. And if they

2326
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:41,200
the way down to here. Right. And if they
 

2327
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,109
the way down to here. Right. And if they
get acceptance under this, then we've

2328
00:55:43,109 --> 00:55:43,119
get acceptance under this, then we've
 

2329
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:45,030
get acceptance under this, then we've
got previous day's value and previous

2330
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:45,040
got previous day's value and previous
 

2331
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,790
got previous day's value and previous
week's value. All right, this would be

2332
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:46,800
week's value. All right, this would be
 

2333
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,309
week's value. All right, this would be
exactly the same as what we've done up

2334
00:55:48,309 --> 00:55:48,319
exactly the same as what we've done up
 

2335
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:51,190
exactly the same as what we've done up
here if they do uh this move here. All

2336
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:51,200
here if they do uh this move here. All
 

2337
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,950
here if they do uh this move here. All
right, so this move here is this move

2338
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:52,960
right, so this move here is this move
 

2339
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,950
right, so this move here is this move
here. So it's a mirror, right? If you

2340
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:54,960
here. So it's a mirror, right? If you
 

2341
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,829
here. So it's a mirror, right? If you
think about this as 50% previous day

2342
00:55:57,829 --> 00:55:57,839
think about this as 50% previous day
 

2343
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,910
think about this as 50% previous day
value area high, previous day value area

2344
00:55:59,910 --> 00:55:59,920
value area high, previous day value area
 

2345
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,710
value area high, previous day value area
low at the moment, no acceptance above

2346
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:02,720
low at the moment, no acceptance above
 

2347
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,789
low at the moment, no acceptance above
above here. If they reclaim, maybe they

2348
00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:04,799
above here. If they reclaim, maybe they
 

2349
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,230
above here. If they reclaim, maybe they
go for acceptance, but if they can't

2350
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:06,240
go for acceptance, but if they can't
 

2351
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,390
go for acceptance, but if they can't
reclaim, then the rotation is possible

2352
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:08,400
reclaim, then the rotation is possible
 

2353
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,990
reclaim, then the rotation is possible
because we're in a rotational market,

2354
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:10,000
because we're in a rotational market,
 

2355
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,990
because we're in a rotational market,
which is why I said you must take profit

2356
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:12,000
which is why I said you must take profit
 

2357
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,390
which is why I said you must take profit
into here and here. We're not in a

2358
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:14,400
into here and here. We're not in a
 

2359
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,549
into here and here. We're not in a
trending market, right? We're not in a

2360
00:56:16,549 --> 00:56:16,559
trending market, right? We're not in a
 

2361
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,069
trending market, right? We're not in a
guaranteed trending market. So, we

2362
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:18,079
guaranteed trending market. So, we
 

2363
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,270
guaranteed trending market. So, we
position for the trend. We take profit

2364
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:21,280
position for the trend. We take profit
 

2365
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,990
position for the trend. We take profit
at key levels and we wait to see if it

2366
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:24,000
at key levels and we wait to see if it
 

2367
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,150
at key levels and we wait to see if it
wants to trend. We don't know if it's

2368
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:26,160
wants to trend. We don't know if it's
 

2369
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,990
wants to trend. We don't know if it's
going to offer that. It didn't offer it.

2370
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:28,000
going to offer that. It didn't offer it.
 

2371
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,950
going to offer that. It didn't offer it.
Now, what are we doing? Yesterday

2372
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:30,960
Now, what are we doing? Yesterday
 

2373
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,670
Now, what are we doing? Yesterday
was what? A rotation

2374
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:35,680

 

2375
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,990

here.

2376
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:38,000
here.
 

2377
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,510
here.
Today currently is a rotation here. We

2378
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:41,520
Today currently is a rotation here. We
 

2379
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,870
Today currently is a rotation here. We
are what? We are inside

2380
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:44,880
are what? We are inside
 

2381
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,270
are what? We are inside
bar on the daily. So let's think about

2382
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:47,280
bar on the daily. So let's think about
 

2383
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,030
bar on the daily. So let's think about
that

2384
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:49,040
that
 

2385
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,670
that
daily bar

2386
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:51,680
daily bar
 

2387
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,349
daily bar
volume and value yesterday.

2388
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:55,359
volume and value yesterday.
 

2389
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:58,390
volume and value yesterday.
Volume and value today so far condensed,

2390
00:56:58,390 --> 00:56:58,400
Volume and value today so far condensed,
 

2391
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,789
Volume and value today so far condensed,
right? We're condensed. So we have to

2392
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:00,799
right? We're condensed. So we have to
 

2393
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,990
right? We're condensed. So we have to
play edge to edge take profit. Wait to

2394
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:04,000
play edge to edge take profit. Wait to
 

2395
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,030
play edge to edge take profit. Wait to
see if we find acceptance. Edge to edge,

2396
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:07,040
see if we find acceptance. Edge to edge,
 

2397
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,950
see if we find acceptance. Edge to edge,
take profit, wait to see if we find

2398
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:08,960
take profit, wait to see if we find
 

2399
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,710
take profit, wait to see if we find
acceptance lower. That's all we're

2400
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:10,720
acceptance lower. That's all we're
 

2401
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,670
acceptance lower. That's all we're
doing. We are creating liquidity for the

2402
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:13,680
doing. We are creating liquidity for the
 

2403
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,159
doing. We are creating liquidity for the
bigger move.

2404
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:16,169
bigger move.
 

2405
00:57:16,169 --> 00:57:25,990
bigger move.

2407
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,549

Uh no this uh the indicator you're

2408
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:28,559
Uh no this uh the indicator you're
 

2409
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,950
Uh no this uh the indicator you're
looking at is my frozone pro. It's not

2410
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:30,960
looking at is my frozone pro. It's not
 

2411
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,870
looking at is my frozone pro. It's not
free. All right. But it's not just a

2412
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:32,880
free. All right. But it's not just a
 

2413
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,309

algos uh this box up here to tell you

2420
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:44,480
algos uh this box up here to tell you
 

2421
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,829
algos uh this box up here to tell you
what type of condition we're in. Right

2422
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:45,839
what type of condition we're in. Right
 

2423
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,190
what type of condition we're in. Right
now we're in liquidity building

2424
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:47,200
now we're in liquidity building
 

2425

genius USA I think that is starting to

2440
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:05,440
genius USA I think that is starting to
 

2441
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,630
genius USA I think that is starting to
look exactly the same pattern from the

2442
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:06,640
look exactly the same pattern from the
 

2443
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,390
look exactly the same pattern from the
last two days it's it's just a rotation

2444
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:08,400
last two days it's it's just a rotation
 

2445
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,630
last two days it's it's just a rotation
right so it's a rotation

2446
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:12,640

 

2447
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,789

yes quite right a lot of you saying very

2448
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:14,799
yes quite right a lot of you saying very
 

2449
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:16,390
yes quite right a lot of you saying very
similar to yesterday that's it because

2450
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:16,400
similar to yesterday that's it because
 

2451
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,549
similar to yesterday that's it because
we're we're back inside value we're not

first thing I always look at what are we

2460
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:27,200
first thing I always look at what are we
 

2461
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,510
first thing I always look at what are we
inside previous week we're inside

2462
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:29,520
inside previous week we're inside
 

2463
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,990
inside previous week we're inside
previous day we expect rotation We're at

2464
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:32,000
previous day we expect rotation We're at
 

2465
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,750
previous day we expect rotation We're at
the mean. We're not above this. We're

2466
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:33,760
the mean. We're not above this. We're
 

2467
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,829
the mean. We're not above this. We're
not below that as well, right? We're not

2468
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:35,839
not below that as well, right? We're not
 

2469
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:38,150
not below that as well, right? We're not
underneath this for continuation. We're

2470
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:38,160
underneath this for continuation. We're
 

2471
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,990
underneath this for continuation. We're
not above this node for continuation.

2472
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:40,000
not above this node for continuation.
 

2473
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,230
not above this node for continuation.
So, everything's saying build liquidity.

2474
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:42,240
So, everything's saying build liquidity.
 

2475
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,309
So, everything's saying build liquidity.
Absolutely everything in this market

2476
00:58:44,309 --> 00:58:44,319
Absolutely everything in this market
 

2477
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,069
Absolutely everything in this market
from a weekly, from a daily, from the

2478
00:58:46,069 --> 00:58:46,079
from a weekly, from a daily, from the
 

2479
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,030
from a weekly, from a daily, from the
EMAs, from volume, even on this higher

2480
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:49,040
EMAs, from volume, even on this higher
 

2481
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,950
EMAs, from volume, even on this higher
time frame daily chart is saying build

2482
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:50,960
time frame daily chart is saying build
 

2483
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,390
time frame daily chart is saying build
liquidity. From there, we went to an

2484
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:52,400
liquidity. From there, we went to an
 

2485
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,309
liquidity. From there, we went to an
hourly chart.

2486
00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:54,319
hourly chart.
 

2487
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:55,990
hourly chart.
The hourly chart is quite clearly

2488
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:56,000
The hourly chart is quite clearly
 

2489
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,230
The hourly chart is quite clearly
showing you that we are currently inside

2490
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:58,240
showing you that we are currently inside
 

2491
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,870
showing you that we are currently inside
of previous days, previous week's value

2492
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:00,880
of previous days, previous week's value
 

2493
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,109
of previous days, previous week's value
and we're inside of previous days value.

2494
00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:03,119
and we're inside of previous days value.
 

2495
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,870
and we're inside of previous days value.
So that's also telling you what build

2496
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:04,880
So that's also telling you what build
 

2497
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,309
So that's also telling you what build
liquidity. Okay? So you have to wait. We

2498
00:59:08,309 --> 00:59:08,319
liquidity. Okay? So you have to wait. We
 

2499
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:09,910
liquidity. Okay? So you have to wait. We
talked about this earlier in Discord.

2500
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:09,920
talked about this earlier in Discord.
 

2501
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,390
talked about this earlier in Discord.
Those looking for this move here, right?

2502
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:12,400
Those looking for this move here, right?
 

2503
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,750
Those looking for this move here, right?
You have to understand that this has to

2504
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:13,760
You have to understand that this has to
 

2505
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,190
You have to understand that this has to
build it all out and you have to be very

2506
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:15,200
build it all out and you have to be very
 

2507
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,789
build it all out and you have to be very
aware of that move there. You do not

2508
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:16,799
aware of that move there. You do not
 

2509
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:17,910
aware of that move there. You do not
want to get caught in that. So you want

2510
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:17,920
want to get caught in that. So you want
 

2511
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,430
want to get caught in that. So you want
to see big break if you're going to look

2512
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:19,440
to see big break if you're going to look
 

2513
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,510
to see big break if you're going to look
for that move and a trade into an old

2514
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:21,520
for that move and a trade into an old
 

2515
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,510
for that move and a trade into an old
weekly value and point of control.

2516
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:23,520
weekly value and point of control.
 

2517
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,190
weekly value and point of control.
Fantastic. This was probably where

2518
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:25,200
Fantastic. This was probably where
 

2519
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,870
Fantastic. This was probably where
higher time frame buyers show up if they

2520
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:26,880
higher time frame buyers show up if they
 

2521
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,270
higher time frame buyers show up if they
do until that point. Got to be careful

2522
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:29,280
do until that point. Got to be careful
 

2523
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,510
do until that point. Got to be careful
because this is what the market is going

2524
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:31,520
because this is what the market is going
 

2525
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,990
because this is what the market is going
to do. All right. And once we use these

2526
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:34,000
to do. All right. And once we use these
 

2527
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,750
to do. All right. And once we use these
players, we can get a break.

2528
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:37,760
players, we can get a break.
 

2529
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,190
players, we can get a break.
Right? It's important that you start on

2530
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:39,200
Right? It's important that you start on
 

2531
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,710
Right? It's important that you start on
the higher time frame and work your way

2532
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:40,720
the higher time frame and work your way
 

2533
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,950
the higher time frame and work your way
down so you understand where you are at

2534
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:42,960
down so you understand where you are at
 

2535
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,349
down so you understand where you are at
versus the big players.

2536
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:45,359
versus the big players.
 

2537
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,109
versus the big players.
Rotation starting to take place now. So

2538
00:59:47,109 --> 00:59:47,119
Rotation starting to take place now. So
 

2539
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:49,349
Rotation starting to take place now. So
those of you who like the rotation,

2540
00:59:49,349 --> 00:59:49,359
those of you who like the rotation,
 

2541
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:50,870
those of you who like the rotation,
right, we keep failing this. We talked

2542
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:50,880
right, we keep failing this. We talked
 

2543
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,630
right, we keep failing this. We talked
about this. We will probably if we fail

2544
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:52,640
about this. We will probably if we fail
 

2545
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,069
about this. We will probably if we fail
this, we will probably come down into

2546
00:59:54,069 --> 00:59:54,079
this, we will probably come down into
 

2547
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:56,230
this, we will probably come down into
here. Watch this low volume node here.

2548
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:56,240
here. Watch this low volume node here.
 

2549
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,150
here. Watch this low volume node here.
And then previous day point control.

2550
00:59:58,150 --> 00:59:58,160
And then previous day point control.
 

2551
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,990
And then previous day point control.
Previous day value area low. Previous

2552
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:00,000
Previous day value area low. Previous
 

2553
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,309
Previous day value area low. Previous
week value area low. Right. I'm going to

2554
01:00:02,309 --> 01:00:02,319
week value area low. Right. I'm going to
 

2555
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,470
week value area low. Right. I'm going to
avoid this like the plague. Like I

2556
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:04,480
avoid this like the plague. Like I
 

2557
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,270
avoid this like the plague. Like I
always say, avoid it like the plague.

2558
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:07,280
always say, avoid it like the plague.
 

2559
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,710
always say, avoid it like the plague.
It's just for me because I don't like

2560
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:08,720
It's just for me because I don't like
 

2561
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:13,750
It's just for me because I don't like
playing in rotation.

2562
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:13,760

 

2563
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,990

Curious around previous day value high

2564
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:16,000
Curious around previous day value high
 

2565
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,990
Curious around previous day value high
and previous day value low. Is that an

2566
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:18,000
and previous day value low. Is that an
 

2567
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,990
and previous day value low. Is that an
indicator is just manually set by me?

2568
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:20,000
indicator is just manually set by me?
 

2569
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,750
indicator is just manually set by me?
Yeah, I just draw it on, mate. Yeah. So,

2570
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:21,760
Yeah, I just draw it on, mate. Yeah. So,
 

2571
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,510
Yeah, I just draw it on, mate. Yeah. So,
I measure it out the previous day and

2572
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:23,520
I measure it out the previous day and
 

2573
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,430
I measure it out the previous day and
then I just put my horizontal lines on.

2574
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:25,440
then I just put my horizontal lines on.
 

2575
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,190
then I just put my horizontal lines on.
And really, you only ever need to do it

2576
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:27,200
And really, you only ever need to do it
 

2577
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,950
And really, you only ever need to do it
once, right? So, if you do your weekly

2578
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:28,960
once, right? So, if you do your weekly
 

2579
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,950
once, right? So, if you do your weekly
and daily levels, you set your weekly

2580
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:30,960
and daily levels, you set your weekly
 

2581
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,510
and daily levels, you set your weekly
levels on a Monday or a Sunday and you

2582
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:33,520
levels on a Monday or a Sunday and you
 

2583
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,990
levels on a Monday or a Sunday and you
do move your daily levels each day. So,

2584
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:36,000
do move your daily levels each day. So,
 

2585
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,190
do move your daily levels each day. So,
you just draw them once and then you

2586
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:37,200
you just draw them once and then you
 

2587
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,950
you just draw them once and then you
move them. It's not too hard. But yeah,

2588
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:38,960
move them. It's not too hard. But yeah,
 

2589
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,390
move them. It's not too hard. But yeah,
I don't have an indicator for it.

2590
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:42,400
I don't have an indicator for it.
 

2591
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,030
I don't have an indicator for it.
Do I follow market cycles at all or just

2592
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:45,040
Do I follow market cycles at all or just
 

2593
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,390
Do I follow market cycles at all or just
price action? my cycle has us going down

2594
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:48,400
price action? my cycle has us going down
 

2595
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,829
price action? my cycle has us going down
into Jan 5th or 8th. Uh, no, I don't

2596
01:00:51,829 --> 01:00:51,839
into Jan 5th or 8th. Uh, no, I don't
 

2597
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,430
into Jan 5th or 8th. Uh, no, I don't
really follow cycles. I might I might

2598
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:53,440
really follow cycles. I might I might
 

2599
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,870
really follow cycles. I might I might
look at historical data and see where

2600
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:56,880
look at historical data and see where
 

2601
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,510
look at historical data and see where
edge is historically, where, you know,

2602
01:00:59,510 --> 01:00:59,520
edge is historically, where, you know,
 

2603
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,109
edge is historically, where, you know,
where the market is likely to go into a

2604
01:01:01,109 --> 01:01:01,119
where the market is likely to go into a
 

2605
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:02,789
where the market is likely to go into a
fade, but I don't pay too much

2606
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:02,799
fade, but I don't pay too much
 

2607
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:04,470
fade, but I don't pay too much
attention. Price and volume is king for

2608
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:04,480
attention. Price and volume is king for
 

2609
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,510
attention. Price and volume is king for
me. Cycles might work better for uh

2610
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:07,520
me. Cycles might work better for uh
 

2611
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,510
me. Cycles might work better for uh
swing positions if you're if you're more

2612
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:09,520
swing positions if you're if you're more
 

2613
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:17,030
swing positions if you're if you're more
focused.

2614
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:17,040

 

2615
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,829

So, anyone who took that look above and

2616
01:01:19,829 --> 01:01:19,839
So, anyone who took that look above and
 

2617
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,549
So, anyone who took that look above and
fail

2618
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:22,559
fail
 

2619
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,990
fail
into my gray box

2620
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:26,000
into my gray box
 

2621
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,430
into my gray box
and decided they were going to fade

2622
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:27,440
and decided they were going to fade
 

2623
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,349
and decided they were going to fade
against value. All right, these are

2624
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:29,359
against value. All right, these are
 

2625
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,710
against value. All right, these are
coming into your TP1s. This is your TP2.

2626
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:32,720
coming into your TP1s. This is your TP2.
 

2627
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,710
coming into your TP1s. This is your TP2.
These are your TP3s. All right. So,

2628
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:34,720
These are your TP3s. All right. So,
 

2629
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,950
These are your TP3s. All right. So,
anyone who got short into I don't guess

2630
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:36,960
anyone who got short into I don't guess
 

2631
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,750
anyone who got short into I don't guess
730s, you need to be starting to partial

2632
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:39,760
730s, you need to be starting to partial
 

2633
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,630
730s, you need to be starting to partial
out now into these lows and see if you

2634
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:42,640
out now into these lows and see if you
 

2635
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,870
out now into these lows and see if you
find acceptance underneath these now.

2636
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:44,880
find acceptance underneath these now.
 

2637
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,630
find acceptance underneath these now.
But here's previous day and previous

2638
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:46,640
But here's previous day and previous
 

2639
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,910
But here's previous day and previous
week point of control. So, these are

2640
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:47,920
week point of control. So, these are
 

2641
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,109
week point of control. So, these are
areas of value from the previous week.

2642
01:01:51,109 --> 01:01:51,119
areas of value from the previous week.
 

2643
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:52,870
areas of value from the previous week.
These were the most fair areas of value

2644
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:52,880
These were the most fair areas of value
 

2645
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,549
These were the most fair areas of value
from the previous week. It is also our

2646
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:54,559
from the previous week. It is also our
 

2647
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,230
from the previous week. It is also our
current value area low on the day. So,

2648
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:56,240
current value area low on the day. So,
 

2649
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,190
current value area low on the day. So,
you must be taking some profit here. I

2650
01:01:59,190 --> 01:01:59,200
you must be taking some profit here. I
 

2651
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,349
you must be taking some profit here. I
don't use Elliot wave. No,

Right. So, here's GlobeEx. If you see
follow through down into here, the next

2710
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:21,839
follow through down into here, the next
 

2711
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,029
follow through down into here, the next
levels will be down into here. So,

2712
01:03:23,029 --> 01:03:23,039
levels will be down into here. So,
 

2713
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,309
levels will be down into here. So,
anyone who took that shot is actually

What indicators can we use to mark
 

2729
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,950
What indicators can we use to mark
previous day values?

2730
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:54,960
previous day values?
 

2731
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,750
previous day values?
Uh right here,

2732
01:03:59,750 --> 01:03:59,760

 

2733
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,870

uh fixed range volume profile, right?

2734
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:02,880
uh fixed range volume profile, right?
 

2735
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,510
uh fixed range volume profile, right?
And you just draw it on just draw it on

2736
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:05,520
And you just draw it on just draw it on
 

2737
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,829
And you just draw it on just draw it on
from 9:30 to 4:00. That's all you need

2738
01:04:07,829 --> 01:04:07,839
from 9:30 to 4:00. That's all you need

01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:10,069
controls right here. I want to see if
this player is real up here or if he

2784
01:05:10,069 --> 01:05:10,079
this player is real up here or if he
 

2785
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:12,309
this player is real up here or if he
lifts or is he pinning this market down?

2786
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:12,319
lifts or is he pinning this market down?
 

2787
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:13,990
lifts or is he pinning this market down?
That last shove up. We've got buyers

2788
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:14,000
That last shove up. We've got buyers
 

2789
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,670
That last shove up. We've got buyers
caught

2790
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:15,680
caught
 

2791
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,390
caught
into sevens. Uh their pain point really

2792
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:18,400
into sevens. Uh their pain point really
 

2793
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,230
into sevens. Uh their pain point really
is up around 704 to 707. And this player

2794
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:22,240
is up around 704 to 707. And this player
 

2795
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,150
is up around 704 to 707. And this player
is just dangling up here at the moment.

2796
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:24,160
is just dangling up here at the moment.
 

2797
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,829
is just dangling up here at the moment.
So I'm waiting to see if we shove up

2798
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:25,839
So I'm waiting to see if we shove up
 

2799
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,710
So I'm waiting to see if we shove up
into him and if he's legit and if buyers

2800
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:28,720
into him and if he's legit and if buyers
 

2801
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:32,069
into him and if he's legit and if buyers
get caught and if we continue to sell.

2802
01:05:32,069 --> 01:05:32,079
get caught and if we continue to sell.
 

2803
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:33,670
get caught and if we continue to sell.
Not that I want to take it. I'm just

2804
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:33,680
Not that I want to take it. I'm just
 

2805
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,190
Not that I want to take it. I'm just
interested to see what he does. You can

2806
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:35,200
interested to see what he does. You can
 

2807
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,950
interested to see what he does. You can
see this liquidity being built out here.

2808
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:36,960
see this liquidity being built out here.
 

2809
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,870
see this liquidity being built out here.
So big shelf now being bu built out

2810
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:38,880
So big shelf now being bu built out
 

2811
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,630
So big shelf now being bu built out
here. So buyers are trying to come in

2812
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:40,640
here. So buyers are trying to come in
 

2813
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,470
here. So buyers are trying to come in
and get this move back into here. Let's

2814
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:42,480
and get this move back into here. Let's
 

2815
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,750
and get this move back into here. Let's
see if this guy's legit. We're about to

2816
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:43,760
see if this guy's legit. We're about to
 

2817
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,349
see if this guy's legit. We're about to
tap into him. We can see him on bookmap.

2818
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:45,359
tap into him. We can see him on bookmap.
 

2819
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:46,870
tap into him. We can see him on bookmap.
No, he's not. He's just pulled it. So,

2820
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:46,880
No, he's not. He's just pulled it. So,
 

2821
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,750
No, he's not. He's just pulled it. So,
he's a absolute fraud with massive size

2822
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:49,760
he's a absolute fraud with massive size
 

2823
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,430
he's a absolute fraud with massive size
and we're into this imbalance we just

2824
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:51,440
and we're into this imbalance we just
 

2825
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,910
and we're into this imbalance we just
talked about. And uh D-shape continuing

2826
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:53,920
talked about. And uh D-shape continuing
 

2827
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,190
talked about. And uh D-shape continuing
to play. So, hopefully you've locked

2828
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:55,200
to play. So, hopefully you've locked
 

2829
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,309
to play. So, hopefully you've locked
some in. No guarantee you see uh lower

2830
01:05:58,309 --> 01:05:58,319
some in. No guarantee you see uh lower
 

2831
01:05:58,319 --> 01:05:59,750
some in. No guarantee you see uh lower
lows here. I'm not going to say you

2832
01:05:59,750 --> 01:05:59,760
lows here. I'm not going to say you
 

2833
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,150
lows here. I'm not going to say you
can't, but uh

2834
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:02,160
can't, but uh
 

2835
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:09,349
can't, but uh
it's a rotational market, right?

2836
01:06:09,349 --> 01:06:09,359

 

2837
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:11,029

There's the imbalance tap and there's

2838
01:06:11,029 --> 01:06:11,039
There's the imbalance tap and there's
 

2839
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,470
There's the imbalance tap and there's
buyers caught in that imbalance. We just

2840
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:12,480
buyers caught in that imbalance. We just
 

2841
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,870
buyers caught in that imbalance. We just
talked about it 707s. There's the

2842
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:14,880
talked about it 707s. There's the
 

2843
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,710
talked about it 707s. There's the
imbalance tap and there is buyers caught

2844
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:16,720
imbalance tap and there is buyers caught
 

2845
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,950
imbalance tap and there is buyers caught
in it. Now, can they come back down to

2846
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:18,960
in it. Now, can they come back down to
 

2847
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,750
in it. Now, can they come back down to
85s and come underneath

2848
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:21,760
85s and come underneath
 

2849
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,870
85s and come underneath
uh what's this PC where we are right

2850
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:24,880
uh what's this PC where we are right
 

2851
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,430
uh what's this PC where we are right
now? Can they get acceptance lower now?

2852
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:27,440
now? Can they get acceptance lower now?
 

2853
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,029
now? Can they get acceptance lower now?
They've got I tell you what, sellers

time today. They've got to move
 

2859
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,870

underneath this volume. All right. If

2860
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:34,880
underneath this volume. All right. If
 

2861
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,510

this is a look above and fail into the
 

2863
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,990

sellers can leave this, they've got a

sellers can leave this, they've got a
 

2869
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,430
sellers can leave this, they've got a
chance for this rotation here. They are

2870
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:47,440
chance for this rotation here. They are
 

2871
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,349

Bit of spoofing going on in this tape

2886
01:07:12,549 --> 01:07:12,559
Bit of spoofing going on in this tape
 

2887
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,630
Bit of spoofing going on in this tape
here by this seller. So, he had big size

2888
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:14,640
here by this seller. So, he had big size
 

2889
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,950
here by this seller. So, he had big size
in at 707s. He pulled his size. He came

2890
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:16,960
in at 707s. He pulled his size. He came
 

2891

in at 707s. He pulled his size. He came
back on with smaller size at 707. He's

2892
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:19,280
back on with smaller size at 707. He's
 

2893
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,710
back on with smaller size at 707. He's
now lifted to 22. So, someone's uh

01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:22,720
now lifted to 22. So, someone's uh
 

2895

2916
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:43,920
do this to complete the rotation.
 

2917
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,430
do this to complete the rotation.
They've got a chance. I'm not in

2918
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:45,440
They've got a chance. I'm not in
 

2919

They've got a chance. I'm not in
anything. I'm just saying what I'm

01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:53,680

 

2925
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,470

So, there's point of control T again

2926
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:56,480
So, there's point of control T again
 

2927
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,990
So, there's point of control T again
here. sellers being aggressive here,

2928
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:58,000
here. sellers being aggressive here,
 

2929
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,510
here. sellers being aggressive here,
trying to move lower. So, this is the

2930
01:07:59,510 --> 01:07:59,520
trying to move lower. So, this is the
 

2931
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,950
trying to move lower. So, this is the
chance that they have. We just talked

2932
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:00,960
chance that they have. We just talked
 

2933
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,190
chance that they have. We just talked
about it. Can they move aggressively

2934
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:03,200
about it. Can they move aggressively
 

2935
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,789
about it. Can they move aggressively

underneath this? We have an imbalance
 

2937
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:08,390
underneath this? We have an imbalance
here from 947 this morning. So, they've

2938
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:08,400
here from 947 this morning. So, they've
 

2939
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,109
here from 947 this morning. So, they've
got to get under

2940
01:08:11,109 --> 01:08:11,119
got to get under
 

2941
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:13,190
got to get under

2949
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:22,550
this morning are caught under 78. So, if
we can expand under 78, sellers will

we can expand under 78, sellers will

01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:07,920
need to take control and resell this and
 

2989
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,110
need to take control and resell this and

get these guys out. Otherwise, this will
 

2991
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,990
get these guys out. Otherwise, this will
continue to develop in here. I don't

2992

continue to develop in here. I don't
 

2993
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,349
continue to develop in here. I don't
want to trade in this. But if sellers

2994
01:09:15,349 --> 01:09:15,359
want to trade in this. But if sellers
 

2995
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,870
want to trade in this. But if sellers
are going to take control, this is the

2996
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:16,880
are going to take control, this is the
 

2997
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,950
are going to take control, this is the
chance that they've got to do it. Big

2998
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:18,960
chance that they've got to do it. Big
 

2999
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:38,309
chance that they've got to do it. Big
if, but that's what I'm just seeing.

3000
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:38,319

 

3001
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:39,829

Yeah, Joe. I mean, the only thing I've
taken, Joe, was this here. I said this

3004
01:09:42,789 --> 01:09:42,799
taken, Joe, was this here. I said this
 

3005
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:45,110
taken, Joe, was this here. I said this
morning 20s was the level. As long as we

3006
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:45,120
morning 20s was the level. As long as we
 

3007
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,550
morning 20s was the level. As long as we
hold in front of 20s, there's possible

3008
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:46,560
hold in front of 20s, there's possible
 

3009
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,550
hold in front of 20s, there's possible
for a drive up into here and here. All

3010
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:48,560
for a drive up into here and here. All
 

3011
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,030
for a drive up into here and here. All
right. So, I was bidding small size in

3012
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:51,040
right. So, I was bidding small size in
 

3013
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,030
right. So, I was bidding small size in
here. I got more aggressive in here and

3014
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:53,040
here. I got more aggressive in here and
 

3015
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,709
here. I got more aggressive in here and
I was selling through this and then I

3016
01:09:54,709 --> 01:09:54,719
I was selling through this and then I
 

3017
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:57,030
I was selling through this and then I
held right and stopped back out when we

3018
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:57,040
held right and stopped back out when we
 

3019
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,950
held right and stopped back out when we
came back into it. I held in case we

3020
01:09:58,950 --> 01:09:58,960
came back into it. I held in case we
 

3021
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,790
came back into it. I held in case we
came up here. That's the only thing. If

3022
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:00,800
came up here. That's the only thing. If
 

3023

you're going to wait for me for when I

01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,630
you're going to wait for me for when I
buy and sell, you're going to miss lots

3026

3027
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,669
buy and sell, you're going to miss lots
of trades because I'm very very fussy.

3028
01:10:07,669 --> 01:10:07,679

3088
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:19,600
probably come and take these out. Both
 

3089
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,110
probably come and take these out. Both
things are possible right now. So,

3090
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:21,120
things are possible right now. So,
 

3091
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,750
things are possible right now. So,
that's why I'm saying both

3092
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:23,760
that's why I'm saying both
 

3093
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,510
that's why I'm saying both
because we're at a key level from

01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:25,520
because we're at a key level from

Yeah, exactly. That is some serious size

3246
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:01,280
Yeah, exactly. That is some serious size
 

3247
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,189
Yeah, exactly. That is some serious size
to be spoofing about with. All right,

3248
01:15:03,189 --> 01:15:03,199
to be spoofing about with. All right,
 

3249
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:07,750

Everything condensed. Previous day,
 

3253
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:11,430
Everything condensed. Previous day,

previous week, and current session. This
 

3255

previous week, and current session. This
is fair value for the day where we are

3256

3259
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:20,550

The same things are possible here,

The same things are possible here,
 

3261
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,830
The same things are possible here,

Waiting to see if we have a breakaway

Waiting to see if we have a breakaway

We will do some giveaways on stream. We

3296
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:14,880
We will do some giveaways on stream. We
 

3297
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:23,030
We will do some giveaways on stream. We
do giveaways every day here.

3298

3299
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,590

streams have been a bit slower with they

streams have been a bit slower with they
 

3301
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,350
streams have been a bit slower with they
will start picking up when the volume

3302
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:27,360
will start picking up when the volume
 

3303
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,110
will start picking up when the volume
picks up and that will probably be next

3304
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:29,120
picks up and that will probably be next
 

3305
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:47,968
picks up and that will probably be next
year folks. But I'm here for it.

3306
01:16:47,968 --> 01:16:47,978

 

3307
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:57,793

[snorts] Here

3308
01:16:57,793 --> 01:16:57,803

 

3309
01:16:57,803 --> 01:17:05,030

[snorts]

3310
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,040

 

3311
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,630

we go. Here's previous week point

3312
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:06,640
we go. Here's previous week point
 

3313
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,550
we go. Here's previous week point
control being tested. This is the

3314
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:08,560
control being tested. This is the
 

3315
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:09,830
control being tested. This is the
question. Are bears going to take

3316
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:09,840
question. Are bears going to take
 

3317
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,350
question. Are bears going to take
control and let those bears from early

3318
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:11,360
control and let those bears from early
 

3319
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,149
control and let those bears from early
morning out?

3320
01:17:14,149 --> 01:17:14,159
morning out?
 

3321
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:15,590
morning out?
Are they going to let the bears from

3322
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:15,600
Are they going to let the bears from
 

3323
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,870
Are they going to let the bears from
early morning out? If so, if they let

3324
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:18,880
early morning out? If so, if they let
 

3325
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,390
early morning out? If so, if they let
them out, then I think this is possible

3326
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:20,400
them out, then I think this is possible
 

3327
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,470
them out, then I think this is possible
down here. It's a big if. So, we got

3328
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:22,480
down here. It's a big if. So, we got
 

3329
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:26,550
down here. It's a big if. So, we got
guys caught in here.

3330
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:26,560

 

3331
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,149

Question is, can they let them out

3332
01:17:30,149 --> 01:17:30,159
Question is, can they let them out
 

3333
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:31,910
Question is, can they let them out
and get some cover points down here? And

3334
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:31,920
and get some cover points down here? And
 

3335
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,510
and get some cover points down here? And
if they get acceptance under previous

3336
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:33,520
if they get acceptance under previous
 

3337
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,669
if they get acceptance under previous
days value, then they come to here. If

3338
01:17:35,669 --> 01:17:35,679
days value, then they come to here. If
 

3339
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:38,550
days value, then they come to here. If
we don't, then this is a mirror image of

3340
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:38,560
we don't, then this is a mirror image of
 

3341
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,430
we don't, then this is a mirror image of
this, right? You need to be aware of

3342
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:41,440
this, right? You need to be aware of
 

3343
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,510
this, right? You need to be aware of
this play here. This would be a mirror

3344
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:43,520
this play here. This would be a mirror
 

3345
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,669
this play here. This would be a mirror
image. So, you can see at the moment, we

3346
01:17:45,669 --> 01:17:45,679
image. So, you can see at the moment, we
 

3347
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:47,750
image. So, you can see at the moment, we
built liquidity. We drove up, we failed

3348
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:47,760
built liquidity. We drove up, we failed
 

3349
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,669
built liquidity. We drove up, we failed
to get acceptance. We came down, we

3350
01:17:49,669 --> 01:17:49,679
to get acceptance. We came down, we
 

3351
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,189
to get acceptance. We came down, we
built liquidity, we might well drive

3352
01:17:51,189 --> 01:17:51,199
built liquidity, we might well drive
 

3353
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:53,030
built liquidity, we might well drive
down, might well fail to have

3354
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:53,040
down, might well fail to have
 

3355
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,189
down, might well fail to have
acceptance. So, you could probably split

3356
01:17:55,189 --> 01:17:55,199
acceptance. So, you could probably split
 

3357
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,030
acceptance. So, you could probably split
this day or this session in half here

3358
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:57,040
this day or this session in half here
 

3359
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,870
this day or this session in half here
and they would look exactly the same

3360
01:17:58,870 --> 01:17:58,880
and they would look exactly the same
 

3361
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,350
and they would look exactly the same
mirrored and reversed kind of thing for

3362
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:01,360
mirrored and reversed kind of thing for
 

3363
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,030
mirrored and reversed kind of thing for
now.

3364
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:03,040
now.
 

3365
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:09,669
now.
If if we do this next next leg that is,

3366
01:18:09,669 --> 01:18:09,679

 

3367
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:13,030

what is this guy doing up at 7:15? It's

3368
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:13,040
what is this guy doing up at 7:15? It's
 

3369
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,110
what is this guy doing up at 7:15? It's
very odd.

3370
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:15,120
very odd.
 

3371
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,790
very odd.

I don't. We do do like group sessions in
 

3421
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:39,830
I don't. We do do like group sessions in
Discord, but I don't do one-on- ones. I

3422
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:39,840
Discord, but I don't do one-on- ones. I
 

3423
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,790
Discord, but I don't do one-on- ones. I
just don't have the time, guys.

I don't have the time.

3426
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:45,920
I don't have the time.
 

3427
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,510
I don't have the time.
It' be nice if I did. I actually love

It' be nice if I did. I actually love
teaching more than anything else.

3430
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:50,070
teaching more than anything else.
 

3431
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:53,189
teaching more than anything else.
[snorts] Find it very rewarding,

3432
01:19:53,189 --> 01:19:53,199
[snorts] Find it very rewarding,
 

3433
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:54,550
[snorts] Find it very rewarding,
but I just don't have the time for

3434
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:54,560
but I just don't have the time for
 

3435
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,790
but I just don't have the time for
one-on- ones. But, uh, we do do like

3436
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:56,800
one-on- ones. But, uh, we do do like
 

3437
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,630
one-on- ones. But, uh, we do do like
hour or twohour sessions in Discord. I'm

3438
01:19:58,630 --> 01:19:58,640
hour or twohour sessions in Discord. I'm
 

3439
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,709
hour or twohour sessions in Discord. I'm
trying to do them more regularly for the

3440
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:00,719
trying to do them more regularly for the
 

3441
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:06,390
trying to do them more regularly for the
members to join in. [snorts]

3442
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:06,400

 

3443
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,910

Inverse head and shoulders. I I don't

3444
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:07,920
Inverse head and shoulders. I I don't
 

3445
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,350
Inverse head and shoulders. I I don't
see an inverse head and shoulders here.

3446
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:09,360
see an inverse head and shoulders here.
 

3447
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,590
see an inverse head and shoulders here.
I'm not sure where you see it. Where's

3448
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:11,600
I'm not sure where you see it. Where's
 

3449
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,350
I'm not sure where you see it. Where's
your head?

3450
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:13,360
your head?
 

3451
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,830
your head?
Where's your head? I see maybe a head

3452
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:15,840
Where's your head? I see maybe a head
 

3453
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,430
Where's your head? I see maybe a head
and shoulders, you could argue. I can't

3454
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:17,440
and shoulders, you could argue. I can't
 

3455
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:20,070
and shoulders, you could argue. I can't
see an inverse right now. [snorts]

3456
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:20,080
see an inverse right now. [snorts]
 

3457
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,510
see an inverse right now. [snorts]
All right, they're going to try and have

3458
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:21,520
All right, they're going to try and have
 

3459
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,590
All right, they're going to try and have
another attempt here to leave volume. It

3460
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:23,600
another attempt here to leave volume. It
 

3461
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,590
another attempt here to leave volume. It
just looks very messy in here. Just you

3462
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:25,600
just looks very messy in here. Just you
 

3463
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,430
just looks very messy in here. Just you
you do well to sort of leave this alone

3464
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:27,440
you do well to sort of leave this alone
 

3465
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,830
you do well to sort of leave this alone
for now, I'd say.

3466
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:29,840
for now, I'd say.
 

3467
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,110
for now, I'd say.

3477
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,990
morning? Where's the first 15 minutes?
Inside the opening range. We're inside

3478
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:40,000
Inside the opening range. We're inside
 

3479
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,430
Inside the opening range. We're inside

video from the weekend on checklists,

3484
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:45,600
video from the weekend on checklists,
 

3485
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,350
video from the weekend on checklists,
well,

3486
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:47,360
well,
 

3487
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,870
well,
here's your checklist for a rotation.

3488
01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:48,880
here's your checklist for a rotation.
 

3489
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,470
here's your checklist for a rotation.
So, if you're a trend trader and you

3490
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:50,480
So, if you're a trend trader and you
 

3491
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,790
So, if you're a trend trader and you
hate rotation, then um today's checklist

3492
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:52,800
hate rotation, then um today's checklist
 

3493
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,870
hate rotation, then um today's checklist
was it right inside the day, inside

3494
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:54,880
was it right inside the day, inside
 

3495
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,590
was it right inside the day, inside
previous value, inside your orb, inside

3496
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:57,600
previous value, inside your orb, inside
 

3497
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,110
previous value, inside your orb, inside
your initial balance, inside current

3498
01:20:59,110 --> 01:20:59,120
your initial balance, inside current
 

3499
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,590
your initial balance, inside current
day's value. What's that screaming at

3500
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:01,600
day's value. What's that screaming at
 

3501
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:13,350
day's value. What's that screaming at
you? No trend.

3502
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:13,360

 

3503
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,510

If a spoofer shows they're spoofing, how

3504
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:15,520
If a spoofer shows they're spoofing, how
 

3505
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,950
If a spoofer shows they're spoofing, how
come they keep getting away with it when

3506
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:16,960
come they keep getting away with it when
 

3507
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,830
come they keep getting away with it when
it's obvious? Well, sometimes, mate,

3508
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:19,840
it's obvious? Well, sometimes, mate,
 

3509
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,430
it's obvious? Well, sometimes, mate,
sometimes rather than a spoofer, it can

3510
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:21,440
sometimes rather than a spoofer, it can
 

3511
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:24,229
sometimes rather than a spoofer, it can
be a liquidity provider. Um, so what

3512
01:21:24,229 --> 01:21:24,239
be a liquidity provider. Um, so what
 

3513
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:27,270
be a liquidity provider. Um, so what
you're seeing is uh is an institution

3514
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:27,280
you're seeing is uh is an institution
 

3515
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,189
you're seeing is uh is an institution
providing liquidity and if they don't

3516
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:29,199
providing liquidity and if they don't
 

3517
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:30,630
providing liquidity and if they don't
get taken, they don't get taken. It's

3518
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:30,640
get taken, they don't get taken. It's
 

3519
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:33,990
get taken, they don't get taken. It's
also very hard to prove like

3520
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:34,000
also very hard to prove like
 

3521
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,430
also very hard to prove like
what's the difference between a spoof

3522
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:35,440
what's the difference between a spoof
 

3523
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:36,790
what's the difference between a spoof
and me putting an order on and saying,

3524
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:36,800
and me putting an order on and saying,
 

3525
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,149
and me putting an order on and saying,
"Oh, I don't like that order anymore."

3526
01:21:38,149 --> 01:21:38,159
"Oh, I don't like that order anymore."
 

3527
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:47,110
"Oh, I don't like that order anymore."
Right. So, that's the other side of it.

3528
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:47,120

 

3529
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,630

Yeah, I would say on on the on the

3530
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:48,640
Yeah, I would say on on the on the
 

3531
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,310
Yeah, I would say on on the on the
hourly. Yeah, I would agree. But I can't

3532
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:50,320
hourly. Yeah, I would agree. But I can't
 

3533
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,830
hourly. Yeah, I would agree. But I can't
see an inverse. Someone someone was

3534
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:51,840
see an inverse. Someone someone was
 

3535
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:52,950
see an inverse. Someone someone was
calling for an inverse head and

3536
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:52,960
calling for an inverse head and
 

3537
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,790
calling for an inverse head and
shoulders. I was saying like you could

3538
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:54,800
shoulders. I was saying like you could
 

3539
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,870
shoulders. I was saying like you could
see you could argue definitely you could

3540
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:56,880
see you could argue definitely you could
 

3541
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,470
see you could argue definitely you could
argue potentially building a right

3542
01:21:58,470 --> 01:21:58,480
argue potentially building a right
 

3543
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,870
argue potentially building a right
shoulder on the hourly. You could argue,

3544
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:00,880
shoulder on the hourly. You could argue,
 

3545
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,550
shoulder on the hourly. You could argue,
you know, potentially building liquidity

3546
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:02,560
you know, potentially building liquidity
 

3547
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,470
you know, potentially building liquidity
here. All I was saying is someone was

3548
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:04,480
here. All I was saying is someone was
 

3549
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,790
here. All I was saying is someone was
saying inverse and shoulders. I I can't

3550
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:06,800
saying inverse and shoulders. I I can't
 

3551
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:15,270
saying inverse and shoulders. I I can't
see personally where that inverse is.

3552
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:15,280

 

3553
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,310

If price goes down, why would it release

3554
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:18,320
If price goes down, why would it release
 

3555
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,550
If price goes down, why would it release
those pre previous sellers? They don't

3556
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:20,560
those pre previous sellers? They don't
 

3557
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,510
those pre previous sellers? They don't
have stop losses. Yes, exactly. Right.

3558
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:23,520
have stop losses. Yes, exactly. Right.
 

3559
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,590
have stop losses. Yes, exactly. Right.
So, if you were a short seller down

3560
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:25,600
So, if you were a short seller down
 

3561
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,149
So, if you were a short seller down
here, right, you'd be amazed how many

3562
01:22:28,149 --> 01:22:28,159
here, right, you'd be amazed how many
 

3563
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:29,910
here, right, you'd be amazed how many
people would not stop out, but they

3564
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:29,920
people would not stop out, but they
 

3565
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:32,070
people would not stop out, but they
won't. This isn't a big move for a lot

3566
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:32,080
won't. This isn't a big move for a lot
 

3567
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,070
won't. This isn't a big move for a lot
of people, right? So, when they come

3568
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:34,080
of people, right? So, when they come
 

3569
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,229
of people, right? So, when they come
back down and if they start getting out

3570
01:22:36,229 --> 01:22:36,239
back down and if they start getting out
 

3571
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:38,149
back down and if they start getting out
here, they get break even. There's your

3572
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:38,159
here, they get break even. There's your
 

3573
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:40,790
here, they get break even. There's your
push. And if they stay and hold, all

3574
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:40,800
push. And if they stay and hold, all
 

3575
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,709
push. And if they stay and hold, all
right, and they get let out under here,

3576
01:22:42,709 --> 01:22:42,719
right, and they get let out under here,
 

3577
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:44,070
right, and they get let out under here,
then they might well add to their

3578
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:44,080
then they might well add to their
 

3579
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,629
then they might well add to their
position.

3580
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:46,639

But yeah, not not everyone is
 

3583
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,310
But yeah, not not everyone is
disciplined enough to stop out. Some of

disciplined enough to stop out. Some of
 

3585
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,590

3649
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,070
getting that data from. It comes from
the CME. Comes from CME if we were

3651
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:27,350

Back to this shelf. Top side of the

3718
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:05,520

 

3719
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,189

I noticed that the New York session sets

3720
01:26:07,189 --> 01:26:07,199
I noticed that the New York session sets
 

3721
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:08,790
I noticed that the New York session sets
the stage for the rest of the session to

3722
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:08,800
the stage for the rest of the session to
 

3723
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,430
the stage for the rest of the session to
be either bullish or bearish.

3724
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:11,440
be either bullish or bearish.
 

3725
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,669
be either bullish or bearish.
Today it's bearish session, so any

3726
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:13,679
Today it's bearish session, so any
 

3727
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:15,990
Today it's bearish session, so any
pullback to the upside is only a

3728
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:16,000
pullback to the upside is only a
 

3729
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,990
pullback to the upside is only a
correction. Um, I don't think so.

3730
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:20,000
correction. Um, I don't think so.
 

3731
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,510
correction. Um, I don't think so.
I mean, the New York session goes all

3732
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:21,520
I mean, the New York session goes all
 

3733
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,950
I mean, the New York session goes all
the way till 4:00 and uh, lots of things

3734
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:24,960
the way till 4:00 and uh, lots of things
 

3735
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,510
the way till 4:00 and uh, lots of things
change. I think if you,

3736
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:27,520
change. I think if you,
 

3737
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,350
change. I think if you,
how can I put this? You might well be

3738
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:29,360
how can I put this? You might well be
 

3739
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,750
how can I put this? You might well be
looking for a pattern that's not there.

01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:31,760

3741

Be very careful.

So, drive out of this now. And if they
leave this, I mean, there's a little bit

leave this, I mean, there's a little bit
 

3747
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,070
leave this, I mean, there's a little bit
of volume here. You can see little

01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:44,080
of volume here. You can see little
 

3749
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,430

3903
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,149

We're going to sleep. We're in this

3904
01:32:42,149 --> 01:32:42,159
We're going to sleep. We're in this
 

3905
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:43,590
We're going to sleep. We're in this
shelf. We're trying to leave this gray

3906
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:43,600
shelf. We're trying to leave this gray
 

3907
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,750
shelf. We're trying to leave this gray
shelf. It's what the sellers are looking

3908
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:45,760
shelf. It's what the sellers are looking
 

3909
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,270
shelf. It's what the sellers are looking
to do. They're looking to drive price

3910
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:47,280
to do. They're looking to drive price
 

3911
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,350
to do. They're looking to drive price
lower at the moment. Just whether they

3912
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:49,360
lower at the moment. Just whether they
 

3913
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:51,350

can find acceptance. We're into a huge

3914
01:32:51,350 --> 01:32:51,360

3915
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,910
can find acceptance. We're into a huge
imbalance down here from this morning.

3916
01:32:53,910 --> 01:32:53,920
imbalance down here from this morning.
 

3917
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,189
imbalance down here from this morning.
Like we said, we've got these trap

3918
01:32:55,189 --> 01:32:55,199
Like we said, we've got these trap
 

3919
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:57,510
Like we said, we've got these trap
players. Where is it? This one. We've

3920
01:32:57,510 --> 01:32:57,520
players. Where is it? This one. We've
 

3921
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:00,790
players. Where is it? This one. We've
got these trap players down here.

3922
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:00,800
got these trap players down here.
 

3923
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,189
got these trap players down here.
Right down here. Right. So, this is

3924
01:33:03,189 --> 01:33:03,199
Right down here. Right. So, this is
 

3925
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:05,750
Right down here. Right. So, this is
their pain right now.

3926
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:05,760
their pain right now.
 

3927
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,070
their pain right now.
680s. So, sellers need to get back below

3928
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:08,080
680s. So, sellers need to get back below
 

3929
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:10,470
680s. So, sellers need to get back below
680s.

3930
01:33:10,470 --> 01:33:10,480
680s.
 

3931
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:14,070
680s.
So, down here. There you go. Right. So,

3932
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:14,080
So, down here. There you go. Right. So,
 

3933
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,070
So, down here. There you go. Right. So,
can we let them out now?

3934
01:33:16,070 --> 01:33:16,080
can we let them out now?
 

3935
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:17,750
can we let them out now?
Do we let them out or do all these

3936
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:17,760
Do we let them out or do all these
 

3937
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,430
Do we let them out or do all these
sellers down here start covering break

3938
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:19,440
sellers down here start covering break
 

3939
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,830
sellers down here start covering break
even? That's now your question. We're

3940
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:21,840
even? That's now your question. We're
 

3941
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,830
even? That's now your question. We're
leaving that gray box though. And the

3942
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:23,840
leaving that gray box though. And the
 

3943
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,310
leaving that gray box though. And the
question is, can we get outside of now

3944
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:26,320
question is, can we get outside of now
 

3945
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,790
question is, can we get outside of now
previous day value area low? If we get

3946
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:28,800
previous day value area low? If we get
 

3947
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,470
previous day value area low? If we get
continuation, this is going to be like

3948
01:33:30,470 --> 01:33:30,480
continuation, this is going to be like
 

3949
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,830
continuation, this is going to be like
what we saw to the top side. All right,

3950
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:31,840
what we saw to the top side. All right,
 

3951
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,669
what we saw to the top side. All right,
if we leave this, if you're trading this

3952
01:33:33,669 --> 01:33:33,679
if we leave this, if you're trading this
 

3953
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:35,830
if we leave this, if you're trading this
move here, all right, your cover points

3954
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:35,840
move here, all right, your cover points
 

3955
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,669
move here, all right, your cover points
are here. I'll be very careful at 680.

3956
01:33:37,669 --> 01:33:37,679
are here. I'll be very careful at 680.
 

3957
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:39,590
are here. I'll be very careful at 680.
You need to see continuation and then

3958
01:33:39,590 --> 01:33:39,600
You need to see continuation and then
 

3959
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,350
You need to see continuation and then
down into this. All right, what we did

3960
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:41,360
down into this. All right, what we did
 

3961
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,590
down into this. All right, what we did
earlier today was this the other side.

3962
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:43,600
earlier today was this the other side.
 

3963
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,350
earlier today was this the other side.
That was the mirror. Did we get to

3964
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:45,360
That was the mirror. Did we get to
 

3965
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:48,229
That was the mirror. Did we get to
previous day value? We did. Yes, that

3966
01:33:48,229 --> 01:33:48,239
previous day value? We did. Yes, that
 

3967
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:50,070
previous day value? We did. Yes, that
was the This would be a mirror of

3968
01:33:50,070 --> 01:33:50,080
was the This would be a mirror of
 

3969
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,669
was the This would be a mirror of
earlier. All right. So, see how we're

3970
01:33:51,669 --> 01:33:51,679
earlier. All right. So, see how we're
 

3971
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:54,229
earlier. All right. So, see how we're
reacting off 680s. That's because right

3972
01:33:54,229 --> 01:33:54,239
reacting off 680s. That's because right
 

3973
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:56,310
reacting off 680s. That's because right
now that's where those guys from earlier

3974
01:33:56,310 --> 01:33:56,320
now that's where those guys from earlier
 

3975
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,629
now that's where those guys from earlier
are stuck. We just went over it right

3976
01:33:58,629 --> 01:33:58,639
are stuck. We just went over it right
 

3977
01:33:58,639 --> 01:33:59,750
are stuck. We just went over it right
here. Right. This is where they're

3978
01:33:59,750 --> 01:33:59,760
here. Right. This is where they're
 

3979
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,390
here. Right. This is where they're
stuck. So, understanding who's stuck and

3980
01:34:02,390 --> 01:34:02,400
stuck. So, understanding who's stuck and
 

3981
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:11,910
stuck. So, understanding who's stuck and
where they're stuck.

3982
01:34:11,910 --> 01:34:11,920

 

3983
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:16,709

And they are now covering

3984
01:34:16,709 --> 01:34:16,719

 

3985
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:18,390

They're really you haven't got much to

3986
01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:18,400
They're really you haven't got much to
 

3987
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:19,910
They're really you haven't got much to
play with. This is the back test of that

3988
01:34:19,910 --> 01:34:19,920
play with. This is the back test of that
 

3989
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:24,470
play with. This is the back test of that
gray box. So, if you're going to sell

3990
01:34:24,470 --> 01:34:24,480
gray box. So, if you're going to sell
 

3991
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:25,669
gray box. So, if you're going to sell
and you're convinced that we're going to

3992
01:34:25,669 --> 01:34:25,679
and you're convinced that we're going to
 

3993
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:27,590
and you're convinced that we're going to
see continuation under 680, this is the

3994
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:27,600
see continuation under 680, this is the
 

3995
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,390
see continuation under 680, this is the
level. But, uh, personally, I'm not

3996
01:34:30,390 --> 01:34:30,400
level. But, uh, personally, I'm not
 

3997
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:33,030
level. But, uh, personally, I'm not
doing anything down here in a D-shape,

3998
01:34:33,030 --> 01:34:33,040
doing anything down here in a D-shape,
 

3999
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,590
doing anything down here in a D-shape,
in a rotation.

4000
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:35,600
in a rotation.
 

4001
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:39,510
in a rotation.
Not much for me to want to do.

4002
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:39,520
Not much for me to want to do.
 

4003
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,070
Not much for me to want to do.
Just saying what I'm seeing down here.

4004
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:42,080
Just saying what I'm seeing down here.
 

4005
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:43,990
Just saying what I'm seeing down here.
You can see the importance of that 680.

4006
01:34:43,990 --> 01:34:44,000
You can see the importance of that 680.
 

4007
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,750
You can see the importance of that 680.
If we get continuation under it, we let

4008
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:45,760
If we get continuation under it, we let
 

4009
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:51,990
If we get continuation under it, we let
all those sellers out.

4010
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:52,000

 

4011
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,990

They are trying.

4012
01:34:53,990 --> 01:34:54,000
They are trying.
 

4013
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,470
They are trying.
But on that last shove down, it was all

4014
01:34:56,470 --> 01:34:56,480
But on that last shove down, it was all
 

4015
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:59,030
But on that last shove down, it was all
sell side.

4016
01:34:59,030 --> 01:34:59,040
sell side.
 

4017
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,430
sell side.
So in here,

4018
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:01,440
So in here,
 

4019
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:05,750
So in here,
we look inside here.

4020
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:05,760

 

4021
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,590

That is completely different to what I

4022
01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:07,600
That is completely different to what I
 

4023
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,510
That is completely different to what I
have on trading view, which is uh on

4024
01:35:09,510 --> 01:35:09,520
have on trading view, which is uh on
 

4025
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,430
have on trading view, which is uh on
Ninja Trader. down here on Ninja Trader.

This is all sell side and then we go bid

4028
01:35:13,189 --> 01:35:13,199
This is all sell side and then we go bid
 

4029
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:16,310
This is all sell side and then we go bid
up and I have down here

4030
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:16,320
up and I have down here
 

4031
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:19,189
up and I have down here
36 lot and 26 lot. So let's have a look.

4032
01:35:19,189 --> 01:35:19,199
36 lot and 26 lot. So let's have a look.
 

4033
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:21,830
36 lot and 26 lot. So let's have a look.
I bet you it's reflected on bookmap. So

4034
01:35:21,830 --> 01:35:21,840
I bet you it's reflected on bookmap. So
 

4035
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,750
I bet you it's reflected on bookmap. So
trading view seems slightly off there.

4036
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:23,760
trading view seems slightly off there.
 

4037
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,550
trading view seems slightly off there.
Where is bookm? Here we go. What's the

4038
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:26,560
Where is bookm? Here we go. What's the
 

4039
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,510
Where is bookm? Here we go. What's the
bottom of the auction? There you go. So

4040
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:29,520
bottom of the auction? There you go. So
 

4041
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:32,229
bottom of the auction? There you go. So
35 lot, 36 lot, 99 lot. So you can see

4042
01:35:32,229 --> 01:35:32,239
35 lot, 36 lot, 99 lot. So you can see
 

4043
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:37,189
35 lot, 36 lot, 99 lot. So you can see
the flip here. Aggressive selling.

4044
01:35:37,189 --> 01:35:37,199

 

4045
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:39,350

aggressive selling on this break of here

4046
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:39,360
aggressive selling on this break of here
 

4047
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:42,229
aggressive selling on this break of here
down into 80. There's the 80s right at

4048
01:35:42,229 --> 01:35:42,239
down into 80. There's the 80s right at
 

4049
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:43,830
down into 80. There's the 80s right at
the low. They've tried to aggressively

4050
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:43,840
the low. They've tried to aggressively
 

4051
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,590
the low. They've tried to aggressively
sell the low. But look what's happened.

4052
01:35:45,590 --> 01:35:45,600
sell the low. But look what's happened.
 

4053
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,189
sell the low. But look what's happened.
We've seen passive buyers down there.

4054
01:35:47,189 --> 01:35:47,199
We've seen passive buyers down there.
 

4055
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:49,350
We've seen passive buyers down there.
Probably the guys at 80s that I just

4056
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:49,360
Probably the guys at 80s that I just
 

4057
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:51,910
Probably the guys at 80s that I just
talked about earlier,

4058
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:51,920
talked about earlier,
 

4059
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,390
talked about earlier,
right at 80s being like, okay, we'll get

4060
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:54,400
right at 80s being like, okay, we'll get
 

4061
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:56,149
right at 80s being like, okay, we'll get
out here. Get out there means they've

4062
01:35:56,149 --> 01:35:56,159
out here. Get out there means they've
 

4063
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:57,830
out here. Get out there means they've
got limit buys there and other guys

4064
01:35:57,830 --> 01:35:57,840
got limit buys there and other guys
 

4065
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,430
got limit buys there and other guys
absorbing. And you see the delta flip

4066
01:35:59,430 --> 01:35:59,440
absorbing. And you see the delta flip
 

4067
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,270
absorbing. And you see the delta flip
from aggressive selling to buying. And

4068
01:36:01,270 --> 01:36:01,280
from aggressive selling to buying. And
 

4069
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,510
from aggressive selling to buying. And
we're going bid back up now, right? And

4070
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:03,520
we're going bid back up now, right? And
 

4071
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,110
we're going bid back up now, right? And
this is how the tape moves. It's

4072
01:36:05,110 --> 01:36:05,120
this is how the tape moves. It's
 

4073
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,189
this is how the tape moves. It's
literally, it's not [\h__\h] [snorts]

4074
01:36:07,189 --> 01:36:07,199
literally, it's not [\h__\h] [snorts]
 

4075
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:09,270

[\h__\h] algo or any [\h__\h] like that that
 

4077
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:12,229
[\h__\h] algo or any [\h__\h] like that that
you hear of godly man doing it all. It's

4078
01:36:12,229 --> 01:36:12,239
you hear of godly man doing it all. It's
 

4079
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:13,990
you hear of godly man doing it all. It's
nothing like that. It's actual

4080
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:14,000
nothing like that. It's actual
 

4081
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,870
nothing like that. It's actual
participants. Okay. And now we're going

4082
01:36:16,870 --> 01:36:16,880
participants. Okay. And now we're going
 

4083
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,709
participants. Okay. And now we're going
back to this is the gray box. So if we

4084
01:36:18,709 --> 01:36:18,719
back to this is the gray box. So if we
 

4085
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:20,390
back to this is the gray box. So if we
if you zoomed this out and you wanted to

4086
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:20,400
if you zoomed this out and you wanted to
 

4087
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,870
if you zoomed this out and you wanted to
think where is that gray box? Well, it's

4088
01:36:22,870 --> 01:36:22,880
think where is that gray box? Well, it's
 

4089
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,950
think where is that gray box? Well, it's
just this dense level here that we're

4090
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:24,960
just this dense level here that we're
 

4091
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,550
just this dense level here that we're
battling over. If we think about this,

4092
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:26,560
battling over. If we think about this,
 

4093
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,629
battling over. If we think about this,
this is your dense level, isn't it? All

4094
01:36:28,629 --> 01:36:28,639
this is your dense level, isn't it? All
 

4095
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:30,070
this is your dense level, isn't it? All
these sellers and buyers, we can't get

4096
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:30,080
these sellers and buyers, we can't get
 

4097
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,750
these sellers and buyers, we can't get
acceptance above and we haven't had any

4098
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:31,760
acceptance above and we haven't had any
 

4099
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,590
acceptance above and we haven't had any
continuation acceptance below. This is

4100
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:33,600
continuation acceptance below. This is
 

4101
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,830
continuation acceptance below. This is
rotation, rotation, rotation, squeeze,

4102
01:36:35,830 --> 01:36:35,840
rotation, rotation, rotation, squeeze,
 

4103
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,669
rotation, rotation, rotation, squeeze,
no acceptance. Rotation, rotation,

01:36:37,669 --> 01:36:37,679
no acceptance. Rotation, rotation,

4107
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,590

01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:41,600
rotation, rotation. And we see what's
 

4109
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:48,597
rotation, rotation. And we see what's
next. All right.

4110
01:36:48,597 --> 01:36:48,607

 

4111
01:36:48,607 --> 01:37:03,590

[snorts]

4112
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:03,600

 

4113
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,270

No, I'm not in a trade. I haven't been

4114
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:05,280
No, I'm not in a trade. I haven't been
 

4115
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,910
No, I'm not in a trade. I haven't been
in a trade since here. The only the only

4116
01:37:07,910 --> 01:37:07,920
in a trade since here. The only the only
 

4117
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:10,550
in a trade since here. The only the only
trade

4118
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:10,560
trade
 

4119
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,709
trade
was this. All right, that's the only

4120
01:37:12,709 --> 01:37:12,719
was this. All right, that's the only
 

4121
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:14,310
was this. All right, that's the only
trade I took. I would have loved to been

4122
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:14,320
trade I took. I would have loved to been
 

4123
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,390
trade I took. I would have loved to been
a buyer here this morning, but this move

4124
01:37:16,390 --> 01:37:16,400
a buyer here this morning, but this move
 

4125
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,629
a buyer here this morning, but this move
here was disgusting. All right, what

4126
01:37:18,629 --> 01:37:18,639
here was disgusting. All right, what
 

4127
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:20,070
here was disgusting. All right, what
what I would have loved to have seen

4128
01:37:20,070 --> 01:37:20,080
what I would have loved to have seen
 

4129
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:22,390
what I would have loved to have seen
down there. All right, as we traded into

4130
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:22,400
down there. All right, as we traded into
 

4131
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,310
down there. All right, as we traded into
previous days value was something a

4132
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:24,320
previous days value was something a
 

4133
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,229
previous days value was something a
little bit like one of these. Thanks

4134
01:37:26,229 --> 01:37:26,239
little bit like one of these. Thanks
 

4135
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:28,390
little bit like one of these. Thanks
very much. you know that is my buying

4136
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:28,400
very much. you know that is my buying
 

4137
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,910
very much. you know that is my buying
opportunity. But what they did instead

4138
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:29,920
opportunity. But what they did instead
 

4139
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:32,310
opportunity. But what they did instead
was they tapped it and just went boom

4140
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:32,320
was they tapped it and just went boom
 

4141
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:33,830
was they tapped it and just went boom
and then we squeezed and then I had to

4142
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:33,840
and then we squeezed and then I had to
 

4143
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:36,070
and then we squeezed and then I had to
wait for them to make sure that these

4144
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:36,080
wait for them to make sure that these
 

4145
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:37,990
wait for them to make sure that these
20s held. So if you rewind the tape,

4146
01:37:37,990 --> 01:37:38,000
20s held. So if you rewind the tape,
 

4147
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,510
20s held. So if you rewind the tape,
this is where I was getting long selling

4148
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:39,520
this is where I was getting long selling
 

4149
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,350
this is where I was getting long selling
into that. I held a runner in case we

4150
01:37:41,350 --> 01:37:41,360
into that. I held a runner in case we
 

4151
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,270
into that. I held a runner in case we
went back up here. I took the runner off

4152
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:43,280
went back up here. I took the runner off
 

4153
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:44,950
went back up here. I took the runner off
as we broke down under the underneath

4154
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:44,960
as we broke down under the underneath
 

4155
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,109
as we broke down under the underneath
value. That was it. That's all I've done

4156
01:37:47,109 --> 01:37:47,119
value. That was it. That's all I've done
 

4157
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:50,470
value. That was it. That's all I've done
today, folks. That was probably one of

4158
01:37:50,470 --> 01:37:50,480
today, folks. That was probably one of
 

4159
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:52,790
today, folks. That was probably one of
the better setups. The best setup would

4160
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:52,800
the better setups. The best setup would
 

4161
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,390
the better setups. The best setup would
have been here if they just didn't do

4162
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:54,400
have been here if they just didn't do
 

4163
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:56,709
have been here if they just didn't do
this horrible candle. If they had just,

4164
01:37:56,709 --> 01:37:56,719
this horrible candle. If they had just,
 

4165
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:58,390
this horrible candle. If they had just,
you could argue to take that, but if

4166
01:37:58,390 --> 01:37:58,400
you could argue to take that, but if
 

4167
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,310
you could argue to take that, but if
they had just done something a little

4168
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:00,320
they had just done something a little
 

4169
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,870
they had just done something a little
bit nicer, I guess that is what it did.

4170
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:02,880
bit nicer, I guess that is what it did.
 

4171
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,430
bit nicer, I guess that is what it did.
But this candle here was gross. The

4172
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:05,440
But this candle here was gross. The
 

4173
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,310
But this candle here was gross. The
reaction was very quick.

4174
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:08,320
reaction was very quick.
 

4175
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:10,149
reaction was very quick.
Literally tapped value just actually

4176
01:38:10,149 --> 01:38:10,159
Literally tapped value just actually
 

4177
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:11,990
Literally tapped value just actually
missed value by a tick, but tapped it

4178
01:38:11,990 --> 01:38:12,000
missed value by a tick, but tapped it
 

4179
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:19,669
missed value by a tick, but tapped it
and then went. [snorts]

4180
01:38:19,669 --> 01:38:19,679

 

4181
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:22,550

This move was impossible to get.

4182
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:22,560
This move was impossible to get.
 

4183
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,910
This move was impossible to get.
I don't know. it it was at the 46 mark.

4184
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:25,920
I don't know. it it was at the 46 mark.
 

4185
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,790
I don't know. it it was at the 46 mark.
So unless unless that data came out a

4186
01:38:28,790 --> 01:38:28,800
So unless unless that data came out a
 

4187
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,510
So unless unless that data came out a
minute late, but yeah, I mean it was

4188
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:31,520
minute late, but yeah, I mean it was
 

4189
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:38,070
minute late, but yeah, I mean it was
either way it was impossible to get.

4190
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:38,080

 

4191
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,430

Here comes the breaks and now they're

4192
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:39,440
Here comes the breaks and now they're
 

4193
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,430
Here comes the breaks and now they're
breaking away from this gray box. All

4194
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:41,440
breaking away from this gray box. All
 

4195
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:42,870
breaking away from this gray box. All
right, leaving volume. So all these

4196
01:38:42,870 --> 01:38:42,880
right, leaving volume. So all these
 

4197
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,790
right, leaving volume. So all these
sellers down here not doing a good job

4198
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:44,800
sellers down here not doing a good job
 

4199
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,350
sellers down here not doing a good job
of breaking down, right? Can't find

4200
01:38:47,350 --> 01:38:47,360
of breaking down, right? Can't find
 

4201
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:50,550
of breaking down, right? Can't find
acceptance. And if this is the volume

4202
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:50,560
acceptance. And if this is the volume
 

4203
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,070
acceptance. And if this is the volume
that's now trapped, they are starting to

4204
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:52,080
that's now trapped, they are starting to
 

4205
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,750
that's now trapped, they are starting to
stop out. We're coming back to VWAP. And

4206
01:38:53,750 --> 01:38:53,760
stop out. We're coming back to VWAP. And
 

4207
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,189
stop out. We're coming back to VWAP. And
the question is, do we go back above

4208
01:38:55,189 --> 01:38:55,199
the question is, do we go back above
 

4209
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:57,750
the question is, do we go back above
VWAP into this area here, current value

4210
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:57,760
VWAP into this area here, current value
 

4211
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,189
VWAP into this area here, current value
area high? And if we get through that,

4212
01:38:59,189 --> 01:38:59,199
area high? And if we get through that,
 

4213
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:00,709
area high? And if we get through that,
do they go to here? And the rotation

4214
01:39:00,709 --> 01:39:00,719
do they go to here? And the rotation
 

4215
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:04,390
do they go to here? And the rotation
will keep happening in here until they

4216
01:39:04,390 --> 01:39:04,400
will keep happening in here until they
 

4217
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,390
will keep happening in here until they
find acceptance. And I don't mean until

4218
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:06,400
find acceptance. And I don't mean until
 

4219
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,790
find acceptance. And I don't mean until
they find acceptance today. Today,

4220
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:08,800
they find acceptance today. Today,
 

4221
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:11,270
they find acceptance today. Today,
tomorrow, next week, they can spend as

4222
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:11,280
tomorrow, next week, they can spend as
 

4223
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:14,470
tomorrow, next week, they can spend as
long as they want in here until one side

01:39:14,470 --> 01:39:14,480

4225
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,950

01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:21,213

catalyst for a break away from it.

01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,950
fastmoving market. At the moment, the
market's moving quite slow. But if we're

in days where we're doing, you know,

01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:57,189
in days where we're doing, you know,
multiple hundreds of points, it's uh

4306
01:40:57,189 --> 01:40:57,199
multiple hundreds of points, it's uh
 

4307
01:40:57,199 --> 01:41:01,830
multiple hundreds of points, it's uh
very easy to miss those players.

To be honest, anything over zero is a
bonus in this market.

4342
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:00,480

 

4343

4349
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:07,669
that a swing long? I remember you saying
yesterday you were getting long. Is that

4350
01:42:07,669 --> 01:42:07,679
yesterday you were getting long. Is that
 

4351
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:10,390
yesterday you were getting long. Is that
the same one? We both talked about it,

4352
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:10,400
the same one? We both talked about it,
 

4353
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:12,149
the same one? We both talked about it,
didn't we? And I said, "I think they'll

4357
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,510
do the stop runs first." And you said,
"Yeah, I think they will as well." I

4358
01:42:15,510 --> 01:42:15,520
"Yeah, I think they will as well." I
 

4359
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:21,030
"Yeah, I think they will as well." I
think you were positioned

4360
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:21,040

 

4361
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:23,350

somewhere around here, right? And I

4369
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:30,790
of day."
Yep. Same one swing. Yeah, I think

4370
01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:30,800
Yep. Same one swing. Yeah, I think
 

4371
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:33,830
Yep. Same one swing. Yeah, I think
that's really nice.

4372
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:33,840
that's really nice.
 

4373
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:37,189
that's really nice.
Exactly there. Stop run and 692. Stop

01:42:37,189 --> 01:42:37,199
Exactly there. Stop run and 692. Stop
 

4375

4377
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,109
run and then 692. Yeah, that that's
exactly it what we just talked about

4378
01:42:41,109 --> 01:42:41,119
exactly it what we just talked about
 

4379
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:42,790
exactly it what we just talked about
here. I remember talking about it with

4380
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:42,800
here. I remember talking about it with
 

4381
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,149
here. I remember talking about it with
you yesterday when we were here in the

4382
01:42:44,149 --> 01:42:44,159
you yesterday when we were here in the
 

4383
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:46,229
you yesterday when we were here in the
morning saying these are my the plays I

4384
01:42:46,229 --> 01:42:46,239
morning saying these are my the plays I
 

4385
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:48,550
morning saying these are my the plays I
like is when we do this and then reclaim

4386
01:42:48,550 --> 01:42:48,560
like is when we do this and then reclaim
 

4387
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:50,790
like is when we do this and then reclaim
wash all these guys out they become the

4388
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:50,800
wash all these guys out they become the
 

4389
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,109
wash all these guys out they become the
liquidity for market makers to get long

4390
01:42:53,109 --> 01:42:53,119
liquidity for market makers to get long
 

4391
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:55,189
liquidity for market makers to get long
against and then that that's nice. So

4392
01:42:55,189 --> 01:42:55,199
against and then that that's nice. So
 

4393
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:57,270
against and then that that's nice. So
and it's just held it. It's held it

4394
01:42:57,270 --> 01:42:57,280
and it's just held it. It's held it
 

4395
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,270
and it's just held it. It's held it
nicely. So for a swing position I think

4396
01:42:59,270 --> 01:42:59,280
nicely. So for a swing position I think
 

4397
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:01,910
nicely. So for a swing position I think
you look you look pretty good especially

4398
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:01,920
you look you look pretty good especially
 

4399
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,229
you look you look pretty good especially
especially that we're unwilling to break

4400
01:43:04,229 --> 01:43:04,239
especially that we're unwilling to break
 

4401
01:43:04,239 --> 01:43:07,510
especially that we're unwilling to break
below previous day's value today. Um,

4402
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:07,520
below previous day's value today. Um,
 

4403
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,229
below previous day's value today. Um,
that's a good sign for you.

4404
01:43:10,229 --> 01:43:10,239
that's a good sign for you.
 

4405
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:12,070
that's a good sign for you.

I'd like to see it if if I don't know
 

4407
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:13,270
I'd like to see it if if I don't know
how long you'd like to hold your swings

4408
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:13,280
how long you'd like to hold your swings
 

4409
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,709
how long you'd like to hold your swings
are, what the targets are, but I'd like

4410
01:43:14,709 --> 01:43:14,719
are, what the targets are, but I'd like
 

4411
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:17,270
are, what the targets are, but I'd like
to see it hold a bid here uh and get

4412
01:43:17,270 --> 01:43:17,280
to see it hold a bid here uh and get
 

4413
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:19,750
to see it hold a bid here uh and get
back into this for you for a swing. And

4414
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:19,760
back into this for you for a swing. And
 

4415
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:20,950
back into this for you for a swing. And
then you can see if you can find

4416
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:20,960
then you can see if you can find
 

4417
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:27,990
then you can see if you can find
acceptance above previous week's value.

4418
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:28,000

 

4419
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,270

Don't know what that was. What the hell

So, if Rick's going to get his way, we
 

4487
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:16,470
So, if Rick's going to get his way, we
want him to make his money. Obviously,

4488
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:16,480
want him to make his money. Obviously,
 

4489
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:18,070
want him to make his money. Obviously,
we want everyone to win on this stream.

4490
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:18,080
we want everyone to win on this stream.
 

4491
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:19,750
we want everyone to win on this stream.
We're not here to do anything else other

4492
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:19,760
We're not here to do anything else other
 

4493
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,590
We're not here to do anything else other
than make money. We want to see this

4494
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:21,600
than make money. We want to see this
 

4495
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,109
than make money. We want to see this
happen for Rick. That would be nice for

4496
01:45:23,109 --> 01:45:23,119
happen for Rick. That would be nice for
 

4497
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:25,430
happen for Rick. That would be nice for
a swing position.

4498
01:45:25,430 --> 01:45:25,440
a swing position.
 

4499
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:28,070
a swing position.
What we don't want to see is this market

4500
01:45:28,070 --> 01:45:28,080
What we don't want to see is this market
 

4501
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:30,229
What we don't want to see is this market
collapse the rotation back down to here

4502
01:45:30,229 --> 01:45:30,239
collapse the rotation back down to here
 

4503
01:45:30,239 --> 01:45:32,229
collapse the rotation back down to here
again. This is definitely a squeeze out

4504
01:45:32,229 --> 01:45:32,239
again. This is definitely a squeeze out
 

4505
01:45:32,239 --> 01:45:34,629
again. This is definitely a squeeze out
though. So, it is possible, but we don't

4506
01:45:34,629 --> 01:45:34,639
though. So, it is possible, but we don't
 

4507
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:36,070
though. So, it is possible, but we don't
want that. We want them to resqueeze

4508
01:45:36,070 --> 01:45:36,080
want that. We want them to resqueeze
 

4509
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,990
want that. We want them to resqueeze
this higher

4510
01:45:37,990 --> 01:45:38,000
this higher
 

4511
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,629
this higher
for Rick. We want Rick to win. Come on,

4512
01:45:40,629 --> 01:45:40,639
for Rick. We want Rick to win. Come on,
 

4513
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:44,070
for Rick. We want Rick to win. Come on,
Rick. We want Rick

4514
01:45:44,070 --> 01:45:44,080
Rick. We want Rick
 

4515
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,470
Rick. We want Rick
be a happy man. All right. So, we want

4516
01:45:46,470 --> 01:45:46,480
be a happy man. All right. So, we want
 

4517
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:52,253
be a happy man. All right. So, we want
pullbacks to hold for him.

4518
01:45:52,253 --> 01:45:52,263

 

4519
01:45:52,263 --> 01:45:56,149

[snorts]

4520
01:45:56,149 --> 01:45:56,159

 

4521
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:59,458

It's got a shot hit.

4522
01:45:59,458 --> 01:45:59,468
It's got a shot hit.
 

4523
01:45:59,468 --> 01:46:01,910
It's got a shot hit.
[laughter] No worries, man. It's got a

4524
01:46:01,910 --> 01:46:01,920
[laughter] No worries, man. It's got a
 

4525
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:06,149
[laughter] No worries, man. It's got a
shot hit.

4526
01:46:06,149 --> 01:46:06,159

 

4527
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:08,229

This candle here is full of sellers at

4528
01:46:08,229 --> 01:46:08,239
This candle here is full of sellers at
 

4529
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:09,990
This candle here is full of sellers at
the lows.

4530
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:10,000
the lows.
 

4531
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,149
the lows.
As long as they say stay stuck, you look

4532
01:46:12,149 --> 01:46:12,159
As long as they say stay stuck, you look
 

4533
01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:13,990
As long as they say stay stuck, you look
okay. And this candle here was the big

4534
01:46:13,990 --> 01:46:14,000
okay. And this candle here was the big
 

4535
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,790
okay. And this candle here was the big
buyers. So this transition here, I want

4536
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:16,800
buyers. So this transition here, I want
 

4537
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,629
buyers. So this transition here, I want
that to hold for you just based on a

4538
01:46:18,629 --> 01:46:18,639
that to hold for you just based on a
 

4539
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:19,910
that to hold for you just based on a
very low time frame chart. Just what

4540
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:19,920
very low time frame chart. Just what
 

4541
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,750
very low time frame chart. Just what
I've seen here. If that doesn't hold,

4542
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:21,760
I've seen here. If that doesn't hold,
 

4543
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:23,750
I've seen here. If that doesn't hold,
then this pocket might come back down

4544
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:23,760
then this pocket might come back down
 

4545
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:26,149
then this pocket might come back down
for a refill. So I'd want to see this

4546
01:46:26,149 --> 01:46:26,159
for a refill. So I'd want to see this
 

4547
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:28,950
for a refill. So I'd want to see this
hold here for a resqueeze. Otherwise, we

4548
01:46:28,950 --> 01:46:28,960
hold here for a resqueeze. Otherwise, we
 

4549
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:30,470
hold here for a resqueeze. Otherwise, we
might come back into this pocket, which

4550
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:30,480
might come back into this pocket, which
 

4551
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:33,350
might come back into this pocket, which
I don't want to see because we've uh

4552
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:33,360
I don't want to see because we've uh
 

4553
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:35,430
I don't want to see because we've uh
sort of building this out here and this

4554
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:35,440
sort of building this out here and this
 

4555
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:37,189
sort of building this out here and this
out here and thin between. You can see

4556
01:46:37,189 --> 01:46:37,199
out here and thin between. You can see
 

4557
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:39,350
out here and thin between. You can see
thin here, thin here. But we should get

4558
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:39,360
thin here, thin here. But we should get
 

4559
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,910
thin here, thin here. But we should get
going now. There you go. So hopefully

4560
01:46:41,910 --> 01:46:41,920
going now. There you go. So hopefully
 

4561
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:43,990
going now. There you go. So hopefully
mate hopefully we get this move for you

4562
01:46:43,990 --> 01:46:44,000
mate hopefully we get this move for you
 

4563
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,510
mate hopefully we get this move for you
now

4564
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:45,520
now
 

4565
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:47,830
now
and if we can find acceptance let's hope

4566
01:46:47,830 --> 01:46:47,840
and if we can find acceptance let's hope
 

4567
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:49,750
and if we can find acceptance let's hope
we can find some acceptance over this

4568
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:49,760
we can find some acceptance over this
 

4569
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:52,310
we can find some acceptance over this
and ideally over this and then we can

4570
01:46:52,310 --> 01:46:52,320
and ideally over this and then we can
 

4571
01:46:52,320 --> 01:47:00,629
and ideally over this and then we can
get back into here.

4572
01:47:00,629 --> 01:47:00,639

 

4573
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:02,070

Yes, back above its New York open and

4574
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:02,080
Yes, back above its New York open and
 

4575
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,070
Yes, back above its New York open and
view up as well which is good. Where's

4576
01:47:04,070 --> 01:47:04,080
view up as well which is good. Where's
 

4577
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,629
view up as well which is good. Where's
the VIX surround PDC? I'd like to see

4578
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:06,639
the VIX surround PDC? I'd like to see
 

4579
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:07,910
the VIX surround PDC? I'd like to see
that start breaking down, but we look

4580
01:47:07,910 --> 01:47:07,920
that start breaking down, but we look
 

4581
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,070
that start breaking down, but we look
okay for a slow grind higher here. Now,

4582
01:47:10,070 --> 01:47:10,080
okay for a slow grind higher here. Now,
 

4583
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:11,830
okay for a slow grind higher here. Now,
if the VIX is going to start behaving

4584
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:11,840
if the VIX is going to start behaving
 

4585
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,510
if the VIX is going to start behaving
itself,

4586
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:13,520
itself,
 

4587
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:17,830
itself,
and I'd say uh basically 36es, 736 is

4588
01:47:17,830 --> 01:47:17,840
and I'd say uh basically 36es, 736 is
 

4589
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,990
and I'd say uh basically 36es, 736 is
under that, we've got sellers stuck. So,

4590
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:20,000
under that, we've got sellers stuck. So,
 

4591
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,470
under that, we've got sellers stuck. So,
if we hold above that or around that,

4592
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:22,480
if we hold above that or around that,
 

4593
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:25,910
if we hold above that or around that,
736s down to 727s

4594
01:47:25,910 --> 01:47:25,920
736s down to 727s
 

4595
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,910
736s down to 727s
are where sellers got stuck in here, a

4596
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:27,920
are where sellers got stuck in here, a
 

4597
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:30,229
are where sellers got stuck in here, a
lower time frame. All right. So the

4598
01:47:30,229 --> 01:47:30,239
lower time frame. All right. So the
 

4599
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:31,750
lower time frame. All right. So the
question is can we do this sort of low

4600
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:31,760
question is can we do this sort of low
 

4601
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:34,950
question is can we do this sort of low
volume drive out now above those levels

4602
01:47:34,950 --> 01:47:34,960
volume drive out now above those levels
 

4603
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:38,310
volume drive out now above those levels
and cause this squeeze. Here we go. So

4604
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:38,320
and cause this squeeze. Here we go. So
 

4605
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:41,910
and cause this squeeze. Here we go. So
750 755 765 all on deck here with

4606
01:47:41,910 --> 01:47:41,920
750 755 765 all on deck here with
 

4607
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,390
750 755 765 all on deck here with
passive players. 775 looking above that

4608
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:44,400
passive players. 775 looking above that
 

4609
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,870
passive players. 775 looking above that
800 is there still player 830 840 there

4610
01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:46,880
800 is there still player 830 840 there
 

4611
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,629
800 is there still player 830 840 there
is. So still got that liquidity to fill

4612
01:47:48,629 --> 01:47:48,639
is. So still got that liquidity to fill
 

4613
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:50,149
is. So still got that liquidity to fill
higher. I think you look really good now

4614
01:47:50,149 --> 01:47:50,159
higher. I think you look really good now
 

4615
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:52,470
higher. I think you look really good now
for a squeeze out. This is looking much

4616
01:47:52,470 --> 01:47:52,480
for a squeeze out. This is looking much
 

4617
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:55,189
for a squeeze out. This is looking much
much better for a squeeze out here. Much

4618
01:47:55,189 --> 01:47:55,199
much better for a squeeze out here. Much
 

4619
01:47:55,199 --> 01:48:00,229
much better for a squeeze out here. Much
much better. Really nice. So,

4620
01:48:00,229 --> 01:48:00,239
much better. Really nice. So,
 

4621
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:01,430
much better. Really nice. So,
let's see if we can fill these

4622
01:48:01,430 --> 01:48:01,440
let's see if we can fill these
 

4623
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:03,669
let's see if we can fill these
participants into

4624
01:48:03,669 --> 01:48:03,679
participants into
 

4625
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:07,109
participants into
55 and 65. Here we go. By time frame,

4626
01:48:07,109 --> 01:48:07,119
55 and 65. Here we go. By time frame,
 

4627
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:08,390
55 and 65. Here we go. By time frame,
I'll go up here. I'd like to see us

4628
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:08,400
I'll go up here. I'd like to see us
 

4629
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:10,629
I'll go up here. I'd like to see us
print back above 55s now and find some

4630
01:48:10,629 --> 01:48:10,639
print back above 55s now and find some
 

4631
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:12,629
print back above 55s now and find some
acceptance

4632
01:48:12,629 --> 01:48:12,639
acceptance
 

4633
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:15,590
acceptance
in an ideal world. And ideally, I don't

4634
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:15,600
in an ideal world. And ideally, I don't
 

4635
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,910
in an ideal world. And ideally, I don't
want it back below 42 now if I'm looking

4636
01:48:17,910 --> 01:48:17,920
want it back below 42 now if I'm looking
 

4637
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:19,189
want it back below 42 now if I'm looking
for higher prices just because that's

4638
01:48:19,189 --> 01:48:19,199
for higher prices just because that's
 

4639
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:20,950
for higher prices just because that's
where that big seller came in and got

4640

if we could get get through the IB I
would feel somewhat confident, right? If

and once we run that might get a squeeze
 

4721
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:23,430
and once we run that might get a squeeze
out through up into these. Looking good

4759
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:11,030

you are looking at opening new 1 hour, 4

4760
01:51:11,030 --> 01:51:11,040
you are looking at opening new 1 hour, 4
 

4761
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:13,270
you are looking at opening new 1 hour, 4
hour or in your strategy. It's not

4762
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:13,280
hour or in your strategy. It's not
 

4763
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:15,590
hour or in your strategy. It's not
important. Yes, it it is important. I do

important. Yes, it it is important. I do
care about the transitions on hours and

4766
01:51:17,590 --> 01:51:17,600
care about the transitions on hours and
 

4767
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:19,270
care about the transitions on hours and
4 hours. Absolutely. Because they

4768
01:51:19,270 --> 01:51:19,280
4 hours. Absolutely. Because they
 

4769
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:21,030
4 hours. Absolutely. Because they
provide more liquidity. Why do they

4770
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:21,040
provide more liquidity. Why do they
 

4771
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:23,030
provide more liquidity. Why do they
provide more liquidity? It's got nothing

4772
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:23,040
provide more liquidity? It's got nothing
 

4773
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:24,870
provide more liquidity? It's got nothing
to do with a magic algo or anything like

4774
01:51:24,870 --> 01:51:24,880
to do with a magic algo or anything like
 

4775
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,390
to do with a magic algo or anything like
that. It's because higher time frame

4776
01:51:26,390 --> 01:51:26,400
that. It's because higher time frame
 

4777
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,310
that. It's because higher time frame
traders trade transitions, right? So if

4778
01:51:28,310 --> 01:51:28,320
traders trade transitions, right? So if
 

4779
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,950
traders trade transitions, right? So if
you if you are trading at a bank and

4780
01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:30,960
you if you are trading at a bank and
 

4781
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:32,470
you if you are trading at a bank and
stuff like that, all right, guess what?

4782
01:51:32,470 --> 01:51:32,480
stuff like that, all right, guess what?
 

4783
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:34,390
stuff like that, all right, guess what?

scalp for that bank. What you're looking

4788
01:51:38,390 --> 01:51:38,400
scalp for that bank. What you're looking
 

4789
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:41,030
scalp for that bank. What you're looking
at is monthly, weekly, dailies,

4790
01:51:41,030 --> 01:51:41,040
at is monthly, weekly, dailies,
 

4791
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:43,189
at is monthly, weekly, dailies,
hourlies, 4 hours, right? So why you see

4792
01:51:43,189 --> 01:51:43,199
hourlies, 4 hours, right? So why you see
 

4793
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:44,870

to size down right if you size down the

4808
01:52:02,070 --> 01:52:02,080
to size down right if you size down the

trading draw down will not affect you
 

4811
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:06,790

right if you're trading two three micros
 

4813
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:08,709
right if you're trading two three micros
it is not going to affect you I'm

4814

it is not going to affect you I'm
 

4815
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:10,790
it is not going to affect you I'm
talking about 50k account right it's not

4816
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:10,800
talking about 50k account right it's not
 

4817
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,189
talking about 50k account right it's not
going to affect you where people get

4818

going to affect you where people get
 

4819
01:52:13,199 --> 01:52:15,990
going to affect you where people get
stuck is they oversize all right and

4820
01:52:15,990 --> 01:52:16,000
stuck is they oversize all right and
 

4821
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,510
stuck is they oversize all right and
they get caught in a pullback and then

4822
01:52:17,510 --> 01:52:17,520
they get caught in a pullback and then
 

4823
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:19,270
they get caught in a pullback and then
they blow up on the trading draw down so

4824
01:52:19,270 --> 01:52:19,280
they blow up on the trading draw down so
 

4825
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:21,189
they blow up on the trading draw down so
the first one is to size down the second

4826
01:52:21,189 --> 01:52:21,199
the first one is to size down the second
 

4827
01:52:21,199 --> 01:52:23,589
the first one is to size down the second
way to do it I'm going to be honest with

4828
01:52:23,589 --> 01:52:23,599
way to do it I'm going to be honest with
 

4829
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:25,589
way to do it I'm going to be honest with
you is to be very very aggressive and

4830
01:52:25,589 --> 01:52:25,599
you is to be very very aggressive and
 

4831
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:27,990
you is to be very very aggressive and
use a trading stop and pass them quick.

4832
01:52:27,990 --> 01:52:28,000
use a trading stop and pass them quick.
 

4833
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,830
use a trading stop and pass them quick.
Is that the best way to do it? I'm not

4834
01:52:29,830 --> 01:52:29,840
Is that the best way to do it? I'm not
 

4835
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,270
Is that the best way to do it? I'm not
convinced it's the best way to do it. I

4836
01:52:31,270 --> 01:52:31,280
convinced it's the best way to do it. I
 

4837
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:32,870
convinced it's the best way to do it. I
think you you will go through a lot of

4838
01:52:32,870 --> 01:52:32,880
think you you will go through a lot of
 

4839
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,950
think you you will go through a lot of
accounts, but do I do that? Yeah, there

4840
01:52:34,950 --> 01:52:34,960
accounts, but do I do that? Yeah, there
 

4841
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:37,350
accounts, but do I do that? Yeah, there
are times where I'm very very aggressive

4842
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:37,360
are times where I'm very very aggressive
 

4843
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:39,990
are times where I'm very very aggressive
with my accounts in eval because I don't

4844
01:52:39,990 --> 01:52:40,000
with my accounts in eval because I don't
 

4845
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,669
with my accounts in eval because I don't
want time decay because I know I can

4846
01:52:41,669 --> 01:52:41,679
want time decay because I know I can
 

4847
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:43,430
want time decay because I know I can
take consistent payouts for it. So, if I

4848
01:52:43,430 --> 01:52:43,440
take consistent payouts for it. So, if I
 

4849
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:44,709
take consistent payouts for it. So, if I
need to get through a trading draw down

4850
01:52:44,709 --> 01:52:44,719
need to get through a trading draw down
 

4851
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:46,709
need to get through a trading draw down
eval,

4852
01:52:46,709 --> 01:52:46,719
eval,
 

4853
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:51,350
eval,
sometimes I will be aggressive with it.

4854
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:51,360

 

4855
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:52,950

And the other way is yeah, exactly what

4856
01:52:52,950 --> 01:52:52,960
And the other way is yeah, exactly what
 

4857
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:55,189
And the other way is yeah, exactly what
Chad's saying. See money take money take

4865
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,229

The first hour has a huge wick. I I

4866
01:53:20,229 --> 01:53:20,239
The first hour has a huge wick. I I
 

4867
01:53:20,239 --> 01:53:22,149
The first hour has a huge wick. I I
don't think anything has a huge wick

4868
01:53:22,149 --> 01:53:22,159
don't think anything has a huge wick
 

4869
01:53:22,159 --> 01:53:23,830
don't think anything has a huge wick
right now. I'm going to be honest with

4870
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:23,840
right now. I'm going to be honest with
 

4871
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,589
right now. I'm going to be honest with
you. I think you're probably zoomed in.

4872
01:53:25,589 --> 01:53:25,599
you. I think you're probably zoomed in.
 

4873
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:27,990
you. I think you're probably zoomed in.
If we zoom like if I look at this, I

4874
01:53:27,990 --> 01:53:28,000
If we zoom like if I look at this, I
 

4875
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,470
If we zoom like if I look at this, I
don't see any huge wick. I just see very

4876
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:30,480
don't see any huge wick. I just see very
 

4877
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:32,870
don't see any huge wick. I just see very
tight price action, right? Very tight

4878
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:32,880
tight price action, right? Very tight
 

4879
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:35,350
tight price action, right? Very tight
price action. Huge wick would be

4880
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:35,360
price action. Huge wick would be
 

4881
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:37,990
price action. Huge wick would be
something like this, I guess, up here.

4882
01:53:37,990 --> 01:53:38,000
something like this, I guess, up here.
 

4883
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:44,950
something like this, I guess, up here.
Right? If we zoom in to this first hour,

4884
01:53:44,950 --> 01:53:44,960

 

4885
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:47,990

right? What you're seeing is huge wicks.

4886
01:53:47,990 --> 01:53:48,000
right? What you're seeing is huge wicks.
 

4887
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,430
right? What you're seeing is huge wicks.
if we're just going to actually measure

4888
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:49,440
if we're just going to actually measure
 

4889
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:52,870
if we're just going to actually measure
those out

4890
01:53:52,870 --> 01:53:52,880

 

4891
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:56,070

of 40 points.

4892
01:53:56,070 --> 01:53:56,080
of 40 points.
 

4893
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:58,070
of 40 points.
40 points is not a huge wick. All right.

4894
01:53:58,070 --> 01:53:58,080
40 points is not a huge wick. All right.
 

4895
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:00,070
40 points is not a huge wick. All right.
It's not a huge wick. You can see like

4896
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:00,080
It's not a huge wick. You can see like
 

4897
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:02,390
It's not a huge wick. You can see like
the these are drives up, right? Because

4898
01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:02,400
the these are drives up, right? Because
 

4899
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:04,470
the these are drives up, right? Because
we're finding bids off previous day

4900
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:04,480
we're finding bids off previous day
 

4901
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:05,990
we're finding bids off previous day
value.

4902
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:06,000
value.
 

4903
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,669
value.
But what I would say is nothing in here,

4904
01:54:09,669 --> 01:54:09,679
But what I would say is nothing in here,
 

4905
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:13,910
But what I would say is nothing in here,
okay, is huge, right? This is tiny,

4906
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:13,920
okay, is huge, right? This is tiny,
 

4907
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:15,510
okay, is huge, right? This is tiny,
right? So don't get too zoomed in.

4908
01:54:15,510 --> 01:54:15,520
right? So don't get too zoomed in.
 

4909
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:21,030
right? So don't get too zoomed in.
That's all I'm trying to say. Here

4910
01:54:21,030 --> 01:54:21,040

the market move the other way. That's
what it is. So if we see aggressive

4948
01:55:11,990 --> 01:55:12,000
what it is. So if we see aggressive
 

4949
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,350
what it is. So if we see aggressive
sellers and the market's not moving

4950
01:55:13,350 --> 01:55:13,360
sellers and the market's not moving
 

4951
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:16,149
sellers and the market's not moving
lower then we know aggressive sellers

4952
01:55:16,149 --> 01:55:16,159
lower then we know aggressive sellers
 

4953
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:17,910
lower then we know aggressive sellers
are stuck. If we see aggressive buyers

4954
01:55:17,910 --> 01:55:17,920
are stuck. If we see aggressive buyers
 

4955
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:19,669
are stuck. If we see aggressive buyers
and the market is not moving higher then

4956
01:55:19,669 --> 01:55:19,679
and the market is not moving higher then
 

4957
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:21,030
and the market is not moving higher then
we know aggressive buyers are stuck

4958
01:55:21,030 --> 01:55:21,040
we know aggressive buyers are stuck
 

4959
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:27,030
we know aggressive buyers are stuck
right and we trade their pain points.

4960
01:55:27,030 --> 01:55:27,040

 

4961
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:29,030

Can I get

4962
01:55:29,030 --> 01:55:29,040
Can I get
 

4963
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:31,669
Can I get
my idea on selling right now? What my

4964
01:55:31,669 --> 01:55:31,679
my idea on selling right now? What my
 

4965
01:55:31,679 --> 01:55:33,510
my idea on selling right now? What my
answer would be why what is your setup

4966
01:55:33,510 --> 01:55:33,520
answer would be why what is your setup
 

4967
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:35,189
answer would be why what is your setup
to sell right now? I don't see a setup

4968
01:55:35,189 --> 01:55:35,199
to sell right now? I don't see a setup
 

4969
01:55:35,199 --> 01:55:38,149
to sell right now? I don't see a setup
to sell right now.

4970
01:55:38,149 --> 01:55:38,159
to sell right now.
 

4971
01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:40,070
to sell right now.
like your location, you could argue, is

4972
01:55:40,070 --> 01:55:40,080
like your location, you could argue, is
 

4973
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:42,149
like your location, you could argue, is
not too bad. But what I'm now seeing is

4974
01:55:42,149 --> 01:55:42,159
not too bad. But what I'm now seeing is
 

4975
01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:46,470
not too bad. But what I'm now seeing is
we're back above previous day's value,

4976
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:46,480
we're back above previous day's value,
 

4977
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:48,709
we're back above previous day's value,
right? We have liquidity to aim for.

4978
01:55:48,709 --> 01:55:48,719
right? We have liquidity to aim for.
 

4979
01:55:48,719 --> 01:55:51,350
right? We have liquidity to aim for.
This isn't just this day. We zoom out.

4980
01:55:51,350 --> 01:55:51,360
This isn't just this day. We zoom out.
 

4981
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:53,750
This isn't just this day. We zoom out.
All these stops are here. And if we run

4982
01:55:53,750 --> 01:55:53,760
All these stops are here. And if we run
 

4983
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:55,270
All these stops are here. And if we run
those stops, we are going to search

4984
01:55:55,270 --> 01:55:55,280
those stops, we are going to search
 

4985
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:57,270
those stops, we are going to search
higher. I don't think there's a good

4986
01:55:57,270 --> 01:55:57,280
higher. I don't think there's a good
 

4987
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:59,510
higher. I don't think there's a good
idea to sell right now. But uh you you

4988
01:55:59,510 --> 01:55:59,520
idea to sell right now. But uh you you
 

4989
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:02,550
idea to sell right now. But uh you you
trade what you want, right? I don't

4990
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:02,560
trade what you want, right? I don't
 

4991
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:04,790
trade what you want, right? I don't
think there's a sell right now. The cell

4992
01:56:04,790 --> 01:56:04,800
think there's a sell right now. The cell
 

4993
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:07,270
think there's a sell right now. The cell
would have to be back

4994
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:07,280
would have to be back
 

4995
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,510
would have to be back
under here if you're playing a rotation,

4996
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:09,520
under here if you're playing a rotation,
 

4997
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:11,030
under here if you're playing a rotation,
right? This is not a sell. If you're

4998
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:11,040
right? This is not a sell. If you're
 

4999
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:12,070
right? This is not a sell. If you're
selling this, what you doing? You're

5000
01:56:12,070 --> 01:56:12,080
selling this, what you doing? You're
 

5001
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:14,070
selling this, what you doing? You're
going to add and add and add. What you

5002
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:14,080
going to add and add and add. What you
 

5003
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:16,149
going to add and add and add. What you
doing when all these stops cover and it

5004
01:56:16,149 --> 01:56:16,159
doing when all these stops cover and it
 

5005
01:56:16,159 --> 01:56:18,470
doing when all these stops cover and it
comes up to here? You're going to add

5006
01:56:18,470 --> 01:56:18,480
comes up to here? You're going to add
 

5007
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:21,189
comes up to here? You're going to add
and add and add and blow up. Right?

5008
01:56:21,189 --> 01:56:21,199
and add and add and blow up. Right?
 

5009
01:56:21,199 --> 01:56:23,910
and add and add and blow up. Right?
There's your momentum right now. Maybe

5010
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:23,920
There's your momentum right now. Maybe
 

5011
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:25,350
There's your momentum right now. Maybe
you get a pull back to here, but it's

5012
01:56:25,350 --> 01:56:25,360
you get a pull back to here, but it's
 

5013
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:26,470
you get a pull back to here, but it's
probably going to be absorbed to go

5014
01:56:26,470 --> 01:56:26,480
probably going to be absorbed to go
 

5015
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:27,430
probably going to be absorbed to go
higher. At the moment, I don't think

5016
01:56:27,430 --> 01:56:27,440
higher. At the moment, I don't think
 

5017
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:29,430
higher. At the moment, I don't think
there's a sell from what I can see right

5018
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:29,440
there's a sell from what I can see right
 

5019
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:33,350
there's a sell from what I can see right
now.

5020
01:56:33,350 --> 01:56:33,360

 

5021
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:36,310

So yeah, you if that's my opinion, you

5022
01:56:36,310 --> 01:56:36,320
So yeah, you if that's my opinion, you
 

5023
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:37,750
So yeah, you if that's my opinion, you
you guys do you. If there's something in

5024
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:37,760
you guys do you. If there's something in
 

5025
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:50,229
you guys do you. If there's something in
here you like, you do you.

5026
01:56:50,229 --> 01:56:50,239

 

5027
01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:51,750

Never used a prop burn just my own

5028
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:51,760
Never used a prop burn just my own
 

5029
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:53,109
Never used a prop burn just my own
account. Is it worth looking into? Yeah,

5030
01:56:53,109 --> 01:56:53,119
account. Is it worth looking into? Yeah,
 

5031
01:56:53,119 --> 01:56:55,669
account. Is it worth looking into? Yeah,
I'd say it is worth looking into. Um,

5032
01:56:55,669 --> 01:56:55,679
I'd say it is worth looking into. Um,
 

5033
01:56:55,679 --> 01:56:57,109
I'd say it is worth looking into. Um,
just make sure you read up on the

5034
01:56:57,109 --> 01:56:57,119
just make sure you read up on the
 

5035
01:56:57,119 --> 01:57:00,870
just make sure you read up on the
trading rules for each one. understand

5036
01:57:00,870 --> 01:57:00,880
trading rules for each one. understand
 

5037
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:02,550
trading rules for each one. understand
it's not like playing with your own

5038
01:57:02,550 --> 01:57:02,560
it's not like playing with your own
 

5039
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:06,229
it's not like playing with your own
cash,

5040
01:57:06,229 --> 01:57:06,239

 

5041
01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:09,990

but uh the leverage is good.

5042
01:57:09,990 --> 01:57:10,000
but uh the leverage is good.
 

5043
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:11,589
but uh the leverage is good.
If you've been used to trading your own

5044
01:57:11,589 --> 01:57:11,599
If you've been used to trading your own
 

5045
01:57:11,599 --> 01:57:13,510
If you've been used to trading your own
account, I would say probably better to

5046
01:57:13,510 --> 01:57:13,520
account, I would say probably better to
 

5047
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:16,629
account, I would say probably better to
look at uh Lucid, Funded Next, or

5048
01:57:16,629 --> 01:57:16,639
look at uh Lucid, Funded Next, or
 

5049
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:19,350
look at uh Lucid, Funded Next, or
Tradeify.

5050
01:57:19,350 --> 01:57:19,360
Tradeify.
 

5051
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:21,430
Tradeify.
They're a bit a bit easier with the

5052
01:57:21,430 --> 01:57:21,440
They're a bit a bit easier with the
 

5053
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:23,830
They're a bit a bit easier with the
rules. If you've been used to trading

5054
01:57:23,830 --> 01:57:23,840
rules. If you've been used to trading
 

5055
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:35,030
rules. If you've been used to trading
your own account, start there.

5056
01:57:35,030 --> 01:57:35,040

 

5057
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:36,870

Do I have an idea about Greeks and

5058
01:57:36,870 --> 01:57:36,880
Do I have an idea about Greeks and
 

5059
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:38,709
Do I have an idea about Greeks and
dealer positions? Is it worth to pay for

5060
01:57:38,709 --> 01:57:38,719
dealer positions? Is it worth to pay for
 

5061
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:41,510
dealer positions? Is it worth to pay for
data? It look gamma can be very very

5062
01:57:41,510 --> 01:57:41,520
data? It look gamma can be very very
 

5063
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:44,070
data? It look gamma can be very very
useful. There's no there's no way of

5064
01:57:44,070 --> 01:57:44,080
useful. There's no there's no way of
 

5065
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:45,910
useful. There's no there's no way of
denying it especially in a market run by

5066
01:57:45,910 --> 01:57:45,920
denying it especially in a market run by
 

5067
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:51,430
denying it especially in a market run by
zero DTE. It becomes important. So yes,

5068
01:57:51,430 --> 01:57:51,440
zero DTE. It becomes important. So yes,
 

5069
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:53,350
zero DTE. It becomes important. So yes,
can be very very useful at least to plot

5070
01:57:53,350 --> 01:57:53,360
can be very very useful at least to plot
 

5071
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:54,709
can be very very useful at least to plot
it in your chart at the beginning of the

5072
01:57:54,709 --> 01:57:54,719
it in your chart at the beginning of the
 

5073
01:57:54,719 --> 01:58:03,109
it in your chart at the beginning of the
days and stuff.

5074
01:58:03,109 --> 01:58:03,119

 

5075
01:58:03,119 --> 01:58:04,550

And that's yeah, if you're on if you're

5076
01:58:04,550 --> 01:58:04,560
And that's yeah, if you're on if you're
 

5077
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:06,550
And that's yeah, if you're on if you're
on tilt, Adam, just yeah, disconnect. I

5078
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:06,560
on tilt, Adam, just yeah, disconnect. I
 

5079
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:07,510
on tilt, Adam, just yeah, disconnect. I
mean, you're not going to miss much

5080
01:58:07,510 --> 01:58:07,520
mean, you're not going to miss much
 

5081
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:14,310
mean, you're not going to miss much
today, honestly.

5082
01:58:14,310 --> 01:58:14,320

 

5083
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:15,430

Okay, they're trying to hold this

5084
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:15,440
Okay, they're trying to hold this
 

5085
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:19,109
Okay, they're trying to hold this
pullback into these flow zones.

5086
01:58:19,109 --> 01:58:19,119
pullback into these flow zones.
 

5087
01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:20,629
pullback into these flow zones.
Where was that last seller stuck? What

5088
01:58:20,629 --> 01:58:20,639
Where was that last seller stuck? What
 

5089
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:24,229
Where was that last seller stuck? What
was his size? 48.

5090
01:58:24,229 --> 01:58:24,239
was his size? 48.
 

5091
01:58:24,239 --> 01:58:29,830
was his size? 48.
Yeah, as long as 48 and sort of 30 39ish

5092
01:58:29,830 --> 01:58:29,840
Yeah, as long as 48 and sort of 30 39ish
 

5093
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:31,750
Yeah, as long as 48 and sort of 30 39ish
hold, then there's a chance for a rebid

5094
01:58:31,750 --> 01:58:31,760
hold, then there's a chance for a rebid
 

5095
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:34,550
hold, then there's a chance for a rebid
higher. If they collap, I wouldn't be

5096
01:58:34,550 --> 01:58:34,560
higher. If they collap, I wouldn't be
 

5097
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,950
higher. If they collap, I wouldn't be
short biased in this market unless we

5098
01:58:36,950 --> 01:58:36,960
short biased in this market unless we
 

5099
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:38,709
short biased in this market unless we
come back under value and we lose this

5100
01:58:38,709 --> 01:58:38,719
come back under value and we lose this
 

5101
01:58:38,719 --> 01:58:40,550
come back under value and we lose this
down here all the time. We're holding

5102
01:58:40,550 --> 01:58:40,560
down here all the time. We're holding
 

5103
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:43,109
down here all the time. We're holding
into here, especially into here. There's

5104
01:58:43,109 --> 01:58:43,119
into here, especially into here. There's
 

5105
01:58:43,119 --> 01:58:45,030
into here, especially into here. There's
this rebid chance. All right. Is this a

5106
01:58:45,030 --> 01:58:45,040
this rebid chance. All right. Is this a
 

5107
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:47,189
this rebid chance. All right. Is this a
squeeze? Yeah. Can they repric it? Yeah.

5108
01:58:47,189 --> 01:58:47,199
squeeze? Yeah. Can they repric it? Yeah.
 

5109
01:58:47,199 --> 01:58:49,189
squeeze? Yeah. Can they repric it? Yeah.
But I'd be looking, if I was bullish,

5110
01:58:49,189 --> 01:58:49,199
But I'd be looking, if I was bullish,
 

5111
01:58:49,199 --> 01:58:51,589
But I'd be looking, if I was bullish,
I'd be looking for them to hold here and

5112
01:58:51,589 --> 01:58:51,599
I'd be looking for them to hold here and
 

5113
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:53,750
I'd be looking for them to hold here and
finish this now. Don't think there's any

5114
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:53,760
finish this now. Don't think there's any
 

5115
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:55,910
finish this now. Don't think there's any
reason to get short.

5116
01:58:55,910 --> 01:58:55,920
reason to get short.
 

5117
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:57,830
reason to get short.
Absolutely no reason to get short in my

5118
01:58:57,830 --> 01:58:57,840
Absolutely no reason to get short in my
 

5119
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:03,830
Absolutely no reason to get short in my
mind.

5120
01:59:03,830 --> 01:59:03,840

 

5121
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:05,430

Is there any reason I don't trade my own

5122
01:59:05,430 --> 01:59:05,440
Is there any reason I don't trade my own
 

5123
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:07,270
Is there any reason I don't trade my own
capital with futures? Uh I'd prefer

5124
01:59:07,270 --> 01:59:07,280
capital with futures? Uh I'd prefer
 

5125
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:09,030
capital with futures? Uh I'd prefer
taking swing swing positions with my own

5126
01:59:09,030 --> 01:59:09,040
taking swing swing positions with my own
 

5127
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:10,550
taking swing swing positions with my own
capital.

5128
01:59:10,550 --> 01:59:10,560
capital.
 

5129
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:13,030
capital.
That's why

5130
01:59:13,030 --> 01:59:13,040
That's why
 

5131
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:14,870
That's why
I think the the amount of leverage and

5132
01:59:14,870 --> 01:59:14,880
I think the the amount of leverage and
 

5133
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:16,310
I think the the amount of leverage and
the amount of money you can make from

5134
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:16,320
the amount of money you can make from
 

5135
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:17,990
the amount of money you can make from
prop firms with very limited risk if

5136
01:59:17,990 --> 01:59:18,000
prop firms with very limited risk if
 

5137
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,950
prop firms with very limited risk if
you're a good trader way outweighs the

5138
01:59:20,950 --> 01:59:20,960
you're a good trader way outweighs the
 

5139
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:23,830
you're a good trader way outweighs the
reason to trade your own capital.

5140
01:59:23,830 --> 01:59:23,840
reason to trade your own capital.
 

5141
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:26,709
reason to trade your own capital.
And uh I'd rather put my capital to work

5142
01:59:26,709 --> 01:59:26,719
And uh I'd rather put my capital to work
 

5143
01:59:26,719 --> 01:59:30,390
And uh I'd rather put my capital to work
in swing positions, which is what I do.

5144
01:59:30,390 --> 01:59:30,400
in swing positions, which is what I do.
 

5145
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,310
in swing positions, which is what I do.
That's just it's just a personal thing.

5146
01:59:32,310 --> 01:59:32,320
That's just it's just a personal thing.
 

5147
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:34,229
That's just it's just a personal thing.
It's just how I do it. It's not always

5148
01:59:34,229 --> 01:59:34,239
It's just how I do it. It's not always
 

5149
01:59:34,239 --> 01:59:36,709
It's just how I do it. It's not always
been the way. I traded my own capital

5150
01:59:36,709 --> 01:59:36,719
been the way. I traded my own capital
 

5151
01:59:36,719 --> 01:59:39,750
been the way. I traded my own capital
for years on small caps and large caps.

5152
01:59:39,750 --> 01:59:39,760
for years on small caps and large caps.
 

5153
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:41,910
for years on small caps and large caps.
Um

5154
01:59:41,910 --> 01:59:41,920
Um
 

5155
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:43,189
Um
maybe I'll go back to that if the

5156
01:59:43,189 --> 01:59:43,199
maybe I'll go back to that if the
 

5157
01:59:43,199 --> 01:59:45,430
maybe I'll go back to that if the
volatility looks well I think the

5158
01:59:45,430 --> 01:59:45,440
volatility looks well I think the
 

5159
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:47,109
volatility looks well I think the
volatility is going to be huge next

5160
01:59:47,109 --> 01:59:47,119
volatility is going to be huge next

5248
02:01:52,310 --> 02:01:52,320
resqueeze up into there. Let's have a
 

5249
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:53,990
resqueeze up into there. Let's have a
look at the mag. How the mag doing? Not

5250
02:01:53,990 --> 02:01:54,000
look at the mag. How the mag doing? Not
 

5251
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,189
look at the mag. How the mag doing? Not
too bad. It look like they're starting

5252
02:01:55,189 --> 02:01:55,199
too bad. It look like they're starting
 

5253
02:01:55,199 --> 02:01:57,430
too bad. It look like they're starting

think I think that's what we ended up up

5298
02:02:57,270 --> 02:02:57,280
think I think that's what we ended up up
 

5299
02:02:57,280 --> 02:03:00,629
think I think that's what we ended up up
on it. We bought at 198 on open and we

5300
02:03:00,629 --> 02:03:00,639
on it. We bought at 198 on open and we
 

5301
02:03:00,639 --> 02:03:02,229
on it. We bought at 198 on open and we
sold right into the peak when everyone

5302
02:03:02,229 --> 02:03:02,239
sold right into the peak when everyone
 

5303
02:03:02,239 --> 02:03:05,270
sold right into the peak when everyone
else started sell started buying it.

5304
02:03:05,270 --> 02:03:05,280
else started sell started buying it.
 

5305
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:06,709
else started sell started buying it.
Maybe it was four. Maybe I got it wrong.

5306
02:03:06,709 --> 02:03:06,719
Maybe it was four. Maybe I got it wrong.
 

5307
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:08,709
Maybe it was four. Maybe I got it wrong.
Maybe it was 400%.

5308
02:03:08,709 --> 02:03:08,719
Maybe it was 400%.
 

5309
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:12,550
Maybe it was 400%.
We bought 198. Where was that in this

5310
02:03:12,550 --> 02:03:12,560
We bought 198. Where was that in this
 

5311
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:17,109
We bought 198. Where was that in this
pullback here?

5312
02:03:17,109 --> 02:03:17,119

 

5313
02:03:17,119 --> 02:03:20,470

I think we actually bought early

5314
02:03:20,470 --> 02:03:20,480
I think we actually bought early
 

5315
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:24,229
I think we actually bought early
and sold some and then rebid. So

5316
02:03:24,229 --> 02:03:24,239
and sold some and then rebid. So
 

5317
02:03:24,239 --> 02:03:29,189
and sold some and then rebid. So
there we go. 450%. That was close. 450%.

5318
02:03:29,189 --> 02:03:29,199
there we go. 450%. That was close. 450%.
 

5319
02:03:29,199 --> 02:03:31,430
there we go. 450%. That was close. 450%.
We got that whole move. It wasn't just

5320
02:03:31,430 --> 02:03:31,440
We got that whole move. It wasn't just
 

5321
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:33,030
We got that whole move. It wasn't just
me. Lots of guys in Discord got it with

5322
02:03:33,030 --> 02:03:33,040
me. Lots of guys in Discord got it with
 

5323
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:35,430
me. Lots of guys in Discord got it with
me and we sold up it. I think that was

5324
02:03:35,430 --> 02:03:35,440
me and we sold up it. I think that was
 

5325
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:39,270
me and we sold up it. I think that was
it.

5326
02:03:39,270 --> 02:03:39,280

5350
02:04:05,430 --> 02:04:05,440
is where I was getting long. There's the
 

5351
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:08,390
is where I was getting long. There's the
accumulation phase,

5352
02:04:08,390 --> 02:04:08,400
accumulation phase,
 

5353
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:10,390

and everything after that was upside
 

5359
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:17,189
and everything after that was upside
until we got into key areas that we were

5360
02:04:17,189 --> 02:04:17,199
until we got into key areas that we were
 

5361

little bit of a shelf starting to be
 

5385
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:50,790

02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:14,550
They are forced to jump over each other
to market order out and you get the big

to market order out and you get the big
 

5453
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:16,709
to market order out and you get the big
squeeze come and then you get one pull

5454

squeeze come and then you get one pull
 

5455
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:18,790
squeeze come and then you get one pull
back in and then hammer it in again. And

5456
02:06:18,790 --> 02:06:18,800
back in and then hammer it in again. And
 

5457
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:21,350
back in and then hammer it in again. And
if that holds a higher low, you get a T

5458
02:06:21,350 --> 02:06:21,360
if that holds a higher low, you get a T
 

5459
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:23,830
if that holds a higher low, you get a T
plus2 scenario and we expand higher. And

plus2 scenario and we expand higher. And
 

5461
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:26,310
plus2 scenario and we expand higher. And
that's exactly what we got over and over

silver at that high? Lots. Okay. All
 

5481
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:50,870
silver at that high? Lots. Okay. All
those extra buyers become the volume for

02:06:50,870 --> 02:06:50,880
those extra buyers become the volume for

If you're going to sell a big position,

5488
02:06:57,030 --> 02:06:57,040
If you're going to sell a big position,
 

5489
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:59,990
If you're going to sell a big position,
if I'm going to sell a million shares

5490

if I'm going to sell a million shares
 

5491
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,910
if I'm going to sell a million shares
right now, let's just let's talk about

5492
02:07:01,910 --> 02:07:01,920
right now, let's just let's talk about
 

5493
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:03,030
right now, let's just let's talk about
right now. This is going to be a good

5494
02:07:03,030 --> 02:07:03,040
right now. This is going to be a good
 

5495
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:05,830
right now. This is going to be a good
example, right? If I'm long here, right,

5496
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:05,840
example, right? If I'm long here, right,
 

5497
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:08,870
example, right? If I'm long here, right,
let's say 10,000 contracts, okay, and I

5498
02:07:08,870 --> 02:07:08,880
let's say 10,000 contracts, okay, and I
 

5499
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:10,870
let's say 10,000 contracts, okay, and I
want to trim some of them. I can't just

5500
02:07:10,870 --> 02:07:10,880
want to trim some of them. I can't just
 

5501
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:13,030
want to trim some of them. I can't just
sell, right? I need a buyer the other

5502
02:07:13,030 --> 02:07:13,040
sell, right? I need a buyer the other
 

5503
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:14,629
sell, right? I need a buyer the other
side. So, where's my buyer? He's

5504
02:07:14,629 --> 02:07:14,639
side. So, where's my buyer? He's
 

5505
02:07:14,639 --> 02:07:16,550
side. So, where's my buyer? He's
probably going to be here because if

5506
02:07:16,550 --> 02:07:16,560
probably going to be here because if
 

5507
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:18,790
probably going to be here because if
this is a short seller and their stops

5508
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:18,800
this is a short seller and their stops
 

5509
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:20,390
this is a short seller and their stops
get run, then he's going to become a

5510
02:07:20,390 --> 02:07:20,400
get run, then he's going to become a
 

5511
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:22,629
get run, then he's going to become a
market buyer. And if I have a breakout,

5512
02:07:22,629 --> 02:07:22,639
market buyer. And if I have a breakout,
 

5513
02:07:22,639 --> 02:07:25,910
market buyer. And if I have a breakout,
a breakout buyer here as well, he's got

5514
02:07:25,910 --> 02:07:25,920
a breakout buyer here as well, he's got
 

5515
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:28,550
a breakout buyer here as well, he's got
buy orders there. So, I know here maybe

5516
02:07:28,550 --> 02:07:28,560
buy orders there. So, I know here maybe
 

5517
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:31,189
buy orders there. So, I know here maybe
I've got 10,000 buy orders. So once we

5518
02:07:31,189 --> 02:07:31,199
I've got 10,000 buy orders. So once we
 

5519
02:07:31,199 --> 02:07:33,430
I've got 10,000 buy orders. So once we
get through here, I can easily sell my

5520
02:07:33,430 --> 02:07:33,440
get through here, I can easily sell my
 

5521
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:35,589
get through here, I can easily sell my
10,000 position without it affecting the

5522
02:07:35,589 --> 02:07:35,599
10,000 position without it affecting the
 

5523
02:07:35,599 --> 02:07:38,390
10,000 position without it affecting the
market, right? Because I can pair off,

5524
02:07:38,390 --> 02:07:38,400
market, right? Because I can pair off,
 

5525
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:41,109
market, right? Because I can pair off,
right? It is the same but more important

5526
02:07:41,109 --> 02:07:41,119
right? It is the same but more important
 

5527
02:07:41,119 --> 02:07:42,950
right? It is the same but more important
in small caps because you have a lack of

5528
02:07:42,950 --> 02:07:42,960
in small caps because you have a lack of
 

5529
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:50,470
in small caps because you have a lack of
liquidity. [snorts]

that's why
it is a game of liquidity. It doesn't

02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:29,430
if if you I literally I don't know what
to tell you, J Source. I don't know how

5560
02:08:29,430 --> 02:08:29,440
to tell you, J Source. I don't know how
 

5561
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:32,390
to tell you, J Source. I don't know how
much size you're in. I don't know how

5562
02:08:32,390 --> 02:08:32,400
much size you're in. I don't know how
 

5563
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:33,990
much size you're in. I don't know how
much exposure you've got. I don't know

5564
02:08:33,990 --> 02:08:34,000
much exposure you've got. I don't know
 

5565
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:37,510
much exposure you've got. I don't know
your risk tolerance. Like,

5566
02:08:37,510 --> 02:08:37,520
your risk tolerance. Like,
 

5567
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:38,790
your risk tolerance. Like,
do I think we're going to go higher

5568
02:08:38,790 --> 02:08:38,800
do I think we're going to go higher
 

5569
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:40,950
do I think we're going to go higher
here? My personal feeling is yes. Right

5570
02:08:40,950 --> 02:08:40,960
here? My personal feeling is yes. Right
 

5571
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:42,149
here? My personal feeling is yes. Right
now, I think we're going to probably

5572
02:08:42,149 --> 02:08:42,159
now, I think we're going to probably
 

5573
02:08:42,159 --> 02:08:44,390
now, I think we're going to probably
squeeze out. But, you know, I don't know

5574
02:08:44,390 --> 02:08:44,400
squeeze out. But, you know, I don't know
 

5575
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:45,830
squeeze out. But, you know, I don't know
your exact position. All I know is you

5576
02:08:45,830 --> 02:08:45,840
your exact position. All I know is you
 

5577
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:48,390
your exact position. All I know is you
said you bought the high. So,

5578
02:08:48,390 --> 02:08:48,400
said you bought the high. So,
 

5579
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:50,069
said you bought the high. So,
if you've sat through all of this, if

5580
02:08:50,069 --> 02:08:50,079
if you've sat through all of this, if
 

5581
02:08:50,079 --> 02:08:52,709
if you've sat through all of this, if
you've bought this

5582
02:08:52,709 --> 02:08:52,719
you've bought this
 

5583
02:08:52,719 --> 02:08:55,589
you've bought this
and you've sat through all of this,

5584
02:08:55,589 --> 02:08:55,599
and you've sat through all of this,
 

5585
02:08:55,599 --> 02:08:58,069
and you've sat through all of this,
you know, would I get out? I mean, I

5586
02:08:58,069 --> 02:08:58,079
you know, would I get out? I mean, I
 

5587
02:08:58,079 --> 02:09:02,629
you know, would I get out? I mean, I
probably would have got out here, but uh

5588
02:09:02,629 --> 02:09:02,639
probably would have got out here, but uh
 

5589
02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:04,550
probably would have got out here, but uh
do I think it can do this? I do think I

5590
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:04,560
do I think it can do this? I do think I
 

5591
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:06,310
do I think it can do this? I do think I
think there's a lot of stops here to

5592
02:09:06,310 --> 02:09:06,320
think there's a lot of stops here to
 

5593
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:08,310
think there's a lot of stops here to
run. But, uh I don't want to tell you to

5594
02:09:08,310 --> 02:09:08,320
run. But, uh I don't want to tell you to
 

5595
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:09,669
run. But, uh I don't want to tell you to
hold because you're you're in a horrible

5596
02:09:09,669 --> 02:09:09,679
hold because you're you're in a horrible
 

5597
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:11,350
hold because you're you're in a horrible
position. But, there's so many stops

5598
02:09:11,350 --> 02:09:11,360
position. But, there's so many stops
 

5599
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:13,430
position. But, there's so many stops
here that I think we go and run up into

5600
02:09:13,430 --> 02:09:13,440
here that I think we go and run up into
 

5601
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:16,790
here that I think we go and run up into
here.

5602
02:09:16,790 --> 02:09:16,800

 

5603
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:18,149

And that's when you'll get the squeeze

5604
02:09:18,149 --> 02:09:18,159
And that's when you'll get the squeeze
 

5605
02:09:18,159 --> 02:09:19,830
And that's when you'll get the squeeze
and the pair off of liquidity that I

5606
02:09:19,830 --> 02:09:19,840
and the pair off of liquidity that I
 

5607
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:22,470
and the pair off of liquidity that I
talked about. So, here we go. Big drive

5608
02:09:22,470 --> 02:09:22,480
talked about. So, here we go. Big drive
 

5609
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:23,910
talked about. So, here we go. Big drive
up. They're going to try and run these

5610
02:09:23,910 --> 02:09:23,920
up. They're going to try and run these
 

5611
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:25,759
up. They're going to try and run these
stops now.

5612
02:09:25,759 --> 02:09:25,769
stops now.
 

5613
02:09:25,769 --> 02:09:29,350
stops now.
[snorts]

5614
02:09:29,350 --> 02:09:29,360

 

5615
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:31,510

You missed the o the trade at the open.

5616
02:09:31,510 --> 02:09:31,520
You missed the o the trade at the open.
 

5617
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:33,750
You missed the o the trade at the open.
Can you show the win again? Uh, I don't

5618
02:09:33,750 --> 02:09:33,760
Can you show the win again? Uh, I don't
 

5619
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:35,830
Can you show the win again? Uh, I don't
think I traded the open, my friend. Uh,

5620
02:09:35,830 --> 02:09:35,840
think I traded the open, my friend. Uh,
 

5621
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:39,189
think I traded the open, my friend. Uh,
my trade was here. I didn't trade this.

5622
02:09:39,189 --> 02:09:39,199
my trade was here. I didn't trade this.
 

5623
02:09:39,199 --> 02:09:41,830
my trade was here. I didn't trade this.
My trade was this this drive up. Looking

5624
02:09:41,830 --> 02:09:41,840
My trade was this this drive up. Looking
 

5625
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:43,189
My trade was this this drive up. Looking
for the same thing we're looking for now

5626
02:09:43,189 --> 02:09:43,199
for the same thing we're looking for now
 

5627
02:09:43,199 --> 02:09:44,870
for the same thing we're looking for now
really to see if we can get back above

5628
02:09:44,870 --> 02:09:44,880
really to see if we can get back above
 

5629
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:46,950
really to see if we can get back above
this. All right. So, there's probably

5630
02:09:46,950 --> 02:09:46,960
this. All right. So, there's probably
 

5631
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:48,470
this. All right. So, there's probably
going to be a stop hunt. You'll probably

5632
02:09:48,470 --> 02:09:48,480
going to be a stop hunt. You'll probably
 

5633
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:50,390
going to be a stop hunt. You'll probably
see liquidity come. There's the stop

5634
02:09:50,390 --> 02:09:50,400
see liquidity come. There's the stop
 

5635
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:52,390
see liquidity come. There's the stop
hunt. You see that? That's the pair off.

5636
02:09:52,390 --> 02:09:52,400
hunt. You see that? That's the pair off.
 

5637
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:53,910
hunt. You see that? That's the pair off.
We just talked about it. That's

5638
02:09:53,910 --> 02:09:53,920
We just talked about it. That's
 

5639
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:57,030
We just talked about it. That's
literally the pair off here. All right?

5640
02:09:57,030 --> 02:09:57,040
literally the pair off here. All right?
 

5641
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:58,790
literally the pair off here. All right?
Because everyone who's smart, who bought

5642
02:09:58,790 --> 02:09:58,800
Because everyone who's smart, who bought
 

5643
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:00,629
Because everyone who's smart, who bought
down here, is going to use these stops

5644
02:10:00,629 --> 02:10:00,639
down here, is going to use these stops
 

5645
02:10:00,639 --> 02:10:02,229
down here, is going to use these stops
to trim their positioning. Remember, we

5646
02:10:02,229 --> 02:10:02,239
to trim their positioning. Remember, we
 

5647
02:10:02,239 --> 02:10:04,709
to trim their positioning. Remember, we
just talked about like a 10 a 10k move

5648
02:10:04,709 --> 02:10:04,719
just talked about like a 10 a 10k move
 

5649
02:10:04,719 --> 02:10:06,870
just talked about like a 10 a 10k move
here. You just paired it off. All right?

5650
02:10:06,870 --> 02:10:06,880
here. You just paired it off. All right?
 

5651
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:10,470
here. You just paired it off. All right?
And I can show you that right here.

5652
02:10:10,470 --> 02:10:10,480
And I can show you that right here.
 

5653
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:12,229
And I can show you that right here.
Right? These are all buy orders. They

5654
02:10:12,229 --> 02:10:12,239
Right? These are all buy orders. They
 

5655
02:10:12,239 --> 02:10:13,910
Right? These are all buy orders. They
are not sell orders. All right, so think

5656
02:10:13,910 --> 02:10:13,920
are not sell orders. All right, so think
 

5657
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:16,390
are not sell orders. All right, so think
about this. If Alex bought low and he

5658
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:16,400
about this. If Alex bought low and he
 

5659
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:20,069
about this. If Alex bought low and he
has 10,000, right, limit orders, limit

5660
02:10:20,069 --> 02:10:20,079
has 10,000, right, limit orders, limit
 

5661
02:10:20,079 --> 02:10:22,229
has 10,000, right, limit orders, limit
order, sell orders here. All right, I

5662
02:10:22,229 --> 02:10:22,239
order, sell orders here. All right, I
 

5663
02:10:22,239 --> 02:10:23,830
order, sell orders here. All right, I
just paired them off with all these guys

5664
02:10:23,830 --> 02:10:23,840
just paired them off with all these guys
 

5665
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:25,350
just paired them off with all these guys
chasing the market. Now, I've trimmed my

5666
02:10:25,350 --> 02:10:25,360
chasing the market. Now, I've trimmed my
 

5667
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:27,109
chasing the market. Now, I've trimmed my
position without me affecting price too

5668
02:10:27,109 --> 02:10:27,119
position without me affecting price too
 

5669
02:10:27,119 --> 02:10:28,950
position without me affecting price too
much. Here comes the squeeze and they're

5670
02:10:28,950 --> 02:10:28,960
much. Here comes the squeeze and they're
 

5671
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:31,430
much. Here comes the squeeze and they're
going to try and come up into here now.

5672
02:10:31,430 --> 02:10:31,440
going to try and come up into here now.
 

5673
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:33,109
going to try and come up into here now.
Looks really good. I forget. I'm really

5674
02:10:33,109 --> 02:10:33,119
Looks really good. I forget. I'm really
 

5675
02:10:33,119 --> 02:10:34,229
Looks really good. I forget. I'm really
sorry. I'm still trying to remember

5676
02:10:34,229 --> 02:10:34,239
sorry. I'm still trying to remember
 

5677
02:10:34,239 --> 02:10:37,750
sorry. I'm still trying to remember
everyone's names who's new here, but uh

5678
02:10:37,750 --> 02:10:37,760
everyone's names who's new here, but uh
 

5679
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:39,430
everyone's names who's new here, but uh
Rick Rick's long. It's Rick that's long

5680
02:10:39,430 --> 02:10:39,440
Rick Rick's long. It's Rick that's long
 

5681
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:41,109
Rick Rick's long. It's Rick that's long
off the lows on the swing and I think he

5682
02:10:41,109 --> 02:10:41,119
off the lows on the swing and I think he
 

5683
02:10:41,119 --> 02:10:42,870
off the lows on the swing and I think he
looks good now. All right, so you want

5684
02:10:42,870 --> 02:10:42,880
looks good now. All right, so you want
 

5685
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:45,030
looks good now. All right, so you want
to see price continue to auction higher

5686
02:10:45,030 --> 02:10:45,040
to see price continue to auction higher
 

5687
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:47,669
to see price continue to auction higher
now and you can see how this is all buy

5688
02:10:47,669 --> 02:10:47,679
now and you can see how this is all buy
 

5689
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:49,830
now and you can see how this is all buy
side. All right, these are stops. These

5690
02:10:49,830 --> 02:10:49,840
side. All right, these are stops. These
 

5691
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:51,750
side. All right, these are stops. These
are either either market buy order

5692
02:10:51,750 --> 02:10:51,760
are either either market buy order
 

5693
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:53,830
are either either market buy order
stops. All right, all their sell stops

5694
02:10:53,830 --> 02:10:53,840
stops. All right, all their sell stops
 

5695
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:55,589
stops. All right, all their sell stops
getting popped. And this is where smart

5696
02:10:55,589 --> 02:10:55,599
getting popped. And this is where smart
 

5697
02:10:55,599 --> 02:10:57,750
getting popped. And this is where smart
people trim their position and now hold

5698
02:10:57,750 --> 02:10:57,760
people trim their position and now hold
 

5699
02:10:57,760 --> 02:10:59,910
people trim their position and now hold
runners up into here. Hopefully like

5700
02:10:59,910 --> 02:10:59,920
runners up into here. Hopefully like
 

5701
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:01,830
runners up into here. Hopefully like
this is starting to make sense to you

5702
02:11:01,830 --> 02:11:01,840
this is starting to make sense to you
 

5703
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:05,030
this is starting to make sense to you
all, all you guys that are new.

02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:12,550
an education in liquidity here for free.
Doing my best to give you one anyway.

5710
02:11:12,550 --> 02:11:12,560
Doing my best to give you one anyway.
 

5711
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:13,910
Doing my best to give you one anyway.
All right. So, this is the target up

5712
02:11:13,910 --> 02:11:13,920
All right. So, this is the target up
 

5713
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:16,149
All right. So, this is the target up
here now.

5714
02:11:16,149 --> 02:11:16,159
here now.
 

5715
02:11:16,159 --> 02:11:17,589
here now.
This is what we were looking for earlier

5716
02:11:17,589 --> 02:11:17,599
This is what we were looking for earlier
 

5717
02:11:17,599 --> 02:11:19,030
This is what we were looking for earlier
today. The trade we took earlier today

5718
02:11:19,030 --> 02:11:19,040
today. The trade we took earlier today
 

5719
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:20,709
today. The trade we took earlier today
from here to here. We were holding those

5720
02:11:20,709 --> 02:11:20,719
from here to here. We were holding those
 

5721
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:22,229
from here to here. We were holding those
runners. It's the same trade, right?

5722
02:11:22,229 --> 02:11:22,239
runners. It's the same trade, right?
 

5723
02:11:22,239 --> 02:11:24,069
runners. It's the same trade, right?
We're looking to see if we can run these

5724
02:11:24,069 --> 02:11:24,079
We're looking to see if we can run these
 

5725
02:11:24,079 --> 02:11:25,830
We're looking to see if we can run these
stops to get expansion into here. It's

5726
02:11:25,830 --> 02:11:25,840
stops to get expansion into here. It's
 

5727
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:27,750
stops to get expansion into here. It's
exactly the same trade now, right? This

5728
02:11:27,750 --> 02:11:27,760
exactly the same trade now, right? This
 

5729
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:29,270
exactly the same trade now, right? This
is the same position. It's the same

5730
02:11:29,270 --> 02:11:29,280
is the same position. It's the same
 

5731
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:30,950
is the same position. It's the same
hold. It's the same thing. We're looking

5732
02:11:30,950 --> 02:11:30,960
hold. It's the same thing. We're looking
 

5733
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:33,350
hold. It's the same thing. We're looking
at the same levels for the same thing.

5734
02:11:33,350 --> 02:11:33,360
at the same levels for the same thing.
 

5735
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:35,430
at the same levels for the same thing.
Really nice. Here's the expansion.

5736
02:11:35,430 --> 02:11:35,440
Really nice. Here's the expansion.
 

5737
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:36,950
Really nice. Here's the expansion.
Right. I've be watching sort of 800

5738
02:11:36,950 --> 02:11:36,960
Right. I've be watching sort of 800
 

5739
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:38,950
Right. I've be watching sort of 800
whole numbers here. Uh we are have got

5740
02:11:38,950 --> 02:11:38,960
whole numbers here. Uh we are have got
 

5741
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:41,510
whole numbers here. Uh we are have got
some imbalances from yesterday. So, uh

5742
02:11:41,510 --> 02:11:41,520
some imbalances from yesterday. So, uh
 

5743
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:45,589
some imbalances from yesterday. So, uh
97 to 99 is one and 806es

5744
02:11:45,589 --> 02:11:45,599
97 to 99 is one and 806es
 

5745
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:48,069
97 to 99 is one and 806es
to 808 is another. And then value area

5746
02:11:48,069 --> 02:11:48,079
to 808 is another. And then value area
 

5747
02:11:48,079 --> 02:11:51,589
to 808 is another. And then value area
high.

5748
02:11:51,589 --> 02:11:51,599

 

5749
02:11:51,599 --> 02:11:54,709

Nice J source. There you go. There you

5750
02:11:54,709 --> 02:11:54,719
Nice J source. There you go. There you
 

5751
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:59,750
Nice J source. There you go. There you
go. Brisker with a W. Love it.

5752
02:11:59,750 --> 02:11:59,760
go. Brisker with a W. Love it.
 

5753
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:04,390
go. Brisker with a W. Love it.
Love it. Love it. Love it.

5754
02:12:04,390 --> 02:12:04,400

 

5755
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:05,830

Really nice. Hopefully that makes sense.

5756
02:12:05,830 --> 02:12:05,840
Really nice. Hopefully that makes sense.
 

5757
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:07,189
Really nice. Hopefully that makes sense.
I mean, does everyone understand what

5758
02:12:07,189 --> 02:12:07,199
I mean, does everyone understand what
 

5759
02:12:07,199 --> 02:12:09,830
I mean, does everyone understand what
we've just gone over?

5760
02:12:09,830 --> 02:12:09,840
we've just gone over?
 

5761
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:12,470
we've just gone over?
Do do you actually understand why the

5762
02:12:12,470 --> 02:12:12,480
Do do you actually understand why the
 

5763
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:13,990
Do do you actually understand why the
market moves the way it does? It's got

5764
02:12:13,990 --> 02:12:14,000
market moves the way it does? It's got
 

5765
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:15,910
market moves the way it does? It's got
nothing to do with an algorithm. That's

5766
02:12:15,910 --> 02:12:15,920
nothing to do with an algorithm. That's
 

5767
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:17,430
nothing to do with an algorithm. That's
not to say that algorithms are not in

5768
02:12:17,430 --> 02:12:17,440
not to say that algorithms are not in
 

5769
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:20,229
not to say that algorithms are not in
the market, but the way it moves, right?

5770
02:12:20,229 --> 02:12:20,239
the market, but the way it moves, right?
 

5771
02:12:20,239 --> 02:12:22,950
the market, but the way it moves, right?
The reason we use volume, the reason we

5772
02:12:22,950 --> 02:12:22,960
The reason we use volume, the reason we
 

5773
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:24,950
The reason we use volume, the reason we
use horizontal levels, the reason we

5774
02:12:24,950 --> 02:12:24,960
use horizontal levels, the reason we
 

5775
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:27,189
use horizontal levels, the reason we
have things like flags and all these

5776
02:12:27,189 --> 02:12:27,199
have things like flags and all these
 

5777
02:12:27,199 --> 02:12:29,350
have things like flags and all these
things is if you can understand the

5778
02:12:29,350 --> 02:12:29,360
things is if you can understand the
 

5779
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:31,669
things is if you can understand the
difference between the type of order

5780
02:12:31,669 --> 02:12:31,679
difference between the type of order
 

5781
02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:34,310
difference between the type of order
sitting at a level and understand what

5782
02:12:34,310 --> 02:12:34,320
sitting at a level and understand what
 

5783
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:36,229
sitting at a level and understand what
that looks like, you will start to be

5784
02:12:36,229 --> 02:12:36,239
that looks like, you will start to be
 

5785
02:12:36,239 --> 02:12:38,629
that looks like, you will start to be
able to build a narrative. If you, how

5786
02:12:38,629 --> 02:12:38,639
able to build a narrative. If you, how
 

5787
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:40,149
able to build a narrative. If you, how
can I put this? You need to create a

5788
02:12:40,149 --> 02:12:40,159
can I put this? You need to create a
 

5789
02:12:40,159 --> 02:12:42,790
can I put this? You need to create a
story of what is happening in the

5790
02:12:42,790 --> 02:12:42,800
story of what is happening in the
 

5791
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:45,270
story of what is happening in the
market. All right? And when we come to a

5792
02:12:45,270 --> 02:12:45,280
market. All right? And when we come to a
 

5793
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:48,229
market. All right? And when we come to a
junction like this, right? This is us.

5794
02:12:48,229 --> 02:12:48,239
junction like this, right? This is us.
 

5795
02:12:48,239 --> 02:12:49,990
junction like this, right? This is us.
We're about to turn the page here,

5796
02:12:49,990 --> 02:12:50,000
We're about to turn the page here,
 

5797
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,750
We're about to turn the page here,
right? So, what is likely to happen?

5798
02:12:51,750 --> 02:12:51,760
right? So, what is likely to happen?
 

5799
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:53,750
right? So, what is likely to happen?
Well, smart money will trim some

5800
02:12:53,750 --> 02:12:53,760
Well, smart money will trim some
 

5801
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:55,430
Well, smart money will trim some
position into here. Now, if they reload

5802
02:12:55,430 --> 02:12:55,440
position into here. Now, if they reload
 

5803
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:57,350
position into here. Now, if they reload
this, we're going to go here. This is a

5804
02:12:57,350 --> 02:12:57,360
this, we're going to go here. This is a
 

5805
02:12:57,360 --> 02:12:59,109
this, we're going to go here. This is a
look above and fail. Then, what I would

5806
02:12:59,109 --> 02:12:59,119
look above and fail. Then, what I would
 

5807
02:12:59,119 --> 02:13:01,910
look above and fail. Then, what I would
say is everyone who got long here sold

5808
02:13:01,910 --> 02:13:01,920
say is everyone who got long here sold
 

5809
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:04,069
say is everyone who got long here sold
into this. Then, we have breakout buyers

5810
02:13:04,069 --> 02:13:04,079
into this. Then, we have breakout buyers
 

5811
02:13:04,079 --> 02:13:06,069
into this. Then, we have breakout buyers
call and we come back under and we fade

5812
02:13:06,069 --> 02:13:06,079
call and we come back under and we fade
 

5813
02:13:06,079 --> 02:13:09,030
call and we come back under and we fade
back down. Right? So, we are building a

5814
02:13:09,030 --> 02:13:09,040
back down. Right? So, we are building a
 

5815
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:11,109
back down. Right? So, we are building a
narrative. So, if you hear me say this

5816
02:13:11,109 --> 02:13:11,119
narrative. So, if you hear me say this
 

5817
02:13:11,119 --> 02:13:12,790
narrative. So, if you hear me say this
is what I'm looking for here, but if we

5818
02:13:12,790 --> 02:13:12,800
is what I'm looking for here, but if we
 

5819
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:14,149
is what I'm looking for here, but if we
do this, this can happen. It's cuz

5820
02:13:14,149 --> 02:13:14,159
do this, this can happen. It's cuz
 

5821
02:13:14,159 --> 02:13:16,629
do this, this can happen. It's cuz
there's two sides of every trade

5822
02:13:16,629 --> 02:13:16,639
there's two sides of every trade
 

5823
02:13:16,639 --> 02:13:19,350
there's two sides of every trade
available, right? If they don't have

5824
02:13:19,350 --> 02:13:19,360
available, right? If they don't have
 

5825
02:13:19,360 --> 02:13:22,390
available, right? If they don't have
enough shorts caught yet to get up here,

5826
02:13:22,390 --> 02:13:22,400
enough shorts caught yet to get up here,
 

5827
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:24,790
enough shorts caught yet to get up here,
then this is possible, right? It's

5828
02:13:24,790 --> 02:13:24,800
then this is possible, right? It's
 

5829
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:26,790
then this is possible, right? It's
possible. Doesn't mean it has to happen.

5830
02:13:26,790 --> 02:13:26,800
possible. Doesn't mean it has to happen.
 

5831
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:28,069
possible. Doesn't mean it has to happen.
If they've got enough caught and they're

5832
02:13:28,069 --> 02:13:28,079
If they've got enough caught and they're
 

5833
02:13:28,079 --> 02:13:29,430
If they've got enough caught and they're
like, "Fuck this. We're going higher.

5834
02:13:29,430 --> 02:13:29,440
like, "Fuck this. We're going higher.
 

5835
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:31,109
like, "Fuck this. We're going higher.
We've just done the damage." Then this

5836
02:13:31,109 --> 02:13:31,119
We've just done the damage." Then this
 

5837
02:13:31,119 --> 02:13:33,189
We've just done the damage." Then this
is the move. There's always two things

5838
02:13:33,189 --> 02:13:33,199
is the move. There's always two things
 

5839
02:13:33,199 --> 02:13:34,950
is the move. There's always two things
possible. If everyone tells you this is

5840
02:13:34,950 --> 02:13:34,960
possible. If everyone tells you this is
 

5841
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:37,350
possible. If everyone tells you this is
100% happening, they're wrong.

5842
02:13:37,350 --> 02:13:37,360
100% happening, they're wrong.
 

5843
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:46,149
100% happening, they're wrong.
Absolutely wrong. [snorts]

5844
02:13:46,149 --> 02:13:46,159

 

5845
02:13:46,159 --> 02:13:47,990

Awesome. That's great, Tim. Glad I'm

5846
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:48,000

If you want to take on some risk, are

5856
02:14:04,229 --> 02:14:04,239
If you want to take on some risk, are
 

5857
02:14:04,239 --> 02:14:05,910
If you want to take on some risk, are
newer and want to actually trade live

5858

newer and want to actually trade live

Really good. All right. Back to this

5890
02:14:54,790 --> 02:14:54,800
Really good. All right. Back to this
 

5891
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:57,669
Really good. All right. Back to this
sort of gray box in IB. So, if we're

5892
02:14:57,669 --> 02:14:57,679
sort of gray box in IB. So, if we're
 

5893
02:14:57,679 --> 02:14:59,510
sort of gray box in IB. So, if we're
going to see expansion, you would want

5894
02:14:59,510 --> 02:14:59,520
going to see expansion, you would want
 

5895
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:01,189
going to see expansion, you would want
to see them hold this. All right. If

5896
02:15:01,189 --> 02:15:01,199
to see them hold this. All right. If
 

5897
02:15:01,199 --> 02:15:03,030
to see them hold this. All right. If
they don't hold this, the rotation is

5898
02:15:03,030 --> 02:15:03,040
they don't hold this, the rotation is
 

5899
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:04,470
they don't hold this, the rotation is
back down to where? Well, we have a

5900
02:15:04,470 --> 02:15:04,480
back down to where? Well, we have a
 

5901
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:06,950
back down to where? Well, we have a
little shelf here. This can still do

5902
02:15:06,950 --> 02:15:06,960
little shelf here. This can still do
 

5903
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:08,709
little shelf here. This can still do
this. It's possible to do that. It's not

5904
02:15:08,709 --> 02:15:08,719
this. It's possible to do that. It's not
 

5905
02:15:08,719 --> 02:15:10,470
this. It's possible to do that. It's not
ideal, but it's definitely possible. We

5906
02:15:10,470 --> 02:15:10,480
ideal, but it's definitely possible. We
 

5907
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:12,550
ideal, but it's definitely possible. We
have a lot of stops here. Really, a sign

5908
02:15:12,550 --> 02:15:12,560
have a lot of stops here. Really, a sign
 

5909
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:13,990
have a lot of stops here. Really, a sign
of strength would be this.

5910
02:15:13,990 --> 02:15:14,000
of strength would be this.
 

5911
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,830
of strength would be this.
Alternatively, it would be this. What

5912
02:15:15,830 --> 02:15:15,840
Alternatively, it would be this. What
 

5913
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:18,149
Alternatively, it would be this. What
you would not want to see is this. Now,

5914
02:15:18,149 --> 02:15:18,159
you would not want to see is this. Now,

really helped me trade. I usually trade
 

5979
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:43,669
really helped me trade. I usually trade
the same on stocks, finding traps where

5980
02:16:43,669 --> 02:16:43,679
the same on stocks, finding traps where
 

5981
02:16:43,679 --> 02:16:45,270
the same on stocks, finding traps where
mainly shorts are trapped and would be

5982
02:16:45,270 --> 02:16:45,280
mainly shorts are trapped and would be
 

5983
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:47,270
mainly shorts are trapped and would be
covering. Can I use your indicator on

5984
02:16:47,270 --> 02:16:47,280
covering. Can I use your indicator on
 

5985
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:48,629
covering. Can I use your indicator on
stocks? Yeah, it will work on anything.

5986
02:16:48,629 --> 02:16:48,639
stocks? Yeah, it will work on anything.
 

5987
02:16:48,639 --> 02:16:50,389
stocks? Yeah, it will work on anything.
All right. All my indicator is the only

5988
02:16:50,389 --> 02:16:50,399
All right. All my indicator is the only
 

5989
02:16:50,399 --> 02:16:52,230
All right. All my indicator is the only
thing that it won't work on is the

5990
02:16:52,230 --> 02:16:52,240
thing that it won't work on is the
 

5991
02:16:52,240 --> 02:16:53,990
thing that it won't work on is the
GlobeEx positions, right? But it will

5992
02:16:53,990 --> 02:16:54,000
GlobeEx positions, right? But it will
 

5993
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,990
GlobeEx positions, right? But it will
give you pre-market. All right. So,

5994
02:16:55,990 --> 02:16:56,000
give you pre-market. All right. So,
 

5995
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,790
give you pre-market. All right. So,
these orange lines, not this line, this

5996
02:16:58,790 --> 02:16:58,800
these orange lines, not this line, this
 

5997
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:00,150
these orange lines, not this line, this
is the higher time frame algo, but the

5998
02:17:00,150 --> 02:17:00,160
is the higher time frame algo, but the
 

5999
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:01,750
is the higher time frame algo, but the
horizontal ones are GlobeEx. But yeah,

6000
02:17:01,750 --> 02:17:01,760
horizontal ones are GlobeEx. But yeah,
 

6001
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:03,830
horizontal ones are GlobeEx. But yeah,
it will work on stocks. I use it on

6002
02:17:03,830 --> 02:17:03,840
it will work on stocks. I use it on
 

6003
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:17,830
it will work on stocks. I use it on
stocks myself.

6004
02:17:17,830 --> 02:17:17,840

 

6005
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:20,070

Yes, trade on tilt to totally there is

6006
02:17:20,070 --> 02:17:20,080
Yes, trade on tilt to totally there is
 

6007
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:22,150
Yes, trade on tilt to totally there is
zero chance all tickers run without

6008
02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:22,160
zero chance all tickers run without
 

6009
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:23,830
zero chance all tickers run without
being computer driven. There is not

6010
02:17:23,830 --> 02:17:23,840
being computer driven. There is not
 

6011
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:25,509
being computer driven. There is not
enough manpower for Black Rockck to

6012
02:17:25,509 --> 02:17:25,519
enough manpower for Black Rockck to
 

6013
02:17:25,519 --> 02:17:27,830
enough manpower for Black Rockck to
handle all all stocks. Yeah, I agree.

6014
02:17:27,830 --> 02:17:27,840
handle all all stocks. Yeah, I agree.
 

6015
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:30,389
handle all all stocks. Yeah, I agree.
Like I said, there are plenty of alos in

6016
02:17:30,389 --> 02:17:30,399
Like I said, there are plenty of alos in
 

6017
02:17:30,399 --> 02:17:32,309
Like I said, there are plenty of alos in
the market. There's just not one algo

6018
02:17:32,309 --> 02:17:32,319
the market. There's just not one algo
 

6019
02:17:32,319 --> 02:17:34,790
the market. There's just not one algo
dictating everything. That is just a way

6020
02:17:34,790 --> 02:17:34,800
dictating everything. That is just a way
 

6021
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:36,309
dictating everything. That is just a way
of looking at the market. It's not

6022
02:17:36,309 --> 02:17:36,319
of looking at the market. It's not
 

6023
02:17:36,319 --> 02:17:40,709
of looking at the market. It's not
reality

6024
02:17:40,709 --> 02:17:40,719

 

6025
02:17:40,719 --> 02:17:42,389

to be honest. Mate, already made 380

6026
02:17:42,389 --> 02:17:42,399
to be honest. Mate, already made 380
 

6027
02:17:42,399 --> 02:17:43,669
to be honest. Mate, already made 380
just trying to see if I can get any

6028
02:17:43,669 --> 02:17:43,679
just trying to see if I can get any
 

6029
02:17:43,679 --> 02:17:45,589
just trying to see if I can get any
more. Yeah, don't try and squeeze I

6030
02:17:45,589 --> 02:17:45,599
more. Yeah, don't try and squeeze I
 

6031
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:46,870
more. Yeah, don't try and squeeze I
don't know what's been said above. I

6032
02:17:46,870 --> 02:17:46,880
don't know what's been said above. I
 

6033
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:48,870
don't know what's been said above. I
probably missed stuff, but don't try and

6034
02:17:48,870 --> 02:17:48,880
probably missed stuff, but don't try and
 

6035
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:51,589
probably missed stuff, but don't try and
squeeze more out of stuff if you're uh

6036
02:17:51,589 --> 02:17:51,599
squeeze more out of stuff if you're uh
 

6037
02:17:51,599 --> 02:17:52,950
squeeze more out of stuff if you're uh
if you're chasing. I don't I don't know

6038
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:52,960
if you're chasing. I don't I don't know
 

6039
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:54,230
if you're chasing. I don't I don't know
what you've said. I've clearly missed

6040
02:17:54,230 --> 02:17:54,240
what you've said. I've clearly missed
 

6041
02:17:54,240 --> 02:18:00,709
what you've said. I've clearly missed
some messages.

6042
02:18:00,709 --> 02:18:00,719

 

6043
02:18:00,719 --> 02:18:01,990

hoping it continues up. I mean, it still

6044
02:18:01,990 --> 02:18:02,000
hoping it continues up. I mean, it still
 

6045
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,070
hoping it continues up. I mean, it still
looks good. Pullbacks are still holding.

6046
02:18:04,070 --> 02:18:04,080
looks good. Pullbacks are still holding.
 

6047
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:05,429
looks good. Pullbacks are still holding.
All right, you're still you're just at

6048
02:18:05,429 --> 02:18:05,439
All right, you're still you're just at
 

6049
02:18:05,439 --> 02:18:07,349
All right, you're still you're just at
IB. You're at this little gray nugget

6050
02:18:07,349 --> 02:18:07,359
IB. You're at this little gray nugget
 

6051
02:18:07,359 --> 02:18:09,190
IB. You're at this little gray nugget
here. I mean, it's possible it comes

6052
02:18:09,190 --> 02:18:09,200
here. I mean, it's possible it comes
 

6053
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:10,469
here. I mean, it's possible it comes
down here. It would not be ideal, but

6054
02:18:10,469 --> 02:18:10,479
down here. It would not be ideal, but
 

6055
02:18:10,479 --> 02:18:12,150
down here. It would not be ideal, but
it's very possible. But as long as they

6056
02:18:12,150 --> 02:18:12,160
it's very possible. But as long as they
 

6057
02:18:12,160 --> 02:18:14,309
it's very possible. But as long as they
hold somewhere around here, if you think

6058
02:18:14,309 --> 02:18:14,319
hold somewhere around here, if you think
 

6059
02:18:14,319 --> 02:18:17,990
hold somewhere around here, if you think
about the swing pivot,

6060
02:18:17,990 --> 02:18:18,000

 

6061
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:22,709

right? And if we think about multi-day,

6062
02:18:22,709 --> 02:18:22,719

 

6063
02:18:22,719 --> 02:18:24,389

right, there's your pivot, right? You

6064
02:18:24,389 --> 02:18:24,399
right, there's your pivot, right? You
 

6065
02:18:24,399 --> 02:18:27,190
right, there's your pivot, right? You
want it to hold there. Worst case here.

6066
02:18:27,190 --> 02:18:27,200
want it to hold there. Worst case here.
 

6067
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:28,709
want it to hold there. Worst case here.
You want it to hold somewhere in this

6068
02:18:28,709 --> 02:18:28,719
You want it to hold somewhere in this
 

6069
02:18:28,719 --> 02:18:38,070
You want it to hold somewhere in this
range and then to complete this move.

6070
02:18:38,070 --> 02:18:38,080

 

6071
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:39,669

I certainly wouldn't be looking short

6072
02:18:39,669 --> 02:18:39,679
I certainly wouldn't be looking short
 

6073
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:42,515
I certainly wouldn't be looking short
right now. Personally,

6074
02:18:42,515 --> 02:18:42,525
right now. Personally,
 

6075
02:18:42,525 --> 02:18:49,270
right now. Personally,
[snorts]

6076
02:18:49,270 --> 02:18:49,280

 

6077
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:52,309

what value do you have as your IB highQ?

6078
02:18:52,309 --> 02:18:52,319
what value do you have as your IB highQ?
 

6079
02:18:52,319 --> 02:18:53,750
what value do you have as your IB highQ?
What you mean? What price is the IB

6080
02:18:53,750 --> 02:18:53,760
What you mean? What price is the IB
 

6081
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:55,830
What you mean? What price is the IB
high?

6082
02:18:55,830 --> 02:18:55,840
high?
 

6083
02:18:55,840 --> 02:19:03,589
high?
Uh 775.

6084
02:19:03,589 --> 02:19:03,599

 

6085
02:19:03,599 --> 02:19:09,030

I know CB. I know. [laughter]

6086
02:19:09,030 --> 02:19:09,040

 

6087
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:11,830

There you go. That's awesome. Made $85.

6088
02:19:11,830 --> 02:19:11,840
There you go. That's awesome. Made $85.
 

6089
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:14,309
There you go. That's awesome. Made $85.
Extremely happy because it's not the

6090
02:19:14,309 --> 02:19:14,319
Extremely happy because it's not the
 

6091
02:19:14,319 --> 02:19:16,549
Extremely happy because it's not the
money, but the strategy I was able to

6092
02:19:16,549 --> 02:19:16,559
money, but the strategy I was able to
 

6093
02:19:16,559 --> 02:19:18,709
money, but the strategy I was able to
use. Thank you. That's it. Once you

6094
02:19:18,709 --> 02:19:18,719
use. Thank you. That's it. Once you
 

6095
02:19:18,719 --> 02:19:21,509
use. Thank you. That's it. Once you
start focusing less on the finance and

6096
02:19:21,509 --> 02:19:21,519
start focusing less on the finance and
 

6097
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:24,549
start focusing less on the finance and
more on your strategy, refine the

6098
02:19:24,549 --> 02:19:24,559
more on your strategy, refine the
 

6099
02:19:24,559 --> 02:19:26,709
more on your strategy, refine the
strategy. Stick to the strategy. If you

6100
02:19:26,709 --> 02:19:26,719
strategy. Stick to the strategy. If you
 

6101
02:19:26,719 --> 02:19:29,190
strategy. Stick to the strategy. If you
know you've got strategy which wins

6102
02:19:29,190 --> 02:19:29,200
know you've got strategy which wins
 

6103
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:31,349
know you've got strategy which wins
multiple times, if you're willing to be

6104
02:19:31,349 --> 02:19:31,359
multiple times, if you're willing to be
 

6105
02:19:31,359 --> 02:19:33,990
multiple times, if you're willing to be
patient, you will start seeing success.

6106
02:19:33,990 --> 02:19:34,000
patient, you will start seeing success.
 

6107
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,309
patient, you will start seeing success.
Success. Can't talk. Still holding this

6108
02:19:36,309 --> 02:19:36,319
Success. Can't talk. Still holding this
 

6109
02:19:36,319 --> 02:19:38,150
Success. Can't talk. Still holding this
in balance. Still looks okay right now,

6110
02:19:38,150 --> 02:19:38,160
in balance. Still looks okay right now,
 

6111
02:19:38,160 --> 02:19:43,349
in balance. Still looks okay right now,
I'd say. Still looks okay.

6112
02:19:43,349 --> 02:19:43,359

 

6113
02:19:43,359 --> 02:19:56,389

Yes. Not quite as pretty.

6114
02:19:56,389 --> 02:19:56,399

 

6115
02:19:56,399 --> 02:19:58,469

Can I use trend friends to help me

6116
02:19:58,469 --> 02:19:58,479
Can I use trend friends to help me
 

6117
02:19:58,479 --> 02:20:00,389
Can I use trend friends to help me
identify market sentiment before I place

6118
02:20:00,389 --> 02:20:00,399
identify market sentiment before I place
 

6119
02:20:00,399 --> 02:20:03,590
identify market sentiment before I place
a trade to check if I'm aligned with the

6120
02:20:03,590 --> 02:20:03,600
a trade to check if I'm aligned with the
 

6121
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:05,510
a trade to check if I'm aligned with the
trend or going against? Yeah, you could.

6122
02:20:05,510 --> 02:20:05,520
trend or going against? Yeah, you could.
 

6123
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:08,469
trend or going against? Yeah, you could.
Like, look, trend friends here, right?

6124
02:20:08,469 --> 02:20:08,479
Like, look, trend friends here, right?
 

6125
02:20:08,479 --> 02:20:10,070
Like, look, trend friends here, right?
So, your lower time frames today have

6126
02:20:10,070 --> 02:20:10,080
So, your lower time frames today have
 

6127
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:11,270
So, your lower time frames today have
been neutral, but your higher time

6128
02:20:11,270 --> 02:20:11,280
been neutral, but your higher time
 

6129
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:13,750
been neutral, but your higher time
frames have been bullish, right? But I

6130
02:20:13,750 --> 02:20:13,760
frames have been bullish, right? But I
 

6131
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:15,750
frames have been bullish, right? But I
wouldn't use it solely alone. But what

6132
02:20:15,750 --> 02:20:15,760
wouldn't use it solely alone. But what
 

6133
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:18,150
wouldn't use it solely alone. But what
do we look for? All right. Who did the

6134
02:20:18,150 --> 02:20:18,160
do we look for? All right. Who did the
 

6135
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:20,469
do we look for? All right. Who did the
video at the weekend? Right? What's

6136
02:20:20,469 --> 02:20:20,479
video at the weekend? Right? What's
 

6137
02:20:20,479 --> 02:20:23,510
video at the weekend? Right? What's
this? Mr. 200. What's this Mr. 20? Where

6138
02:20:23,510 --> 02:20:23,520
this? Mr. 200. What's this Mr. 20? Where
 

6139
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:25,910
this? Mr. 200. What's this Mr. 20? Where
do we see acceleration once we get

6140
02:20:25,910 --> 02:20:25,920
do we see acceleration once we get
 

6141
02:20:25,920 --> 02:20:28,070
do we see acceleration once we get
outside of this? Right? Why? Because

6142
02:20:28,070 --> 02:20:28,080
outside of this? Right? Why? Because
 

6143
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:30,710
outside of this? Right? Why? Because
this is basically your hour. That's your

6144
02:20:30,710 --> 02:20:30,720
this is basically your hour. That's your
 

6145
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:33,670
this is basically your hour. That's your
hourly pivot. Boom. Right. Went over it

6146
02:20:33,670 --> 02:20:33,680
hourly pivot. Boom. Right. Went over it
 

6147
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:35,270
hourly pivot. Boom. Right. Went over it
in the free video at the weekend. If you

6148
02:20:35,270 --> 02:20:35,280
in the free video at the weekend. If you
 

6149
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:36,870
in the free video at the weekend. If you
move down to lower time frame would have

6150
02:20:36,870 --> 02:20:36,880
move down to lower time frame would have
 

6151
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:38,790
move down to lower time frame would have
given you more opportunities quite

6152
02:20:38,790 --> 02:20:38,800
given you more opportunities quite
 

6153
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:40,389
given you more opportunities quite
possibly.

6154
02:20:40,389 --> 02:20:40,399
possibly.
 

6155
02:20:40,399 --> 02:20:44,230
possibly.
Same kind of area reclaim

6156
02:20:44,230 --> 02:20:44,240
Same kind of area reclaim
 

6157
02:20:44,240 --> 02:20:46,070
Same kind of area reclaim
in low volume. All right. So I wouldn't

6158
02:20:46,070 --> 02:20:46,080
in low volume. All right. So I wouldn't
 

6159
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:49,510
in low volume. All right. So I wouldn't
rely on one sole thing you especially if

6160
02:20:49,510 --> 02:20:49,520
rely on one sole thing you especially if
 

6161
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:53,349
rely on one sole thing you especially if
it's an indicator but does it provide uh

6162
02:20:53,349 --> 02:20:53,359
it's an indicator but does it provide uh
 

6163
02:20:53,359 --> 02:20:55,030
it's an indicator but does it provide uh
you know areas of incentive to help you

6164
02:20:55,030 --> 02:20:55,040
you know areas of incentive to help you
 

6165
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:56,630
you know areas of incentive to help you
even if you played this inside bar. Look

6166
02:20:56,630 --> 02:20:56,640
even if you played this inside bar. Look
 

6167
02:20:56,640 --> 02:20:58,070
even if you played this inside bar. Look
at the inside bar build. There's your

6168
02:20:58,070 --> 02:20:58,080
at the inside bar build. There's your
 

6169
02:20:58,080 --> 02:20:59,830
at the inside bar build. There's your
white bar. There's the green arrow for

6170
02:20:59,830 --> 02:20:59,840
white bar. There's the green arrow for

and firms and I I still trade QQQ. It's
 

6307
02:26:48,640 --> 02:27:10,469
and firms and I I still trade QQQ. It's
just more swing.

6308
02:27:10,469 --> 02:27:10,479

 

6309
02:27:10,479 --> 02:27:14,550

What's happening in the market? Okay,

6312
02:27:15,750 --> 02:27:15,760
What's happening in the market? Okay,
 

6313
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:17,190
What's happening in the market? Okay,
pulling back to that value area high.

6314
02:27:17,190 --> 02:27:17,200
pulling back to that value area high.
 

6315
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:19,349
pulling back to that value area high.
So, it didn't continue, right? So,

6316
02:27:19,349 --> 02:27:19,359
So, it didn't continue, right? So,
 

6317
02:27:19,359 --> 02:27:21,590
So, it didn't continue, right? So,
failed to hold this uh gray box. So,

6318
02:27:21,590 --> 02:27:21,600
failed to hold this uh gray box. So,
 

6319
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:23,750
failed to hold this uh gray box. So,
this is the move back down to value. If

6320
02:27:23,750 --> 02:27:23,760
this is the move back down to value. If
 

6321
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:25,030
this is the move back down to value. If
they lose this down to here, if they

6322
02:27:25,030 --> 02:27:25,040
they lose this down to here, if they
 

6323
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:26,950
they lose this down to here, if they
lose all of that all the way down,

6324
02:27:26,950 --> 02:27:26,960
lose all of that all the way down,
 

6325
02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:28,950
lose all of that all the way down,
right? So, the rotation continues. It's

6326
02:27:28,950 --> 02:27:28,960
right? So, the rotation continues. It's
 

6327
02:27:28,960 --> 02:27:31,830
right? So, the rotation continues. It's
unfortunate. never was able to hold for

6328
02:27:31,830 --> 02:27:31,840
unfortunate. never was able to hold for
 

6329
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:33,750
unfortunate. never was able to hold for
that pivot, but it gave a good move up

6330
02:27:33,750 --> 02:27:33,760
that pivot, but it gave a good move up
 

6331
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:36,550
that pivot, but it gave a good move up
from here to here and from here to here.

6332
02:27:36,550 --> 02:27:36,560
from here to here and from here to here.
 

6333
02:27:36,560 --> 02:27:38,309
from here to here and from here to here.
All right. And we still remain inside

6334
02:27:38,309 --> 02:27:38,319
All right. And we still remain inside
 

6335
02:27:38,319 --> 02:27:42,150
All right. And we still remain inside
the previous week's value.

6336
02:27:42,150 --> 02:27:42,160

 

6337
02:27:42,160 --> 02:28:57,750

6357
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:30,469

I wanted to check this fib for this

6358
02:29:30,469 --> 02:29:30,479
I wanted to check this fib for this
 

6359
02:29:30,479 --> 02:29:31,830
I wanted to check this fib for this
runup. Would you anchor to the very

6360
02:29:31,830 --> 02:29:31,840
runup. Would you anchor to the very
 

6361
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:33,670
runup. Would you anchor to the very
bottom value area low the current

6362
02:29:33,670 --> 02:29:33,680
bottom value area low the current
 

6363
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:36,710
bottom value area low the current
session value higher small swing? Uh Mo,

6364
02:29:36,710 --> 02:29:36,720
session value higher small swing? Uh Mo,
 

6365
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:38,950
session value higher small swing? Uh Mo,
it depends what I'm looking to trade.

6366
02:29:38,950 --> 02:29:38,960
it depends what I'm looking to trade.
 

6367
02:29:38,960 --> 02:29:41,429
it depends what I'm looking to trade.
Right. So, if I was looking at this

6368
02:29:41,429 --> 02:29:41,439
Right. So, if I was looking at this
 

6369
02:29:41,439 --> 02:29:44,070
Right. So, if I was looking at this
current extension, right, I'd go from

6370
02:29:44,070 --> 02:29:44,080
current extension, right, I'd go from
 

6371
02:29:44,080 --> 02:29:45,750
current extension, right, I'd go from
here to here. Or if you were looking for

6372
02:29:45,750 --> 02:29:45,760
here to here. Or if you were looking for
 

6373
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:47,750
here to here. Or if you were looking for
this pullback now, I'd I'd just be going

6374
02:29:47,750 --> 02:29:47,760
this pullback now, I'd I'd just be going
 

6375
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:50,230
this pullback now, I'd I'd just be going
from here, from this swing point. All

6376
02:29:50,230 --> 02:29:50,240
from here, from this swing point. All
 

6377
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:52,790
from here, from this swing point. All
right, so back down to here. If you were

6378
02:29:52,790 --> 02:29:52,800
right, so back down to here. If you were
 

6379
02:29:52,800 --> 02:29:54,550
right, so back down to here. If you were
looking beyond that, if you were zoomed

6380
02:29:54,550 --> 02:29:54,560
looking beyond that, if you were zoomed
 

6381
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:56,790
looking beyond that, if you were zoomed
out,

6382
02:29:56,790 --> 02:29:56,800
out,
 

6383
02:29:56,800 --> 02:30:00,230
out,
we'd be thinking from this high

6384
02:30:00,230 --> 02:30:00,240
we'd be thinking from this high
 

6385
02:30:00,240 --> 02:30:02,469
we'd be thinking from this high
to here,

6386
02:30:02,469 --> 02:30:02,479
to here,
 

6387
02:30:02,479 --> 02:30:04,309
to here,
and we just got stuck in sort sort of

6388
02:30:04,309 --> 02:30:04,319
and we just got stuck in sort sort of
 

6389
02:30:04,319 --> 02:30:06,070
and we just got stuck in sort sort of
this golden zone. So, at the moment,

6390
02:30:06,070 --> 02:30:06,080
this golden zone. So, at the moment,
 

6391
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:07,910
this golden zone. So, at the moment,
like we're just nothing more than a

6392
02:30:07,910 --> 02:30:07,920
like we're just nothing more than a
 

6393
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:10,469
like we're just nothing more than a
rotation. Um buyers did have the chance

6394
02:30:10,469 --> 02:30:10,479
rotation. Um buyers did have the chance
 

6395
02:30:10,479 --> 02:30:13,429
rotation. Um buyers did have the chance
there to come in. They had the chance up

6396
02:30:13,429 --> 02:30:13,439
there to come in. They had the chance up
 

6397
02:30:13,439 --> 02:30:15,270
there to come in. They had the chance up
here to really cause a resqueeze. So

6398
02:30:15,270 --> 02:30:15,280
here to really cause a resqueeze. So
 

6399
02:30:15,280 --> 02:30:17,830
here to really cause a resqueeze. So
there's one big leg up.

6400
02:30:17,830 --> 02:30:17,840
there's one big leg up.
 

6401
02:30:17,840 --> 02:30:19,750
there's one big leg up.
This is still a pullback. Question is

6402
02:30:19,750 --> 02:30:19,760
This is still a pullback. Question is
 

6403
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:21,270
This is still a pullback. Question is
where do they hold this? They should

6404
02:30:21,270 --> 02:30:21,280
where do they hold this? They should
 

6405
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:22,950
where do they hold this? They should
they can hold here. They failed to hold

6406
02:30:22,950 --> 02:30:22,960
they can hold here. They failed to hold
 

6407
02:30:22,960 --> 02:30:24,550
they can hold here. They failed to hold
here. They failed to hold here. It's

6408
02:30:24,550 --> 02:30:24,560
here. They failed to hold here. It's
 

6409
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:26,550
here. They failed to hold here. It's
quite drastic. Maybe they offer this

6410
02:30:26,550 --> 02:30:26,560
quite drastic. Maybe they offer this
 

6411
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:28,309
quite drastic. Maybe they offer this
later. Maybe they save that for next

6412
02:30:28,309 --> 02:30:28,319
later. Maybe they save that for next
 

6413
02:30:28,319 --> 02:30:30,550
later. Maybe they save that for next
week. I don't know. [snorts]

6414
02:30:30,550 --> 02:30:30,560
week. I don't know. [snorts]
 

6415
02:30:30,560 --> 02:30:33,830
week. I don't know. [snorts]
But there is a big shelf down here where

6416
02:30:33,830 --> 02:30:33,840
But there is a big shelf down here where
 

6417
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:35,670
But there is a big shelf down here where
we broke out from. Right. So leaving

6418
02:30:35,670 --> 02:30:35,680
we broke out from. Right. So leaving
 

6419
02:30:35,680 --> 02:30:37,190
we broke out from. Right. So leaving
this. Remember it's these short sellers

6420
02:30:37,190 --> 02:30:37,200
this. Remember it's these short sellers
 

6421
02:30:37,200 --> 02:30:39,349
this. Remember it's these short sellers
here that caused this move. Buyers then

6422
02:30:39,349 --> 02:30:39,359
here that caused this move. Buyers then
 

6423
02:30:39,359 --> 02:30:42,150
here that caused this move. Buyers then
came in completed part one squeeze

6424
02:30:42,150 --> 02:30:42,160
came in completed part one squeeze
 

6425
02:30:42,160 --> 02:30:43,830
came in completed part one squeeze
above. Remember we talked about the pair

6426
02:30:43,830 --> 02:30:43,840
above. Remember we talked about the pair
 

6427
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:46,550
above. Remember we talked about the pair
off like 10k for example pairing off. If

6428
02:30:46,550 --> 02:30:46,560
off like 10k for example pairing off. If
 

6429
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:47,830
off like 10k for example pairing off. If
you were buying here and you wanted to

6430
02:30:47,830 --> 02:30:47,840
you were buying here and you wanted to
 

6431
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:49,510
you were buying here and you wanted to
sell into this this is the squeeze to

6432
02:30:49,510 --> 02:30:49,520
sell into this this is the squeeze to
 

6433
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:51,190
sell into this this is the squeeze to
sell into. They would have held runners

6434
02:30:51,190 --> 02:30:51,200
sell into. They would have held runners
 

6435
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:52,790
sell into. They would have held runners
for this move here. Same as I did from

6436
02:30:52,790 --> 02:30:52,800
for this move here. Same as I did from
 

6437
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:54,630
for this move here. Same as I did from
here to here holding runners. They don't

6438
02:30:54,630 --> 02:30:54,640
here to here holding runners. They don't
 

6439
02:30:54,640 --> 02:30:56,550
here to here holding runners. They don't
get that way. Right. So the question is

6440
02:30:56,550 --> 02:30:56,560
get that way. Right. So the question is
 

6441
02:30:56,560 --> 02:30:58,389
get that way. Right. So the question is
is there an area of value which they

6442
02:30:58,389 --> 02:30:58,399
is there an area of value which they
 

6443
02:30:58,399 --> 02:31:00,550
is there an area of value which they
rebid and try another attempt at it or

6444
02:31:00,550 --> 02:31:00,560
rebid and try another attempt at it or
 

6445
02:31:00,560 --> 02:31:02,630
rebid and try another attempt at it or
not? The problem that you've now got is

6446
02:31:02,630 --> 02:31:02,640
not? The problem that you've now got is
 

6447
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:04,950
not? The problem that you've now got is
you need to obey structure and shelves.

6448
02:31:04,950 --> 02:31:04,960
you need to obey structure and shelves.
 

6449
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:08,070
you need to obey structure and shelves.
All right. So you have these volume

6450
02:31:08,070 --> 02:31:08,080
All right. So you have these volume
 

6451
02:31:08,080 --> 02:31:10,309
All right. So you have these volume
nuggets little here now. So the question

6452
02:31:10,309 --> 02:31:10,319
nuggets little here now. So the question
 

6453
02:31:10,319 --> 02:31:13,990
nuggets little here now. So the question
is if buyers cannot reclaim all right

6454
02:31:13,990 --> 02:31:14,000
is if buyers cannot reclaim all right
 

6455
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,150
is if buyers cannot reclaim all right
sellers can come back in and sell this

6456
02:31:16,150 --> 02:31:16,160
sellers can come back in and sell this
 

6457
02:31:16,160 --> 02:31:18,550
sellers can come back in and sell this
and try and get back down to this low.

6458
02:31:18,550 --> 02:31:18,560
and try and get back down to this low.
 

6459
02:31:18,560 --> 02:31:21,030
and try and get back down to this low.
It's possible if we get no acceptance

6460
02:31:21,030 --> 02:31:21,040
It's possible if we get no acceptance
 

6461
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:22,630
It's possible if we get no acceptance
here. So if you get a look above in in

6462
02:31:22,630 --> 02:31:22,640
here. So if you get a look above in in
 

6463
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:26,389
here. So if you get a look above in in
in this is possible to repric this. You

6464
02:31:26,389 --> 02:31:26,399
in this is possible to repric this. You
 

6465
02:31:26,399 --> 02:31:27,910
in this is possible to repric this. You
have to be aware to be able to take

6466
02:31:27,910 --> 02:31:27,920
have to be aware to be able to take
 

6467
02:31:27,920 --> 02:31:29,429
have to be aware to be able to take
every side of the tape when we're in

6468
02:31:29,429 --> 02:31:29,439
every side of the tape when we're in
 

6469
02:31:29,439 --> 02:31:31,349
every side of the tape when we're in
rotational markets. Can't be too

6470
02:31:31,349 --> 02:31:31,359
rotational markets. Can't be too
 

6471
02:31:31,359 --> 02:31:34,115
rotational markets. Can't be too
bullish, too trend driven.

6472
02:31:34,115 --> 02:31:34,125
bullish, too trend driven.
 

6473
02:31:34,125 --> 02:31:35,190
bullish, too trend driven.

03:01:06,080 --> 03:01:07,990
the data they present shown real
outcomes of thousands of day trades

7432
03:01:07,990 --> 03:01:08,000
outcomes of thousands of day trades
 

7433
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:11,030
outcomes of thousands of day trades
across long periods of time. Probably be

7434
03:01:11,030 --> 03:01:11,040
across long periods of time. Probably be
 

7435
03:01:11,040 --> 03:01:13,030
across long periods of time. Probably be
a bit shocked at the evidence data that

7436
03:01:13,030 --> 03:01:13,040
a bit shocked at the evidence data that
 

7437
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:14,870
a bit shocked at the evidence data that
all scalping is random. The outcomes

7438
03:01:14,870 --> 03:01:14,880
all scalping is random. The outcomes
 

7439
03:01:14,880 --> 03:01:16,630
all scalping is random. The outcomes
show everyone here gets totally random

7440
03:01:16,630 --> 03:01:16,640
show everyone here gets totally random
 

7441
03:01:16,640 --> 03:01:18,070
show everyone here gets totally random
outcomes. I think that's [\h__\h]

7442
03:01:18,070 --> 03:01:18,080
outcomes. I think that's [\h__\h]
 

7443

[\h__\h] I think that I think that's

7444
03:01:20,309 --> 03:01:20,319
[\h__\h] I think that I think that's
 

7445
03:01:20,319 --> 03:01:22,309
[\h__\h] I think that I think that's
bollocks.

7446
03:01:22,309 --> 03:01:22,319
bollocks.
 

7447
03:01:22,319 --> 03:01:24,550
bollocks.
It's all about entry and location.

7448
03:01:24,550 --> 03:01:24,560
It's all about entry and location.
 

7449
03:01:24,560 --> 03:01:26,630
It's all about entry and location.
That's bollocks. That's absolute

7450
03:01:26,630 --> 03:01:26,640
That's bollocks. That's absolute
 

7451
03:01:26,640 --> 03:01:28,950
That's bollocks. That's absolute
bollocks, mate. I'm sorry. That's that's

7452
03:01:28,950 --> 03:01:28,960
bollocks, mate. I'm sorry. That's that's
 

7453
03:01:28,960 --> 03:01:30,389
bollocks, mate. I'm sorry. That's that's
a quant saying that. Well, quants

7454
03:01:30,389 --> 03:01:30,399
a quant saying that. Well, quants
 

7455
03:01:30,399 --> 03:01:31,670
a quant saying that. Well, quants
probably get totally [\h__\h] random

7456
03:01:31,670 --> 03:01:31,680
probably get totally [\h__\h] random
 

7457
03:01:31,680 --> 03:01:33,190
probably get totally [\h__\h] random
outcomes.

7458
03:01:33,190 --> 03:01:33,200
outcomes.
 

7459
03:01:33,200 --> 03:01:35,429

So, I like I'm not buying into that.

7460
03:01:35,429 --> 03:01:35,439
So, I like I'm not buying into that.
 

7461
03:01:35,439 --> 03:01:37,030
So, I like I'm not buying into that.
Sorry.

7462
03:01:37,030 --> 03:01:37,040
Sorry.
 

7463
03:01:37,040 --> 03:01:38,309
Sorry.
If you're going to enter a random

If you're going to enter a random
 

7465

If you're going to enter a random
position, you're going to get a random

7466
03:01:39,429 --> 03:01:39,439

7467
03:01:39,439 --> 03:01:41,030

trapped, you're not going to get it. How

trapped, you're not going to get it. How
 

7471
03:01:42,319 --> 03:01:44,469

How else How else did I know that that

How else How else did I know that that
 

7473
03:01:44,479 --> 03:01:46,870
How else How else did I know that that
was going to happen? That's not random.

7474

was going to happen? That's not random.
 

7475

That's just fundamentally flawed.

7486

That's just fundamentally flawed.
 

7487
03:02:02,319 --> 03:02:06,389
That's just fundamentally flawed.
Sorry. Don't agree.

03:02:09,279 --> 03:02:19,429
Um, they can say what they want, but uh
I don't agree with it.

Not going to lie, you helped me pass my
 

7495
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:23,349
Not going to lie, you helped me pass my
combound today. I was on a slow, steady

7496
03:02:23,349 --> 03:02:23,359
combound today. I was on a slow, steady
 

7497
03:02:23,359 --> 03:02:25,429

7503
03:02:30,240 --> 03:02:32,150
rejection on the 30 minutes, but your
long held. Oh, so you were going to be

7504
03:02:32,150 --> 03:02:32,160
long held. Oh, so you were going to be
 

7505
03:02:32,160 --> 03:02:33,670
long held. Oh, so you were going to be
short here, but that stopped you and

7506
03:02:33,670 --> 03:02:33,680
short here, but that stopped you and
 

7507
03:02:33,680 --> 03:02:43,030
short here, but that stopped you and
then maybe you came back in here. Nice.

03:16:29,190 --> 03:16:29,200
I I'm not I'm not a Greg sausage roll
 

8059
03:16:29,200 --> 03:16:31,190
I I'm not I'm not a Greg sausage roll
guy. This is not my thing. This reminds

8060
03:16:31,190 --> 03:16:31,200
guy. This is not my thing. This reminds
 

8061
03:16:31,200 --> 03:16:35,670
guy. This is not my thing. This reminds
me of motorway stops. This jacket uh

8062
03:16:35,670 --> 03:16:35,680
me of motorway stops. This jacket uh
 

8063
03:16:35,680 --> 03:16:40,389
me of motorway stops. This jacket uh
Scot, this is Scotch and Soda.

8064
03:16:40,389 --> 03:16:40,399

 

8065
03:16:40,399 --> 03:16:42,550

It's funny you say that, SG Trades. I

8066
03:16:42,550 --> 03:16:42,560
It's funny you say that, SG Trades. I
 

8067
03:16:42,560 --> 03:16:44,309
It's funny you say that, SG Trades. I
was actually looking at that for a swing

8068
03:16:44,309 --> 03:16:44,319
was actually looking at that for a swing
 

8069
03:16:44,319 --> 03:16:47,190
was actually looking at that for a swing
position. Let's have a look.

8070
03:16:47,190 --> 03:16:47,200
position. Let's have a look.
 

8071
03:16:47,200 --> 03:16:50,469
position. Let's have a look.
The only worry is

8072
03:16:50,469 --> 03:16:50,479
The only worry is
 

8073
03:16:50,479 --> 03:16:54,790
The only worry is
it's uh

8074
03:16:54,790 --> 03:16:54,800

 

8075
03:16:54,800 --> 03:16:58,469

I think it's at a deep discount.

8076
03:16:58,469 --> 03:16:58,479
I think it's at a deep discount.
 

8077
03:16:58,479 --> 03:17:00,550
I think it's at a deep discount.
Right, we're back to to start of the

8078
03:17:00,550 --> 03:17:00,560
Right, we're back to to start of the
 

8079
03:17:00,560 --> 03:17:02,790
Right, we're back to to start of the
year. So if we think about we've given

8080
03:17:02,790 --> 03:17:02,800
year. So if we think about we've given
 

8081
03:17:02,800 --> 03:17:05,910
year. So if we think about we've given
back the whole year.

8082
03:17:05,910 --> 03:17:05,920
back the whole year.
 

8083
03:17:05,920 --> 03:17:07,510
back the whole year.
I will look at this because this is this

8084
03:17:07,510 --> 03:17:07,520
I will look at this because this is this
 

8085
03:17:07,520 --> 03:17:09,990
I will look at this because this is this
is interesting for me. Where did we

8086
03:17:09,990 --> 03:17:10,000
is interesting for me. Where did we
 

8087
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:12,389
is interesting for me. Where did we
where's Jan?

8088
03:17:12,389 --> 03:17:12,399
where's Jan?
 

8089
03:17:12,399 --> 03:17:14,150
where's Jan?
Right. We've given back the whole year

8090
03:17:14,150 --> 03:17:14,160
Right. We've given back the whole year
 

8091
03:17:14,160 --> 03:17:15,590
Right. We've given back the whole year
and more. We're trading at deep

8092
03:17:15,590 --> 03:17:15,600
and more. We're trading at deep
 

8093
03:17:15,600 --> 03:17:17,030
and more. We're trading at deep
discount. Obviously this is direct

8094
03:17:17,030 --> 03:17:17,040
discount. Obviously this is direct
 

8095
03:17:17,040 --> 03:17:20,469
discount. Obviously this is direct
correlation to BTC. All right. So if we

8096
03:17:20,469 --> 03:17:20,479
correlation to BTC. All right. So if we
 

8097
03:17:20,479 --> 03:17:22,710
correlation to BTC. All right. So if we
have a quick look at BTC,

8098
03:17:22,710 --> 03:17:22,720
have a quick look at BTC,
 

8099
03:17:22,720 --> 03:17:24,150
have a quick look at BTC,
you're going to see it look very very

8100
03:17:24,150 --> 03:17:24,160
you're going to see it look very very
 

8101
03:17:24,160 --> 03:17:28,389
you're going to see it look very very
similar.

8102
03:17:28,389 --> 03:17:28,399

 

8103
03:17:28,399 --> 03:17:31,030

All right. Very similar peak high. We're

8104
03:17:31,030 --> 03:17:31,040
All right. Very similar peak high. We're
 

8105
03:17:31,040 --> 03:17:35,030
All right. Very similar peak high. We're
trading at what level? March 25. So MSTR

8106
03:17:35,030 --> 03:17:35,040
trading at what level? March 25. So MSTR
 

8107
03:17:35,040 --> 03:17:40,309
trading at what level? March 25. So MSTR
worse. Um I I I do wonder if this is due

8108
03:17:40,309 --> 03:17:40,319
worse. Um I I I do wonder if this is due
 

8109
03:17:40,319 --> 03:17:43,269
worse. Um I I I do wonder if this is due
a pop. I do wonder if this starts to

8110
03:17:43,269 --> 03:17:43,279
a pop. I do wonder if this starts to
 

8111
03:17:43,279 --> 03:17:45,190
a pop. I do wonder if this starts to
lift. Uh if we want to think about the

8112
03:17:45,190 --> 03:17:45,200
lift. Uh if we want to think about the
 

8113
03:17:45,200 --> 03:17:51,429
lift. Uh if we want to think about the
whole rotation

8114
03:17:51,429 --> 03:17:51,439

 

8115
03:17:51,439 --> 03:17:53,030

because I think it's been decimated

8116
03:17:53,030 --> 03:17:53,040
because I think it's been decimated
 

8117
03:17:53,040 --> 03:17:57,990
because I think it's been decimated
quite hard.

8118
03:17:57,990 --> 03:17:58,000

 

8119
03:17:58,000 --> 03:17:59,590

I mean, it can't even figure that out.

8120
03:17:59,590 --> 03:17:59,600
I mean, it can't even figure that out.
 

8121
03:17:59,600 --> 03:18:04,469
I mean, it can't even figure that out.
That's so bad. What is it doing?

8122
03:18:04,469 --> 03:18:04,479
That's so bad. What is it doing?
 

8123
03:18:04,479 --> 03:18:13,750
That's so bad. What is it doing?
That's [\h__\h] ridiculous.

8124
03:18:13,750 --> 03:18:13,760

 

8125
03:18:13,760 --> 03:18:18,630

How much we down on that swing to swing?

8126
03:18:18,630 --> 03:18:18,640
How much we down on that swing to swing?
 

8127
03:18:18,640 --> 03:18:22,229
How much we down on that swing to swing?
Let's just get the days right.

8128
03:18:22,229 --> 03:18:22,239
Let's just get the days right.
 

8129
03:18:22,239 --> 03:18:33,349
Let's just get the days right.
So, it's a two-year cycle.

8130
03:18:33,349 --> 03:18:33,359

 

8131
03:18:33,359 --> 03:18:37,990

down 72%.

8132
03:18:37,990 --> 03:18:38,000

 

8133
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:40,472

Trading at the same levels

8134
03:18:40,472 --> 03:18:40,482
Trading at the same levels
 

8135
03:18:40,482 --> 03:18:41,590
Trading at the same levels
[sighs]

8136
03:18:41,590 --> 03:18:41,600
[sighs]
 

8137
03:18:41,600 --> 03:18:44,630
[sighs]
as 2024 highs. Doesn't mean it can't

8138
03:18:44,630 --> 03:18:44,640
as 2024 highs. Doesn't mean it can't
 

8139
03:18:44,640 --> 03:18:47,269
as 2024 highs. Doesn't mean it can't
come lower, but I'm not I am I'd be

8140
03:18:47,269 --> 03:18:47,279
come lower, but I'm not I am I'd be
 

8141
03:18:47,279 --> 03:18:49,190
come lower, but I'm not I am I'd be
lying if I said I wasn't interested.

8142
03:18:49,190 --> 03:18:49,200
lying if I said I wasn't interested.
 

8143
03:18:49,200 --> 03:18:51,190
lying if I said I wasn't interested.
Definitely if we drifted anywhere into

8144
03:18:51,190 --> 03:18:51,200
Definitely if we drifted anywhere into
 

8145
03:18:51,200 --> 03:18:53,830
Definitely if we drifted anywhere into
here. Um, but I think there's probably a

8146
03:18:53,830 --> 03:18:53,840
here. Um, but I think there's probably a
 

8147
03:18:53,840 --> 03:18:56,630
here. Um, but I think there's probably a
turnaround due even just for a pop back

8148
03:18:56,630 --> 03:18:56,640
turnaround due even just for a pop back
 

8149
03:18:56,640 --> 03:18:59,429
turnaround due even just for a pop back
in. If I was a short seller, I'm like,

8150
03:18:59,429 --> 03:18:59,439
in. If I was a short seller, I'm like,
 

8151
03:18:59,439 --> 03:19:02,150
in. If I was a short seller, I'm like,
this is how I would view this, right?

8152
03:19:02,150 --> 03:19:02,160
this is how I would view this, right?
 

8153
03:19:02,160 --> 03:19:04,070
this is how I would view this, right?
Even if we

8154
03:19:04,070 --> 03:19:04,080
Even if we
 

8155
03:19:04,080 --> 03:19:10,150
Even if we
do a fixed range from this break

8156
03:19:10,150 --> 03:19:10,160

 

8157
03:19:10,160 --> 03:19:15,990

and if we do an anchor from the high.

8158
03:19:15,990 --> 03:19:16,000

 

8159
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:17,349

No, you don't want to do that anchor.

8160
03:19:17,349 --> 03:19:17,359
No, you don't want to do that anchor.
 

8161
03:19:17,359 --> 03:19:19,190
No, you don't want to do that anchor.
You're going to play bull. You don't

8162
03:19:19,190 --> 03:19:19,200
You're going to play bull. You don't
 

8163
03:19:19,200 --> 03:19:20,630
You're going to play bull. You don't
want to do it. Okay. Thanks, Trading

8164
03:19:20,630 --> 03:19:20,640
want to do it. Okay. Thanks, Trading
 

8165
03:19:20,640 --> 03:19:23,030
want to do it. Okay. Thanks, Trading
View. You absolute garbage piece of

8166
03:19:23,030 --> 03:19:23,040
View. You absolute garbage piece of
 

8167
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:26,070
View. You absolute garbage piece of
crap.

8168
03:19:26,070 --> 03:19:26,080

 

8169
03:19:26,080 --> 03:19:32,389

We want to draw one on then.

8170
03:19:32,389 --> 03:19:32,399

 

8171
03:19:32,399 --> 03:19:37,349

Anchor this. Let's do an anchor from

8172
03:19:37,349 --> 03:19:37,359
Anchor this. Let's do an anchor from
 

8173
03:19:37,359 --> 03:19:39,510
Anchor this. Let's do an anchor from
here. Let's just do one from here a

8174
03:19:39,510 --> 03:19:39,520
here. Let's just do one from here a
 

8175
03:19:39,520 --> 03:19:45,750
here. Let's just do one from here a
second.

8176
03:19:45,750 --> 03:19:45,760

 

8177
03:19:45,760 --> 03:19:48,070

Big node here.

8178
03:19:48,070 --> 03:19:48,080
Big node here.
 

8179
03:19:48,080 --> 03:19:51,110
Big node here.
So, this is where I'd be interested in.

8180
03:19:51,110 --> 03:19:51,120
So, this is where I'd be interested in.
 

8181
03:19:51,120 --> 03:19:54,630
So, this is where I'd be interested in.
Let's let me just get a volume anchored

8182
03:19:54,630 --> 03:19:54,640
Let's let me just get a volume anchored
 

8183
03:19:54,640 --> 03:19:59,590
Let's let me just get a volume anchored
VWAP one second off the high

8184
03:19:59,590 --> 03:19:59,600

 

8185
03:19:59,600 --> 03:20:04,309

one more

8186
03:20:04,309 --> 03:20:04,319

 

8187
03:20:04,319 --> 03:20:11,518

and let me get one from this pivot here.

8188
03:20:11,518 --> 03:20:11,528

 

8189
03:20:11,528 --> 03:20:14,309

[sighs] It's not good.

8190
03:20:14,309 --> 03:20:14,319
[sighs] It's not good.
 

8191
03:20:14,319 --> 03:20:16,870
[sighs] It's not good.
I was hoping that would be underneath.

8192
03:20:16,870 --> 03:20:16,880
I was hoping that would be underneath.
 

8193
03:20:16,880 --> 03:20:18,870
I was hoping that would be underneath.
That's not great.

8194
03:20:18,870 --> 03:20:18,880
That's not great.
 

8195
03:20:18,880 --> 03:20:20,389
That's not great.
And I'm going to assume these guys are

8196
03:20:20,389 --> 03:20:20,399
And I'm going to assume these guys are
 

8197
03:20:20,399 --> 03:20:23,030
And I'm going to assume these guys are
all out the money as well. Yeah. Okay.

8198
03:20:23,030 --> 03:20:23,040
all out the money as well. Yeah. Okay.
 

8199
03:20:23,040 --> 03:20:24,550
all out the money as well. Yeah. Okay.
That'll be my only concern right now.

8200
03:20:24,550 --> 03:20:24,560
That'll be my only concern right now.
 

8201
03:20:24,560 --> 03:20:27,110
That'll be my only concern right now.
I'm going to be honest with you. So,

8202
03:20:27,110 --> 03:20:27,120
I'm going to be honest with you. So,
 

8203
03:20:27,120 --> 03:20:29,269
I'm going to be honest with you. So,
you've got this build out of a node

8204
03:20:29,269 --> 03:20:29,279
you've got this build out of a node
 

8205
03:20:29,279 --> 03:20:32,229
you've got this build out of a node
here,

8206
03:20:32,229 --> 03:20:32,239
here,
 

8207
03:20:32,239 --> 03:20:37,030
here,
right? If we can't hold that,

8208
03:20:37,030 --> 03:20:37,040

 

8209
03:20:37,040 --> 03:20:39,110

my expectations would be for a trade

8210
03:20:39,110 --> 03:20:39,120
my expectations would be for a trade
 

8211
03:20:39,120 --> 03:20:41,750
my expectations would be for a trade
down into 30s.

8212
03:20:41,750 --> 03:20:41,760
down into 30s.
 

8213
03:20:41,760 --> 03:20:43,510
down into 30s.
Okay. Do I think it's due some relief?

8214
03:20:43,510 --> 03:20:43,520
Okay. Do I think it's due some relief?
 

8215
03:20:43,520 --> 03:20:44,950
Okay. Do I think it's due some relief?
Yeah. I mean, it did have some last

8216
03:20:44,950 --> 03:20:44,960
Yeah. I mean, it did have some last
 

8217
03:20:44,960 --> 03:20:47,990
Yeah. I mean, it did have some last
week. Uh, I think at some point you're

8218
03:20:47,990 --> 03:20:48,000
week. Uh, I think at some point you're
 

8219
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:49,590
week. Uh, I think at some point you're
going to see a trade back into here. All

8220
03:20:49,590 --> 03:20:49,600
going to see a trade back into here. All
 

8221
03:20:49,600 --> 03:20:51,670
going to see a trade back into here. All
right? Because you've got, this is,

8222
03:20:51,670 --> 03:20:51,680
right? Because you've got, this is,
 

8223
03:20:51,680 --> 03:20:53,190
right? Because you've got, this is,
you've got to imagine this is where guys

8224
03:20:53,190 --> 03:20:53,200
you've got to imagine this is where guys
 

8225
03:20:53,200 --> 03:20:56,229
you've got to imagine this is where guys
off these highs are stuck right now.

8226
03:20:56,229 --> 03:20:56,239
off these highs are stuck right now.
 

8227
03:20:56,239 --> 03:20:58,229
off these highs are stuck right now.
275

8228
03:20:58,229 --> 03:20:58,239
275
 

8229
03:20:58,239 --> 03:21:01,510
275
to 230s, let's just call it. This anchor

8230
03:21:01,510 --> 03:21:01,520
to 230s, let's just call it. This anchor
 

8231
03:21:01,520 --> 03:21:03,590
to 230s, let's just call it. This anchor
off the low is a problem. The fact that

8232
03:21:03,590 --> 03:21:03,600
off the low is a problem. The fact that
 

8233
03:21:03,600 --> 03:21:06,870
off the low is a problem. The fact that
they've accumulated since 2022,

8234
03:21:06,870 --> 03:21:06,880
they've accumulated since 2022,
 

8235
03:21:06,880 --> 03:21:08,150
they've accumulated since 2022,
all right, and they're now out the money

8236
03:21:08,150 --> 03:21:08,160
all right, and they're now out the money
 

8237
03:21:08,160 --> 03:21:09,990
all right, and they're now out the money
is a problem. And we've just failed. You

8238
03:21:09,990 --> 03:21:10,000
is a problem. And we've just failed. You
 

8239
03:21:10,000 --> 03:21:11,750
is a problem. And we've just failed. You
can see this trade back to it. They just

8240
03:21:11,750 --> 03:21:11,760
can see this trade back to it. They just
 

8241
03:21:11,760 --> 03:21:13,030
can see this trade back to it. They just
failed. All right, they failed the

8242
03:21:13,030 --> 03:21:13,040
failed. All right, they failed the
 

8243
03:21:13,040 --> 03:21:14,469
failed. All right, they failed the
reclaim. That was an attempt of a

8244
03:21:14,469 --> 03:21:14,479
reclaim. That was an attempt of a
 

8245
03:21:14,479 --> 03:21:16,309
reclaim. That was an attempt of a
reclaim of that anchor. All right. So,

8246
03:21:16,309 --> 03:21:16,319
reclaim of that anchor. All right. So,
 

8247
03:21:16,319 --> 03:21:19,429
reclaim of that anchor. All right. So,
I'd be careful. I wouldn't I wouldn't

8248
03:21:19,429 --> 03:21:19,439
I'd be careful. I wouldn't I wouldn't
 

8249
03:21:19,439 --> 03:21:21,190
I'd be careful. I wouldn't I wouldn't
feel the need to frontr run it. I'd be

8250
03:21:21,190 --> 03:21:21,200
feel the need to frontr run it. I'd be
 

8251
03:21:21,200 --> 03:21:23,670
feel the need to frontr run it. I'd be
careful for this drift. But at some

8252
03:21:23,670 --> 03:21:23,680
careful for this drift. But at some
 

8253
03:21:23,680 --> 03:21:25,030
careful for this drift. But at some
point, do I think this is going to

8254
03:21:25,030 --> 03:21:25,040
point, do I think this is going to
 

8255
03:21:25,040 --> 03:21:27,750
point, do I think this is going to
happen? Yeah. As a trade, whether it's

8256
03:21:27,750 --> 03:21:27,760
happen? Yeah. As a trade, whether it's
 

8257
03:21:27,760 --> 03:21:31,190
happen? Yeah. As a trade, whether it's
from here or here, it's highly probable.

8258
03:21:31,190 --> 03:21:31,200
from here or here, it's highly probable.
 

8259
03:21:31,200 --> 03:21:33,110
from here or here, it's highly probable.
At some point, we lift back into the

8260
03:21:33,110 --> 03:21:33,120
At some point, we lift back into the
 

8261
03:21:33,120 --> 03:21:35,429
At some point, we lift back into the
80s. Now, whether we reclaim that or not

8262
03:21:35,429 --> 03:21:35,439
80s. Now, whether we reclaim that or not
 

8263
03:21:35,439 --> 03:21:37,349
80s. Now, whether we reclaim that or not
is different, but that's still like a h

8264
03:21:37,349 --> 03:21:37,359
is different, but that's still like a h
 

8265
03:21:37,359 --> 03:21:39,429
is different, but that's still like a h
100 plus dollars even from here, like

8266
03:21:39,429 --> 03:21:39,439
100 plus dollars even from here, like
 

8267
03:21:39,439 --> 03:21:42,550
100 plus dollars even from here, like
$150 move. If shorts want to leave these

8268
03:21:42,550 --> 03:21:42,560
$150 move. If shorts want to leave these
 

8269
03:21:42,560 --> 03:21:43,910
$150 move. If shorts want to leave these
participants trapped, then they will

8270
03:21:43,910 --> 03:21:43,920
participants trapped, then they will
 

8271
03:21:43,920 --> 03:21:46,070
participants trapped, then they will
resell this, right? And then we'll use

8272
03:21:46,070 --> 03:21:46,080
resell this, right? And then we'll use
 

8273
03:21:46,080 --> 03:21:49,349
resell this, right? And then we'll use
the liquidity. Um, it really depends on

8274
03:21:49,349 --> 03:21:49,359
the liquidity. Um, it really depends on
 

8275
03:21:49,359 --> 03:21:51,670
the liquidity. Um, it really depends on
the macro sort of environment for next

8276
03:21:51,670 --> 03:21:51,680
the macro sort of environment for next
 

8277
03:21:51,680 --> 03:21:53,110
the macro sort of environment for next
year. Let me just check one more thing

8278
03:21:53,110 --> 03:21:53,120
year. Let me just check one more thing
 

8279
03:21:53,120 --> 03:22:01,030
year. Let me just check one more thing
while we're here.

8280
03:22:01,030 --> 03:22:01,040

 

8281
03:22:01,040 --> 03:22:03,269

Come on, Trading View. The [\h__\h] is going

8282
03:22:03,269 --> 03:22:03,279
Come on, Trading View. The [\h__\h] is going
 

8283
03:22:03,279 --> 03:22:09,030
Come on, Trading View. The [\h__\h] is going
on?

8284
03:22:09,030 --> 03:22:09,040

 

8285
03:22:09,040 --> 03:22:19,510

Oh my god, it's gone mental.

8286
03:22:19,510 --> 03:22:19,520

 

8287
03:22:19,520 --> 03:22:22,630

Can I not put

8288
03:22:22,630 --> 03:22:22,640
Can I not put
 

8289
03:22:22,640 --> 03:22:23,910
Can I not put
moving average on this? It's not going

8290
03:22:23,910 --> 03:22:23,920
moving average on this? It's not going
 

8291
03:22:23,920 --> 03:22:34,870
moving average on this? It's not going
to let me do it.

8292
03:22:34,870 --> 03:22:34,880

 

8293
03:22:34,880 --> 03:22:37,349

Let's just do

8294
03:22:37,349 --> 03:22:37,359
Let's just do
 

8295
03:22:37,359 --> 03:22:48,150
Let's just do
actually just want this 200.

8296
03:22:48,150 --> 03:22:48,160

 

8297
03:22:48,160 --> 03:22:54,550

Where's my 200?

8298
03:22:54,550 --> 03:22:54,560

 

8299
03:22:54,560 --> 03:22:56,550

Yeah, that's not good. What about on a

8300
03:22:56,550 --> 03:22:56,560
Yeah, that's not good. What about on a
 

8301
03:22:56,560 --> 03:22:58,710
Yeah, that's not good. What about on a
weekly?

8302
03:22:58,710 --> 03:22:58,720
weekly?
 

8303
03:22:58,720 --> 03:23:01,910
weekly?
Okay, that's interesting. So for a

8304
03:23:01,910 --> 03:23:01,920
Okay, that's interesting. So for a
 

8305
03:23:01,920 --> 03:23:04,389
Okay, that's interesting. So for a
weekly

8306
03:23:04,389 --> 03:23:04,399
weekly
 

8307
03:23:04,399 --> 03:23:06,630
weekly
that's probably a high probability play

8308
03:23:06,630 --> 03:23:06,640
that's probably a high probability play
 

8309
03:23:06,640 --> 03:23:09,269
that's probably a high probability play
a weekly back test

8310
03:23:09,269 --> 03:23:09,279
a weekly back test
 

8311
03:23:09,279 --> 03:23:11,670
a weekly back test
of this. So definitely in this in this

8312
03:23:11,670 --> 03:23:11,680
of this. So definitely in this in this
 

8313
03:23:11,680 --> 03:23:14,469
of this. So definitely in this in this
area here there is a possible bounce

8314
03:23:14,469 --> 03:23:14,479
area here there is a possible bounce
 

8315
03:23:14,479 --> 03:23:16,630
area here there is a possible bounce
around this weekly. So I think it's I

8316
03:23:16,630 --> 03:23:16,640
around this weekly. So I think it's I
 

8317
03:23:16,640 --> 03:23:18,389
around this weekly. So I think it's I
I'll say these things. I think it's at a

8318
03:23:18,389 --> 03:23:18,399
I'll say these things. I think it's at a
 

8319
03:23:18,399 --> 03:23:21,750
I'll say these things. I think it's at a
deep discount. I think it's probably

8320
03:23:21,750 --> 03:23:21,760
deep discount. I think it's probably
 

8321
03:23:21,760 --> 03:23:23,750
deep discount. I think it's probably
due a bounce up to here at some point.

8322
03:23:23,750 --> 03:23:23,760
due a bounce up to here at some point.
 

8323
03:23:23,760 --> 03:23:24,790
due a bounce up to here at some point.
It's going to have to get back through

8324
03:23:24,790 --> 03:23:24,800
It's going to have to get back through
 

8325
03:23:24,800 --> 03:23:26,950
It's going to have to get back through
this anchor first. This is an area of

8326
03:23:26,950 --> 03:23:26,960
this anchor first. This is an area of
 

8327
03:23:26,960 --> 03:23:29,349
this anchor first. This is an area of
interest to me. But if we fail this and

8328
03:23:29,349 --> 03:23:29,359
interest to me. But if we fail this and
 

8329
03:23:29,359 --> 03:23:31,269
interest to me. But if we fail this and
lose this area of interest, you've got

8330
03:23:31,269 --> 03:23:31,279
lose this area of interest, you've got
 

8331
03:23:31,279 --> 03:23:33,510
lose this area of interest, you've got
to imagine a deep rotation. This like I

8332
03:23:33,510 --> 03:23:33,520
to imagine a deep rotation. This like I
 

8333
03:23:33,520 --> 03:23:35,590
to imagine a deep rotation. This like I
don't think we come that far down. But

8334
03:23:35,590 --> 03:23:35,600
don't think we come that far down. But
 

8335
03:23:35,600 --> 03:23:37,429
don't think we come that far down. But
you just don't [\h__\h] know if Bitcoin

8336
03:23:37,429 --> 03:23:37,439
you just don't [\h__\h] know if Bitcoin
 

8337
03:23:37,439 --> 03:23:38,710
you just don't [\h__\h] know if Bitcoin
goes to [\h__\h] and we go into some

8338
03:23:38,710 --> 03:23:38,720
goes to [\h__\h] and we go into some
 

8339
03:23:38,720 --> 03:23:41,110
goes to [\h__\h] and we go into some
recessionary pressure and if if this

8340
03:23:41,110 --> 03:23:41,120
recessionary pressure and if if this
 

8341
03:23:41,120 --> 03:23:44,469
recessionary pressure and if if this
company has got overexposure, all right,

8342
03:23:44,469 --> 03:23:44,479
company has got overexposure, all right,
 

8343
03:23:44,479 --> 03:23:46,469
company has got overexposure, all right,
to that you don't know, but uh I would

8344
03:23:46,469 --> 03:23:46,479
to that you don't know, but uh I would
 

8345
03:23:46,479 --> 03:23:48,630
to that you don't know, but uh I would
say it's I would be interested along.

8346
03:23:48,630 --> 03:23:48,640
say it's I would be interested along.
 

8347
03:23:48,640 --> 03:23:50,150
say it's I would be interested along.
I'm with you. It's actually on my watch

8348
03:23:50,150 --> 03:23:50,160
I'm with you. It's actually on my watch
 

8349
03:23:50,160 --> 03:23:53,590
I'm with you. It's actually on my watch
list. I uh put it on at the weekend.

8350
03:23:53,590 --> 03:23:53,600
list. I uh put it on at the weekend.
 

8351
03:23:53,600 --> 03:23:55,830
list. I uh put it on at the weekend.
So yeah, that's where my head's at.

8352
03:23:55,830 --> 03:23:55,840
So yeah, that's where my head's at.
 

8353
03:23:55,840 --> 03:23:58,150
So yeah, that's where my head's at.
Hopefully that helps. Uh, the only thing

8354
03:23:58,150 --> 03:23:58,160
Hopefully that helps. Uh, the only thing
 

8355
03:23:58,160 --> 03:24:02,229
Hopefully that helps. Uh, the only thing
that would scare me right now is BTC

8356
03:24:02,229 --> 03:24:02,239
that would scare me right now is BTC
 

8357
03:24:02,239 --> 03:24:04,469
that would scare me right now is BTC
I think is going to have some issues.

8358
03:24:04,469 --> 03:24:04,479
I think is going to have some issues.
 

8359
03:24:04,479 --> 03:24:05,429
I think is going to have some issues.
All right, so they're trying to

8360
03:24:05,429 --> 03:24:05,439
All right, so they're trying to
 

8361
03:24:05,439 --> 03:24:07,030
All right, so they're trying to
accumulate. It's the same kind of thing.

8362
03:24:07,030 --> 03:24:07,040
accumulate. It's the same kind of thing.
 

8363
03:24:07,040 --> 03:24:11,030
accumulate. It's the same kind of thing.
BTC is trying to accumulate versus this.

8364
03:24:11,030 --> 03:24:11,040
BTC is trying to accumulate versus this.
 

8365
03:24:11,040 --> 03:24:13,030
BTC is trying to accumulate versus this.
Okay, but if they get failed

8366
03:24:13,030 --> 03:24:13,040
Okay, but if they get failed
 

8367
03:24:13,040 --> 03:24:15,590
Okay, but if they get failed
followrough, this is a peak high

8368
03:24:15,590 --> 03:24:15,600
followrough, this is a peak high
 

8369
03:24:15,600 --> 03:24:18,550
followrough, this is a peak high
breakdown, breakdown, failure. If we do

8370
03:24:18,550 --> 03:24:18,560
breakdown, breakdown, failure. If we do
 

8371
03:24:18,560 --> 03:24:20,070
breakdown, breakdown, failure. If we do
like a two-leg into here and you see

8372
03:24:20,070 --> 03:24:20,080
like a two-leg into here and you see
 

8373
03:24:20,080 --> 03:24:21,670
like a two-leg into here and you see
failure, they will come back for this.

8374
03:24:21,670 --> 03:24:21,680
failure, they will come back for this.
 

8375
03:24:21,680 --> 03:24:24,389
failure, they will come back for this.
Um,

8376
03:24:24,389 --> 03:24:24,399
Um,
 

8377
03:24:24,399 --> 03:24:27,990
Um,
you've just got to understand that

8378
03:24:27,990 --> 03:24:28,000
you've just got to understand that
 

8379
03:24:28,000 --> 03:24:31,110
you've just got to understand that
we have finished a,000 day cycle up here

8380
03:24:31,110 --> 03:24:31,120
we have finished a,000 day cycle up here
 

8381
03:24:31,120 --> 03:24:33,030
we have finished a,000 day cycle up here
on BTC

8382
03:24:33,030 --> 03:24:33,040
on BTC
 

8383
03:24:33,040 --> 03:24:36,630
on BTC
and an 80% pullback

8384
03:24:36,630 --> 03:24:36,640
and an 80% pullback
 

8385
03:24:36,640 --> 03:24:39,429
and an 80% pullback
uh is highly possible, not just probable

8386
03:24:39,429 --> 03:24:39,439
uh is highly possible, not just probable
 

8387
03:24:39,439 --> 03:24:43,110
uh is highly possible, not just probable
or a 78 to 80% which would take us, as

8388
03:24:43,110 --> 03:24:43,120
or a 78 to 80% which would take us, as
 

8389
03:24:43,120 --> 03:24:45,670
or a 78 to 80% which would take us, as
horrific as that sounds,

8390
03:24:45,670 --> 03:24:45,680
horrific as that sounds,
 

8391
03:24:45,680 --> 03:24:48,309
horrific as that sounds,
right? Let's just say 70% would take us

8392
03:24:48,309 --> 03:24:48,319
right? Let's just say 70% would take us
 

8393
03:24:48,319 --> 03:24:50,229
right? Let's just say 70% would take us
back down to here. And if you're like,

8394
03:24:50,229 --> 03:24:50,239
back down to here. And if you're like,
 

8395
03:24:50,239 --> 03:24:53,670
back down to here. And if you're like,
"That isn't doable." Well, it [\h__\h]

8396
03:24:53,670 --> 03:24:53,680
"That isn't doable." Well, it [\h__\h]
 

8397
03:24:53,680 --> 03:24:55,830
"That isn't doable." Well, it [\h__\h]
absolutely is,

8398
03:24:55,830 --> 03:24:55,840
absolutely is,
 

8399
03:24:55,840 --> 03:24:58,229
absolutely is,
right? 77. If we look at the pullbacks

8400
03:24:58,229 --> 03:24:58,239
right? 77. If we look at the pullbacks
 

8401
03:24:58,239 --> 03:25:00,950
right? 77. If we look at the pullbacks
after the cycles, after the big cycles,

8402
03:25:00,950 --> 03:25:00,960
after the cycles, after the big cycles,
 

8403
03:25:00,960 --> 03:25:04,070
after the cycles, after the big cycles,
they are drastic.

8404
03:25:04,070 --> 03:25:04,080
they are drastic.
 

8405
03:25:04,080 --> 03:25:07,670
they are drastic.
What was this one?

8406
03:25:07,670 --> 03:25:07,680

 

8407
03:25:07,680 --> 03:25:10,630

73. So, you have to be careful because

8408
03:25:10,630 --> 03:25:10,640
73. So, you have to be careful because
 

8409
03:25:10,640 --> 03:25:15,590
73. So, you have to be careful because
if we're measuring it out in cycles,

8410
03:25:15,590 --> 03:25:15,600

 

8411
03:25:15,600 --> 03:25:19,429

you see 80%. So 80 to 70% is possible,

8412
03:25:19,429 --> 03:25:19,439
you see 80%. So 80 to 70% is possible,
 

8413
03:25:19,439 --> 03:25:21,670
you see 80%. So 80 to 70% is possible,
right? And the and the cycle has been

8414
03:25:21,670 --> 03:25:21,680
right? And the and the cycle has been
 

8415
03:25:21,680 --> 03:25:24,790
right? And the and the cycle has been
huge. If we look at the cycle length,

8416
03:25:24,790 --> 03:25:24,800
huge. If we look at the cycle length,
 

8417
03:25:24,800 --> 03:25:26,389
huge. If we look at the cycle length,
it's achieved everything that you would

8418
03:25:26,389 --> 03:25:26,399
it's achieved everything that you would
 

8419
03:25:26,399 --> 03:25:29,990
it's achieved everything that you would
expect,

8420
03:25:29,990 --> 03:25:30,000

 

8421
03:25:30,000 --> 03:25:32,469

right? 1,000 days,

8422
03:25:32,469 --> 03:25:32,479
right? 1,000 days,
 

8423
03:25:32,479 --> 03:25:35,030
right? 1,000 days,
692%.

8424
03:25:35,030 --> 03:25:35,040
692%.
 

8425
03:25:35,040 --> 03:25:44,790
692%.
Right? If we look from this pin,

8426
03:25:44,790 --> 03:25:44,800

 

8427
03:25:44,800 --> 03:25:48,309

uh where's the days? 622 days normally.

8428
03:25:48,309 --> 03:25:48,319
uh where's the days? 622 days normally.
 

8429
03:25:48,319 --> 03:25:50,950
uh where's the days? 622 days normally.
So we normally we talk about a,000 days

8430
03:25:50,950 --> 03:25:50,960
So we normally we talk about a,000 days
 

8431
03:25:50,960 --> 03:25:56,150
So we normally we talk about a,000 days
maybe we go from here this accumulation

8432
03:25:56,150 --> 03:25:56,160

 

8433
03:25:56,160 --> 03:25:58,870

1,000 days

8434
03:25:58,870 --> 03:25:58,880
1,000 days
 

8435
03:25:58,880 --> 03:26:00,389
1,000 days
2,000%

8436
03:26:00,389 --> 03:26:00,399
2,000%
 

8437
03:26:00,399 --> 03:26:02,950
2,000%
you know if we go from here this first

8438
03:26:02,950 --> 03:26:02,960
you know if we go from here this first
 

8439
03:26:02,960 --> 03:26:08,469
you know if we go from here this first
big old bull run that we had

8440
03:26:08,469 --> 03:26:08,479

 

8441
03:26:08,479 --> 03:26:09,750

someone asked me earlier do I look at

8442
03:26:09,750 --> 03:26:09,760
someone asked me earlier do I look at
 

8443
03:26:09,760 --> 03:26:11,670
someone asked me earlier do I look at
cycles not for day trading but for swing

8444
03:26:11,670 --> 03:26:11,680
cycles not for day trading but for swing
 

8445
03:26:11,680 --> 03:26:20,229
cycles not for day trading but for swing
positions absolutely

8446
03:26:20,229 --> 03:26:20,239

 

8447
03:26:20,239 --> 03:26:22,630

There's that pin

8448
03:26:22,630 --> 03:26:22,640
There's that pin
 

8449
03:26:22,640 --> 03:26:24,229
There's that pin
uh over a thousand days again. So you

8450
03:26:24,229 --> 03:26:24,239
uh over a thousand days again. So you
 

8451
03:26:24,239 --> 03:26:26,070
uh over a thousand days again. So you
can see the cycle thousand days sell

8452
03:26:26,070 --> 03:26:26,080
can see the cycle thousand days sell
 

8453
03:26:26,080 --> 03:26:28,630
can see the cycle thousand days sell
thousand days sell thousand days sell

8454
03:26:28,630 --> 03:26:28,640
thousand days sell thousand days sell
 

8455
03:26:28,640 --> 03:26:31,349
thousand days sell thousand days sell
right the question is are we going to

8456
03:26:31,349 --> 03:26:31,359
right the question is are we going to
 

8457
03:26:31,359 --> 03:26:35,429
right the question is are we going to
see a 70 80% sale like here and like

8458
03:26:35,429 --> 03:26:35,439
see a 70 80% sale like here and like
 

8459
03:26:35,439 --> 03:26:38,710
see a 70 80% sale like here and like
here right that's that is a possibility

8460
03:26:38,710 --> 03:26:38,720
here right that's that is a possibility
 

8461
03:26:38,720 --> 03:26:45,030
here right that's that is a possibility
and that is what MSTR is exposed to

8462
03:26:45,030 --> 03:26:45,040

 

8463
03:26:45,040 --> 03:26:47,670

somewhere between 25 let's just call it

8464
03:26:47,670 --> 03:26:47,680
somewhere between 25 let's just call it
 

8465
03:26:47,680 --> 03:26:49,349
somewhere between 25 let's just call it
30,000 because it's probable that we're

8466
03:26:49,349 --> 03:26:49,359
30,000 because it's probable that we're
 

8467
03:26:49,359 --> 03:26:50,630
30,000 because it's probable that we're
going to come if we are going to sell

8468
03:26:50,630 --> 03:26:50,640
going to come if we are going to sell
 

8469
03:26:50,640 --> 03:26:53,429
going to come if we are going to sell
that this is the pivot right 30,000ish

8470
03:26:53,429 --> 03:26:53,439
that this is the pivot right 30,000ish
 

8471
03:26:53,439 --> 03:26:56,309
that this is the pivot right 30,000ish
If we see that, the risk exposure on

8472
03:26:56,309 --> 03:26:56,319
If we see that, the risk exposure on
 

8473
03:26:56,319 --> 03:26:58,950
If we see that, the risk exposure on
MSTR to that is drastic, right? That's

8474
03:26:58,950 --> 03:26:58,960
MSTR to that is drastic, right? That's
 

8475
03:26:58,960 --> 03:27:01,110
MSTR to that is drastic, right? That's
why we're seeing this, which will pull

8476
03:27:01,110 --> 03:27:01,120
why we're seeing this, which will pull
 

8477
03:27:01,120 --> 03:27:03,590
why we're seeing this, which will pull
us back down into the 50s. So, that's

8478
03:27:03,590 --> 03:27:03,600
us back down into the 50s. So, that's
 

8479
03:27:03,600 --> 03:27:06,469
us back down into the 50s. So, that's
the only thing I would say if you're

8480
03:27:06,469 --> 03:27:06,479
the only thing I would say if you're
 

8481
03:27:06,479 --> 03:27:08,309
the only thing I would say if you're
looking to accumulate here, if we start

8482
03:27:08,309 --> 03:27:08,319
looking to accumulate here, if we start
 

8483
03:27:08,319 --> 03:27:11,349
looking to accumulate here, if we start
losing BTC and there's you will see

8484
03:27:11,349 --> 03:27:11,359
losing BTC and there's you will see
 

8485
03:27:11,359 --> 03:27:14,950
losing BTC and there's you will see
panic start to enter in. All right. Uh

8486
03:27:14,950 --> 03:27:14,960
panic start to enter in. All right. Uh
 

8487
03:27:14,960 --> 03:27:17,269
panic start to enter in. All right. Uh
hopefully that helps, but it's something

8488
03:27:17,269 --> 03:27:17,279
hopefully that helps, but it's something
 

8489
03:27:17,279 --> 03:27:19,590
hopefully that helps, but it's something
that's worth watching for sure. Um,

8490
03:27:19,590 --> 03:27:19,600
that's worth watching for sure. Um,
 

8491
03:27:19,600 --> 03:27:21,429
that's worth watching for sure. Um,
definitely definitely for a bounce, not

8492
03:27:21,429 --> 03:27:21,439
definitely definitely for a bounce, not
 

8493
03:27:21,439 --> 03:27:25,030
definitely definitely for a bounce, not
necessarily for a long-term buy.

8494
03:27:25,030 --> 03:27:25,040
necessarily for a long-term buy.
 

8495
03:27:25,040 --> 03:27:26,389
necessarily for a long-term buy.
There you go. So, you can see how I

8496
03:27:26,389 --> 03:27:26,399
There you go. So, you can see how I
 

8497
03:27:26,399 --> 03:27:29,063
There you go. So, you can see how I
operate.

8498
03:27:29,063 --> 03:27:29,073
operate.
 

8499
03:27:29,073 --> 03:27:32,309
operate.
[snorts]

8500
03:27:32,309 --> 03:27:32,319

 

8501
03:27:32,319 --> 03:27:34,150

And the rotation continues, right? I

8502
03:27:34,150 --> 03:27:34,160
And the rotation continues, right? I
 

8503
03:27:34,160 --> 03:27:35,510
And the rotation continues, right? I
need to get out of here, man. What am I

8504
03:27:35,510 --> 03:27:35,520
need to get out of here, man. What am I
 

8505
03:27:35,520 --> 03:27:45,110
need to get out of here, man. What am I
doing? Um,

8506
03:27:45,110 --> 03:27:45,120

 

8507
03:27:45,120 --> 03:27:46,710

been trading silver more. Is it possible

8508
03:27:46,710 --> 03:27:46,720
been trading silver more. Is it possible
 

8509
03:27:46,720 --> 03:27:48,070
been trading silver more. Is it possible
to go over it? I can have a quick look

8510
03:27:48,070 --> 03:27:48,080
to go over it? I can have a quick look
 

8511
03:27:48,080 --> 03:27:50,389
to go over it? I can have a quick look
at it.

8512
03:27:50,389 --> 03:27:50,399
at it.
 

8513
03:27:50,399 --> 03:27:54,630
at it.
Nice bounce back today.

8514
03:27:54,630 --> 03:27:54,640

 

8515
03:27:54,640 --> 03:27:58,229

Right. Structurally

8516
03:27:58,229 --> 03:27:58,239

 

8517
03:27:58,239 --> 03:28:02,790

looks good.

8518
03:28:02,790 --> 03:28:02,800

 

8519
03:28:02,800 --> 03:28:04,309

All right. So, here's your failure to

8520
03:28:04,309 --> 03:28:04,319
All right. So, here's your failure to
 

8521
03:28:04,319 --> 03:28:06,309
All right. So, here's your failure to
make a new high from the other day.

8522
03:28:06,309 --> 03:28:06,319
make a new high from the other day.
 

8523
03:28:06,319 --> 03:28:08,950
make a new high from the other day.
There's the wash. Remember, this is on

8524
03:28:08,950 --> 03:28:08,960
There's the wash. Remember, this is on
 

8525
03:28:08,960 --> 03:28:12,309
There's the wash. Remember, this is on
the new futures

8526
03:28:12,309 --> 03:28:12,319
the new futures
 

8527
03:28:12,319 --> 03:28:14,630
the new futures
uh requirements, margin requirements. We

8528
03:28:14,630 --> 03:28:14,640
uh requirements, margin requirements. We
 

8529
03:28:14,640 --> 03:28:17,670
uh requirements, margin requirements. We
wash down key. Uh, in my opinion, we

8530
03:28:17,670 --> 03:28:17,680
wash down key. Uh, in my opinion, we
 

8531
03:28:17,680 --> 03:28:19,269
wash down key. Uh, in my opinion, we
hold this pivot. All right, this pivot's

8532
03:28:19,269 --> 03:28:19,279
hold this pivot. All right, this pivot's
 

8533
03:28:19,279 --> 03:28:24,309

held,

8534
03:28:24,309 --> 03:28:24,319

 

8535
03:28:24,319 --> 03:28:26,710

right? We hold the pivot. We've built

8536
03:28:26,710 --> 03:28:26,720
right? We hold the pivot. We've built
 

8537
03:28:26,720 --> 03:28:28,389
right? We hold the pivot. We've built
liquidity. We're going back upside now,

8538
03:28:28,389 --> 03:28:28,399
liquidity. We're going back upside now,
 

8539
03:28:28,399 --> 03:28:29,990
liquidity. We're going back upside now,
and we're going to repric. Uh, where are

8540
03:28:29,990 --> 03:28:30,000
and we're going to repric. Uh, where are
 

8541
03:28:30,000 --> 03:28:32,070
and we're going to repric. Uh, where are
the key levels? Well, clearly we go from

8542
03:28:32,070 --> 03:28:32,080
the key levels? Well, clearly we go from
 

8543
03:28:32,080 --> 03:28:35,269
the key levels? Well, clearly we go from
pivot high, pivot low. We're coming

8544
03:28:35,269 --> 03:28:35,279
pivot high, pivot low. We're coming
 

8545
03:28:35,279 --> 03:28:36,790
pivot high, pivot low. We're coming
right into one. All right, we're coming

8546
03:28:36,790 --> 03:28:36,800
right into one. All right, we're coming
 

8547
03:28:36,800 --> 03:28:40,229
right into one. All right, we're coming
right into that 61 fib.

8548
03:28:40,229 --> 03:28:40,239
right into that 61 fib.
 

8549
03:28:40,239 --> 03:28:42,630
right into that 61 fib.
If I was a short seller, it's very

8550
03:28:42,630 --> 03:28:42,640
If I was a short seller, it's very
 

8551
03:28:42,640 --> 03:28:44,950
If I was a short seller, it's very
simple. If I was a short seller, I would

8552
03:28:44,950 --> 03:28:44,960
simple. If I was a short seller, I would
 

8553
03:28:44,960 --> 03:28:46,710
simple. If I was a short seller, I would
want to be selling in this block here

8554
03:28:46,710 --> 03:28:46,720
want to be selling in this block here
 

8555
03:28:46,720 --> 03:28:49,030
want to be selling in this block here
and more notably in this block here,

8556
03:28:49,030 --> 03:28:49,040
and more notably in this block here,
 

8557
03:28:49,040 --> 03:28:50,950
and more notably in this block here,
right? I'd want to be forcing the hand

8558
03:28:50,950 --> 03:28:50,960
right? I'd want to be forcing the hand
 

8559
03:28:50,960 --> 03:28:52,550
right? I'd want to be forcing the hand
here. Now, if I can get a failure to

8560
03:28:52,550 --> 03:28:52,560
here. Now, if I can get a failure to
 

8561
03:28:52,560 --> 03:28:54,070
here. Now, if I can get a failure to
follow through up here as a short

8562
03:28:54,070 --> 03:28:54,080
follow through up here as a short
 

8563
03:28:54,080 --> 03:28:56,950
follow through up here as a short
seller, right? If bulls bulls are

8564
03:28:56,950 --> 03:28:56,960
seller, right? If bulls bulls are
 

8565
03:28:56,960 --> 03:28:58,630
seller, right? If bulls bulls are
trapped here, if I can use their pain

8566
03:28:58,630 --> 03:28:58,640
trapped here, if I can use their pain
 

8567
03:28:58,640 --> 03:29:00,790
trapped here, if I can use their pain
and come down and get a break, [snorts]

8568
03:29:00,790 --> 03:29:00,800
and come down and get a break, [snorts]
 

8569
03:29:00,800 --> 03:29:02,710
and come down and get a break, [snorts]
right, we can look for a lower price.

8570
03:29:02,710 --> 03:29:02,720
right, we can look for a lower price.
 

8571
03:29:02,720 --> 03:29:05,750
right, we can look for a lower price.
But overall, momentum is what? It's very

8572
03:29:05,750 --> 03:29:05,760
But overall, momentum is what? It's very
 

8573
03:29:05,760 --> 03:29:07,269
But overall, momentum is what? It's very
bullish. If we look at the daily, we're

8574
03:29:07,269 --> 03:29:07,279
bullish. If we look at the daily, we're
 

8575
03:29:07,279 --> 03:29:09,429
bullish. If we look at the daily, we're
bullish. We had an inside bar being

8576
03:29:09,429 --> 03:29:09,439
bullish. We had an inside bar being
 

8577
03:29:09,439 --> 03:29:10,710
bullish. We had an inside bar being
created today. This is what I talked

8578
03:29:10,710 --> 03:29:10,720
created today. This is what I talked
 

8579
03:29:10,720 --> 03:29:13,670
created today. This is what I talked
about yesterday. Macro wise, can this

8580
03:29:13,670 --> 03:29:13,680
about yesterday. Macro wise, can this
 

8581
03:29:13,680 --> 03:29:16,550
about yesterday. Macro wise, can this
keep going up? Yes. Silver um about to

03:29:16,550 --> 03:29:16,560
keep going up? Yes. Silver um about to
 

8583
03:29:16,560 --> 03:29:18,070

have new legislation put in in China

8584
03:29:18,070 --> 03:29:18,080
have new legislation put in in China
 

8585
03:29:18,080 --> 03:29:19,269
have new legislation put in in China
where you have to sign all sorts of

8586
03:29:19,269 --> 03:29:19,279
where you have to sign all sorts of
 

8587
03:29:19,279 --> 03:29:20,870
where you have to sign all sorts of
[\h__\h] documentation to bring it out of

8588
03:29:20,870 --> 03:29:20,880
[\h__\h] documentation to bring it out of
 

8589
03:29:20,880 --> 03:29:24,710
[\h__\h] documentation to bring it out of
China. So, uh scarcity might or a lack

8590
03:29:24,710 --> 03:29:24,720
China. So, uh scarcity might or a lack
 

8591
03:29:24,720 --> 03:29:27,110
China. So, uh scarcity might or a lack
of supply, right? If we get more of a

8592
03:29:27,110 --> 03:29:27,120
of supply, right? If we get more of a
 

8593
03:29:27,120 --> 03:29:28,790
of supply, right? If we get more of a
lack of supply, we can have increased

8594
03:29:28,790 --> 03:29:28,800
lack of supply, we can have increased
 

8595
03:29:28,800 --> 03:29:31,269
lack of supply, we can have increased
prices. This is also a peg or a hedge I

8596
03:29:31,269 --> 03:29:31,279
prices. This is also a peg or a hedge I
 

8597
03:29:31,279 --> 03:29:33,910
prices. This is also a peg or a hedge I
should say against the dollar with gold.

8598
03:29:33,910 --> 03:29:33,920
should say against the dollar with gold.
 

8599
03:29:33,920 --> 03:29:36,710
should say against the dollar with gold.
All right? So Asia Asian markets

to come out of the dollar

8604
03:29:46,389 --> 03:29:46,399
to come out of the dollar
 

8605
03:29:46,399 --> 03:29:49,269
to come out of the dollar
to daily right Asian markets continue to

come out of
 

8611
03:29:53,920 --> 03:29:57,750
come out of
MAG or they might come out of MAG. Let's

8612
03:29:57,750 --> 03:29:57,760
MAG or they might come out of MAG. Let's
 

8613
03:29:57,760 --> 03:29:59,990
MAG or they might come out of MAG. Let's
just go

8614
03:29:59,990 --> 03:30:00,000
just go
 

8615
03:30:00,000 --> 03:30:07,110
just go
and beyond mags to be honest.

8616
03:30:07,110 --> 03:30:07,120

 

8617
03:30:07,120 --> 03:30:08,950

All right. Out if they come rotate out

8618
03:30:08,950 --> 03:30:08,960
All right. Out if they come rotate out
 

8619
03:30:08,960 --> 03:30:11,830
All right. Out if they come rotate out
of mags

8620
03:30:11,830 --> 03:30:11,840
of mags
 

8621
03:30:11,840 --> 03:30:13,750
of mags
and put downside pressure. All right.

8622
03:30:13,750 --> 03:30:13,760
and put downside pressure. All right.
 

8623
03:30:13,760 --> 03:30:15,990
and put downside pressure. All right.
Because they need

8624
03:30:15,990 --> 03:30:16,000
Because they need
 

8625
03:30:16,000 --> 03:30:19,030
Because they need
the extra uh equity to deal with what's

8626
03:30:19,030 --> 03:30:19,040
the extra uh equity to deal with what's
 

8627
03:30:19,040 --> 03:30:20,870
the extra uh equity to deal with what's
going on with the Bank of Japan. All

8628
03:30:20,870 --> 03:30:20,880
going on with the Bank of Japan. All
 

8629
03:30:20,880 --> 03:30:22,550
going on with the Bank of Japan. All
right. If they do this kind of move here

8630
03:30:22,550 --> 03:30:22,560
right. If they do this kind of move here
 

8631
03:30:22,560 --> 03:30:25,190
right. If they do this kind of move here
on the mags for early 2026, then I think

8632
03:30:25,190 --> 03:30:25,200
on the mags for early 2026, then I think
 

8633
03:30:25,200 --> 03:30:26,309
on the mags for early 2026, then I think
you're going to see gold and silver

8634
03:30:26,309 --> 03:30:26,319
you're going to see gold and silver
 

8635
03:30:26,319 --> 03:30:28,229
you're going to see gold and silver
continue to rally. It's big if but may,

8636
03:30:28,229 --> 03:30:28,239
continue to rally. It's big if but may,
 

8637
03:30:28,239 --> 03:30:31,510
continue to rally. It's big if but may,
but that this looks strong. All right,

8638
03:30:31,510 --> 03:30:31,520
but that this looks strong. All right,
 

8639
03:30:31,520 --> 03:30:33,590
but that this looks strong. All right,
this looks very very very very very

8640
03:30:33,590 --> 03:30:33,600
this looks very very very very very
 

8641
03:30:33,600 --> 03:30:35,110
this looks very very very very very
strong. Uh if shorts are going to come

8642
03:30:35,110 --> 03:30:35,120
strong. Uh if shorts are going to come
 

8643
03:30:35,120 --> 03:30:36,229
strong. Uh if shorts are going to come
in, they're going to have to come in the

8644
03:30:36,229 --> 03:30:36,239
in, they're going to have to come in the
 

8645
03:30:36,239 --> 03:30:38,870
in, they're going to have to come in the
next few sessions. All right, but these

8646
03:30:38,870 --> 03:30:38,880
next few sessions. All right, but these
 

8647
03:30:38,880 --> 03:30:40,870
next few sessions. All right, but these
bases can take a while to form. I would

8648
03:30:40,870 --> 03:30:40,880
bases can take a while to form. I would
 

8649
03:30:40,880 --> 03:30:42,790
bases can take a while to form. I would
say that in the metals, if we think

8650
03:30:42,790 --> 03:30:42,800
say that in the metals, if we think
 

8651
03:30:42,800 --> 03:30:44,870
say that in the metals, if we think
about what happened

8652
03:30:44,870 --> 03:30:44,880
about what happened
 

8653
03:30:44,880 --> 03:30:47,030
about what happened
last time,

8654
03:30:47,030 --> 03:30:47,040
last time,
 

8655
03:30:47,040 --> 03:30:48,550
last time,
all right, we had these big flush out

8656
03:30:48,550 --> 03:30:48,560
all right, we had these big flush out
 

8657
03:30:48,560 --> 03:30:50,469
all right, we had these big flush out
moves, these reversal flush out moves.

8658
03:30:50,469 --> 03:30:50,479
moves, these reversal flush out moves.
 

8659
03:30:50,479 --> 03:30:53,269
moves, these reversal flush out moves.
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Based

8660
03:30:53,269 --> 03:30:53,279
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Based
 

8661
03:30:53,279 --> 03:30:56,550
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Based
settled. This was from October, really a

8662
03:30:56,550 --> 03:30:56,560
settled. This was from October, really a
 

8663
03:30:56,560 --> 03:30:58,150
settled. This was from October, really a
month, month and a half. All right,

8664
03:30:58,150 --> 03:30:58,160
month, month and a half. All right,
 

8665
03:30:58,160 --> 03:30:59,510
month, month and a half. All right,
before this sort of cup and handle

8666
03:30:59,510 --> 03:30:59,520
before this sort of cup and handle
 

8667
03:30:59,520 --> 03:31:01,510
before this sort of cup and handle
break, all right, momentum is still

8668
03:31:01,510 --> 03:31:01,520
break, all right, momentum is still
 

8669
03:31:01,520 --> 03:31:03,510
break, all right, momentum is still
bullish. If we still fail to follow

8670
03:31:03,510 --> 03:31:03,520
bullish. If we still fail to follow
 

8671
03:31:03,520 --> 03:31:04,630
bullish. If we still fail to follow
through in something like this, then

8672
03:31:04,630 --> 03:31:04,640
through in something like this, then
 

8673
03:31:04,640 --> 03:31:06,229
through in something like this, then
yeah, I think we can return back down to

8674
03:31:06,229 --> 03:31:06,239
yeah, I think we can return back down to
 

8675
03:31:06,239 --> 03:31:08,710
yeah, I think we can return back down to
these 50s. But it like if you

8676
03:31:08,710 --> 03:31:08,720
these 50s. But it like if you
 

8677
03:31:08,720 --> 03:31:10,870
these 50s. But it like if you
accumulated in here, I think you're good

8678
03:31:10,870 --> 03:31:10,880
accumulated in here, I think you're good
 

8679
03:31:10,880 --> 03:31:12,870
accumulated in here, I think you're good
to hold. But you you'd want to see a new

8680
03:31:12,870 --> 03:31:12,880
to hold. But you you'd want to see a new
 

8681
03:31:12,880 --> 03:31:14,870
to hold. But you you'd want to see a new
high or a base out. So you either want

8682
03:31:14,870 --> 03:31:14,880
high or a base out. So you either want
 

8683
03:31:14,880 --> 03:31:17,510
high or a base out. So you either want
to see this reclaim or a base out in

8684
03:31:17,510 --> 03:31:17,520
to see this reclaim or a base out in
 

8685
03:31:17,520 --> 03:31:19,110
to see this reclaim or a base out in
here. What you don't want to see is a

8686
03:31:19,110 --> 03:31:19,120
here. What you don't want to see is a
 

8687
03:31:19,120 --> 03:31:21,190
here. What you don't want to see is a
failure to follow through and this move

8688
03:31:21,190 --> 03:31:21,200
failure to follow through and this move
 

8689
03:31:21,200 --> 03:31:22,229
failure to follow through and this move
here, right? You don't want to be

8690
03:31:22,229 --> 03:31:22,239
here, right? You don't want to be
 

8691
03:31:22,239 --> 03:31:24,469
here, right? You don't want to be
holding through that.

8692
03:31:24,469 --> 03:31:24,479
holding through that.
 

8693
03:31:24,479 --> 03:31:26,790
holding through that.
But overall, macro environment wise, it

8694
03:31:26,790 --> 03:31:26,800
But overall, macro environment wise, it
 

8695
03:31:26,800 --> 03:31:28,710
But overall, macro environment wise, it
looks good. Like, is it overextended? I

8696
03:31:28,710 --> 03:31:28,720
looks good. Like, is it overextended? I
 

8697
03:31:28,720 --> 03:31:29,830
looks good. Like, is it overextended? I
mean, absolutely. We went over it

8698
03:31:29,830 --> 03:31:29,840
mean, absolutely. We went over it
 

8699
03:31:29,840 --> 03:31:31,510
mean, absolutely. We went over it
yesterday. It's well past two standard

8700
03:31:31,510 --> 03:31:31,520
yesterday. It's well past two standard
 

8701
03:31:31,520 --> 03:31:33,910
yesterday. It's well past two standard
deviations. I think it hit 2.6 standard

8702
03:31:33,910 --> 03:31:33,920
deviations. I think it hit 2.6 standard
 

8703
03:31:33,920 --> 03:31:36,389
deviations. I think it hit 2.6 standard
deviations on a daily. Well, well, well,

8704
03:31:36,389 --> 03:31:36,399
deviations on a daily. Well, well, well,
 

8705
03:31:36,399 --> 03:31:38,630
deviations on a daily. Well, well, well,
well past it.

8706
03:31:38,630 --> 03:31:38,640
well past it.
 

8707
03:31:38,640 --> 03:31:40,870
well past it.
