00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960

 

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,509

There we go. Okay, so starting off on

6
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:15,519
There we go. Okay, so starting off on
 

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,390
There we go. Okay, so starting off on
the daily as we always do, we can see

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,400
the daily as we always do, we can see
 

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,230
the daily as we always do, we can see
like we talked about yesterday. Friday

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
like we talked about yesterday. Friday
 

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,230
like we talked about yesterday. Friday
we left the old balance range. Yesterday

12
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,240
we left the old balance range. Yesterday
 

13
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,950
we left the old balance range. Yesterday
we back tested stayed heavy and

14
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
we back tested stayed heavy and
 

15
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,589
we back tested stayed heavy and
overnight you would have seen my uh

16
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
overnight you would have seen my uh
 

17
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,470
overnight you would have seen my uh
level traded into uh now that level

18
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
level traded into uh now that level
 

19
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,990
level traded into uh now that level
adjusted

20
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
adjusted
 

21
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,870
adjusted
is 25180.

22
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:34,880
is 25180.
 

23
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,830
is 25180.
All right 25180 that's the naked point

24
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:37,840
All right 25180 that's the naked point
 

25
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,270
All right 25180 that's the naked point
of control that we were looking for that

26
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
of control that we were looking for that
 

27
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,030
of control that we were looking for that
trade into which on the old contract was

28
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,040
trade into which on the old contract was
 

29
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,350
trade into which on the old contract was
25 930. So we've tagged it overnight and

30
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
25 930. So we've tagged it overnight and
 

31
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,270
25 930. So we've tagged it overnight and
uh we're starting to try and bid back

32
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280
uh we're starting to try and bid back
 

33
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,790
uh we're starting to try and bid back
up. So what are we watching? Really

34
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:48,800
up. So what are we watching? Really
 

35
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,630
up. So what are we watching? Really
simple, isn't it? We're watching this

36
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640
simple, isn't it? We're watching this
 

37
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,470
simple, isn't it? We're watching this
transition point here. All right, this

38
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,480
transition point here. All right, this
 

39
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,389
transition point here. All right, this
transition point here. This transition

40
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
transition point here. This transition
 

41
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,630
transition point here. This transition
point here. If we go in rotation, we're

42
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640
point here. If we go in rotation, we're
 

43
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,310
point here. If we go in rotation, we're
going to go inside here. We still have

44
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
going to go inside here. We still have
 

45
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,869
going to go inside here. We still have
this low volume node here. All right,

46
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
this low volume node here. All right,
 

47
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,310
this low volume node here. All right,
and that really needs to act as

48
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
and that really needs to act as
 

49
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,509
and that really needs to act as
resistance for bears. Very very simple.

50
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
resistance for bears. Very very simple.
 

51
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,990
resistance for bears. Very very simple.
They must must must

52
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
They must must must
 

53
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,990
They must must must
protect this. Failing to protect that

54
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000
protect this. Failing to protect that
 

55
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,789
protect this. Failing to protect that
from bears, right, will mean this whole

56
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
from bears, right, will mean this whole
 

57
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,789
from bears, right, will mean this whole
area here will get bears caught. And if

58
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
area here will get bears caught. And if
 

59
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,469
area here will get bears caught. And if
we start coming back up, we can come and

60
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
we start coming back up, we can come and
 

61
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,590
we start coming back up, we can come and
test. Well, yes, obviously 570s, but

62
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
test. Well, yes, obviously 570s, but
 

63
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,630
test. Well, yes, obviously 570s, but
into the six 650s and old range. And if

64
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
into the six 650s and old range. And if
 

65
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,469
into the six 650s and old range. And if
we get acceptance in there, we'll be

66
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
we get acceptance in there, we'll be
 

67
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,910
we get acceptance in there, we'll be
looking for a breakout to the upside

68
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:25,920
looking for a breakout to the upside
 

69
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,270
looking for a breakout to the upside
because this will be a look below and

70
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
because this will be a look below and
 

71
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,030
because this will be a look below and
fail back into range and upside. If

72
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
fail back into range and upside. If
 

73
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,109
fail back into range and upside. If
you're saying, why have I shifted? Well,

74
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
you're saying, why have I shifted? Well,
 

75
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,870
you're saying, why have I shifted? Well,
I haven't shifted yet. But what I would

76
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
I haven't shifted yet. But what I would
 

77
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,950
I haven't shifted yet. But what I would
say is down here, I said if bulls are

78
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
say is down here, I said if bulls are
 

79
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,149
say is down here, I said if bulls are
going to defend, this is where they're

80
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
going to defend, this is where they're
 

81
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,429
going to defend, this is where they're
going to defend. That is the buying

82
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
going to defend. That is the buying
 

83
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,270
going to defend. That is the buying
opportunity. It happened overnight. And

84
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
opportunity. It happened overnight. And
 

85
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,749
opportunity. It happened overnight. And
if we move on to the hourly charts, I'm

86
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
if we move on to the hourly charts, I'm
 

87
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,469
if we move on to the hourly charts, I'm
going to show you how and why. All

88
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
going to show you how and why. All
 

89
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,310
going to show you how and why. All
right, this was the level. This red line

90
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
right, this was the level. This red line
 

91
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,910
right, this was the level. This red line
in the green box was the level I felt

92
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:47,920
in the green box was the level I felt
 

93
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,830
in the green box was the level I felt
like the market would draw into and then

94
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840
like the market would draw into and then
 

95
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,990
like the market would draw into and then
it would be up to bulls to defend it.

96
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
it would be up to bulls to defend it.
 

97
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,910
it would be up to bulls to defend it.
So, we've drawn into it so far. They

98
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:53,920
So, we've drawn into it so far. They
 

99
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,190
So, we've drawn into it so far. They
defended it. I would question right

100
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
defended it. I would question right
 

101
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,429
defended it. I would question right
right now, very simply, can bulls defend

102
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
right now, very simply, can bulls defend
 

103
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,830
right now, very simply, can bulls defend
this box here now, right? Can they

104
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
this box here now, right? Can they
 

105
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,429
this box here now, right? Can they
produce in the New York session a higher

106
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
produce in the New York session a higher
 

107
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,510
produce in the New York session a higher
low over this box? If they can produce

108
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:07,520
low over this box? If they can produce
 

109
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,029
low over this box? If they can produce
that, their next job is to get back

110
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,039
that, their next job is to get back
 

111
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,110
that, their next job is to get back
inside previous days value area low. If

112
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
inside previous days value area low. If
 

113
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,110
inside previous days value area low. If
they do that, they need to go back to

114
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
they do that, they need to go back to
 

115
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,270
they do that, they need to go back to
the upside into previous days value area

116
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,280
the upside into previous days value area
 

117
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,270
the upside into previous days value area
high. I doubt they're able to do much

118
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
high. I doubt they're able to do much
 

119
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,190
high. I doubt they're able to do much
more than that today. But if they are,

120
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
more than that today. But if they are,
 

121
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,589
more than that today. But if they are,
then the next job is to base up here to

122
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
then the next job is to base up here to
 

123
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,190
then the next job is to base up here to
get back into previous week's value. All

124
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
get back into previous week's value. All
 

125
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,270
get back into previous week's value. All
right, that is the bull's job. All

126
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,280
right, that is the bull's job. All
 

127
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,670
right, that is the bull's job. All
right, this is all counter trend. All of

128
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:27,680
right, this is all counter trend. All of
 

129
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,350
right, this is all counter trend. All of
this counter trend until we get

130
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
this counter trend until we get
 

131
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,110
this counter trend until we get
acceptance back into previous week's

132
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
acceptance back into previous week's
 

133
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,550
acceptance back into previous week's
value. Just so that you are aware,

134
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
value. Just so that you are aware,
 

135
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,430
value. Just so that you are aware,
bear's job's quite simple, isn't it?

136
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
bear's job's quite simple, isn't it?
 

137
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,190
bear's job's quite simple, isn't it?
They want to stay underneath yesterday's

138
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
They want to stay underneath yesterday's
 

139
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,790
They want to stay underneath yesterday's
value. There's yesterday's value. All

140
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:40,800
value. There's yesterday's value. All
 

141
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,550
value. There's yesterday's value. All
right. They don't want acceptance back

142
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,560
right. They don't want acceptance back
 

143
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,990
right. They don't want acceptance back
into yesterday's value. If they defend

144
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
into yesterday's value. If they defend
 

145
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,670
into yesterday's value. If they defend
that, they'll be looking for a New York

146
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680
that, they'll be looking for a New York
 

147
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,309
that, they'll be looking for a New York
test of this naked point of control. If

148
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
test of this naked point of control. If
 

149
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,910
test of this naked point of control. If
we sell that naked point of control,

150
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:49,920
we sell that naked point of control,
 

151
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,430
we sell that naked point of control,
then look out below because if we look

152
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
then look out below because if we look
 

153
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,750
then look out below because if we look
on the daily, right, if we're going to

154
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
on the daily, right, if we're going to
 

155
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,150
on the daily, right, if we're going to
sell that, the next real level that we

156
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
sell that, the next real level that we
 

157
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,910
sell that, the next real level that we
can think about is probably this high

158
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
can think about is probably this high
 

159
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,869
can think about is probably this high
volume node all the way down here. And

160
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
volume node all the way down here. And
 

161
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,309
volume node all the way down here. And
that is what 800s.

162
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319

 

163
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,990

Is that on the old contract? It's not

164
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
Is that on the old contract? It's not
 

165
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,550
Is that on the old contract? It's not
adjusted, is it?

166
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
adjusted, is it?
 

167
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,390
adjusted, is it?
How do we hit low here? Oh, it is

168
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
How do we hit low here? Oh, it is
 

169
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,589
How do we hit low here? Oh, it is
adjusted. Okay, 248.

170
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
adjusted. Okay, 248.
 

171
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,270
adjusted. Okay, 248.
248. All right. So, we can mark one down

172
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
248. All right. So, we can mark one down
 

173
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,750
248. All right. So, we can mark one down
here.

174
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
here.
 

175
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,352
here.
All right. That's the next level.

176
00:03:24,352 --> 00:03:24,362
All right. That's the next level.
 

177
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:25,830
All right. That's the next level.
[snorts] So, that's what we're watching

178
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
[snorts] So, that's what we're watching
 

179
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,790
[snorts] So, that's what we're watching
for. All right. Do bulls hold the

180
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:28,800
for. All right. Do bulls hold the
 

181
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,869
for. All right. Do bulls hold the
rotation or do bears defend previous

182
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
rotation or do bears defend previous
 

183
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,350
rotation or do bears defend previous
day's value? If we get back inside of

184
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
day's value? If we get back inside of
 

185
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,750
day's value? If we get back inside of
yesterday's value, then we're going to

186
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
yesterday's value, then we're going to
 

187
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,149
yesterday's value, then we're going to
look for rotations inside previous day's

188
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
look for rotations inside previous day's
 

189
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,710
look for rotations inside previous day's
value. All right, very very simple. So

190
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
value. All right, very very simple. So
 

191
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,509
value. All right, very very simple. So
bull's job will be to defend this. All

192
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:43,519
bull's job will be to defend this. All
 

193
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,270
bull's job will be to defend this. All
right, that's the bull's job to get back

194
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
right, that's the bull's job to get back
 

195
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,149
right, that's the bull's job to get back
to here. Bear's job is first stop to

196
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
to here. Bear's job is first stop to
 

197
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,309
to here. Bear's job is first stop to
defend this, right? And get down to

198
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
defend this, right? And get down to
 

199
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,149
defend this, right? And get down to
there. Those are the rotations early

200
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
there. Those are the rotations early
 

201
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,470
there. Those are the rotations early
morning. Once we make our mind beyond

202
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
morning. Once we make our mind beyond
 

203
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,309
morning. Once we make our mind beyond
that, either we're going to melt or

204
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
that, either we're going to melt or
 

205
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,910
that, either we're going to melt or
we're going to get back into range if we

206
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
we're going to get back into range if we
 

207
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,910
we're going to get back into range if we
find acceptance back into value. Bull's

208
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
find acceptance back into value. Bull's
 

209
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,910
find acceptance back into value. Bull's
next job is to get back to the top side.

210
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
next job is to get back to the top side.
 

211
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,830
next job is to get back to the top side.
Bears will desperately want to defend

212
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
Bears will desperately want to defend
 

213
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,990
Bears will desperately want to defend
this. The rotation can take place there.

214
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
this. The rotation can take place there.
 

215
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,670
this. The rotation can take place there.
If there's no rotation, there is a

216
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
If there's no rotation, there is a
 

217
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,949
If there's no rotation, there is a
squeeze potential. That's what we're

218
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
squeeze potential. That's what we're
 

219
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,550
squeeze potential. That's what we're
looking at in the market today, folks.

220
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
looking at in the market today, folks.
 

221
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,470
looking at in the market today, folks.
All right.

222
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
All right.
 

223
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,270
All right.
If we come up to uh 5m minute above, you

224
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
If we come up to uh 5m minute above, you
 

225
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,189
If we come up to uh 5m minute above, you
can just see how we've built that

226
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
can just see how we've built that
 

227
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,069
can just see how we've built that
liquidity. All right. So, yesterday we

228
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
liquidity. All right. So, yesterday we
 

229
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,150
liquidity. All right. So, yesterday we
participated in that big sell. All

230
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
participated in that big sell. All
 

231
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,150
participated in that big sell. All
right. There was a rally back. We sold

232
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
right. There was a rally back. We sold
 

233
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,310
right. There was a rally back. We sold
that back down. Overnight we came into

234
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
that back down. Overnight we came into
 

235
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,870
that back down. Overnight we came into
key level. We've gone sideways or we've

236
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
key level. We've gone sideways or we've
 

237
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,469
key level. We've gone sideways or we've
gone lower, but we've gone sideways and

238
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
gone lower, but we've gone sideways and
 

239
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,230
gone lower, but we've gone sideways and
potentially build out a base here. Too

240
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
potentially build out a base here. Too
 

241
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,909
potentially build out a base here. Too
early to say if we've successfully built

242
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
early to say if we've successfully built
 

243
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,070
early to say if we've successfully built
that out, but that is what the market is

244
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
that out, but that is what the market is
 

245
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,350
that out, but that is what the market is
looking at.

246
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360

 

247
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,310

And if we get into

248
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320

 

249
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,150

five minute chart, let's have a look

250
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
five minute chart, let's have a look
 

251
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,710
five minute chart, let's have a look
across the board right now.

252
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720

 

253
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,950

All right, ES same kind of job right

254
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
All right, ES same kind of job right
 

255
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,230
All right, ES same kind of job right
here. Have to adjust some of these.

256
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
here. Have to adjust some of these.
 

257
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,990
here. Have to adjust some of these.
Right. One thing with ES to understand

258
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
Right. One thing with ES to understand
 

259
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,230
Right. One thing with ES to understand
is if we go onto a daily,

260
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240

 

261
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,230

right, it's yet to leave that balance

262
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
right, it's yet to leave that balance
 

263
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,830
right, it's yet to leave that balance
range. Today's actually the first day.

264
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840
range. Today's actually the first day.
 

265
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,070
range. Today's actually the first day.
So if you think about the daily, there's

266
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
So if you think about the daily, there's
 

267
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,070
So if you think about the daily, there's
the attempt to move higher. There's the

268
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
the attempt to move higher. There's the
 

269
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,629
the attempt to move higher. There's the
crack yesterday. If we can't get

270
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
crack yesterday. If we can't get
 

271
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,510
crack yesterday. If we can't get
acceptance, I'd say 900's your level on

272
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
acceptance, I'd say 900's your level on
 

273
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,590
acceptance, I'd say 900's your level on
ES. All right, we can set a price alert

274
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
ES. All right, we can set a price alert
 

275
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,629
ES. All right, we can set a price alert
there. 900 there or thereabouts, that's

276
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
there. 900 there or thereabouts, that's
 

277
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,070
there. 900 there or thereabouts, that's
the edge of the range, right? That's

278
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
the edge of the range, right? That's
 

279
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,390
the edge of the range, right? That's
where ES is trying to get back above.

280
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
where ES is trying to get back above.
 

281
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,629
where ES is trying to get back above.
Right. If ES gets back above that, we go

282
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
Right. If ES gets back above that, we go
 

283
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,029
Right. If ES gets back above that, we go
into old range, maybe they do a rotation

284
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
into old range, maybe they do a rotation
 

285
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,790
into old range, maybe they do a rotation
in here and can finish the year strong.

286
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
in here and can finish the year strong.
 

287
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,790
in here and can finish the year strong.
If they come up and they keep like

288
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
If they come up and they keep like
 

289
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,870
If they come up and they keep like
selling into this, then we're looking

290
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
selling into this, then we're looking
 

291
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,629
selling into this, then we're looking
for downside pressure. We've got some

292
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
for downside pressure. We've got some
 

293
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,230
for downside pressure. We've got some
imbalances here to come back down and

294
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
imbalances here to come back down and
 

295
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,550
imbalances here to come back down and
fill.

296
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
fill.
 

297
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,230
fill.
Okay, if you're struggling with the

298
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
Okay, if you're struggling with the
 

299
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,749
Okay, if you're struggling with the
levels today, make it easier for

300
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
levels today, make it easier for
 

301
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,510
levels today, make it easier for
yourself. All right, just go to the uh

302
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
yourself. All right, just go to the uh
 

303

ETFs. All right, really easy. Go to the
 

305
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,550
ETFs. All right, really easy. Go to the
spy where you can see the box. We're now

306
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
spy where you can see the box. We're now
 

307
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,469
spy where you can see the box. We're now
trading underneath it. Go to the cues.

308
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
trading underneath it. Go to the cues.
 

309
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,629
trading underneath it. Go to the cues.
We can come to a fiveminute chart,

310
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
We can come to a fiveminute chart,
 

311
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,550
We can come to a fiveminute chart,
right? Just plot the levels on the spy

312
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
right? Just plot the levels on the spy
 

313
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,629
right? Just plot the levels on the spy
and the Q's. You can see there's top

side, there's the bottom side that we're

316
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
side, there's the bottom side that we're
 

317
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,950
side, there's the bottom side that we're
trying to leave. Same on the Q's, right?

318
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
trying to leave. Same on the Q's, right?
 

319
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,510
trying to leave. Same on the Q's, right?
You can move this down.

320
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
You can move this down.
 

321
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,350
You can move this down.
This is current resistance. Just make it

322
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,360
This is current resistance. Just make it
 

323
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,270
This is current resistance. Just make it
easy for yourself. Just have the spying

remainder of this week until we've got
 

329
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,230
remainder of this week until we've got
enough data. [snorts]

All right. Interesting. Dixie

332
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
All right. Interesting. Dixie

All right. Interesting. Dixie
puked out on that uh 8:30 and then

334
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
puked out on that uh 8:30 and then
 

335
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,629
puked out on that uh 8:30 and then
reclaimed it. the complete opposite to

00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
reclaimed it. the complete opposite to
 

337
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,469

00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800

 

341
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,070

Where we at?

342
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080

 

343
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,070

Just trading in a range for me. But um

344
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
Just trading in a range for me. But um
 

345
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,710
Just trading in a range for me. But um
like I said, when we come down here, we

346
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:38,720
like I said, when we come down here, we
 

347
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,790
like I said, when we come down here, we
historically into these areas, we often

348
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
historically into these areas, we often
 

349
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,230
historically into these areas, we often
find nasty moves out of them. We're

350
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
find nasty moves out of them. We're
 

351
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,309
find nasty moves out of them. We're
starting to see that. Bitcoin's found a

352
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
starting to see that. Bitcoin's found a
 

353
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,430
starting to see that. Bitcoin's found a
bit of a bid. All right, let's go

354
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
bit of a bid. All right, let's go
 

355
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,950
bit of a bid. All right, let's go
through the mag.

356
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960

 

357
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,270

All right, gap down on Apple after that

358
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
All right, gap down on Apple after that
 

359
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,670
All right, gap down on Apple after that
news. Uh they are really pushing for

360
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
news. Uh they are really pushing for
 

361
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,510
news. Uh they are really pushing for
Apple to be punished for uh its

362
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,520
Apple to be punished for uh its
 

363
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,110
Apple to be punished for uh its
treatment of apps. So if they fail this,

364
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120

 

365
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,670

there is a rotation back down into here.

366
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
there is a rotation back down into here.
 

367
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,110
there is a rotation back down into here.
All right. So if they start losing that,

368
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
All right. So if they start losing that,
 

369
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:15,350
All right. So if they start losing that,
so that's the level on Apple uh Amazon.

370
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360

 

371
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,070

It's tricky into this. That's that look

372
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080
It's tricky into this. That's that look
 

373
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,629
It's tricky into this. That's that look
above building liquidity here. And it

374
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
above building liquidity here. And it
 

375
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,070
above building liquidity here. And it
doesn't look ready to go either way yet,

376
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080
doesn't look ready to go either way yet,
 

377
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,469
doesn't look ready to go either way yet,
but that's what it's starting to do. Oh,

378
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
but that's what it's starting to do. Oh,
 

379
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,749
but that's what it's starting to do. Oh,
we're gapping down. We're flat on

380
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
we're gapping down. We're flat on
 

381
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,589
we're gapping down. We're flat on
Amazon. So, no real edge on Amazon. Most

00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
Amazon. So, no real edge on Amazon. Most
 

383
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,790
Amazon. So, no real edge on Amazon. Most
of these look kind of flat. Google, uh,

384
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
of these look kind of flat. Google, uh,
 

385
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,629
of these look kind of flat. Google, uh,
slight gap down, but still inside

386
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
slight gap down, but still inside
 

387
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,550
slight gap down, but still inside
previous days range, right? There's your

388
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
previous days range, right? There's your
 

389
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,710
previous days range, right? There's your
previous day range on Google. Microsoft

390
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
previous day range on Google. Microsoft
 

391
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,870
previous day range on Google. Microsoft
gapping down again inside previous days

392
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
gapping down again inside previous days
 

393
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,110
gapping down again inside previous days
range. You're going to see that a lot.

394
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
range. You're going to see that a lot.
 

395
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,029
range. You're going to see that a lot.
We are just in a rotation right now,

00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
We are just in a rotation right now,
 

397

We are just in a rotation right now,
building the next leg. Um Micros

398
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
building the next leg. Um Micros
 

399
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,230
building the next leg. Um Micros
Microsoft did we just do that? So Meta

400
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
Microsoft did we just do that? So Meta
 

401
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,510
Microsoft did we just do that? So Meta
and Microsoft doing the same thing.

402

and Microsoft doing the same thing.
 

403
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,029
and Microsoft doing the same thing.
Microsoft actually looks a bit weaker.

Doesn't have to get that far. And then
 

433
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,230
Doesn't have to get that far. And then
it's looking for continuation. an

Looks all right. It's just pulling back
 

439
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,870
Looks all right. It's just pulling back
a bit. Looking to see if they can find a

a bit. Looking to see if they can find a
 

441
00:08:50,880 --> 00:09:01,509
a bit. Looking to see if they can find a
bid on it.

levels if you want to look. Can I look

450
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
levels if you want to look. Can I look
 

451
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,670
levels if you want to look. Can I look
at gold? Uh, yeah, I can look at gold

its range right now. All right. So, it's
 

461
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,670
its range right now. All right. So, it's
trying to hold a bid. Gold's very

462
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
trying to hold a bid. Gold's very
 

463
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,110
trying to hold a bid. Gold's very
simple. It needs to hold a bid above

464
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
simple. It needs to hold a bid above
 

465
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,870
simple. It needs to hold a bid above
this. This is your supply. This is your

double top supply. All right. It's
 

469
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,949
double top supply. All right. It's
building out a range here. Breakout will

470
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
building out a range here. Breakout will
 

471
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,230
building out a range here. Breakout will
try and take it up to here. You need to

472
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,240
try and take it up to here. You need to
 

473
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,910
try and take it up to here. You need to
be aware of failed breakouts. All right.

approach back to previous day value area
 

645
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,949
approach back to previous day value area
low, which is right next to your point,

low, which is right next to your point,
 

647
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,710

So, bears will want to defend this and

00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
So, bears will want to defend this and
 

651
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,310
So, bears will want to defend this and
if they don't defend it, it means we're

652
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,320
if they don't defend it, it means we're
 

653
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,910
if they don't defend it, it means we're
getting acceptance back into range. You

654
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
getting acceptance back into range. You
 

655
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,829
getting acceptance back into range. You
can see they're holding this box here.

656
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:51,839
can see they're holding this box here.
 

657

can see they're holding this box here.
Might have been a very quick long

00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
Might have been a very quick long

663
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,069
100 point scalp to be fair in the first

664
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:02,079

Let's just get this time to settle in my

00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
Let's just get this time to settle in my
 

667
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,150
Let's just get this time to settle in my
mind. Amazon holding up. Meta's gone red

668
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
mind. Amazon holding up. Meta's gone red
 

669
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:16,710
mind. Amazon holding up. Meta's gone red
to green. Nvidia's gone red to green.

670
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:16,720

 

671
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,710

Let's develop for a minute.

672
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720

 

673
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,710

Hey, Alex, the VP levels. Is that an

Hey, Alex, the VP levels. Is that an
 

675
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,860
Hey, Alex, the VP levels. Is that an
indicator? It's just drawing it on.

676
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:24,870
indicator? It's just drawing it on.
 

677
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,509
indicator? It's just drawing it on.
[snorts]

678
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519
[snorts]
 

679
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,310
[snorts]
Um, these are manually drawn on. I do

680
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
Um, these are manually drawn on. I do
 

681
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,430
Um, these are manually drawn on. I do
them more manually.

682
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440

 

683
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,870

Pop and fade. Yeah, it could well be a

684
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:34,880
Pop and fade. Yeah, it could well be a
 

685
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,030
Pop and fade. Yeah, it could well be a
pop and fade if they defend previous day

686
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
pop and fade if they defend previous day
 

687
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,629
pop and fade if they defend previous day
value. Like I said, the rotation right

688
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639
value. Like I said, the rotation right
 

689
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,189
value. Like I said, the rotation right
now is between sort of this edge here

690
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:41,199
now is between sort of this edge here
 

691
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,949
now is between sort of this edge here
and this edge here. All right, so bulls

692
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:42,959
and this edge here. All right, so bulls
 

693
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,230
and this edge here. All right, so bulls
want to defend this, bears want to

694
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
want to defend this, bears want to
 

695
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,750
want to defend this, bears want to
defend that. That's your first rotation.

696
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:45,760
defend that. That's your first rotation.
 

697
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,670
defend that. That's your first rotation.
If they get acceptance back inside,

698
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
If they get acceptance back inside,
 

699
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,350
If they get acceptance back inside,
these are the rotations. All right, so

700
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
these are the rotations. All right, so
 

701
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,829
these are the rotations. All right, so
it's from here to here, here to here. If

702
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
it's from here to here, here to here. If
 

703
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,069
it's from here to here, here to here. If
we lose this,

704
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
we lose this,
 

705
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,310
we lose this,
then this is possible.

706
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,320
then this is possible.
 

707
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,189
then this is possible.
Sorry, folks.

708
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199

 

709
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,870

Please, Lord, do not let me have another

710
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880
Please, Lord, do not let me have another
 

711
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,550
Please, Lord, do not let me have another
cold before Christmas. I've just got

712
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
cold before Christmas. I've just got
 

713
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,436
cold before Christmas. I've just got
over CO.

714
00:16:07,436 --> 00:16:07,446
over CO.
 

715
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:12,710
over CO.

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,030

Okay, so we're above that New York open

718
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
Okay, so we're above that New York open
 

719
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,670
Okay, so we're above that New York open
so far. Let's have [snorts] a look about

00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:17,680
so far. Let's have [snorts] a look about
 

721
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,069
so far. Let's have [snorts] a look about
Google the weakest one right now. Market

722
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079
Google the weakest one right now. Market
 

723
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,269
Google the weakest one right now. Market
looks like it's starting to bleed here,

724
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
looks like it's starting to bleed here,
 

725
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,189
looks like it's starting to bleed here,
folks. Market is starting to bleed a bit

726
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
folks. Market is starting to bleed a bit
 

727
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,110
folks. Market is starting to bleed a bit
here as in the mag.

729
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,629

Definitely starting to bleed a bit here

00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
Definitely starting to bleed a bit here

Definitely starting to bleed a bit here

733
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,806

Why is it [\h__\h] my footprint up now?

734
00:16:42,806 --> 00:16:42,816
Why is it [\h__\h] my footprint up now?
 

735
00:16:42,816 --> 00:16:49,749
Why is it [\h__\h] my footprint up now?
[snorts] I got to reload it.

736
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759

 

737
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,069

Oh god, that looks awful. What's

Oh god, that looks awful. What's
 

739
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,430
Oh god, that looks awful. What's
happened here on footprint?

740

741
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,710

Oh my god. Well, that's not useful, is

Oh my god. Well, that's not useful, is
 

743

Oh my god. Well, that's not useful, is

745
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,176

I can't [\h__\h] see my charts right now.

You got to hate roll over. Let me save

You got to hate roll over. Let me save

753
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,750

I don't trade top step. I've made that

754
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
I don't trade top step. I've made that
 

755
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,430
I don't trade top step. I've made that
very clear for many years for that

756
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,440
very clear for many years for that
 

757
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,350
very clear for many years for that
reason. You trade top step, you're

758
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
reason. You trade top step, you're
 

759
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,870
reason. You trade top step, you're
giving Michael Pekki cash. I don't agree

760
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:40,880
giving Michael Pekki cash. I don't agree
 

761
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,750
giving Michael Pekki cash. I don't agree
with his business ethics. Said it many,

762
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:43,760
with his business ethics. Said it many,
 

763
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,789
with his business ethics. Said it many,
many times.

764
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
many times.
 

765
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,390
many times.
I don't think he's a good man,

766
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,400
I don't think he's a good man,
 

767
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,230
I don't think he's a good man,
unfortunately.

768
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,240
unfortunately.
 

769
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,590
unfortunately.
Otherwise, you wouldn't have the issues

770
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
Otherwise, you wouldn't have the issues
 

771
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,870
Otherwise, you wouldn't have the issues
you have. He wouldn't be trying to

772
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:52,880
you have. He wouldn't be trying to
 

773
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,190
you have. He wouldn't be trying to
create a monopoly. He wouldn't be

774
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
create a monopoly. He wouldn't be
 

775
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,870
create a monopoly. He wouldn't be
controlling the backend data. He

776
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:56,880
controlling the backend data. He
 

777
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,230
controlling the backend data. He
wouldn't be selling and sharing your

778
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,240
wouldn't be selling and sharing your
 

779
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,470
wouldn't be selling and sharing your
data and he wouldn't be trying to move

780
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
data and he wouldn't be trying to move
 

781
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,070
data and he wouldn't be trying to move
it to a brokerage to take more of your

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080
it to a brokerage to take more of your
 

783
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,950
it to a brokerage to take more of your
money out of you.

784
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960

 

785
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,270

It's not the first time X has been down.

786
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
It's not the first time X has been down.
 

787
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,070
It's not the first time X has been down.
It's probably the millionth time this

788
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,080
It's probably the millionth time this
 

789
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,909
It's probably the millionth time this
quarter. Oh my god, my footprint is

790
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:13,919
quarter. Oh my god, my footprint is
 

791
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,110
quarter. Oh my god, my footprint is
absolutely [\h__\h] here. What is going

792
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,120
absolutely [\h__\h] here. What is going
 

793
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,909
absolutely [\h__\h] here. What is going
on?

794
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919

 

795
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:33,990

This is a shame.

796
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,000

 

797
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,510

New version of footprint is now

798
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520

No, my footprint is not on the other

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,390
No, my footprint is not on the other
contract. It's on the new contract. The

00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:16,400
contract. It's on the new contract. The

Two days in a row.

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:57,750
anyone else having an issue using CDI

826
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760

 

827
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:06,870

You're having issue with it on quant

828
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:06,880

 

829
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,830

5 minutes fine. My one minute's

830
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840
5 minutes fine. My one minute's
 

831
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,310
5 minutes fine. My one minute's
absolutely fooked

832
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:14,320

 

833
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,830

is absolutely fooked. Let's see if I can

834
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:15,840
is absolutely fooked. Let's see if I can
 

835
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:28,950
is absolutely fooked. Let's see if I can
make a new chart with that.

836
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:28,960

 

837
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,310

All right, here's your drive into

00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,320
All right, here's your drive into
 

839
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,310
All right, here's your drive into
previous day value area low. So, if

840
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320
previous day value area low. So, if
 

841
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,070
previous day value area low. So, if
bears don't defend this, they're going

842
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,080
bears don't defend this, they're going
 

843
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,830
bears don't defend this, they're going
to go rotation top side.

844
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:39,840

 

845
00:20:39,840 --> 00:21:01,909

Yeah, top set X is down apparently.

846
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:01,919

 

847
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,510

Mate, my charts are [\h__\h] Like,

Mate, my charts are [\h__\h] Like,

That's not even with footprint. It's

852
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:08,720
That's not even with footprint. It's
 

853
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,470
That's not even with footprint. It's
untradeable. Completely untradable.

854
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:14,480

 

855
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:26,230

Don't know what to do about that.

856
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,240

 

857
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:44,070

duplicate new tab. Let's try this.

859
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,470

Sorry folks, this is two days in a row.

Sorry folks, this is two days in a row.
 

861

Sorry folks, this is two days in a row.
It's frustrating. I'm really sorry about

00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,000
It's frustrating. I'm really sorry about
 

863
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,430
It's frustrating. I'm really sorry about
that. I would love to be trading this

864
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,440
that. I would love to be trading this
 

865
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,270
that. I would love to be trading this
right now. Can't literally can't see in

right now. Can't literally can't see in
 

867
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,710
right now. Can't literally can't see in
my charts. All right, so bears are

00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:52,720
my charts. All right, so bears are
 

869
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,990
my charts. All right, so bears are
trying to defend your previous day value

870
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,000
trying to defend your previous day value
 

871
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,669
trying to defend your previous day value
area low. If they successfully defend

872
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:55,679
area low. If they successfully defend
 

873
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,190
area low. If they successfully defend
this, they're going to look for VWAP and

874
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
this, they're going to look for VWAP and
 

875
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,710
this, they're going to look for VWAP and
then your New York open. If they fail

876
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:58,720
then your New York open. If they fail

881
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,110

at least I give you the move beforehand,

at least I give you the move beforehand,
 

883
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,630
at least I give you the move beforehand,
right? The drive was from green and blue

884
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:08,640
right? The drive was from green and blue

889
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:22,149
to defend this. That's your snapshot
opportunity.

891
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,070

Going to snap. I'm trying not to snap.

[\h__\h] nonsense. I'm about to snap.
Don't snap, Alex.

You can hear the error messages now

Okay, there's your rotation. Congrats if

00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:55,520
Okay, there's your rotation. Congrats if
 

927
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:05,350
Okay, there's your rotation. Congrats if
you took it.

928
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,360

 

929
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,909

Congrats if you took it. Oh my [\h__\h]

932
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:21,279

 

933
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:39,590

Yeah, my [\h__\h]

934
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:39,600

 

935
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,510

Nice, nice work, Tyson. Yeah, just

936
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:41,520
Nice, nice work, Tyson. Yeah, just
 

937
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,190
Nice, nice work, Tyson. Yeah, just
really clean rotation. So cover points

938
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,200
really clean rotation. So cover points
 

939
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,430
really clean rotation. So cover points
are now into view up and New York open.

940
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:45,440
are now into view up and New York open.
 

941
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,909
are now into view up and New York open.
If you fail New York open, all right,

942
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:47,919
If you fail New York open, all right,
 

943
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,669
If you fail New York open, all right,
then it's possible they come and test

944
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:49,679
then it's possible they come and test
 

945
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,710
then it's possible they come and test
sort of the these edges here. 217s, I'd

946
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:52,720
sort of the these edges here. 217s, I'd
 

947
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,510
sort of the these edges here. 217s, I'd
say two 17s, probably this edge here,

948
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:55,520
say two 17s, probably this edge here,
 

949
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,830
say two 17s, probably this edge here,
281. So we can clean this up a bit to be

950
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:57,840
281. So we can clean this up a bit to be
 

951
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,269
281. So we can clean this up a bit to be
honest. This can be a bit more like

952
00:24:59,269 --> 00:24:59,279
honest. This can be a bit more like
 

953
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,630
honest. This can be a bit more like
this, right? I'll be watching these kind

954
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
this, right? I'll be watching these kind
 

955
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,510
this, right? I'll be watching these kind
of edges here and then

956
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:05,520
of edges here and then
 

957
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,990
of edges here and then
lower day

958
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,000
lower day
 

959
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,310
lower day
down here.

960
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,320
down here.
 

961
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,510
down here.
All right.

962
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:17,520

 

963
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,430

969
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:46,310
wakey.
Okay, let's have another go at this.

970
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,320

 

971
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,029

Oh, I keep getting a message. Um, I

972
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:49,039
Oh, I keep getting a message. Um, I
 

973
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,549
Oh, I keep getting a message. Um, I
don't know who's trading on city saying

974
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:50,559
don't know who's trading on city saying
 

975
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,310

an F5 update is required.

976
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,320
an F5 update is required.
 

977
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,830
an F5 update is required.
And there's no update to do when I

978
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:55,840
And there's no update to do when I
 

979
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,310
And there's no update to do when I
check. And now it's got all my value

980
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,320
check. And now it's got all my value
 

981
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:10,310
check. And now it's got all my value
errors wrong. This is marvelous.

982
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,320

 

983
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:16,470

Okay. Well,

984
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:16,480

 

985
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,950

let's start.

986
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:18,960
let's start.
 

987
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:30,310
let's start.
You must select.

988

Okay, there's your VWAP. Sorry, folks.

993
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,870
All right, I'm there or thereabouts now.
I've just I'm trying trading a little

994
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:36,880

996
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,480

997
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,230

00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:43,458
So, there's your New York open

market has all rolled over. Like I said,

1004
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:45,840
market has all rolled over. Like I said,
 

1005
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,510
market has all rolled over. Like I said,
all the mag started selling. So, that

1006
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:47,520
all the mag started selling. So, that
 

1007
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,590
all the mag started selling. So, that
previous day value area low was your

1008
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:49,600
previous day value area low was your
 

1009
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,269
previous day value area low was your
rejection point

1010
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:53,279

 

1011
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:59,110

like we talked about.

1012
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,120

 

1013
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,470

Yeah, I've got some sellers getting

1017
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,630
caught these lows down here. All right.
240s. So you might see a pop back up off

1018
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:04,640
240s. So you might see a pop back up off
 

1019
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,070
240s. So you might see a pop back up off
this and we can maybe create new range

1020
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,080
this and we can maybe create new range
 

1021
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,950
this and we can maybe create new range
today. Let's just mark this out the 930.

1022
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:12,960
today. Let's just mark this out the 930.
 

1023
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,510
today. Let's just mark this out the 930.
Okay. So there's your rotation. We

1024
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:15,520
Okay. So there's your rotation. We
 

1025
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,950
Okay. So there's your rotation. We
talked about this premarket. People

1026
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:16,960
talked about this premarket. People
 

1027
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,870

1029
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,630
said, "What was I looking for?" I I told
you premarket. All right. Bears must

00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:20,640
you premarket. All right. Bears must
 

1031
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,310

defend this for a rotation down into

1032
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,320
defend this for a rotation down into
 

1033
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,830
defend this for a rotation down into
this. Balls must defend this for a

1034
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:23,840
this. Balls must defend this for a
 

1035
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,070
this. Balls must defend this for a
rotation up. That's the market condition

1036
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,080
rotation up. That's the market condition
 

1037
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,430
rotation up. That's the market condition
you're currently in. And Ninja Trader

1038
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,440
you're currently in. And Ninja Trader
 

1039
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,750
you're currently in. And Ninja Trader
has started to wake up now.

1040
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:33,760

 

1041
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:49,909

which is a start, I guess.

1042
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:49,919

 

1043
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:58,149

Oh my god, it's running so bad.

1044
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:58,159

 

1045
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,590

Back down to where these chap sellers

1046
00:27:59,590 --> 00:27:59,600
Back down to where these chap sellers
 

1047
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,909
Back down to where these chap sellers
just were.

1048
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:05,919

 

1049
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,549

into this sort of gray greeny box.

1050
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:08,559
into this sort of gray greeny box.
 

1051
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,990
into this sort of gray greeny box.
There's your New York open. If we trade

1052
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,000
There's your New York open. If we trade
 

1053
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,070
There's your New York open. If we trade
under there, this is where bulls must

1054
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,080
under there, this is where bulls must
 

1055
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,950
under there, this is where bulls must
defend uh down here. So, we just

1056
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:14,960
defend uh down here. So, we just
 

1057
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,909
defend uh down here. So, we just
rejected point of control on the day.

1058
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:21,919

 

1059
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,750

Everyone's top step down, guys.

1060
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:23,760
Everyone's top step down, guys.
 

1061
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,590
Everyone's top step down, guys.
Everyone's top step is down. All you

1062
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:25,600
Everyone's top step is down. All you
 

1063
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,590
Everyone's top step is down. All you
guys asking, right? It's why I don't

1064
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:27,600
guys asking, right? It's why I don't
 

1065
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,830
guys asking, right? It's why I don't
trade on top step. You're literally

1066
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:29,840
trade on top step. You're literally
 

1067
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,269
trade on top step. You're literally
asking for problems straight in there.

1068
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:31,279
asking for problems straight in there.
 

1069
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:35,190
asking for problems straight in there.
Honestly, the guy's an [\h__\h]

1070
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,200
Honestly, the guy's an [\h__\h]
 

1071
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,190
Honestly, the guy's an [\h__\h]
Something big's coming. Yeah, something

1072
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,200
Something big's coming. Yeah, something
 

1073
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,909
Something big's coming. Yeah, something
big to [\h__\h] you lot over.

1074
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:41,919

 

1075
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,070

Okay, into this box. I'd say all the way

1076
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,080
Okay, into this box. I'd say all the way
 

1077
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,990
Okay, into this box. I'd say all the way
down to here is where bulls will want to

1078
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,000
down to here is where bulls will want to
 

1079
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,830
down to here is where bulls will want to
defend 180s. I would imagine if they

1080
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:47,840
defend 180s. I would imagine if they
 

1081
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,350
defend 180s. I would imagine if they
start losing in 180s, there'd be

1082
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:49,360
start losing in 180s, there'd be
 

1083
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,669
start losing in 180s, there'd be
problems. All right, so overall we're

1084
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:51,679
problems. All right, so overall we're
 

1085
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,990
problems. All right, so overall we're
bearish. We've just rejected value, but

1086
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,000
bearish. We've just rejected value, but
 

1087
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,310
bearish. We've just rejected value, but
we know overnight

1088
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:56,320
we know overnight
 

1089
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,149
we know overnight
um from sort of 230 to 180 is where

1090
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:00,159
um from sort of 230 to 180 is where
 

1091
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,310
um from sort of 230 to 180 is where
bulls will want to defend. We know that

1092
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:02,320
bulls will want to defend. We know that
 

1093
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,310
bulls will want to defend. We know that
from overnight. Okay. [snorts]

1094
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:06,320

 

1095
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,549

Never had that before. Oh well, you must

1096
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:08,559
Never had that before. Oh well, you must
 

1097
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,630
Never had that before. Oh well, you must
be new to them because they have issues

1098
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:10,640
be new to them because they have issues
 

1099

Okay, so they're defending that box like
 

1103

can defend all the way down to here.

1106
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:39,919
can defend all the way down to here.
 

1107
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,909
can defend all the way down to here.
Back to point of control on the day.

00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:41,919
Back to point of control on the day.
 

1109
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,430
Back to point of control on the day.
They're now trying to cause a squeeze

1110
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:43,440
They're now trying to cause a squeeze
 

1111
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,950
They're now trying to cause a squeeze
back up higher.

1121
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,990
all the way. Grabbing [clears throat] a

piece of this from point control
 

1123
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,070
piece of this from point control
and looking at this ledge 320s now. See

1124
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,080
and looking at this ledge 320s now. See
 

1125
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,870
and looking at this ledge 320s now. See
if we can get three 320s or not.

1126
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:06,880

 

1127
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,029

Really nice. Nice squeeze. Beautiful. So

1128
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:09,039
Really nice. Nice squeeze. Beautiful. So
 

1129
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,549
Really nice. Nice squeeze. Beautiful. So
from one side, we just talked about the

1130
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:10,559
from one side, we just talked about the
 

1131
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,070
from one side, we just talked about the
rotation

1132
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,080
rotation
 

1133
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,230
rotation
from one side to the other, from one

1134
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:14,240
from one side to the other, from one
 

1135
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,789
from one side to the other, from one
side to the other, from one side to the

1136
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:16,799
side to the other, from one side to the
 

1137
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,470
side to the other, from one side to the
other. How we act now becomes important.

1138
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:18,480
other. How we act now becomes important.
 

1139
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,990
other. How we act now becomes important.
If we get back inside value, then

1140
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,000
If we get back inside value, then
 

1141
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,510
If we get back inside value, then
they're going to attack up here. Okay?

1142
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:21,520
they're going to attack up here. Okay?
 

1143
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,789
they're going to attack up here. Okay?
If they reject value, you're going to do

1144
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:22,799
If they reject value, you're going to do
 

1145
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,710
If they reject value, you're going to do
the same rotation back down or at least

1146
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:24,720
the same rotation back down or at least
 

1147
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,710
the same rotation back down or at least
back down to the midpoint. It's just a

1148
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:26,720
back down to the midpoint. It's just a
 

1149
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,549
back down to the midpoint. It's just a
rotational day. We've talked about it

1150
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:28,559
rotational day. We've talked about it
 

1151
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,549
rotational day. We've talked about it
numerous times already on stream

1152
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:32,559
numerous times already on stream
 

1153
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,669
numerous times already on stream
out [clears throat] of this. Now we got

1154
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:33,679
out [clears throat] of this. Now we got
 

1155
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,510
out [clears throat] of this. Now we got
to the 320s. You can hold a runner to

1156
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:35,520
to the 320s. You can hold a runner to
 

1157
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,789
to the 320s. You can hold a runner to
see if they can expand back into

1158
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:36,799
see if they can expand back into
 

1159
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:50,070
see if they can expand back into
previous days value.

1160
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,080

 

1161
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:57,350

Can I get back into previous days value?

1162
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:57,360

 

1163
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,389

Here is previous day's value. Tap tap

1164
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:00,399
Here is previous day's value. Tap tap
 

1165
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,669
Here is previous day's value. Tap tap
tap. I'm out of a bit now, by the way,

1166
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:01,679
tap. I'm out of a bit now, by the way,
 

1167
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,070
tap. I'm out of a bit now, by the way,
folks. So, I just took as soon as we

1168
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,080
folks. So, I just took as soon as we
 

1169
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,950
folks. So, I just took as soon as we
broke through here. 70s about 50 point

1170
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:06,960
broke through here. 70s about 50 point
 

1171
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,269
broke through here. 70s about 50 point
move or something. Not bad. If we get

1172
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:09,279
move or something. Not bad. If we get
 

1173
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,029
move or something. Not bad. If we get
into previous days value, all right, we

1174
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:11,039
into previous days value, all right, we
 

1175
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,149
into previous days value, all right, we
have supply overhead from

1176
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:14,159
have supply overhead from
 

1177
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,269
have supply overhead from
uh 380s to 400. And then above that, we

1178
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:17,279
uh 380s to 400. And then above that, we
 

1179
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,789
uh 380s to 400. And then above that, we
have the point of previous day point of

1180
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:18,799
have the point of previous day point of
 

1181
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,149
have the point of previous day point of
control and value. All right. So, we

1182
00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:20,159
control and value. All right. So, we
 

1183
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,789
control and value. All right. So, we
have supply overhead. I should probably

1184
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:22,799
have supply overhead. I should probably
 

1185
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,190
have supply overhead. I should probably
draw this out

1186
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,200
draw this out
 

1187
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,669
draw this out
380. So, that's that peak to 400. I'm

1188
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:27,679
380. So, that's that peak to 400. I'm
 

1189
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,870
380. So, that's that peak to 400. I'm
going to leave that actually. We can

1190
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:28,880
going to leave that actually. We can
 

1191
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,350
going to leave that actually. We can
just put like a little pin in here so we

1192
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,360
just put like a little pin in here so we
 

1193
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:38,389
just put like a little pin in here so we
know where the liquidity is

1194
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:38,399

 

1195
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,070

there. But we're in rotation until it

1196
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,080
there. But we're in rotation until it
 

1197
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,509
there. But we're in rotation until it
proves otherwise. Here's the attempt to

1198
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:41,519
proves otherwise. Here's the attempt to
 

1199
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,950
proves otherwise. Here's the attempt to
get back through value and close the

1200
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:42,960
get back through value and close the
 

1201
00:31:42,960 --> 00:32:04,470
get back through value and close the
gap.

1202
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:04,480

 

1203
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,190

Having to look at my footprint on

1204
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:07,200
Having to look at my footprint on
 

1205
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,710
Having to look at my footprint on
trading view. I'm struggling here. All

1206
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:08,720
trading view. I'm struggling here. All
 

1207
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,470
trading view. I'm struggling here. All
right. What I'd say is bulls will now

1208
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:10,480
right. What I'd say is bulls will now
 

1209
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,029
right. What I'd say is bulls will now
want to defend 295

1210
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:13,039
want to defend 295
 

1211
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,389
want to defend 295
to 263. All right. 295 to 263. If they

1212
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:16,399
to 263. All right. 295 to 263. If they
 

1213
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,549
to 263. All right. 295 to 263. If they
can defend 325, they leave some bears

1214
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:18,559
can defend 325, they leave some bears
 

1215
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,789
can defend 325, they leave some bears
stuck. But we have a big old imbalance

1216
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:20,799
stuck. But we have a big old imbalance
 

1217
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,310
stuck. But we have a big old imbalance
up there. All right. So, I would be down

1218
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,320
up there. All right. So, I would be down
 

1219
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,110
up there. All right. So, I would be down
to small size here.

1220
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,120

 

1221
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,830

Mag did rotate there a little bit. So uh

1222
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:29,840
Mag did rotate there a little bit. So uh
 

1223
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,110
Mag did rotate there a little bit. So uh
Nvidia, Microsoft and uh Amazon all

1224
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:33,120
Nvidia, Microsoft and uh Amazon all
 

1225
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,497
Nvidia, Microsoft and uh Amazon all
caught a bid.

1226
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:36,507

 

1227
00:32:36,507 --> 00:32:44,950

[snorts]

1228
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:44,960

 

1229
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,710

Very stupid question. Is today the last

1230
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:46,720
Very stupid question. Is today the last
 

1231
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,789
Very stupid question. Is today the last
day to pass Apex Eval special? The

1232
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:48,799
day to pass Apex Eval special? The
 

1233
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,509
day to pass Apex Eval special? The
website doesn't say so. Yeah, it it is.

1234
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:51,519
website doesn't say so. Yeah, it it is.
 

1235
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,909
website doesn't say so. Yeah, it it is.
And it and it will say on the sale ends

1236
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:53,919
And it and it will say on the sale ends
 

1237
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,750
And it and it will say on the sale ends
this date. That's means that's your last

1238
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:55,760
this date. That's means that's your last
 

1239
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,230
this date. That's means that's your last
day to do it.

1240
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,240

 

1241
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,830

Okay. So, they're reaching in to this

1242
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:01,840
Okay. So, they're reaching in to this
 

1243
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,149
Okay. So, they're reaching in to this
previous day value gaps now filled. We

1244
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:04,159
previous day value gaps now filled. We
 

1245
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,990
previous day value gaps now filled. We
know there's supply overhead up here.

1246
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:06,000
know there's supply overhead up here.
 

1247
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,470
know there's supply overhead up here.
All right. The rotation

1248
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:08,480
All right. The rotation
 

1249
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,710
All right. The rotation
if they want to let come back down for

1250
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:10,720
if they want to let come back down for
 

1251
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,190
if they want to let come back down for
some of this imbalance. They will trade

1252
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:15,200
some of this imbalance. They will trade
 

1253
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,789
some of this imbalance. They will trade
they will trade back into this ledge.

1254
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:16,799
they will trade back into this ledge.
 

1255
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,149
they will trade back into this ledge.
All right. And bulls will want to defend

1256
00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:18,159
All right. And bulls will want to defend
 

1257
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,590
All right. And bulls will want to defend
this ledge if they've got an ambition of

1258
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:19,600
this ledge if they've got an ambition of
 

1259
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,110
this ledge if they've got an ambition of
doing this. Bulls will defend this

1260
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,120
doing this. Bulls will defend this
 

1261
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,789
doing this. Bulls will defend this
ledge. Lud this ledge. We go right back

1262
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:22,799
ledge. Lud this ledge. We go right back
 

1263
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,470
ledge. Lud this ledge. We go right back
down to the lower side again. Remember,

1264
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:24,480
down to the lower side again. Remember,
 

1265
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,909
down to the lower side again. Remember,
we're just in a rotation. That's all

1266
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:25,919
we're just in a rotation. That's all
 

1267
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,509
we're just in a rotation. That's all
this market is in right now. There's the

1268
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:27,519
this market is in right now. There's the
 

1269
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,110
this market is in right now. There's the
squeeze. Beautiful. So, now you're

1270
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,120
squeeze. Beautiful. So, now you're
 

1271
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,310
squeeze. Beautiful. So, now you're
looking to take out this high. So, if

1272
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:30,320
looking to take out this high. So, if
 

1273
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,909
looking to take out this high. So, if
you're still in it, you look good. And

1274
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:31,919
you're still in it, you look good. And
 

1275
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:32,950
you're still in it, you look good. And
once you take out this high, you're

1276
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:32,960
once you take out this high, you're
 

1277
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,149
once you take out this high, you're
looking for previous day point of

1278
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:34,159
looking for previous day point of
 

1279
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,590
looking for previous day point of
control, previous day value area higher.

1280
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:35,600
control, previous day value area higher.
 

1281
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,669
control, previous day value area higher.
That's a really good squeeze there,

1282
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:37,679
That's a really good squeeze there,
 

1283
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,310
That's a really good squeeze there,
leaving those bears trapped at the 330s.

1284
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,320
leaving those bears trapped at the 330s.
 

1285
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,149
leaving those bears trapped at the 330s.
And they've just got trapped again into

1286
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:42,159
And they've just got trapped again into
 

1287
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,630
And they've just got trapped again into
370s. So, I'll be taking some profit

1288
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:44,640
370s. So, I'll be taking some profit
 

1289
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,389
370s. So, I'll be taking some profit
here into this box if I was you. And

1290
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:46,399
here into this box if I was you. And
 

1291
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,470
here into this box if I was you. And
then holding runners to get to the top

1292
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:48,480
then holding runners to get to the top
 

1293
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,630
then holding runners to get to the top
side of the rotation.

1294
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:52,640

 

1295
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,389

Yes, we've rolled over. We're on the H

1296
00:33:54,389 --> 00:33:54,399
Yes, we've rolled over. We're on the H
 

1297
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,070
Yes, we've rolled over. We're on the H
contract. You'll be able to tell by the

1298
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,080
contract. You'll be able to tell by the
 

1299
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,430

numbers.

1300
00:33:59,430 --> 00:33:59,440

 

1301
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,230

More money on the H contract. Really

1302
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:02,240
More money on the H contract. Really
 

1303
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,710
More money on the H contract. Really
nice. Gosh, I wish I held a little

1304
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:04,720
nice. Gosh, I wish I held a little
 

1305
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,233
nice. Gosh, I wish I held a little
something.

1306
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:06,243
something.
 

1307
00:34:06,243 --> 00:34:07,110
something.

Could have, would a, should have. It is

00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,750
Could have, would a, should have. It is
a 15-minute order break, but if you

1314
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:13,760
a 15-minute order break, but if you
 

1315
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,030
a 15-minute order break, but if you
using orderflow, you could have seen

00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,040
using orderflow, you could have seen
 

1317
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,869
using orderflow, you could have seen
that the sellers got trapped from uh 300

1318
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:18,879
that the sellers got trapped from uh 300
 

1319
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,589
that the sellers got trapped from uh 300
up to 324 on that 947, 948, 949, and in

up to 324 on that 947, 948, 949, and in
 

1321
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,750
up to 324 on that 947, 948, 949, and in
the 10:00 candle, they got trapped at

1322
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:25,760
the 10:00 candle, they got trapped at
 

1323
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,829
the 10:00 candle, they got trapped at
3:30 to 3:15. So, you've left them all

1324
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:27,839
3:30 to 3:15. So, you've left them all
 

1325
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,190
3:30 to 3:15. So, you've left them all
trapped. I just be careful now because

1326
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,200
trapped. I just be careful now because
 

1327
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,869
trapped. I just be careful now because
you've had very, very aggressive buying

1328
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:30,879
you've had very, very aggressive buying
 

1329
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,589
you've had very, very aggressive buying
stepping in, and you need to pull back

1330
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:33,599
stepping in, and you need to pull back
 

1331
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,750
stepping in, and you need to pull back
and make sure it can hold a base because

1332
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:35,760
and make sure it can hold a base because
 

1333
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,030
and make sure it can hold a base because
all you've done now is sweep this

1334
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,040
all you've done now is sweep this
 

1335
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,270
all you've done now is sweep this
liquidity that we just marked out. All

1336
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:39,280
liquidity that we just marked out. All
 

1337
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,349
liquidity that we just marked out. All
right. So buyers now very simply got

1338
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:41,359
right. So buyers now very simply got
 

1339
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:42,950
right. So buyers now very simply got
they've got to hold above previous days

1340
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:42,960
they've got to hold above previous days
 

1341
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,230
they've got to hold above previous days
value. All right. They've got to hold

1342
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:44,240
value. All right. They've got to hold
 

1343
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,669
value. All right. They've got to hold
above previous days value. They've

1344
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:45,679
above previous days value. They've
 

1345
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,430
above previous days value. They've
created a ledge and this will be the

1346
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:47,440
created a ledge and this will be the
 

1347
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,430
created a ledge and this will be the
completion of the rotation.

1348
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:51,440

 

1349
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,790

Right? So buyers need to hold this.

1350
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:52,800
Right? So buyers need to hold this.
 

1351
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,790
Right? So buyers need to hold this.
Failing to hold this then you just get

1352
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:54,800
Failing to hold this then you just get
 

1353
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,670
Failing to hold this then you just get
back that whole squeeze.

1354
00:34:59,670 --> 00:34:59,680

 

1355
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:07,829

And we can mark out other levels here.

1356
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:07,839

 

1357
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,790

Get those in. [snorts]

1358
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:10,800
Get those in. [snorts]
 

1359
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,150
Get those in. [snorts]
All right. So, some strong selling

1360
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:12,160
All right. So, some strong selling
 

1361
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,630
All right. So, some strong selling
trying to come in here. Like I said, you

1362
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:14,640
trying to come in here. Like I said, you
 

1363
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:25,910
trying to come in here. Like I said, you
need to hold previous day value

1364
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:25,920

 

1365
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,349

there or thereabouts. I'd say you don't

1366
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:27,359
there or thereabouts. I'd say you don't
 

1367
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,109
there or thereabouts. I'd say you don't
want to trade under 313s. That's where

1368
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:29,119
want to trade under 313s. That's where
 

1369
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,310
want to trade under 313s. That's where
the sellside delta got caught. So, let's

1370
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:32,320
the sellside delta got caught. So, let's
 

1371
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,349
the sellside delta got caught. So, let's
just call it 300s. 313s. Ideally, you

1372
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:35,359
just call it 300s. 313s. Ideally, you
 

1373
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,790
just call it 300s. 313s. Ideally, you
hold over 313s. Otherwise,

1374
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:38,800
hold over 313s. Otherwise,
 

1375
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,790
hold over 313s. Otherwise,
it can get a little bit weak back down

1376
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:40,800
it can get a little bit weak back down
 

1377
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,310
it can get a little bit weak back down
into here. Okay,

1378
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:44,320
into here. Okay,
 

1379
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,510
into here. Okay,
was a squeeze out.

1380
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:47,520
was a squeeze out.
 

1381
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,109
was a squeeze out.
Looks bullish overall. It's just whether

1382
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:49,119
Looks bullish overall. It's just whether
 

1383
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:58,150
Looks bullish overall. It's just whether
they can hold it.

1384
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,160

 

1385
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,750

3 330s to 316s, possibly down to to

1386
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:01,760
3 330s to 316s, possibly down to to
 

1387
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,910
3 330s to 316s, possibly down to to
297s, but you don't really want it down

1388
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:03,920
297s, but you don't really want it down
 

1389
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,430
297s, but you don't really want it down
there, I'd say.

1390
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:07,440

 

1391
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,430

They'd want to try and catch a bid here

1392
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:11,440
They'd want to try and catch a bid here
 

1393
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,710
They'd want to try and catch a bid here
to cause a resqueeze higher. In my mind,

1394
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:14,720
to cause a resqueeze higher. In my mind,
 

1395
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,310
to cause a resqueeze higher. In my mind,
they've got the opportunity to do it at

1396
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:16,320
they've got the opportunity to do it at
 

1397
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,510
they've got the opportunity to do it at
the moment. That's what they would want

1398
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:17,520
the moment. That's what they would want
 

1399
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,190
the moment. That's what they would want
to do.

1400
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,200

 

1401
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,270

So, here's value. Here's the gap fill.

1402
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:23,280
So, here's value. Here's the gap fill.
 

1403
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,589
So, here's value. Here's the gap fill.
They lose this. This little shelf here

off it not very successfully yet but
they are attempting at least

1430
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:07,920

 

1431
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,349

Can they get back through and go top

1432
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:09,359
Can they get back through and go top
 

1433
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,069
Can they get back through and go top
side? Here they go. They got to get back

1434
00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:12,079
side? Here they go. They got to get back
 

1435
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,150
side? Here they go. They got to get back
above it. They are trying. They got to

1436
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:14,160
above it. They are trying. They got to
 

1437
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,470
above it. They are trying. They got to
get back above this and squeeze back to

1438
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:16,480
get back above this and squeeze back to
 

1439
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,829
get back above this and squeeze back to
the top side. All right. So, they're

1440
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:17,839
the top side. All right. So, they're
 

1441
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,390
the top side. All right. So, they're
trying to put in a higher low here. I

1442
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:20,400
trying to put in a higher low here. I
 

1443
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,230
trying to put in a higher low here. I
might sort of wait to see if they do one

1444
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:22,240
might sort of wait to see if they do one
 

1445
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:30,550
might sort of wait to see if they do one
of these.

1446
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:30,560

 

1447
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,030

My charts are absolutely [\h__\h] I'm

1448
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,040
My charts are absolutely [\h__\h] I'm
 

1449
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:45,910
My charts are absolutely [\h__\h] I'm
literally trading blind right now.

1450
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:45,920

 

1451
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,109

Here they go. It's a good hold. So those

1452
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:49,119
Here they go. It's a good hold. So those
 

1453
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,670
Here they go. It's a good hold. So those
sellers remain trapped under 320 right

1454
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:51,680
sellers remain trapped under 320 right
 

1455
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,230
sellers remain trapped under 320 right
now.

1456
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:56,240

 

1457
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,829

This is where the strong selling sort of

1458
00:37:57,829 --> 00:37:57,839
This is where the strong selling sort of
 

1459
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,349
This is where the strong selling sort of
stepped in where we are now. So, if they

1460
00:37:59,349 --> 00:37:59,359
stepped in where we are now. So, if they
 

1461
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,670
stepped in where we are now. So, if they
can get back through this, new highs can

1462
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:01,680
can get back through this, new highs can
 

1463
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,349
can get back through this, new highs can
be available. They just got to make sure

1464
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:03,359
be available. They just got to make sure
 

1465
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,030
be available. They just got to make sure
they don't retract buyers up here, which

1466
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,040
they don't retract buyers up here, which
 

1467
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,630
they don't retract buyers up here, which
is what probably just happened here.

1468
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:08,640
is what probably just happened here.
 

1469
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,310
is what probably just happened here.
There is a potential move higher here

1470
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:10,320
There is a potential move higher here
 

1471
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,270
There is a potential move higher here
coming.

1472
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:13,280
coming.
 

1473
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,109
coming.
It's a really good hold of value like we

1474
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:15,119
It's a really good hold of value like we
 

1475
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,510
It's a really good hold of value like we
talked about. Any dip back down into

1476
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:17,520
talked about. Any dip back down into
 

1477
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,109
talked about. Any dip back down into
there that holds again will probably be

1478
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:19,119
there that holds again will probably be
 

1479
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,950
there that holds again will probably be
gobbled up and then go for a new high at

1480
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:20,960
gobbled up and then go for a new high at
 

1481
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,996
gobbled up and then go for a new high at
this point.

1482
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:23,006
this point.
 

1483
00:38:23,006 --> 00:38:28,310
this point.

1497

they can hold that dip. That would be

they can hold that dip. That would be
 

1499

really encouraging. Do you want to give

1504
00:38:57,349 --> 00:38:57,359

 

1505
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,510

They're going to go for it, aren't they?

1506
00:38:59,510 --> 00:38:59,520
They're going to go for it, aren't they?
 

1507
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,670
They're going to go for it, aren't they?
Come on. Come back down. Just one little

1508
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:01,680
Come on. Come back down. Just one little
 

1509
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,470
Come on. Come back down. Just one little
retest somewhere down there. No, they're

1510
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:04,480
retest somewhere down there. No, they're
 

1511
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,710

going for the squeeze. They're going for

1514
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:09,359
the squeeze.
 

1515
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:17,109
the squeeze.
So, let's getting caught here at 64s.

1516
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:17,119

 

1517
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,030

One more dip in just to here to see if

1518
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,040
One more dip in just to here to see if
 

1519
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,990
One more dip in just to here to see if
we can hold for this be ideal looking

1520
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:22,000
we can hold for this be ideal looking
 

1521
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,230
we can hold for this be ideal looking
for the moment.

1522
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,240
for the moment.
 

1523
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,550
for the moment.
Here we come.

1524
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:30,560

 

1525
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:42,550

And can we accelerate now then?

1526
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:42,560

 

1527
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:48,390

Good.

1528
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:48,400

 

1529
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,910

And my chart's frozen. Oh, Ninja.

1530
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:51,920
And my chart's frozen. Oh, Ninja.
 

1531
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,710
And my chart's frozen. Oh, Ninja.
Ninja. Seriously,

1532
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:56,720

 

1533
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,190

charts fully frozen.

1534
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,200
charts fully frozen.
 

1535
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,190
charts fully frozen.
I'm in this long and my charts are

1536
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,200
I'm in this long and my charts are
 

1537
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:11,829
I'm in this long and my charts are
frozen.

1538
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:11,839

 

1539
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:18,230

Here

1540
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:18,240

 

1541
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,030

we go. Back on.

1542
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,040
we go. Back on.
 

1543
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,109
we go. Back on.
I don't know if I can trade like this.

1544
00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:23,119
I don't know if I can trade like this.
 

1545
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,310
I don't know if I can trade like this.
All right, let's see if we can take out

1546
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:24,320
All right, let's see if we can take out
 

1547
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,990
All right, let's see if we can take out
this high.

1548
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:26,000
this high.
 

1549
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,349
this high.
Just missed me there. I'm going to cover

1550
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:27,359
Just missed me there. I'm going to cover
 

1551
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,990
Just missed me there. I'm going to cover
one into this.

1552
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,000
one into this.
 

1553
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,510
one into this.
Don't want to see it come back down and

1554
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:31,520
Don't want to see it come back down and
 

1555
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,710
Don't want to see it come back down and
lose 70s. Now there a seller up here

1556
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:34,720
lose 70s. Now there a seller up here
 

1557
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,550
lose 70s. Now there a seller up here
refreshing at 85. Want to be careful if

1558
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:36,560
refreshing at 85. Want to be careful if
 

1559
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,190
refreshing at 85. Want to be careful if
he tries to slam this back down.

1560
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:41,200

 

1561
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,390

[\h__\h] me. I can't trade like this. Like

1563
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,710

I'm I'm making money. I'm in long from

didn't give me a chance to put my uh

Yeah, they're holding this buy side

1572
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:56,400
Yeah, they're holding this buy side
 

1573
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,870
Yeah, they're holding this buy side
imbalance. They need to hold 70s. So,

1574
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:58,880
imbalance. They need to hold 70s. So,
 

1575
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,870
imbalance. They need to hold 70s. So,
I'm moving my stop into 69. They need to

1576
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:00,880
I'm moving my stop into 69. They need to
 

1577
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,550
I'm moving my stop into 69. They need to
hold 70s in my mind. Otherwise, I'm out.

1578
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:02,560
hold 70s in my mind. Otherwise, I'm out.
 

1579
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,710
hold 70s in my mind. Otherwise, I'm out.
Almost got tapped there. 70s is the buy

1580
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:04,720
Almost got tapped there. 70s is the buy
 

1581
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,829
Almost got tapped there. 70s is the buy
side and balance. If they don't hold

1582
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:05,839
side and balance. If they don't hold
 

1583
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,550
side and balance. If they don't hold
this, we can rotate. And I just want to

1584
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:08,560
this, we can rotate. And I just want to
 

1585
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,589
this, we can rotate. And I just want to
see if we can get up to point control.

Okay, out of this. Now I'm going to have
 

1589

Okay, out of this. Now I'm going to have
to do a reboot here. I'm literally

1590
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:12,960
to do a reboot here. I'm literally
 

1591
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,270
to do a reboot here. I'm literally
trading completely blind. This is

1592
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:15,280
trading completely blind. This is
 

1593
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:24,150
trading completely blind. This is
absolutely ridiculous.

1594
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,160

 

1595
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,990

This is to give you an idea. This is

00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,000
This is to give you an idea. This is
 

1597
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,430
This is to give you an idea. This is
what I'm currently dealing with it

1598
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:27,440
what I'm currently dealing with it
 

1599
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:34,790
what I'm currently dealing with it
freezing doing this. It's

1600
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:34,800

 

1601
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,950

okay. Just try and open this one more

1602
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:36,960
okay. Just try and open this one more
 

1603
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,109
okay. Just try and open this one more
time.

1604
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:39,119
time.
 

1605
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,710

1611
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,790
calling it like really nice and can't do
anything about it. Okay, so I would be

1612
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:48,800
anything about it. Okay, so I would be
 

1613
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,510
anything about it. Okay, so I would be
now if you took this long for this hold

1614
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:51,520
now if you took this long for this hold
 

1615
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,030
now if you took this long for this hold
of this dip. All right, you're partial

1616
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,040
of this dip. All right, you're partial
 

1617
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,390
of this dip. All right, you're partial
one here and then you're looking for

1618
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:54,400
one here and then you're looking for
 

1619
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,950
one here and then you're looking for
these. Okay, so you're partiing out into

1620
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:56,960
these. Okay, so you're partiing out into
 

1621
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,710
these. Okay, so you're partiing out into
this. So TP1, TP2, TP3 up here.

1622
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:02,720
this. So TP1, TP2, TP3 up here.

00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,069
These are the levels balls must defend
if they want to complete rotation. If

1746
00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:04,079
if they want to complete rotation. If
 

1747
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,069
if they want to complete rotation. If
bears defend this, you complete rotation

1748
00:47:06,069 --> 00:47:06,079
bears defend this, you complete rotation
 

1749
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,470
bears defend this, you complete rotation
here. You're inside previous days value.

1750
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:08,480
here. You're inside previous days value.
 

1751
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,710
here. You're inside previous days value.
So, they have the ability. I mean, you

1752
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:10,720
So, they have the ability. I mean, you
 

1753
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,790
So, they have the ability. I mean, you
did tag this. They have the ability to

1754
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:12,800
did tag this. They have the ability to
 

1755
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,550
did tag this. They have the ability to
try and get up into previous day value

1756
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:14,560
try and get up into previous day value
 

1757
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,990
try and get up into previous day value
area high and this if they're going to

1758
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:16,000
area high and this if they're going to

This is what tilt looks like because you

1772
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:34,319
This is what tilt looks like because you
 

1773
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,150
This is what tilt looks like because you
have technical issues. One of my big big

1774
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:36,160
have technical issues. One of my big big
 

1775
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:54,950

tilt factors is technical issues.

1777
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,390

Yeah, close the trade. Yeah. Yeah. I

Yeah, close the trade. Yeah. Yeah. I
 

1779
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,630
Yeah, close the trade. Yeah. Yeah. I
like money's not a problem. It's that

Trader, I've got like these awful charts

Trader, I've got like these awful charts
 

1785
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,390
Trader, I've got like these awful charts
and then when I'm going to Twin Peaks,

and then when I'm going to Twin Peaks,
 

1787
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,910
and then when I'm going to Twin Peaks,
it's showing me everything in German

1788
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:07,920
it's showing me everything in German
 

1789
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,430
it's showing me everything in German
even though I keep telling it English.

just someone up there's been taking the

00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:23,839
just someone up there's been taking the
 

1801
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,430
just someone up there's been taking the
piss out of me this week. They're just

piss out of me this week. They're just
 

1803
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,990
piss out of me this week. They're just
like, "Fuck this guy. Make sure he can't

00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:28,000
like, "Fuck this guy. Make sure he can't
 

1805
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:35,750
like, "Fuck this guy. Make sure he can't
make as much money as he'd like."

1806
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:35,760

 

1807
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,710

Yeah,

1808
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:40,720

 

1809
00:48:40,720 --> 00:49:45,750

I'd literally give up.

1810
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:45,760

 

1811
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,750

Oh,

1812
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:51,760

 

1813
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,470

this is what I'm dealing with. That is a

1814
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:54,480
this is what I'm dealing with. That is a
 

1815
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,150
this is what I'm dealing with. That is a
one minute. What the hell am I supposed

1816
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:56,160
one minute. What the hell am I supposed
 

1817
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:21,109
one minute. What the hell am I supposed
to do with that?

1818
00:50:21,109 --> 00:50:21,119

 

1819
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,190

Blue box holding. You're probably going

1820
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:23,200
Blue box holding. You're probably going
 

1821
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,790
Blue box holding. You're probably going
to get value area [snorts] high now,

1822
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:24,800
to get value area [snorts] high now,
 

1823
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,390
to get value area [snorts] high now,
folks. You will probably get value very

1824
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:26,400
folks. You will probably get value very
 

1825
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:42,390
folks. You will probably get value very
high.

1826
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:42,400

 

1827
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,150

I can show you to show you like I'm not

1828
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,160
I can show you to show you like I'm not
 

1829
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,549
I can show you to show you like I'm not
too stressed. It's just I can't [sighs]

1830
00:50:46,549 --> 00:50:46,559
too stressed. It's just I can't [sighs]
 

1831
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:52,309
too stressed. It's just I can't [sighs]
I can't trade it. Oh god.

1832
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:52,319

 

1833
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,309

It's not Ninja. It's Twin Peaks. It's

1834
00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:54,319
It's not Ninja. It's Twin Peaks. It's
 

1835
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:58,470
It's not Ninja. It's Twin Peaks. It's
not Ninja. It's it's it's the uh

1836
00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:58,480
not Ninja. It's it's it's the uh
 

1837
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,390
not Ninja. It's it's it's the uh
Twin Peaks. But hopefully I don't know.

1838
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:00,400
Twin Peaks. But hopefully I don't know.
 

1839
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,770
Twin Peaks. But hopefully I don't know.
We'll see.

1840
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:04,780

 

1841
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,069

[groaning]

1842
00:51:06,069 --> 00:51:06,079
[groaning]
 

1843
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,069
[groaning]
Okay.

1844
00:51:08,069 --> 00:51:08,079
Okay.
 

1845
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,430
Okay.
Right. You need to see if they're going

1846
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:09,440
Right. You need to see if they're going
 

1847
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,950
Right. You need to see if they're going
to hold value here now. So, basically,

1848
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:10,960
to hold value here now. So, basically,
 

1849
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,470
to hold value here now. So, basically,
you want to see if this turns into this.

1850
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:14,480
you want to see if this turns into this.
 

1851
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,470
you want to see if this turns into this.
Uh and you want to watch this shelf down

1852
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:16,480
Uh and you want to watch this shelf down
 

1853
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,990
Uh and you want to watch this shelf down
to here. You don't want them to lose

1854
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:18,000
to here. You don't want them to lose
 

1855
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,630
to here. You don't want them to lose
this shelf. All right. So, I would still

1856
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:20,640
this shelf. All right. So, I would still
 

1857
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,030
this shelf. All right. So, I would still
be bullish technically on this, but

1858
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:23,040
be bullish technically on this, but
 

1859
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,630
be bullish technically on this, but
you've lost prime position. Prime

1860
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:24,640
you've lost prime position. Prime
 

1861
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,230
you've lost prime position. Prime
position was here and here. All right,

1862
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:26,240
position was here and here. All right,
 

1863
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,710
position was here and here. All right,
this retested this low. Remember, this

1864
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:28,720
this retested this low. Remember, this
 

1865
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,630
this retested this low. Remember, this
is the area higher time frame bulls

1866
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:30,640
is the area higher time frame bulls
 

1867
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,470
is the area higher time frame bulls
needed to hold. They've tested this

1868
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:32,480
needed to hold. They've tested this
 

1869
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,150
needed to hold. They've tested this
twice. If they do this, they should

1870
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:34,160
twice. If they do this, they should
 

1871
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,309
twice. If they do this, they should
complete rotation. All right, I'd be

1872
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:36,319
complete rotation. All right, I'd be
 

1873
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,910
complete rotation. All right, I'd be
very careful being long up into this,

1874
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:37,920
very careful being long up into this,
 

1875
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,309
very careful being long up into this,
but it it is potentially available. If

1876
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:40,319
but it it is potentially available. If
 

1877
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,630
but it it is potentially available. If
you start losing this, that is the

1878
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:42,640
you start losing this, that is the
 

1879
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,430
you start losing this, that is the
rotation back down. And you're seeing

1880
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:45,440
rotation back down. And you're seeing
 

1881
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,510
rotation back down. And you're seeing
delta flip from buy side to sell side

1882
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:47,520
delta flip from buy side to sell side
 

1883
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,390
delta flip from buy side to sell side
now. And oh, it's woken up. Okay,

1884
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:50,400
now. And oh, it's woken up. Okay,
 

1885
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,829
now. And oh, it's woken up. Okay,
fantastic. I have a screen. This is

1886
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:53,839
fantastic. I have a screen. This is
 

1887
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,829
fantastic. I have a screen. This is
good. All right, I can actually read all

1888
00:51:55,829 --> 00:51:55,839
good. All right, I can actually read all
 

1889
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:59,349
good. All right, I can actually read all
the flow for you now.

1890
00:51:59,349 --> 00:51:59,359
the flow for you now.
 

1891
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,950
the flow for you now.
All right, so Delta was last caught

1892
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:00,960
All right, so Delta was last caught
 

1893
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,030
All right, so Delta was last caught
offside at uh 337 here. So, previous day

1894
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,040
offside at uh 337 here. So, previous day
 

1895
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,430
offside at uh 337 here. So, previous day
value low. So, that looks like the same

1896
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:07,440
value low. So, that looks like the same
 

1897
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,390
value low. So, that looks like the same
spot that bulls want to hold. Failing

1898
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:10,400
spot that bulls want to hold. Failing
 

1899
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,069
spot that bulls want to hold. Failing
that, then probably down to pro uh point

1900
00:52:14,069 --> 00:52:14,079
that, then probably down to pro uh point
 

1901
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,069
that, then probably down to pro uh point
control and VWOP down here. So, this

1902
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:16,079
control and VWOP down here. So, this
 

1903
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,390
control and VWOP down here. So, this
level here needs to hold for that. Fail

1904
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:18,400
level here needs to hold for that. Fail
 

1905
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,470
level here needs to hold for that. Fail
this, they wash back down into this.

1906
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:24,480

 

1907
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,990

At least that's how I'd be treating it

1908
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:26,000
At least that's how I'd be treating it
 

1909
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,589
At least that's how I'd be treating it
right now. So, you'd want this kind of

1910
00:52:27,589 --> 00:52:27,599
right now. So, you'd want this kind of
 

1911
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,030
right now. So, you'd want this kind of
level here to hold. This is where big

1912
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:29,040
level here to hold. This is where big
 

1913
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,630
level here to hold. This is where big
sellers came in. If they don't hold this

1914
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:30,640
sellers came in. If they don't hold this
 

1915
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,510
sellers came in. If they don't hold this
and they resell it, then uh volume point

1916
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:33,520
and they resell it, then uh volume point
 

1917
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,589
and they resell it, then uh volume point
control and view up very very possible.

1918
00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:35,599
control and view up very very possible.
 

1919
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,190
control and view up very very possible.
And we have that old imbalance down

1920
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:37,200
And we have that old imbalance down
 

1921
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:43,829
And we have that old imbalance down
there from uh 9:48 this morning.

1922
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:43,839

 

1923
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,430

So, it's a good attempt to hold this.

1924
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:45,440
So, it's a good attempt to hold this.
 

1925
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,030
So, it's a good attempt to hold this.
This is the key area, the previous day

1926
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:47,040
This is the key area, the previous day
 

1927
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,470
This is the key area, the previous day
value area low, like we've talked about

1928
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:48,480
value area low, like we've talked about
 

1929
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,950
value area low, like we've talked about
numerous times today.

1930
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:52,960

 

1931
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,349

And you have a battle on here.

1932
00:52:57,349 --> 00:52:57,359

 

1933
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,790

Be careful if you start breaking this

1934
00:52:58,790 --> 00:52:58,800
Be careful if you start breaking this
 

1935
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,030
Be careful if you start breaking this
shelf, this blue box, cuz we can get

1936
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:01,040
shelf, this blue box, cuz we can get
 

1937
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,870
shelf, this blue box, cuz we can get
straight down, straight down into the

1938
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:02,880
straight down, straight down into the
 

1939
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,790
straight down, straight down into the
300s very, very quickly,

1940
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:08,800

 

1941
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,230

which is what they're now trying to do.

1942
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:10,240
which is what they're now trying to do.
 

1943
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,750
which is what they're now trying to do.
So, we want to see if they look below

1944
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:11,760
So, we want to see if they look below
 

1945
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,349
So, we want to see if they look below
here and fail and catch uh sellers

1946
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:15,359
here and fail and catch uh sellers
 

1947
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,829
here and fail and catch uh sellers
caught or not,

1948
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:17,839
caught or not,
 

1949
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,430
caught or not,
which is what they're trying to do. But,

1950
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:19,440
which is what they're trying to do. But,
 

1951
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,109
which is what they're trying to do. But,
you won't re-trigger anything until you

1952
00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:21,119
you won't re-trigger anything until you
 

1953
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,030
you won't re-trigger anything until you
get back above value. But that is what

1954
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:23,040
get back above value. But that is what
 

1955
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,710
get back above value. But that is what
they're attempting to do at the moment.

1956
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:24,720
they're attempting to do at the moment.
 

1957
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,150
they're attempting to do at the moment.
They're trying to trap shorts down here.

1958
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:26,160
They're trying to trap shorts down here.
 

1959
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,990
They're trying to trap shorts down here.
We have a shelf all the way down into 93

1960
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,000
We have a shelf all the way down into 93
 

1961
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,549
We have a shelf all the way down into 93
that they can actually trade down into.

1962
00:53:30,549 --> 00:53:30,559
that they can actually trade down into.
 

1963
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:31,910
that they can actually trade down into.
And below that, they can come back down

1964
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:31,920
And below that, they can come back down
 

1965
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,670
And below that, they can come back down
into point of control. So, let's just

1966
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:33,680
into point of control. So, let's just
 

1967
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,829
into point of control. So, let's just
see. Here we go.

1968
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:39,839

 

1969
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,670

The bulls need to reclaim that value

1970
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:41,680
The bulls need to reclaim that value
 

1971
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,390
The bulls need to reclaim that value
area low right now

1972
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:44,400
area low right now
 

1973
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,589
area low right now
if they're going to leave these shorts

1974
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:45,599
if they're going to leave these shorts
 

1975
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,589
if they're going to leave these shorts
down here caught. Here they go. They're

1976
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:47,599
down here caught. Here they go. They're
 

1977
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,950
down here caught. Here they go. They're
attempting to do it. They're looking for

1978
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:48,960
attempting to do it. They're looking for
 

1979
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,630
attempting to do it. They're looking for
this bear trap in this little low volume

1980
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:50,640
this bear trap in this little low volume
 

1981
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,470
this bear trap in this little low volume
node is what the bulls looking to do.

1982
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:52,480
node is what the bulls looking to do.
 

1983
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,990
node is what the bulls looking to do.
They need to reclaim this and then start

1984
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:54,000
They need to reclaim this and then start
 

1985
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,750
They need to reclaim this and then start
to squeeze. So here's the attempt of the

1986
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:55,760
to squeeze. So here's the attempt of the
 

1987
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,230
to squeeze. So here's the attempt of the
reclaim and can they start to squeeze

1988
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:58,240
reclaim and can they start to squeeze
 

1989
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,750
reclaim and can they start to squeeze
this big question. They're back testing

1990
00:53:59,750 --> 00:53:59,760
this big question. They're back testing
 

1991
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,430
this big question. They're back testing
value area low. If they can get back

1992
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:01,440
value area low. If they can get back
 

1993
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,030
value area low. If they can get back
above and base above, they will catch

1994
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:03,040
above and base above, they will catch
 

1995
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,950
above and base above, they will catch
those shorts in that low volume node we

1996
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:04,960
those shorts in that low volume node we
 

1997
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,190
those shorts in that low volume node we
just talked about.

1998
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:07,200
just talked about.
 

1999
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,990
just talked about.
Big big battle here now. Seller just

2000
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:10,000
Big big battle here now. Seller just
 

2001
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,990
Big big battle here now. Seller just
reloaded here at 36. Can bulls get back

2002
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:14,000
reloaded here at 36. Can bulls get back
 

2003
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,270
reloaded here at 36. Can bulls get back
above this to catch those bears in that

2004
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:17,280
above this to catch those bears in that
 

2005
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,950
above this to catch those bears in that
low volume node for a short squeeze back

2006
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:18,960
low volume node for a short squeeze back
 

2007
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,510
low volume node for a short squeeze back
up? That is the question.

2008
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:21,520
up? That is the question.
 

2009
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,790
up? That is the question.
That is the question. Sorry, I was

2010
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:22,800
That is the question. Sorry, I was
 

2011
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,030
That is the question. Sorry, I was
distracted this morning for the first

2012
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:25,040
distracted this morning for the first
 

2013
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,190
distracted this morning for the first
No, what's it been? 40 minutes. Thank

2016
00:54:30,549 --> 00:54:30,559
you. Very frustrating when you have
 

2017
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,589
you. Very frustrating when you have
technical issues stopping me trading.

2018
00:54:33,589 --> 00:54:33,599
technical issues stopping me trading.
 

2019
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,670
technical issues stopping me trading.
Okay, so nothing's changed. This is the

2020
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:35,680
Okay, so nothing's changed. This is the
 

2021
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,990
Okay, so nothing's changed. This is the
area. Bulls are trying to defend this.

2022
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:38,000
area. Bulls are trying to defend this.
 

2023
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,670
area. Bulls are trying to defend this.
Use that as the trap. Can they get this

2024
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:39,680
Use that as the trap. Can they get this
 

2025
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,109
Use that as the trap. Can they get this
move? That's what they're looking for at

2026
00:54:41,109 --> 00:54:41,119
move? That's what they're looking for at
 

2027
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,190
move? That's what they're looking for at
the moment. Bears will want to just get

2028
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:43,200
the moment. Bears will want to just get
 

2029
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,950
the moment. Bears will want to just get
complete this rotation back down. So,

2030
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:44,960
complete this rotation back down. So,
 

2031
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,710
complete this rotation back down. So,
we're just trading in range today. All

2032
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:46,720
we're just trading in range today. All
 

2033
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,790
we're just trading in range today. All
right. It was identified from this box

2034
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:48,800
right. It was identified from this box
 

2035
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,470
right. It was identified from this box
to this box. So, we can make this back

2036
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:50,480
to this box. So, we can make this back
 

2037
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,390
to this box. So, we can make this back
to blue uh to red now because we didn't

2038
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:52,400
to blue uh to red now because we didn't
 

2039
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,230
to blue uh to red now because we didn't
hold it. All right. That's your range on

2040
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:54,240
hold it. All right. That's your range on
 

2041
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,230
hold it. All right. That's your range on
the day currently. Or you can just look

2042
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:56,240
the day currently. Or you can just look
 

2043
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,829
the day currently. Or you can just look
at the profile. You can see the range on

2044
00:54:57,829 --> 00:54:57,839
at the profile. You can see the range on
 

2045
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,870
at the profile. You can see the range on
the day.

2046
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:00,880
the day.
 

2047
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,470
the day.
Waiting to see if bulls can get back

2048
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:02,480
Waiting to see if bulls can get back
 

2049
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,390
Waiting to see if bulls can get back
above and hold value or if we're going

2050
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:04,400
above and hold value or if we're going
 

2051
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,030
above and hold value or if we're going
to dip further down and start moving

2052
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:07,040
to dip further down and start moving
 

2053
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,109
to dip further down and start moving
into that cell.

2054
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:09,119
into that cell.
 

2055
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,030
into that cell.
VIX is going absolutely nowhere. It is

2056
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:11,040
VIX is going absolutely nowhere. It is
 

2057
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,549
VIX is going absolutely nowhere. It is
also caught in a range. Let's have a

2058
00:55:12,549 --> 00:55:12,559
also caught in a range. Let's have a
 

2059
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:17,670
also caught in a range. Let's have a
look at ES. ES is now back to VWAP.

2060
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:17,680
look at ES. ES is now back to VWAP.
 

2061
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,589
look at ES. ES is now back to VWAP.
Still inside.

2062
00:55:19,589 --> 00:55:19,599
Still inside.
 

2063
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:25,349
Still inside.
That's definitely changed. [\h__\h] me.

2064
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:25,359

 

2065
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:49,589

wishes galore here today.

2066
00:55:49,589 --> 00:55:49,599

 

2067
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,069

There we go.

2068
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:52,079
There we go.
 

2069
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,990
There we go.
One day, folks, one day we'll come to

2070
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:54,000
One day, folks, one day we'll come to
 

2071
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,910
One day, folks, one day we'll come to
the charts and not have these issues.

2072
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:55,920
the charts and not have these issues.
 

2073
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,833
the charts and not have these issues.
I'm waiting for that day.

2074
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:00,843

 

2075
00:56:00,843 --> 00:56:01,430

[snorts]

2076
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:01,440
[snorts]
 

2077
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,430
[snorts]
Top set back up. Okay, nice. Well, good

2078
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:03,440
Top set back up. Okay, nice. Well, good
 

2079
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,030
Top set back up. Okay, nice. Well, good
for you guys. You're brave if you trade

2080
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:05,040
for you guys. You're brave if you trade
 

2081
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,430
for you guys. You're brave if you trade
with them, honestly.

2082
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:07,440
with them, honestly.
 

2083
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,030
with them, honestly.
Okay, they're reattempting. Remember,

2084
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:09,040
Okay, they're reattempting. Remember,
 

2085
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,270
Okay, they're reattempting. Remember,
bulls want to get back above this level

2086
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:11,280
bulls want to get back above this level
 

2087
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,109
bulls want to get back above this level
to complete a rotation. Bears just want

2088
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:13,119
to complete a rotation. Bears just want
 

2089
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,030
to complete a rotation. Bears just want
to rotate back down to value low and

2090
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:15,040
to rotate back down to value low and
 

2091
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,190
to rotate back down to value low and
VWOP.

2092
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:17,200
VWOP.
 

2093
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,710
VWOP.
And you just got to probably let it

2094
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:18,720
And you just got to probably let it
 

2095
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:29,190
And you just got to probably let it
build out here for a minute.

2096
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:29,200

 

2097
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,390

God, that's strong, Jess. O, strong

2098
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:32,400
God, that's strong, Jess. O, strong
 

2099
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:38,390
God, that's strong, Jess. O, strong
coffee.

2100
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:38,400

 

2101
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,309

All right, so I'd watch this low volume

2102
00:56:40,309 --> 00:56:40,319
All right, so I'd watch this low volume
 

2103
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:43,190
All right, so I'd watch this low volume
node here. 07s to 97s. All right, that

2104
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:43,200
node here. 07s to 97s. All right, that
 

2105
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,750
node here. 07s to 97s. All right, that
could be a trap level. Otherwise,

2106
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:45,760
could be a trap level. Otherwise,
 

2107
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,990
could be a trap level. Otherwise,
bears are starting to take control here.

2108
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:48,000
bears are starting to take control here.
 

2109
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,910
bears are starting to take control here.
Right. If they force this lower high, if

2110
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:49,920
Right. If they force this lower high, if
 

2111
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,510
Right. If they force this lower high, if
they start to rotate, it's a problem.

2112
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:51,520
they start to rotate, it's a problem.
 

2113
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,030
they start to rotate, it's a problem.
Balls

2114
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:53,040
Balls
 

2115
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,589
Balls
need to do

2116
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:55,599
need to do
 

2117
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,670
need to do
this move here. That's what bulls are

2118
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:57,680
this move here. That's what bulls are
 

2119
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,270
this move here. That's what bulls are
looking for. It's a battle right now.

2120
00:56:59,270 --> 00:56:59,280
looking for. It's a battle right now.
 

2121
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,510
looking for. It's a battle right now.
Lower time frame. She knew I need to do

2122
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:01,520
Lower time frame. She knew I need to do
 

2123
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,950
Lower time frame. She knew I need to do
it. Yeah, he's probably right.

2124
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:04,960
it. Yeah, he's probably right.
 

2125
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,470
it. Yeah, he's probably right.
Either that or she's drugged it to be

2126
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:06,480
Either that or she's drugged it to be
 

2127
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,910
Either that or she's drugged it to be
like, "Shut this guy up." He's well

2128
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:07,920
like, "Shut this guy up." He's well
 

2129
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,264
like, "Shut this guy up." He's well
annoying.

2130
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:10,274
annoying.
 

2131
00:57:10,274 --> 00:57:12,549
annoying.
[laughter]

2132
00:57:12,549 --> 00:57:12,559

 

2133
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,349

Just tapping on that value level. We're

2134
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:15,359
Just tapping on that value level. We're
 

2135
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:17,510
Just tapping on that value level. We're
in sort of no man's land here. We need

2136
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:17,520
in sort of no man's land here. We need
 

2137
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,190
in sort of no man's land here. We need
to get back inside if Bulls are going to

2138
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:19,200
to get back inside if Bulls are going to
 

2139
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,470
to get back inside if Bulls are going to
have a shot here. They're having another

2140
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:20,480
have a shot here. They're having another
 

2141
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,230
have a shot here. They're having another
go. They're trying to get back inside

2142
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:22,240
go. They're trying to get back inside
 

2143
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,670
go. They're trying to get back inside
and bears are defending this

2144
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:23,680
and bears are defending this
 

2145
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:29,589
and bears are defending this
aggressively.

2146
00:57:29,589 --> 00:57:29,599

 

2147
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,750

I do think if bulls are able to get back

2148
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:31,760
I do think if bulls are able to get back
 

2149
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,589
I do think if bulls are able to get back
inside value, there is a potential move

2150
00:57:33,589 --> 00:57:33,599
inside value, there is a potential move
 

2151
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,230
inside value, there is a potential move
higher today. But we did defend this

2152
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:36,240
higher today. But we did defend this
 

2153
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,750
higher today. But we did defend this
400.

2154
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:37,760
400.
 

2155
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,349
400.
We know that was a big level yesterday

2156
00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:39,359
We know that was a big level yesterday
 

2157
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:42,549
We know that was a big level yesterday
into here. But if bulls can reclaim, I

2158
00:57:42,549 --> 00:57:42,559
into here. But if bulls can reclaim, I
 

2159
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,069
into here. But if bulls can reclaim, I
think we've got liquidity here we can

2160
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:44,079
think we've got liquidity here we can
 

2161
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:45,829
think we've got liquidity here we can
aim for. I think they could maybe could

2162
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:45,839
aim for. I think they could maybe could
 

2163
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,430
aim for. I think they could maybe could
do that rotation to value area height.

2164
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:47,440
do that rotation to value area height.
 

2165
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,710
do that rotation to value area height.
It all depends if they actually want to

2166
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:48,720
It all depends if they actually want to
 

2167
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:54,309
It all depends if they actually want to
turn up today or not.

2168
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:54,319

 

2169
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,230

Getting very tight here. You can see

2170
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:56,240
Getting very tight here. You can see
 

2171
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:02,870
Getting very tight here. You can see
very very very tight.

2172
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:02,880

 

2173
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,789

If we lose value, we have to like sort

2174
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:04,799
If we lose value, we have to like sort
 

2175
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:07,109
If we lose value, we have to like sort
of be willing to flip and think about

2176
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:07,119
of be willing to flip and think about
 

2177
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,510
of be willing to flip and think about
shorts because it means we're rejecting

2178
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:09,520
shorts because it means we're rejecting
 

2179
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,910
shorts because it means we're rejecting
value. So, but the way we've built out

2180
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:11,920
value. So, but the way we've built out
 

2181
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,109
value. So, but the way we've built out
structure this morning is going to make

2182
00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:13,119
structure this morning is going to make
 

2183
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,109
structure this morning is going to make
it a little bit more tricky to think

2184
00:58:15,109 --> 00:58:15,119
it a little bit more tricky to think
 

2185
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,829
it a little bit more tricky to think
about that at the moment.

2186
00:58:17,829 --> 00:58:17,839
about that at the moment.
 

2187
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:24,630
about that at the moment.
Apple starting to lose a bid.

2188
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:24,640

 

2189
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,950

ES back under its New York open under

2190
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:26,960
ES back under its New York open under
 

2191
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,270
ES back under its New York open under
VWAP coming into its 20day. So, weakness

2192
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:29,280
VWAP coming into its 20day. So, weakness
 

2193
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,750
VWAP coming into its 20day. So, weakness
in the ES here.

2194
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:31,760
in the ES here.
 

2195
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,430
in the ES here.
There's that bleed across the markets.

2196
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:33,440
There's that bleed across the markets.
 

2197
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,349
There's that bleed across the markets.
RTY red on a day

2198
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:37,359
RTY red on a day
 

2199
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:38,950
RTY red on a day
testing towards that what we talked

2200
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:38,960
testing towards that what we talked
 

2201
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,230
testing towards that what we talked
about. Bears have taken control now and

2202
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:42,240
about. Bears have taken control now and
 

2203
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,990
about. Bears have taken control now and
how far can they force this rotation is

2204
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:44,000
how far can they force this rotation is
 

2205
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,990
how far can they force this rotation is
the new question.

2206
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:46,000
the new question.
 

2207
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:53,510
the new question.
Yes, very very very weak here.

2208
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:53,520

 

2209
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,510

Right into its 20k does not look good

2210
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:55,520
Right into its 20k does not look good
 

2211
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:01,109
Right into its 20k does not look good
for the ES right now.

2212
00:59:01,109 --> 00:59:01,119

 

2213
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:03,270

So previous day value defended by bears.

2214
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:03,280
So previous day value defended by bears.
 

2215
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,030
So previous day value defended by bears.
So we go back into rotation of current

2216
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:05,040
So we go back into rotation of current
 

2217
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,789
So we go back into rotation of current
day value. All right. So bears have

2218
00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:06,799
day value. All right. So bears have
 

2219
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:08,230
day value. All right. So bears have
taken control. They didn't let it back

2220
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:08,240
taken control. They didn't let it back
 

2221
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,430
taken control. They didn't let it back
through point of control. They've

2222
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:09,440
through point of control. They've
 

2223
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,670
through point of control. They've
defended. All right. So, bears didn't

2224
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:11,680
defended. All right. So, bears didn't
 

2225
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,069
defended. All right. So, bears didn't
let it back through point of control. So

2226
00:59:14,069 --> 00:59:14,079
let it back through point of control. So
 

2227
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,150
let it back through point of control. So
far, they've defended value. This is

2228
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:16,160
far, they've defended value. This is
 

2229
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,750
far, they've defended value. This is
their TP right now. And then they're

2230
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:17,760
their TP right now. And then they're
 

2231
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,349
their TP right now. And then they're
looking for run as an expansion under

2232
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:19,359
looking for run as an expansion under
 

2233

2235
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,910
here if they get it. Bulls, well, they
will want to defend this level here

2236
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:23,920
will want to defend this level here
 

2237
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,589

intraday. Failing to do that, they'll

2238
00:59:25,589 --> 00:59:25,599
intraday. Failing to do that, they'll
 

2239
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,270
intraday. Failing to do that, they'll
look to defend this. But really, they

2240
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:27,280
look to defend this. But really, they
 

2241
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,789
look to defend this. But really, they
need to reclaim that. Otherwise, they've

2242
00:59:28,789 --> 00:59:28,799
need to reclaim that. Otherwise, they've
 

2243
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:31,589
need to reclaim that. Otherwise, they've
got no shot. They have no shot because

2244
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:31,599
got no shot. They have no shot because
 

2245
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,589
got no shot. They have no shot because
higher time frame bears are in control

2246

rotation lower. ES is trying to find a

2372
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:39,440
rotation lower. ES is trying to find a
 

2373
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,950
rotation lower. ES is trying to find a
bid down here near the lows. You'd

2374
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:40,960
bid down here near the lows. You'd
 

2375
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,390
bid down here near the lows. You'd
imagine they're going going to go and

2376
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:42,400
imagine they're going going to go and
 

2377
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,710
imagine they're going going to go and
dunk it, but all I'm saying is be

2378
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:44,720
dunk it, but all I'm saying is be
 

2379
01:02:44,720 --> 01:03:00,789
dunk it, but all I'm saying is be
careful

2380
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:00,799

 

2381
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,390

coming into this edge. And if they lose

2382
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:02,400
coming into this edge. And if they lose
 

2383
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,030
coming into this edge. And if they lose
that low day is possible.

2384
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:05,040
that low day is possible.
 

2385
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:15,589
that low day is possible.
Definitely possible.

2386
01:03:15,589 --> 01:03:15,599

 

2387
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:26,710

Yes, he's about to do it.

2388
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:26,720

 

2389
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:37,430

Few

2390
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:37,440

 

2391
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,270

sellers got stuck down there just then,

2392
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:39,280
sellers got stuck down there just then,
 

2393
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,870
sellers got stuck down there just then,
folks.

2394
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:40,880
folks.
 

2395
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,870
folks.
They need to get back under 65 here. The

2396
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:42,880
They need to get back under 65 here. The
 

2397
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,990
They need to get back under 65 here. The
sellers, otherwise they're going to get

2398
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:44,000
sellers, otherwise they're going to get
 

2399
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,470
sellers, otherwise they're going to get
caught. Few sellers just got caught

2400
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:46,480
caught. Few sellers just got caught
 

2401
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,870
caught. Few sellers just got caught
under 65. They need to get back under 65

2402
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:48,880
under 65. They need to get back under 65
 

2403
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,910
under 65. They need to get back under 65
otherwise they're going to get caught

2404
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:49,920
otherwise they're going to get caught
 

2405
01:03:49,920 --> 01:04:00,390
otherwise they're going to get caught
for a little squeeze.

2406
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:00,400

 

2407
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,150

It's a passive seller up there at 80. If

2408
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:02,160
It's a passive seller up there at 80. If
 

2409
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,510
It's a passive seller up there at 80. If
he moves out the way, this thing can

2410
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:03,520
he moves out the way, this thing can
 

2411
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,190
he moves out the way, this thing can
squeeze because it just caught a few. So

2412
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:05,200
squeeze because it just caught a few. So
 

2413
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,270
squeeze because it just caught a few. So
65 to 80 is your current like M1

2414
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:07,280
65 to 80 is your current like M1
 

2415
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,950
65 to 80 is your current like M1
rotation.

2416
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:08,960
rotation.
 

2417
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,630
rotation.
They're going to go back to test 65. If

2418
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:10,640
They're going to go back to test 65. If
 

2419
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,470
They're going to go back to test 65. If
they get under 65, sellers take control

2420
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,480
they get under 65, sellers take control
 

2421
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,309
they get under 65, sellers take control
again. They're testing it. You see, they

2422
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:14,319
again. They're testing it. You see, they
 

2423
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:15,430
again. They're testing it. You see, they
just found a bid there again. So there's

2424
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:15,440
just found a bid there again. So there's
 

2425
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,390
just found a bid there again. So there's
a passive buy there for now. It's only a

2426
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:18,400
a passive buy there for now. It's only a
 

2427
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,910
a passive buy there for now. It's only a
15 point rotation here while they make

2428
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:19,920
15 point rotation here while they make
 

2429
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,349
15 point rotation here while they make
their mind up. You've got a few people

2430
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:21,359
their mind up. You've got a few people
 

2431
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:23,190
their mind up. You've got a few people
on the tape battling. Sellers are caught

2432
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:23,200
on the tape battling. Sellers are caught
 

2433
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,190
on the tape battling. Sellers are caught
under 65. There's a passive seller at

2434
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:25,200
under 65. There's a passive seller at
 

2435
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,349
under 65. There's a passive seller at
80. So sellers want it under 65 for a

2436
01:04:27,349 --> 01:04:27,359
80. So sellers want it under 65 for a
 

2437
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,190
80. So sellers want it under 65 for a
wash. If they get back above 80, they're

2438
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:29,200
wash. If they get back above 80, they're
 

2439
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,150
wash. If they get back above 80, they're
going to get squeezed out.

2440
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:32,160
going to get squeezed out.
 

2441
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,430
going to get squeezed out.
You would imagine we're going to trade

2442
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:33,440
You would imagine we're going to trade
 

2443
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,109
You would imagine we're going to trade
lower because ES is very close to lower

2444
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:35,119
lower because ES is very close to lower
 

2445
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:36,470
lower because ES is very close to lower
day, but they need to see the set. Here

2446
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:36,480
day, but they need to see the set. Here
 

2447
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,750
day, but they need to see the set. Here
they come. So they step back on the

2448
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:37,760
they come. So they step back on the
 

2449
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,950
they come. So they step back on the
tape. There you go.

2450
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:40,960
tape. There you go.
 

2451
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,190
tape. There you go.
They almost lost control of that for a

2452
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:43,200
They almost lost control of that for a
 

2453
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:48,069
They almost lost control of that for a
for nancond. Yes. Almost current day.

2454
01:04:48,069 --> 01:04:48,079
for nancond. Yes. Almost current day.
 

2455
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:49,750
for nancond. Yes. Almost current day.
Big starting to spike as well. Starting

2456
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:49,760
Big starting to spike as well. Starting
 

2457
01:04:49,760 --> 01:05:01,109
Big starting to spike as well. Starting
to get motoring into the 17s. Here's

2458
01:05:01,109 --> 01:05:01,119

 

2459
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:05,430

the lows in. It goes boom

2460
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:05,440
the lows in. It goes boom
 

2461
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,750
the lows in. It goes boom
into those lows.

2462
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:09,760

 

2463
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,990

Yes, new low day. All right. So, here's

2464
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:12,000
Yes, new low day. All right. So, here's
 

2465
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,309
Yes, new low day. All right. So, here's
your New York open and then green and

2466
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:14,319
your New York open and then green and
 

2467
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,710
your New York open and then green and
blue box is what they will ideally want

2468
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:16,720
blue box is what they will ideally want
 

2469
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,230
blue box is what they will ideally want
to defend. If they fail to defend this,

2470
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:18,240
to defend. If they fail to defend this,
 

2471
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,230
to defend. If they fail to defend this,
then you can't rule out GlobeEx low.

2472
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:20,240
then you can't rule out GlobeEx low.
 

2473
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:25,270
then you can't rule out GlobeEx low.
There's no way you can rule it out.

2474
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:25,280

 

2475
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,270

Market staying heavy. Most of the mags

2476
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:27,280
Market staying heavy. Most of the mags
 

2477
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,870
Market staying heavy. Most of the mags
lost its bid now other than Meta and

2478
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:28,880
lost its bid now other than Meta and
 

2479
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,190
lost its bid now other than Meta and
Nvidia. [cough]

2480
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:33,200

 

2481
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,950

Yeah, once it lost, you're right. Once

2482
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:34,960
Yeah, once it lost, you're right. Once
 

2483
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,589
Yeah, once it lost, you're right. Once
it lost the shelf, right, once it failed

2484
01:05:37,589 --> 01:05:37,599
it lost the shelf, right, once it failed
 

2485
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,750
it lost the shelf, right, once it failed
previous day, uh, in control a couple

2486
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:39,760
previous day, uh, in control a couple
 

2487
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,430
previous day, uh, in control a couple
times and it lost this, it really

2488
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:41,440
times and it lost this, it really
 

2489
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,510
times and it lost this, it really
started to wash and wash and wash and

2490
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:43,520
started to wash and wash and wash and
 

2491
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,510
started to wash and wash and wash and
wash and now we're moving into a sell.

2492
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:45,520
wash and now we're moving into a sell.
 

2493
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,109
wash and now we're moving into a sell.
So, we're outside of yesterday's value.

2494
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:47,119
So, we're outside of yesterday's value.
 

2495
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:49,029
So, we're outside of yesterday's value.
So the bias now remains short and you

2496
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:49,039
So the bias now remains short and you
 

2497
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,910
So the bias now remains short and you
just be covering into these. [snorts]

2498
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:51,920
just be covering into these. [snorts]
 

2499
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,230
just be covering into these. [snorts]
Uh we're in we're if we reclaim today's

2500
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:54,240
Uh we're in we're if we reclaim today's
 

2501
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,349
Uh we're in we're if we reclaim today's
value, you just want to be careful that

2502
01:05:55,349 --> 01:05:55,359
value, you just want to be careful that
 

2503
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:57,349
value, you just want to be careful that
they just don't do a whippy rotational

2504
01:05:57,349 --> 01:05:57,359
they just don't do a whippy rotational
 

2505
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:58,710
they just don't do a whippy rotational
type of day. Let me just check the

2506
01:05:58,710 --> 01:05:58,720
type of day. Let me just check the
 

2507
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,789
type of day. Let me just check the
daily. I mean still we're an inside day

2508
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:00,799
daily. I mean still we're an inside day
 

2509
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:02,950
daily. I mean still we're an inside day
on the daily. So you want to be careful.

2510
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:02,960
on the daily. So you want to be careful.
 

2511
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:11,990
on the daily. So you want to be careful.
It's an inside bar on the daily.

2512
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:12,000

 

2513
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,670

You want to be careful spy looks below

2514
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:13,680
You want to be careful spy looks below
 

2515
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,349
You want to be careful spy looks below
and fails.

2516
01:06:15,349 --> 01:06:15,359
and fails.
 

2517
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:18,390
and fails.
Where have we traded into 78? That was a

2518
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:18,400
Where have we traded into 78? That was a
 

2519
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:24,230
Where have we traded into 78? That was a
big level on spy.

2520
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:24,240

 

2521
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,150

The way we built this, we they might

2522
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:26,160
The way we built this, we they might
 

2523
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,349
The way we built this, we they might
want to come and test this point of

2524
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:27,359
want to come and test this point of
 

2525
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:28,549
want to come and test this point of
control and if they get through that

2526
01:06:28,549 --> 01:06:28,559
control and if they get through that
 

2527
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:29,910
control and if they get through that
back through here and then they might

2528
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:29,920
back through here and then they might
 

2529
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,069
back through here and then they might
try and resell it or they might just

2530
01:06:32,069 --> 01:06:32,079
try and resell it or they might just
 

2531
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:33,589
try and resell it or they might just
keep dumping if they've got inventory

2532
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:33,599
keep dumping if they've got inventory
 

2533
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,710
keep dumping if they've got inventory
like this. We'll see.

2534
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:36,720
like this. We'll see.
 

2535
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:43,109
like this. We'll see.
Aggressive. Aggressive. Aggressive.

2536
01:06:43,109 --> 01:06:43,119

 

2537
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:45,829

Probably 75 I imagine is the next gamma

2538
01:06:45,829 --> 01:06:45,839
Probably 75 I imagine is the next gamma
 

2539
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:48,870
Probably 75 I imagine is the next gamma
level on spy.

2540
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:48,880
level on spy.
 

2541
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,470
level on spy.
Zoom this out. We're losing all bits

2542
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:50,480
Zoom this out. We're losing all bits
 

2543
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,789
Zoom this out. We're losing all bits
here on spy. It's starting to lose its

2544
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:52,799
here on spy. It's starting to lose its
 

2545
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:58,150
here on spy. It's starting to lose its
uh box here. Yeah, 755 75 is probably in

2546
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:58,160
uh box here. Yeah, 755 75 is probably in
 

2547
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:26,710
uh box here. Yeah, 755 75 is probably in
the next level. fighters.

2548
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:26,720

 

2549
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,390

Jack, thank God we don't listen to you

2550
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:28,400
Jack, thank God we don't listen to you
 

2551
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:43,589
Jack, thank God we don't listen to you
every day you're here.

2552
01:07:43,589 --> 01:07:43,599

 

2553
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:45,990

You can't listen, my friends. You can't

2554
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:46,000
You can't listen, my friends. You can't
 

2555
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,630
You can't listen, my friends. You can't
listen. If we leave this,

2556
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:48,640
listen. If we leave this,
 

2557
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,710
listen. If we leave this,
we're protrend. We have to reject this.

2558
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:50,720
we're protrend. We have to reject this.
 

2559
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,990
we're protrend. We have to reject this.
We're protren. But we're going to

2560
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:52,000
We're protren. But we're going to
 

2561
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,789
We're protren. But we're going to
respect this. Rotation can happen in

2562
01:07:54,789 --> 01:07:54,799
respect this. Rotation can happen in
 

2563
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:56,789
respect this. Rotation can happen in
here. Can happen in here. But like I

2564
01:07:56,789 --> 01:07:56,799
here. Can happen in here. But like I
 

2565
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:00,309
here. Can happen in here. But like I
said, we're protraed outside of this.

2566
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:00,319
said, we're protraed outside of this.
 

2567
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:03,510
said, we're protraed outside of this.
Oh man, I tell you what, Jack, very

Oh man, I tell you what, Jack, very

annoying.

2574
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:09,440
annoying.
 

2575
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:16,407

You're just an annoying character.

2599
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,870

Imagine I would imagine there's a bit of

2600
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:46,880
Imagine I would imagine there's a bit of
 

2601
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,390
Imagine I would imagine there's a bit of
a gamma level there. VIX starting to

2602
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:48,400
a gamma level there. VIX starting to
 

2603
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,189
a gamma level there. VIX starting to
really start to break out now. So, next

2604
01:08:51,189 --> 01:08:51,199
really start to break out now. So, next
 

2605
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:52,789
really start to break out now. So, next
level for VIX once we get through here

2606
01:08:52,789 --> 01:08:52,799
level for VIX once we get through here
 

2607
01:08:52,799 --> 01:09:03,990
level for VIX once we get through here
will be a test of 1786.

01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:04,000

 

2609
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,510

Starting to get very aggressive on the

Starting to get very aggressive on the

Any of you that are short, I'd be

01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:08,640
Any of you that are short, I'd be
 

2615
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,070
Any of you that are short, I'd be
covering into this level like I talked

2616
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:10,080
covering into this level like I talked
 

2617
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,269
covering into this level like I talked
about. All right, that's the sort of

2618
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:11,279
about. All right, that's the sort of
 

2619
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:12,950
about. All right, that's the sort of
break and retest level or at least

2620
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:12,960
break and retest level or at least
 

2621
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,550
break and retest level or at least
covering some of your position into this

2622
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:14,560
covering some of your position into this
 

2623
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,550
covering some of your position into this
level. This blue box here, this is where

2624
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:16,560
level. This blue box here, this is where
 

2625
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,070
level. This blue box here, this is where
they will try and defend. It doesn't

2626
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:18,080
they will try and defend. It doesn't
 

2627
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,510
they will try and defend. It doesn't
mean they can defend it, but you would

2628
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:19,520
mean they can defend it, but you would
 

2629
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,430
mean they can defend it, but you would
imagine they'll try and defend. And then

2630
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:21,440
imagine they'll try and defend. And then
 

2631
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:22,709
imagine they'll try and defend. And then
beyond this, we'd be looking for a

2632
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:22,719
beyond this, we'd be looking for a
 

2633
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:24,870
beyond this, we'd be looking for a
breakdown of GloEx. And then under here,

2634
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:24,880
breakdown of GloEx. And then under here,
 

2635
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,149
breakdown of GloEx. And then under here,
the next level's all the way down at

2636
01:09:26,149 --> 01:09:26,159
the next level's all the way down at
 

2637
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:27,990
the next level's all the way down at
800.

2638
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:28,000
800.
 

2639
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,590
800.
All the way down at 800.

2640
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:31,600
All the way down at 800.
 

2641
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:38,229
All the way down at 800.
Nice. Yeah, really nice, man.

2642
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:38,239

 

2643
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:39,990

Still getting aggressive here. Whole of

2644
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:40,000
Still getting aggressive here. Whole of
 

2645
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,110
Still getting aggressive here. Whole of
the mag other than meta now turns

2646
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:43,120
the mag other than meta now turns
 

2647
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,630
the mag other than meta now turns
green to reds.

2648
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:46,640

 

2649
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,149

Yeah, exactly, Josh. It can move down

2650
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:48,159
Yeah, exactly, Josh. It can move down
 

2651
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,149
Yeah, exactly, Josh. It can move down
into that into this box if we lo if we

2652
01:09:50,149 --> 01:09:50,159
into that into this box if we lo if we
 

2653
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:51,910
into that into this box if we lo if we
lose the bid up there. Absolutely. It's

2654
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:51,920
lose the bid up there. Absolutely. It's
 

2655
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,749
lose the bid up there. Absolutely. It's
the next level.

2656
01:09:53,749 --> 01:09:53,759
the next level.
 

2657
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:56,390
the next level.
If we look at the daily and the yearly,

2658
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:56,400
If we look at the daily and the yearly,
 

2659
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,070
If we look at the daily and the yearly,
yeah, there's no profile really till we

2660
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:58,080
yeah, there's no profile really till we
 

2661
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,310
yeah, there's no profile really till we
get down there. So, you'd be watching,

2662
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:00,320
get down there. So, you'd be watching,
 

2663
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,990
get down there. So, you'd be watching,
you know, previous day low into 25s. All

2664
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:04,000
you know, previous day low into 25s. All
 

2665
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,390
you know, previous day low into 25s. All
right. And 25,000 whole number and that

2666
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:06,400
right. And 25,000 whole number and that
 

2667
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,950
right. And 25,000 whole number and that
sort of 960. We start to lose that, then

2668
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:08,960
sort of 960. We start to lose that, then
 

2669
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,510
sort of 960. We start to lose that, then
yes, I I would agree with you. I would

2670
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:11,520
yes, I I would agree with you. I would
 

2671
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,910
yes, I I would agree with you. I would
agree with you. It's possible.

2672
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:13,920
agree with you. It's possible.
 

2673
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,189
agree with you. It's possible.
I think we might need to build a bit

2674
01:10:15,189 --> 01:10:15,199
I think we might need to build a bit
 

2675
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:16,390
I think we might need to build a bit
more liquidity. This is getting very

2676
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:16,400
more liquidity. This is getting very
 

2677
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,189
more liquidity. This is getting very
very aggressive. So, need to wait for a

2678
01:10:19,189 --> 01:10:19,199
very aggressive. So, need to wait for a
 

2679
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,270
very aggressive. So, need to wait for a
back test to see if they uh remain heavy

2680
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:21,280
back test to see if they uh remain heavy
 

2681
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,630
back test to see if they uh remain heavy
on it because they've done a big move

2682
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:22,640
on it because they've done a big move
 

2683
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,270
on it because they've done a big move
here. Might not look big, but this is

2684
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:25,280
here. Might not look big, but this is
 

2685
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,709
here. Might not look big, but this is
likeund and something point move from

2686
01:10:28,709 --> 01:10:28,719
likeund and something point move from
 

2687
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:30,310
likeund and something point move from
losing this shelf without really much of

2688
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:30,320
losing this shelf without really much of
 

2689
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:31,590
losing this shelf without really much of
a back test, I guess, for a couple

2690
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:31,600
a back test, I guess, for a couple
 

2691
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,110
a back test, I guess, for a couple
minutes here. So, just waiting to see if

2692
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:33,120
minutes here. So, just waiting to see if
 

2693
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:43,030
minutes here. So, just waiting to see if
they offer a back test.

2694
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:43,040

 

2695
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,870

ES coming into GlobeEx. It's found a

2696
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:44,880
ES coming into GlobeEx. It's found a
 

2697
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,149
ES coming into GlobeEx. It's found a
little bit of a bid there at GlobeEx

2698
01:10:46,149 --> 01:10:46,159
little bit of a bid there at GlobeEx
 

2699
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:50,709
little bit of a bid there at GlobeEx
spying to its 20-day. [snorts]

2700
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:50,719

 

2701
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:52,070

And you're starting to see some relief

2702
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:52,080
And you're starting to see some relief
 

2703
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:58,310
And you're starting to see some relief
here on the edge of the blue box.

2704
01:10:58,310 --> 01:10:58,320

 

2705
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,830

So, it's a cover point. Like I said,

2706
01:10:59,830 --> 01:10:59,840
So, it's a cover point. Like I said,
 

2707
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,550
So, it's a cover point. Like I said,
likely to be a cover point down here.

2708
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:02,560
likely to be a cover point down here.
 

2709
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,990
likely to be a cover point down here.
Doesn't mean they can't go lower. It's

2710
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:04,000
Doesn't mean they can't go lower. It's
 

2711
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,590
Doesn't mean they can't go lower. It's
just likely to be a first target. If I

2712
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:05,600
just likely to be a first target. If I
 

2713
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,390
just likely to be a first target. If I
was short off the rotation here, right?

2714
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:08,400
was short off the rotation here, right?
 

2715
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,470
was short off the rotation here, right?
If my Ninja Trader was being kind and we

2716
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:10,480
If my Ninja Trader was being kind and we
 

2717
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,149
If my Ninja Trader was being kind and we
lost these shelves, all right, this

2718
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:12,159
lost these shelves, all right, this
 

2719
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:13,590
lost these shelves, all right, this
would definitely be a cover point where

2720
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:13,600
would definitely be a cover point where
 

2721
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,270
would definitely be a cover point where
I'd be taking a huge amount of my profit

2722
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:15,280
I'd be taking a huge amount of my profit
 

2723
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,070
I'd be taking a huge amount of my profit
off, which is why it's highlighted the

2724
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:18,080
off, which is why it's highlighted the
 

2725
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,430
off, which is why it's highlighted the
way it is. All right, so you're starting

2726
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:19,440
way it is. All right, so you're starting
 

2727
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,270
way it is. All right, so you're starting
to see some relief now. We're going to

2728
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:21,280
to see some relief now. We're going to
 

2729
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,709
to see some relief now. We're going to
come up to that New York open. That New

2730
01:11:22,709 --> 01:11:22,719
come up to that New York open. That New
 

2731
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:39,189
come up to that New York open. That New
York open will be key. It will be key.

2732
01:11:39,189 --> 01:11:39,199

 

2733
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:40,950

Buyers getting aggressive up here. They

2734
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:40,960
Buyers getting aggressive up here. They
 

2735
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,390
Buyers getting aggressive up here. They
might get themselves caught. They keep

2736
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:42,400
might get themselves caught. They keep
 

2737
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,149
might get themselves caught. They keep
trying to buy the high of this candle.

2738
01:11:44,149 --> 01:11:44,159
trying to buy the high of this candle.
 

2739
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:45,110
trying to buy the high of this candle.
They don't get through that New York

2740
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:45,120
They don't get through that New York
 

2741
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,870
They don't get through that New York
open. They're going to get caught buy

2742
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:46,880
open. They're going to get caught buy
 

2743
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,630
open. They're going to get caught buy
side delta here. Here into the sellside

2744
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:48,640
side delta here. Here into the sellside
 

2745
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,229
side delta here. Here into the sellside
imbalance. Can they get continuation?

2746
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:50,239
imbalance. Can they get continuation?
 

2747
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,430
imbalance. Can they get continuation?
Here's the New York open.

2748
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:53,440
Here's the New York open.
 

2749
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,630
Here's the New York open.
And they're going to look to squeeze

2750
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:54,640
And they're going to look to squeeze
 

2751
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,630
And they're going to look to squeeze
probably back up towards value here. And

2752
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:56,640
probably back up towards value here. And
 

2753
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,630
probably back up towards value here. And
then if I was them, I'd be very careful

2754
01:11:58,630 --> 01:11:58,640
then if I was them, I'd be very careful
 

2755
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,350
then if I was them, I'd be very careful
about thinking about more than that.

2756
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:01,360
about thinking about more than that.
 

2757
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,189
about thinking about more than that.
Unless we get acceptance back into that

2758
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:03,199
Unless we get acceptance back into that
 

2759
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:06,070
Unless we get acceptance back into that
range again, in which case,

2760
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:06,080
range again, in which case,
 

2761
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,470
range again, in which case,
oh my god, it could be rotation, but you

2762
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:08,480
oh my god, it could be rotation, but you
 

2763
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,790
oh my god, it could be rotation, but you
know,

2764
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:10,800
know,
 

2765
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,910
know,
make sure you listen to Mr. Noby in chat

2766
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:13,920
make sure you listen to Mr. Noby in chat
 

2767
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,910
make sure you listen to Mr. Noby in chat
instead. Okay,

2768
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:17,920
instead. Okay,
 

2769
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,590
instead. Okay,
here we go. Testing current value area

2770
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:19,600
here we go. Testing current value area
 

2771
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,149
here we go. Testing current value area
low. Testing this shelf here. This is

2772
01:12:22,149 --> 01:12:22,159
low. Testing this shelf here. This is
 

2773
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:26,470
low. Testing this shelf here. This is
where bears will have to defend.

2774
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:26,480

 

2775
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,070

Big buyer coming in here. He might get

2776
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:28,080
Big buyer coming in here. He might get
 

2777
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,750
Big buyer coming in here. He might get
himself caught hit. He might well get

2778
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:29,760
himself caught hit. He might well get
 

2779
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,270
himself caught hit. He might well get
himself caught hit. He's coming in with

himself caught hit. He's coming in with
 

2781
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:37,830
himself caught hit. He's coming in with
size right into a key level.

2782
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:37,840

 

2783
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,830

Yeah, Rosco, I don't know like I don't

2784
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:39,840
Yeah, Rosco, I don't know like I don't
 

2785
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,350
Yeah, Rosco, I don't know like I don't
know if it was Ninja or or or uh I

2786
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:43,360
know if it was Ninja or or or uh I
 

2787
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,310
know if it was Ninja or or or uh I
thought it was my um volume footprint,

2788
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:46,320
thought it was my um volume footprint,
 

2789
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,630
thought it was my um volume footprint,
which is a third party, but seems that

2790
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:48,640
which is a third party, but seems that
 

2791
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,430
which is a third party, but seems that
this last reset has got it fixed. Okay,

2792
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:51,440
this last reset has got it fixed. Okay,
 

2793
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,189
this last reset has got it fixed. Okay,
so retesting this level I just talked

2794
01:12:53,189 --> 01:12:53,199
so retesting this level I just talked
 

2795
01:12:53,199 --> 01:13:03,189
so retesting this level I just talked
about.

2796
01:13:03,189 --> 01:13:03,199

 

2797
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:05,030

Lots of big buying coming in here. They

2798
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:05,040
Lots of big buying coming in here. They
 

2799
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,550
Lots of big buying coming in here. They
need to find acceptance through this

2800
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:06,560
need to find acceptance through this
 

2801
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,070
need to find acceptance through this
level otherwise they will get themselves

2802
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:08,080
level otherwise they will get themselves
 

2803
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,830
level otherwise they will get themselves
caught. I would imagine shorts will try

2804
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:09,840
caught. I would imagine shorts will try
 

2805
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,910
caught. I would imagine shorts will try
and defend this now. That's marking out

2806
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:11,920
and defend this now. That's marking out
 

2807
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,189
and defend this now. That's marking out
with the 20-day on ES as well.

2808
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:15,199
with the 20-day on ES as well.
 

2809
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:18,149
with the 20-day on ES as well.
SPY found a bid on its 20-day. What did

2810
01:13:18,149 --> 01:13:18,159
SPY found a bid on its 20-day. What did
 

2811
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:20,950
SPY found a bid on its 20-day. What did
we say to SPY? 75 probably. We're going

2812
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:20,960
we say to SPY? 75 probably. We're going
 

2813
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,709
we say to SPY? 75 probably. We're going
to trade back up to 78 now and see if

2814
01:13:22,709 --> 01:13:22,719
to trade back up to 78 now and see if
 

2815
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:25,590
to trade back up to 78 now and see if
they defend this. And if we get back

2816
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:25,600
they defend this. And if we get back
 

2817
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,189
they defend this. And if we get back
inside this, we're going to go back in

2818
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:27,199
inside this, we're going to go back in
 

2819
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:28,950
inside this, we're going to go back in
rotation. They need to defend this. The

2820
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:28,960
rotation. They need to defend this. The
 

2821
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,550
rotation. They need to defend this. The
bears, this is the level for them to

01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:30,560
bears, this is the level for them to
 

2823
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,030

control of it, they need to take control
 

2829
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,830
control of it, they need to take control
of it here. They want to look for lower

2830
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:37,840
of it here. They want to look for lower
 

2831
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,830
of it here. They want to look for lower
prices. This is the area they want to do

2832
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:39,840
prices. This is the area they want to do
 

2833
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,830
prices. This is the area they want to do
it from. Right? If they want to cause a

01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:43,920
lower high, they need to do it here. And
 

2837
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,149
lower high, they need to do it here. And
they will not want All right. If they

2838
01:13:46,149 --> 01:13:46,159
they will not want All right. If they
 

2839
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:47,590
they will not want All right. If they
want to cause a lower high, they will

2840
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:47,600
want to cause a lower high, they will
 

2841
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,750
want to cause a lower high, they will
not want bulls to defend this area. All

2842
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:49,760
not want bulls to defend this area. All
 

2843
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,950
not want bulls to defend this area. All
right? Otherwise, they'll be done with

2844
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:50,960
right? Otherwise, they'll be done with
 

2845
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:51,990
right? Otherwise, they'll be done with
it. And then we're going to go back

2846
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:52,000
it. And then we're going to go back
 

2847
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,310
it. And then we're going to go back
upside. Same if we do this. We're going

2848
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:54,320
upside. Same if we do this. We're going
 

2849
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,669
upside. Same if we do this. We're going
to come and rebalance this out, which

2850
01:13:55,669 --> 01:13:55,679
to come and rebalance this out, which
 

2851
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:07,669
to come and rebalance this out, which
will not be nice.

2852
01:14:07,669 --> 01:14:07,679

 

2853
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:09,590

Starting my nervous system starting to

2854
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:09,600
Starting my nervous system starting to
 

2855
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,590
Starting my nervous system starting to
calm down now. Can feel it starting to

2856
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:11,600
calm down now. Can feel it starting to
 

2857
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:18,070
calm down now. Can feel it starting to
come back down to a regulated level.

2858
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:18,080

 

2859
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,830

Okay, VW up and point of control here.

2860
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:19,840
Okay, VW up and point of control here.
 

2861
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,350
Okay, VW up and point of control here.
Like we talked about, this is the level.

2862
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:21,360
Like we talked about, this is the level.
 

2863
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,189
Like we talked about, this is the level.
This is your overunder for sentiment on

2864
01:14:23,189 --> 01:14:23,199
This is your overunder for sentiment on
 

2865
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:33,110
This is your overunder for sentiment on
the day I would say for now.

2866
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:33,120

 

2867
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,030

Right, this is the level right here.

2868
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:35,040
Right, this is the level right here.
 

2869
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,189
Right, this is the level right here.
They must defend this bears otherwise

2870
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:37,199
They must defend this bears otherwise
 

2871
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:38,390
They must defend this bears otherwise
we're going to go back into current

2872
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:38,400
we're going to go back into current
 

2873
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,830
we're going to go back into current
range and we're going to squeeze up to

2874
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:39,840
range and we're going to squeeze up to
 

2875
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,861
range and we're going to squeeze up to
320s and above.

2876
01:14:42,861 --> 01:14:42,871
320s and above.
 

2877
01:14:42,871 --> 01:14:45,590
320s and above.
[clears throat]

2878
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:45,600

 

2879
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,830

I was a bear, I'd be trying to make sure

2880
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:47,840
I was a bear, I'd be trying to make sure
 

2881
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,110
I was a bear, I'd be trying to make sure
that this is not going to find

2882
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:49,120
that this is not going to find
 

2883
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,189
that this is not going to find
acceptance back into side inside the

2884
01:14:51,189 --> 01:14:51,199
acceptance back into side inside the
 

2885
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:52,310
acceptance back into side inside the
range. And at the moment, they're not

2886
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:52,320
range. And at the moment, they're not
 

2887
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,510
range. And at the moment, they're not
doing too much of a good job about it.

2888
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:55,520
doing too much of a good job about it.
 

2889
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,430
doing too much of a good job about it.
And the mag's gone starting to go green

2890
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:57,440
And the mag's gone starting to go green
 

2891
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:01,270
And the mag's gone starting to go green
here, folks.

2892
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:01,280

 

2893
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,870

So, you can see this is the level.

2894
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:02,880
So, you can see this is the level.
 

2895
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:23,590
So, you can see this is the level.
That's why we've paused there.

2896
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:23,600

 

2897
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,550

Where are sellers offside? 273 and below

2898
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:26,560
Where are sellers offside? 273 and below
 

2899
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,510
Where are sellers offside? 273 and below
is where seven sellers are offside. 273

2900
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:29,520
is where seven sellers are offside. 273
 

2901
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,390
is where seven sellers are offside. 273
and below. 270s. They need to get back

2902
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:32,400
and below. 270s. They need to get back
 

2903
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,149
and below. 270s. They need to get back
underneath that. Basically, we have big

2904
01:15:34,149 --> 01:15:34,159
underneath that. Basically, we have big
 

2905
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:37,110
underneath that. Basically, we have big
offside delta there at 270s. If they

2906
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:37,120
offside delta there at 270s. If they
 

2907
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,270
offside delta there at 270s. If they
don't get back off underneath 270s,

2908
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:39,280
don't get back off underneath 270s,
 

2909
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,030
don't get back off underneath 270s,
they're going to get caught. So this is

2910
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:41,040
they're going to get caught. So this is
 

2911
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,390
they're going to get caught. So this is
the attempt to get back under it and

2912
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:42,400
the attempt to get back under it and
 

2913
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:46,310
the attempt to get back under it and
stay under it and they failed. Look. So

2914
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:46,320
stay under it and they failed. Look. So
 

2915
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,709
stay under it and they failed. Look. So
all these sellers into 270. We can see

2916
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:48,719
all these sellers into 270. We can see
 

2917
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:50,390
all these sellers into 270. We can see
them on bookmap. They are caught right

2918
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:50,400
them on bookmap. They are caught right
 

2919
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,990
them on bookmap. They are caught right
now. They need to get back underneath

2920
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:52,000
now. They need to get back underneath
 

2921
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,510
now. They need to get back underneath
that otherwise they're going to start to

2922
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:53,520
that otherwise they're going to start to
 

2923
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,470
that otherwise they're going to start to
get squeezed out.

2924
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:56,480
get squeezed out.
 

2925
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:01,270
get squeezed out.
So you can see the delta 273 272 271.

2926
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:01,280
So you can see the delta 273 272 271.
 

2927
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,390
So you can see the delta 273 272 271.
That's where they need to get back

2928
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:02,400
That's where they need to get back
 

2929
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,189
That's where they need to get back
under. You see every time into there so

2930
01:16:05,189 --> 01:16:05,199
under. You see every time into there so
 

2931
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:06,550
under. You see every time into there so
far there's been a passive buyer. They

2932
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:06,560
far there's been a passive buyer. They
 

2933
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,030
far there's been a passive buyer. They
need a snap just to make sure that they

2934
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:09,040
need a snap just to make sure that they
 

2935
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,790
need a snap just to make sure that they
stay safe as a seller. Otherwise, I

2936
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:10,800
stay safe as a seller. Otherwise, I
 

2937
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,149
stay safe as a seller. Otherwise, I
think they might get themselves caught.

2938
01:16:12,149 --> 01:16:12,159
think they might get themselves caught.
 

2939
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,470
think they might get themselves caught.
There's this decent amount around this

2940
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:14,480
There's this decent amount around this
 

2941
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,470
There's this decent amount around this
level here. They're desperately trying

2942
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:16,480
level here. They're desperately trying
 

2943
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:22,070
level here. They're desperately trying
to get a close underneath this now.

2944
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:22,080

 

2945
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,510

Here they go. Good. So, they've taken

2946
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:23,520
Here they go. Good. So, they've taken
 

2947
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,870
Here they go. Good. So, they've taken
control. This is the sellers now trying

2948
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:24,880
control. This is the sellers now trying
 

2949
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,390
control. This is the sellers now trying
to take control. Can they get a close

2950
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:26,400
to take control. Can they get a close
 

2951
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,910
to take control. Can they get a close
though? How long we got left? 10 seconds

2952
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:27,920
though? How long we got left? 10 seconds
 

2953
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,590
though? How long we got left? 10 seconds
left of this candle. This is uh around

2954
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:31,600
left of this candle. This is uh around
 

2955
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,310
left of this candle. This is uh around
value area low on the day. They will

2956
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:34,320
value area low on the day. They will
 

2957
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,070
value area low on the day. They will
want this to just make a new low. They

2958
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:36,080
want this to just make a new low. They
 

2959
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,910
want this to just make a new low. They
will not want bulls to defend. If bulls

2960
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:37,920
will not want bulls to defend. If bulls
 

2961
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,189
will not want bulls to defend. If bulls
defend this and they start reclaiming

2962
01:16:39,189 --> 01:16:39,199
defend this and they start reclaiming
 

2963
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:40,790
defend this and they start reclaiming
these 270s, these bears are going to get

2964
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:40,800
these 270s, these bears are going to get
 

2965
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,149
these 270s, these bears are going to get
very, very caught cuz they come in here

2966
01:16:42,149 --> 01:16:42,159
very, very caught cuz they come in here
 

2967
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:47,189
very, very caught cuz they come in here
very aggressively

2968
01:16:47,189 --> 01:16:47,199

 

2969
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:48,630

back to these 70s where they've got

2970
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:48,640
back to these 70s where they've got
 

2971
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:57,590
back to these 70s where they've got
offside delta again.

2972
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:57,600

 

2973
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,110

It's a lower time frame battle here.

2974
01:16:59,110 --> 01:16:59,120
It's a lower time frame battle here.
 

2975
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:03,189
It's a lower time frame battle here.
Bulls have the chance here.

2976
01:17:03,189 --> 01:17:03,199
Bulls have the chance here.
 

2977
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,510
Bulls have the chance here.
They got to get back above 73 and drive

2978
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:05,520
They got to get back above 73 and drive
 

2979
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,950
They got to get back above 73 and drive
out. So, if they do that and create a

2980
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:06,960
out. So, if they do that and create a
 

2981
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,310
out. So, if they do that and create a
new high, I think you might get a little

2982
01:17:08,310 --> 01:17:08,320
new high, I think you might get a little
 

2983
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,709
new high, I think you might get a little
short squeeze. If bears hold this, they

2984
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:10,719
short squeeze. If bears hold this, they
 

2985
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:12,390
short squeeze. If bears hold this, they
can rotate back to this low of day. So,

2986
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:12,400
can rotate back to this low of day. So,
 

2987
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,830
can rotate back to this low of day. So,
we just I'm not I've got no position

2988
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:13,840
we just I'm not I've got no position
 

2989
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,350
we just I'm not I've got no position
here. I'm just watching the tape. I can

2990
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:15,360
here. I'm just watching the tape. I can
 

2991
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,990
here. I'm just watching the tape. I can
see how big the delta is here. It's very

2992
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:18,000
see how big the delta is here. It's very
 

2993
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,270
see how big the delta is here. It's very
very offside into these 70s. We are

2994
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:21,280
very offside into these 70s. We are
 

2995
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,990
very offside into these 70s. We are
below that right now. So,

2996
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:24,000
below that right now. So,
 

2997
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,990
below that right now. So,
we will see. I think if we get back

2998
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:26,000
we will see. I think if we get back
 

2999
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,870
we will see. I think if we get back
above 73

3000
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:28,880
above 73
 

3001
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,510
above 73
and definitely above 93, there's a

3002
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:31,520
and definitely above 93, there's a
 

3003
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,149
and definitely above 93, there's a
squeeze. All the time we're below 273,

3004
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:34,159
squeeze. All the time we're below 273,
 

3005
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:36,438
squeeze. All the time we're below 273,
bears have control. Lower time frame.

3006
01:17:36,438 --> 01:17:36,448
bears have control. Lower time frame.
 

3007
01:17:36,448 --> 01:17:38,149
bears have control. Lower time frame.
[snorts]

3008
01:17:38,149 --> 01:17:38,159
[snorts]
 

3009
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:40,630
[snorts]
Yes, I rolled to March. Guys, everyone,

3010
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:40,640
Yes, I rolled to March. Guys, everyone,
 

3011
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,070
Yes, I rolled to March. Guys, everyone,
everyone asking questions, all you have

3012
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:42,080
everyone asking questions, all you have
 

3013
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,510
everyone asking questions, all you have
to do is look at the side of the chart.

3014
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:43,520
to do is look at the side of the chart.
 

3015
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,790
to do is look at the side of the chart.
Look at the numbers on the side of the

3016
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:44,800
Look at the numbers on the side of the
 

3017
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,990
Look at the numbers on the side of the
chart. That will show you that I've

3018
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:46,000
chart. That will show you that I've
 

3019
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:53,030
chart. That will show you that I've
rolled to March. Okay,

3020
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:53,040

 

3021
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,709

more volume on the March contract. Now,

3022
01:17:54,709 --> 01:17:54,719
more volume on the March contract. Now,
 

3023
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:56,070
more volume on the March contract. Now,
like I said yesterday, likely that I

3024
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:56,080
like I said yesterday, likely that I
 

3025
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:03,990
like I said yesterday, likely that I
roll over by Tuesday.

3026
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:04,000

 

3027
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,590

Oh my god, lots of new people here. I

3028
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:05,600
Oh my god, lots of new people here. I
 

3029
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,110
Oh my god, lots of new people here. I
think volume on the right is your New

3030
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:07,120
think volume on the right is your New
 

3031
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,630
think volume on the right is your New
York anchor. All right, this is volume

3032
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:08,640
York anchor. All right, this is volume
 

3033
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,310
York anchor. All right, this is volume
since 9:30. We're back over the 70.

3034
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:10,320
since 9:30. We're back over the 70.
 

3035
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,630
since 9:30. We're back over the 70.
Squeeze is on here, folks. Squeeze is on

3036
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:12,640
Squeeze is on here, folks. Squeeze is on
 

3037
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,550
Squeeze is on here, folks. Squeeze is on
here. They've got to get back over 93s

3038
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:14,560
here. They've got to get back over 93s
 

3039
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,510
here. They've got to get back over 93s
now. So, the transition is 73 to 93. If

3040
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:17,520
now. So, the transition is 73 to 93. If
 

3041
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,590
now. So, the transition is 73 to 93. If
bulls get over 93, this thing will

3042
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:19,600
bulls get over 93, this thing will
 

3043
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,790
bulls get over 93, this thing will
squeeze.

3044
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:22,800

 

3045
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,550

Feathering into this long just to see if

3046
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:24,560
Feathering into this long just to see if
 

3047
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,550
Feathering into this long just to see if
we give it a chance here. So, I'm going

3048
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:26,560
we give it a chance here. So, I'm going
 

3049
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,709
we give it a chance here. So, I'm going
to put my stop just under 73. If they

3050
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:28,719
to put my stop just under 73. If they
 

3051
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:30,630
to put my stop just under 73. If they
close back under that. Oh, look at that.

3052
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:30,640
close back under that. Oh, look at that.
 

3053
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,790
close back under that. Oh, look at that.
Am I going to get stopped out instantly?

3054
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:32,800
Am I going to get stopped out instantly?
 

3055
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,630
Am I going to get stopped out instantly?
Possibly. Balls just got caught into 81.

3056
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:36,640
Possibly. Balls just got caught into 81.
 

3057
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:39,189
Possibly. Balls just got caught into 81.
Okay, out of this. [\h__\h] me. That was

3058
01:18:39,189 --> 01:18:39,199
Okay, out of this. [\h__\h] me. That was
 

3059
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:43,590
Okay, out of this. [\h__\h] me. That was
quick.

3060
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:43,600

 

3061
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,524

They reclaim and go here.

3062
01:18:46,524 --> 01:18:46,534
They reclaim and go here.
 

3063
01:18:46,534 --> 01:18:51,110
They reclaim and go here.
[laughter]

3064
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:51,120

 

3065
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,030

H. All right. They're defending 73s.

3066
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:53,040
H. All right. They're defending 73s.
 

3067
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,229
H. All right. They're defending 73s.
Okay. I was going to say if they reclaim

3068
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:54,239
Okay. I was going to say if they reclaim
 

3069
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:55,910
Okay. I was going to say if they reclaim
and go there after a good stop, I'll be

3070
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:55,920
and go there after a good stop, I'll be
 

3071
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:00,870
and go there after a good stop, I'll be
very upset. Here

3072
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:00,880

 

3073
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,510

they come. So downside we come now.

3074
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:03,520
they come. So downside we come now.
 

3075
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,590
they come. So downside we come now.
Defended 73s on that retest. That's a

3076
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:05,600
Defended 73s on that retest. That's a
 

3077
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,669
Defended 73s on that retest. That's a
good move.

3078
01:19:07,669 --> 01:19:07,679
good move.
 

3079
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:10,470
good move.
Okay. Okay.

3080
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:10,480
Okay. Okay.
 

3081
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,110
Okay. Okay.
We've come to bears.

3082
01:19:13,110 --> 01:19:13,120
We've come to bears.
 

3083
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,790
We've come to bears.
They need a break and a new low here.

3084
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:14,800
They need a break and a new low here.
 

3085
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,189
They need a break and a new low here.
Bears.

3086
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:17,199
Bears.
 

3087
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:22,070
Bears.
What was that auction like at the low

3088
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:22,080

 

3089
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,859

88s?

3090
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:23,869
88s?
 

3091
01:19:23,869 --> 01:19:28,709
88s?
[snorts]

3092
01:19:28,709 --> 01:19:28,719

 

3093
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:33,990

And VIX doesn't know what it's doing.

3094
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:34,000

 

3095
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,590

VIX does not know what it's doing right

3096
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:35,600
VIX does not know what it's doing right
 

3097
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,750
VIX does not know what it's doing right
now.

3098
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:39,760

 

3099
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,910

So I say bears in total control all the

3100
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:41,920
So I say bears in total control all the
 

3101
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,030
So I say bears in total control all the
time. Price is under 270s.

3102
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:45,040
time. Price is under 270s.
 

3103
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,950
time. Price is under 270s.
Total control all the time price is

3104
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:46,960
Total control all the time price is
 

3105
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,870
Total control all the time price is
under 270s. Bears have taken control

3106
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:48,880
under 270s. Bears have taken control
 

3107
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,790
under 270s. Bears have taken control
there.

3108
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:50,800
there.
 

3109
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,510
there.
That's their pain point.

3110
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:53,520
That's their pain point.
 

3111
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,350
That's their pain point.
I had a little stab at that and

3112
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:55,360
I had a little stab at that and
 

3113
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:58,070
I had a little stab at that and
instantly cut it. Lost like 10 15 points

3114
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:58,080
instantly cut it. Lost like 10 15 points
 

3115
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:07,270
instantly cut it. Lost like 10 15 points
on that very quickly.

3116
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:07,280

 

3117
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,110

They should rotate here. They should

3118
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:09,120
They should rotate here. They should
 

3119
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,510
They should rotate here. They should
have the power to rotate here. Entry for

3120
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:11,520
have the power to rotate here. Entry for
 

3121
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,870
have the power to rotate here. Entry for
a long. No, for me,

3122
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:14,880
a long. No, for me,
 

3123
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,630
a long. No, for me,
not right now. It hasn't proved itself.

3124
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:16,640
not right now. It hasn't proved itself.
 

3125
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:20,310
not right now. It hasn't proved itself.
Right. We've just lost value. We've lost

3126
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:20,320
Right. We've just lost value. We've lost
 

3127
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,510
Right. We've just lost value. We've lost
this shelf. You haven't [snorts]

3128
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:21,520
this shelf. You haven't [snorts]
 

3129
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,590
this shelf. You haven't [snorts]
reclaimed any level for a long. Yeah, we

3130
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:23,600
reclaimed any level for a long. Yeah, we
 

3131
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,070
reclaimed any level for a long. Yeah, we
we know there's bid support here, but

3132
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:26,080
we know there's bid support here, but
 

3133
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,430
we know there's bid support here, but
they had the chance there and they

3134
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:27,440
they had the chance there and they
 

3135
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,270
they had the chance there and they
failed. Like for me, no longs right now

3136
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:29,280
failed. Like for me, no longs right now
 

3137
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,350
failed. Like for me, no longs right now
in this market. I I was willing to give

3138
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:31,360
in this market. I I was willing to give
 

3139
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,030
in this market. I I was willing to give
it a shot once they reclaimed the 70s

3140
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:33,040
it a shot once they reclaimed the 70s
 

3141
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,350
it a shot once they reclaimed the 70s
and I had the door shut on my face very

3142
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:35,360
and I had the door shut on my face very
 

3143
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,990
and I had the door shut on my face very
quickly. So, probably should have waited

3144
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:38,000
quickly. So, probably should have waited
 

3145
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,070
quickly. So, probably should have waited
for the candle to close. That's probably

3146
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:40,080
for the candle to close. That's probably
 

3147
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,430
for the candle to close. That's probably
my fault. Which probably says

3148
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:43,440
my fault. Which probably says
 

3149
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,350
my fault. Which probably says
still maybe not fully calm down my

3150
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:45,360
still maybe not fully calm down my
 

3151
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,590
still maybe not fully calm down my
nervous system after the ninja issues

3152
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:47,600
nervous system after the ninja issues
 

3153
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:51,910
nervous system after the ninja issues
this morning.

3154
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:51,920

 

3155
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,910

So, what would I say? Area is not too

3156
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:53,920
So, what would I say? Area is not too
 

3157
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,669
So, what would I say? Area is not too
bad into here for the longs, but

3158
01:20:55,669 --> 01:20:55,679
bad into here for the longs, but
 

3159
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:57,430
bad into here for the longs, but
location's terrible. Uh, location's

3160
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:57,440
location's terrible. Uh, location's
 

3161
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:01,189
location's terrible. Uh, location's
okay, but momentum's terrible.

3162
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:01,199
okay, but momentum's terrible.
 

3163
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:02,790
okay, but momentum's terrible.
Yeah, I jumped in there too soon. That

3164
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:02,800
Yeah, I jumped in there too soon. That
 

3165
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,390
Yeah, I jumped in there too soon. That
is an error for me. Not letting that

3166
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:04,400
is an error for me. Not letting that
 

3167
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:09,430
is an error for me. Not letting that
candle close.

3168
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:09,440

 

3169
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,350

Nice, Carla. Yeah, I think shorts taking

3170
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:11,360
Nice, Carla. Yeah, I think shorts taking
 

3171
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,510
Nice, Carla. Yeah, I think shorts taking
control there. Totally taking control

3172
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:13,520
control there. Totally taking control
 

3173
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:17,750
control there. Totally taking control
there now in this level. See this shelf

3174
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:17,760
there now in this level. See this shelf
 

3175
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,910
there now in this level. See this shelf
built built out. I should have just lent

3176
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:19,920
built built out. I should have just lent
 

3177
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,310
built built out. I should have just lent
on that. That's that's screaming to me

3178
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:22,320
on that. That's that's screaming to me
 

3179
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,669
on that. That's that's screaming to me
that um

3180
01:21:25,669 --> 01:21:25,679
that um
 

3181
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:28,310
that um
I'm like

3182
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:28,320
I'm like
 

3183
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,070
I'm like
maybe a bit tilted from what happened

3184
01:21:30,070 --> 01:21:30,080
maybe a bit tilted from what happened
 

3185
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,910
maybe a bit tilted from what happened
earlier. That's two days in a row.

3186
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:31,920
earlier. That's two days in a row.
 

3187
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,990
earlier. That's two days in a row.
That's probably

3188
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:34,000
That's probably
 

3189
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,510
That's probably
I have to really question whether I take

3190
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:35,520
I have to really question whether I take
 

3191
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:41,030
I have to really question whether I take
a trade now today.

3192
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:41,040

 

3193
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,390

To really question whether I take a

3194
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:42,400
To really question whether I take a
 

3195
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:49,270
To really question whether I take a
trade now today, I think

3196
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:49,280

 

3197
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:52,310

If I look at my journal, I know my

3198
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:52,320
If I look at my journal, I know my
 

3199
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,950
If I look at my journal, I know my
biggest tilt factor by my well two tilt

3200
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:54,960
biggest tilt factor by my well two tilt
 

3201
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,950
biggest tilt factor by my well two tilt
factors. Break too many break evens in a

3202
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:56,960
factors. Break too many break evens in a
 

3203
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,550
factors. Break too many break evens in a
row and tech.

3204
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:00,560
row and tech.
 

3205
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,709
row and tech.
Too many break evens in a row in tech.

3206
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:02,719
Too many break evens in a row in tech.
 

3207
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:04,870
Too many break evens in a row in tech.
Today I had tech. Yesterday I had tech.

3208
01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:04,880
Today I had tech. Yesterday I had tech.
 

3209
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:14,229
Today I had tech. Yesterday I had tech.
So be carrying a bit of that over.

3210
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:14,239

 

3211
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:15,590

What do you mean? We're testing previous

What do you mean? We're testing previous

What do you mean? We're testing previous

We're well below that, Albero.

3218
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:27,440

 

3219
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,510

Okay, this New York level is being used

3220
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:29,520
Okay, this New York level is being used
 

3221
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:36,070
Okay, this New York level is being used
as an overunder right now.

3222
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:36,080

 

3223
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,870

Bears failed to break down here. Bears

3224
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:38,880
Bears failed to break down here. Bears
 

3225
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,550
Bears failed to break down here. Bears

3227
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,750
must get a new low here. Bears fail to
make a new low here, they're going to

3228
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:41,760
make a new low here, they're going to
 

3229
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,149
make a new low here, they're going to
get very upset. They've done the hard

get very upset. They've done the hard
 

3231

3235
01:22:54,960 --> 01:23:06,550

Here they come.

3236
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:06,560

 

3237
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,629

Failed again.

3238
01:23:08,629 --> 01:23:08,639
Failed again.
 

3239
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:09,830
Failed again.
They're coming again. They're going to

3240
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:09,840
They're coming again. They're going to

low. These bears here.
 

3245
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:16,550
low. These bears here.
They will get very upset if they don't.

3246
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:16,560
They will get very upset if they don't.
 

3247
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,350
They will get very upset if they don't.
They've done the hard work at 270s.

3248
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:19,360
They've done the hard work at 270s.
 

3249
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:24,390
They've done the hard work at 270s.
They need a new low.

3251
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,030

If we break this uh well really you're

3252
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:27,040
If we break this uh well really you're
 

3253
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,870
If we break this uh well really you're
looking at low of day globeex low 2574

01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:30,880
looking at low of day globeex low 2574
 

3255
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:44,629
looking at low of day globeex low 2574
and then you're really looking at 800s

3256
01:23:44,629 --> 01:23:44,639

 

3257
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:47,350

and VIX is just rotating in range. It's

3258
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:47,360
and VIX is just rotating in range. It's
 

3259
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,669
and VIX is just rotating in range. It's
very ugly.

3260
01:23:49,669 --> 01:23:49,679
very ugly.
 

3261
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:51,270
very ugly.
No sustained breakout. It's literally

No sustained breakout. It's literally
 

3263
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,870
No sustained breakout. It's literally
sat in the middle of its range right now

01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:52,880
sat in the middle of its range right now
 

3265
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,688
sat in the middle of its range right now

3269
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,709

They're having another go for the

3270
01:24:10,709 --> 01:24:10,719
They're having another go for the
 

3271
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:12,070
They're having another go for the
breakdown here. The Bears, they're

3272
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:12,080
breakdown here. The Bears, they're
 

3273
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:15,030
breakdown here. The Bears, they're
flying in here. They're getting more and

3274
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:15,040
flying in here. They're getting more and
 

3275
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,310
flying in here. They're getting more and
more pissed off that they haven't done

3276
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:16,320
more pissed off that they haven't done
 

3277
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,910
more pissed off that they haven't done
it yet. They need that breakdown. They

3278
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:17,920
it yet. They need that breakdown. They
 

3279
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,590
it yet. They need that breakdown. They
need a new lower day. Otherwise, they

3280
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:19,600
need a new lower day. Otherwise, they
 

3281
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:23,910
need a new lower day. Otherwise, they
don't get their cover point.

3282
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:23,920

 

3283
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,590

Definitely a little bit of absorption

3284
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:25,600
Definitely a little bit of absorption
 

3285
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,270
Definitely a little bit of absorption
down here, but again, it's a bearish

3286
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:27,280
down here, but again, it's a bearish
 

3287
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:28,790
down here, but again, it's a bearish
momentum right now. They've taken

3288
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:28,800
momentum right now. They've taken
 

3289
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,189
momentum right now. They've taken
control from those 270s. They should get

3290
01:24:31,189 --> 01:24:31,199
control from those 270s. They should get
 

3291
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:35,430
control from those 270s. They should get
a new low of day here. The bears

3292
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:35,440

 

3293
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,270

failing to do that will be a problem for

3294
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:37,280
failing to do that will be a problem for
 

3295
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,590
failing to do that will be a problem for
them. Here they go. So, they're coming

3296
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:39,600
them. Here they go. So, they're coming
 

3297
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,510
them. Here they go. So, they're coming
for it now.

3298
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:41,520
for it now.
 

3299
01:24:41,520 --> 01:25:01,669
for it now.
Took long enough. They took long enough.

3300
01:25:01,669 --> 01:25:01,679

VIX is trying to find a bid. It's got to

VIX is trying to find a bid. It's got to

01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:08,629
VIX is trying to find a bid. It's got to
break out though and make a higher high

3308
01:25:08,629 --> 01:25:08,639
break out though and make a higher high
 

3309
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:11,910
break out though and make a higher high
here. The VIX I'm not convinced of this

3310
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:11,920
here. The VIX I'm not convinced of this
 

3311
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:19,110
here. The VIX I'm not convinced of this
chart over here right now.

3312
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:19,120

 

3313
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:23,750

That is uh what are we doing? What are

3314
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:23,760
That is uh what are we doing? What are
 

3315
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,590
That is uh what are we doing? What are
we doing? It needs to get going here and

3316
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:25,600
we doing? It needs to get going here and
 

3317
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:35,910
we doing? It needs to get going here and
break out.

3318
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:35,920

 

3319
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,070

Can see this edge down here keeps being

3320
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:38,080
Can see this edge down here keeps being
 

3321
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,149
Can see this edge down here keeps being
defended by high time frame buyers

3322
01:25:40,149 --> 01:25:40,159
defended by high time frame buyers
 

3323
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:49,110
defended by high time frame buyers
again.

3324
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:49,120

 

3325
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,950

They might come back up here. If they

3326
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:50,960
They might come back up here. If they
 

3327
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,550
They might come back up here. If they
don't get this cell versus this little

3328
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:52,560
don't get this cell versus this little
 

3329
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,950
don't get this cell versus this little
ledge, they might get caught again. And

3330
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:54,960
ledge, they might get caught again. And
 

3331
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:01,510
ledge, they might get caught again. And
that would be the uh failed break lower.

3332
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:01,520

 

3333
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,510

Oh my gosh. Bears have failed. They fail

3334
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:03,520
Oh my gosh. Bears have failed. They fail
 

3335
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,270
Oh my gosh. Bears have failed. They fail
the rotation. They need to defend this

3336
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:05,280
the rotation. They need to defend this
 

3337
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,030
the rotation. They need to defend this
uh blue line, this New York open.

3338
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:07,040
uh blue line, this New York open.
 

3339
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,149
uh blue line, this New York open.
Otherwise, we're going to come straight

3340
01:26:08,149 --> 01:26:08,159
Otherwise, we're going to come straight
 

3341
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:11,110
Otherwise, we're going to come straight
back to 260s.

3342
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:11,120
back to 260s.
 

3343
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,629
back to 260s.
They need to defend that New York open

3344
01:26:12,629 --> 01:26:12,639
They need to defend that New York open
 

3345
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:25,430
They need to defend that New York open
otherwise we're going 260s.

3346
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:25,440

 

3347
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,950

They're not doing a very good job here

3348
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:26,960
They're not doing a very good job here
 

3349
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,870
They're not doing a very good job here
into low vol node and we're probably

3350
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:28,880
into low vol node and we're probably
 

3351
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:34,310
into low vol node and we're probably
going to go to 60s now.

3352
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:34,320

 

3353
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,229

There is a little note here. 40s. And

3354
01:26:36,229 --> 01:26:36,239
There is a little note here. 40s. And
 

3355
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,070
There is a little note here. 40s. And
then let's just make sure this is lined

3356
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:38,080
then let's just make sure this is lined
 

3357
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,149
then let's just make sure this is lined
up properly. They need to defend this

3358
01:26:40,149 --> 01:26:40,159
up properly. They need to defend this
 

3359
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:42,550
up properly. They need to defend this
here, this blue level here. If they

3360
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:42,560
here, this blue level here. If they
 

3361
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,830
here, this blue level here. If they
don't defend this, we're going to drift

3362
01:26:43,830 --> 01:26:43,840
don't defend this, we're going to drift
 

3363
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,430
don't defend this, we're going to drift
high. If they defend this, then we can

3364
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:45,440
high. If they defend this, then we can
 

3365
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,590
high. If they defend this, then we can
go, they can slap this back down. But

3366
01:26:47,590 --> 01:26:47,600
go, they can slap this back down. But
 

3367
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:48,709
go, they can slap this back down. But
they've got to come in, and they got to

3368
01:26:48,709 --> 01:26:48,719
they've got to come in, and they got to
 

3369
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:51,110
they've got to come in, and they got to
come in soon because a few of them came

3370
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:51,120
come in soon because a few of them came
 

3371
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,830
come in soon because a few of them came
back in at 197 and got caught. So, if

3372
01:26:53,830 --> 01:26:53,840
back in at 197 and got caught. So, if
 

3373
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,709
back in at 197 and got caught. So, if
they lift this, we're going to go 60s.

3374
01:26:56,709 --> 01:26:56,719
they lift this, we're going to go 60s.
 

3375
01:26:56,719 --> 01:26:58,390
they lift this, we're going to go 60s.
And VIX has failed again. This is the

3376
01:26:58,390 --> 01:26:58,400
And VIX has failed again. This is the
 

3377
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,229
And VIX has failed again. This is the
one worry I would say for these bears.

3378
01:27:00,229 --> 01:27:00,239
one worry I would say for these bears.
 

3379
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:01,990
one worry I would say for these bears.
The VIX has just pushed and failed

3380
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:02,000
The VIX has just pushed and failed
 

3381
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,149
The VIX has just pushed and failed
again.

3382
01:27:04,149 --> 01:27:04,159
again.
 

3383
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:09,030
again.
Here we go. So, back up to the 60s then.

3384
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:09,040

 

3385
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,350

And if we get back inside 60s, they're

3386
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:11,360
And if we get back inside 60s, they're
 

3387
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,950
And if we get back inside 60s, they're
going to get really upset. And if we get

3388
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:12,960
going to get really upset. And if we get
 

3389
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,430
going to get really upset. And if we get
back above the 70s, the all the bears

3390
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:15,440
back above the 70s, the all the bears
 

3391
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,030
back above the 70s, the all the bears
are stuck up there, right? We talked

3392
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:17,040
are stuck up there, right? We talked
 

3393
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,950
are stuck up there, right? We talked
about that. 70s is their level. This is

3394
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:18,960
about that. 70s is their level. This is
 

3395
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:20,629
about that. 70s is their level. This is
where they came flying in. Remember,

3396
01:27:20,629 --> 01:27:20,639
where they came flying in. Remember,
 

3397
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:22,229
where they came flying in. Remember,
this is where I lost that trade. I was

3398
01:27:22,229 --> 01:27:22,239
this is where I lost that trade. I was
 

3399
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:23,910
this is where I lost that trade. I was
looking long here without waiting for

3400
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:23,920
looking long here without waiting for
 

3401
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:26,070
looking long here without waiting for
confirmation and instantly got slapped.

3402
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:26,080
confirmation and instantly got slapped.
 

3403
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,830
confirmation and instantly got slapped.
Right? So, we're revisiting this shelf

3404
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:27,840
Right? So, we're revisiting this shelf
 

3405
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,830
Right? So, we're revisiting this shelf
now. And if we get back above that, that

3406
01:27:29,830 --> 01:27:29,840
now. And if we get back above that, that
 

3407
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,590
now. And if we get back above that, that
would be a failure to make a new low.

3408
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:31,600
would be a failure to make a new low.
 

3409
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,310
would be a failure to make a new low.
And this will be the trigger long

3410
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:34,320
And this will be the trigger long
 

3411
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,870
And this will be the trigger long
back inside of a range rotation, believe

3412
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:36,880
back inside of a range rotation, believe
 

3413
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,750
back inside of a range rotation, believe
it or not,

3414
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:39,760
it or not,
 

3415
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:43,830
it or not,
in an inside day.

3416
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:43,840

 

3417
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,669

70s are going to be visited here. We

3418
01:27:45,669 --> 01:27:45,679
70s are going to be visited here. We
 

3419
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:48,470
70s are going to be visited here. We
know bears absolutely hammer 70s. If

3420
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:48,480
know bears absolutely hammer 70s. If
 

3421
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,229
know bears absolutely hammer 70s. If
they get stopped out at 70s, this thing

3422
01:27:50,229 --> 01:27:50,239
they get stopped out at 70s, this thing
 

3423
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:53,430
they get stopped out at 70s, this thing
flies. Here we go. Here's 70s.

3424
01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:53,440
flies. Here we go. Here's 70s.
 

3425
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,189
flies. Here we go. Here's 70s.
If they get stopped out here, this thing

3426
01:27:55,189 --> 01:27:55,199
If they get stopped out here, this thing
 

3427
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:57,910
If they get stopped out here, this thing
flies. So, this is a huge level for them

3428
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:57,920
flies. So, this is a huge level for them
 

3429
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:01,910
flies. So, this is a huge level for them
now. and 93s will be their pain point.

3430
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:01,920
now. and 93s will be their pain point.
 

3431
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,310
now. and 93s will be their pain point.
All right. So 70s to 93s is that old

3432
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:04,320
All right. So 70s to 93s is that old
 

3433
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:07,210
All right. So 70s to 93s is that old
rotation

3434
01:28:07,210 --> 01:28:07,220
rotation
 

3435
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:23,590
rotation
[clears throat]

3436
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:23,600

 

3437
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,470

same levels. What I would say now though

3438
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:26,480
same levels. What I would say now though
 

3439
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:30,470
same levels. What I would say now though
is bears failed to make a new low.

3440
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:30,480
is bears failed to make a new low.
 

3441
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,870
is bears failed to make a new low.
So, it's possible we come up into 316s.

3442
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:32,880
So, it's possible we come up into 316s.
 

3443
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:36,070
So, it's possible we come up into 316s.
Once we get over 70 and pop 90s, it's

3444
01:28:36,070 --> 01:28:36,080
Once we get over 70 and pop 90s, it's
 

3445
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:44,709
Once we get over 70 and pop 90s, it's
possible we come up into this shelf.

3446
01:28:44,709 --> 01:28:44,719

 

3447
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:47,270

So, it's back and forth today. Why is it

3448
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:47,280
So, it's back and forth today. Why is it
 

3449
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,430
So, it's back and forth today. Why is it
back and forth, folks?

3450
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:49,440
back and forth, folks?
 

3451
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,350
back and forth, folks?
Is it because it's Jack's big trend day

3452
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:51,360
Is it because it's Jack's big trend day
 

3453
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,709
Is it because it's Jack's big trend day
lower, or is it because we're in an

3454
01:28:52,709 --> 01:28:52,719
lower, or is it because we're in an
 

3455
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:55,270
lower, or is it because we're in an
inside bar and maybe rotating? Just

3456
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:55,280
inside bar and maybe rotating? Just
 

3457
01:28:55,280 --> 01:29:01,189
inside bar and maybe rotating? Just
wondering.

3458
01:29:01,189 --> 01:29:01,199

 

3459
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:04,629

Are we underneath initial balance?

3460
01:29:04,629 --> 01:29:04,639
Are we underneath initial balance?
 

3461
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:11,270
Are we underneath initial balance?
Not yet.

3462
01:29:11,270 --> 01:29:11,280

 

3463
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,590

Nice, Carla.

3464
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:13,600
Nice, Carla.
 

3465
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,110
Nice, Carla.
All right, here we go. So 90 is being

3466
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:15,120
All right, here we go. So 90 is being
 

3467
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,629
All right, here we go. So 90 is being
popped. So we might go straight up to

3468
01:29:16,629 --> 01:29:16,639
popped. So we might go straight up to
 

3469
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:19,350
popped. So we might go straight up to
sort of the 310s

3470
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:19,360
sort of the 310s
 

3471
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:22,709
sort of the 310s
320s now. So

3472
01:29:22,709 --> 01:29:22,719
320s now. So
 

3473
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:27,590
320s now. So
try to help out here.

3474
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:27,600

 

3475
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,030

Hopefully you can see it when I'm

3476
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:29,040
Hopefully you can see it when I'm
 

3477
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,950
Hopefully you can see it when I'm
calling it and it makes sense to you

3478
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:30,960
calling it and it makes sense to you
 

3479
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,390
calling it and it makes sense to you
guys. Over the 90s is a squeeze back out

3480
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:34,400
guys. Over the 90s is a squeeze back out
 

3481
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,229
guys. Over the 90s is a squeeze back out
to this next red block. All right. So,

3482
01:29:36,229 --> 01:29:36,239
to this next red block. All right. So,
 

3483
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:37,910
to this next red block. All right. So,
if it if it can get over the 90s,

3484
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:37,920
if it if it can get over the 90s,
 

3485
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,430
if it if it can get over the 90s,
there's a squeeze out to that next red

3486
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:39,440
there's a squeeze out to that next red
 

3487
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:49,110
there's a squeeze out to that next red
block.

3488
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:49,120

 

3489
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,110

I'm going to get a refill on coffee.

3490
01:29:51,110 --> 01:29:51,120
I'm going to get a refill on coffee.
 

3491
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:53,322
I'm going to get a refill on coffee.
Come right back.

3492
01:29:53,322 --> 01:29:53,332
Come right back.
 

3493
01:29:53,332 --> 01:29:56,597
Come right back.

Yeah, it's it's trying to go, folks.
 

3501
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:30,149
Yeah, it's it's trying to go, folks.
This thing's trying to go.

3502
01:31:30,149 --> 01:31:30,159

 

3503
01:31:30,159 --> 01:31:31,830

Yeah, hopefully it helped you. I mean,

3504
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:31,840
Yeah, hopefully it helped you. I mean,

Yeah, hopefully it helped you. I mean,
guys, these are these are days like

3506
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:33,840
guys, these are these are days like
 

3507
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,070
guys, these are these are days like
these are days where you have to be

3508
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:36,080
these are days where you have to be
 

3509
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,990
these are days where you have to be
playing the edges. Like if we just zoom

3510
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:38,000
playing the edges. Like if we just zoom
 

3511
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:43,110
playing the edges. Like if we just zoom
out,

3512
01:31:43,110 --> 01:31:43,120

 

3513
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:44,870

we're likely to try and rotate back

3514
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:44,880
we're likely to try and rotate back
 

3515
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,990
we're likely to try and rotate back
inside of this. All right. So, if we

3516
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:48,000
inside of this. All right. So, if we
 

3517
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,149
inside of this. All right. So, if we
can't find expansion lower, remember

3518
01:31:50,149 --> 01:31:50,159
can't find expansion lower, remember
 

3519
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:52,310
can't find expansion lower, remember
here, right, was the naked point of

3520
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:52,320
here, right, was the naked point of
 

3521
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:56,070
here, right, was the naked point of
control. Here is like

3522
01:31:56,070 --> 01:31:56,080
control. Here is like
 

3523
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,790
control. Here is like
into discount,

3524
01:31:58,790 --> 01:31:58,800
into discount,
 

3525
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,110
into discount,
right? Trying to short down here is not

3526
01:32:01,110 --> 01:32:01,120
right? Trying to short down here is not
 

3527
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:03,110
right? Trying to short down here is not
ideal. Not without structure. Your short

3528
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:03,120
ideal. Not without structure. Your short
 

3529
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,430
ideal. Not without structure. Your short
this morning came from previous day

3530
01:32:05,430 --> 01:32:05,440
this morning came from previous day
 

3531
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:09,510
this morning came from previous day
value area high, right? So

3532
01:32:09,510 --> 01:32:09,520
value area high, right? So
 

3533
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:10,950
value area high, right? So
or value area high, previous day point

3534
01:32:10,950 --> 01:32:10,960
or value area high, previous day point
 

3535
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,950
or value area high, previous day point
of control. The short, the first short

3536
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:12,960
of control. The short, the first short
 

3537
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,830
of control. The short, the first short
was a snapshot here, right? Then they

3538
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:15,840
was a snapshot here, right? Then they
 

3539
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,189
was a snapshot here, right? Then they
held this. Okay, this is telling you

3540
01:32:17,189 --> 01:32:17,199
held this. Okay, this is telling you
 

3541
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:18,470
held this. Okay, this is telling you
bulls are going to defend this level

3542
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:18,480
bulls are going to defend this level
 

3543
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,149
bulls are going to defend this level
which we had already identified

3544
01:32:20,149 --> 01:32:20,159
which we had already identified
 

3545
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:22,629
which we had already identified
overnight. We came back in one, two,

3546
01:32:22,629 --> 01:32:22,639
overnight. We came back in one, two,
 

3547
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:24,870
overnight. We came back in one, two,
three. Can't get over previous day point

3548
01:32:24,870 --> 01:32:24,880
three. Can't get over previous day point
 

3549
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:27,430
three. Can't get over previous day point
control failure. All right, maybe here

3550
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:27,440
control failure. All right, maybe here
 

3551
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,110
control failure. All right, maybe here
is a nice short. Maybe here is a nice

3552
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:29,120
is a nice short. Maybe here is a nice
 

3553
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,430
is a nice short. Maybe here is a nice
short. But it's down into a rotation,

3554
01:32:31,430 --> 01:32:31,440
short. But it's down into a rotation,
 

3555
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,430
short. But it's down into a rotation,
right? That's all it is. And back inside

3556
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:33,440
right? That's all it is. And back inside
 

3557
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,270
right? That's all it is. And back inside
we go.

3558
01:32:35,270 --> 01:32:35,280
we go.
 

3559
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:41,830
we go.
So, you got to be somewhat careful. Um,

3560
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:41,840

 

3561
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:47,350

and if we look at

3562
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:47,360

 

3563
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,110

the shelf which we're protecting today

3564
01:32:49,110 --> 01:32:49,120
the shelf which we're protecting today
 

3565
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,470
the shelf which we're protecting today
where we're trying to get back inside

3566
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:50,480
where we're trying to get back inside
 

3567
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,470
where we're trying to get back inside
previous day's range, the shelf we're

3568
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:52,480
previous day's range, the shelf we're
 

3569
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,709
previous day's range, the shelf we're
protecting is 25,000.

3570
01:32:54,709 --> 01:32:54,719
protecting is 25,000.
 

3571
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:56,390
protecting is 25,000.
If you go to the daily, there's a shelf

3572
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:56,400
If you go to the daily, there's a shelf
 

3573
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,310
If you go to the daily, there's a shelf
25,243

3574
01:32:58,310 --> 01:32:58,320
25,243
 

3575
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,070
25,243
on the adjusted chart. We're trying to

3576
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:00,080
on the adjusted chart. We're trying to
 

3577
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,830
on the adjusted chart. We're trying to
get back into yesterday's range until we

3578
01:33:01,830 --> 01:33:01,840
get back into yesterday's range until we
 

3579
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:05,270
get back into yesterday's range until we
reject yesterday 280s. All right. Then

3580
01:33:05,270 --> 01:33:05,280
reject yesterday 280s. All right. Then
 

3581
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,990
reject yesterday 280s. All right. Then
we can see expansion again lower, which

3582
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:08,000
we can see expansion again lower, which
 

3583
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,910
we can see expansion again lower, which
they're trying to do now, which is the

3584
01:33:09,910 --> 01:33:09,920
they're trying to do now, which is the
 

3585
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,229
they're trying to do now, which is the
280 level. So that that's the battle of

3586
01:33:12,229 --> 01:33:12,239
280 level. So that that's the battle of
 

3587
01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:13,830
280 level. So that that's the battle of
like, are we going rotation? Are we

3588
01:33:13,830 --> 01:33:13,840
like, are we going rotation? Are we
 

3589
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,430
like, are we going rotation? Are we
going lower? Are we going rotation? Are

3590
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:15,440
going lower? Are we going rotation? Are
 

3591
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,590
going lower? Are we going rotation? Are
we going lower? But you don't want to be

3592
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:17,600
we going lower? But you don't want to be
 

3593
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,669
we going lower? But you don't want to be
like too biased in one direction right

3594
01:33:19,669 --> 01:33:19,679
like too biased in one direction right
 

3595
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:21,270
like too biased in one direction right
now. We had a big sell day yesterday. We

3596
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:21,280
now. We had a big sell day yesterday. We
 

3597
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,149
now. We had a big sell day yesterday. We
had a big sell day overnight.

3598
01:33:24,149 --> 01:33:24,159
had a big sell day overnight.
 

3599
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:25,669
had a big sell day overnight.
If they're going to sell, they need to

3600
01:33:25,669 --> 01:33:25,679
If they're going to sell, they need to
 

3601
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:27,270
If they're going to sell, they need to
sell from here. And they need to see

3602
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:27,280
sell from here. And they need to see
 

3603
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,430
sell from here. And they need to see
follow through under here. And right now

3604
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:29,440
follow through under here. And right now
 

3605
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:32,629
follow through under here. And right now
we don't have it. So intraday

3606
01:33:32,629 --> 01:33:32,639
we don't have it. So intraday
 

3607
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:34,709
we don't have it. So intraday
we're still in this. Right? Think about

3608
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:34,719
we're still in this. Right? Think about
 

3609
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:36,629
we're still in this. Right? Think about
your opening 15 minutes. Look above

3610
01:33:36,629 --> 01:33:36,639
your opening 15 minutes. Look above
 

3611
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:38,470
your opening 15 minutes. Look above
fail, look below fail. That's your

3612
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:38,480
fail, look below fail. That's your
 

3613
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,709
fail, look below fail. That's your
rotation for the day. Right? If we get

3614
01:33:40,709 --> 01:33:40,719
rotation for the day. Right? If we get
 

3615
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:42,390
rotation for the day. Right? If we get
back inside here, we're back inside

3616
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:42,400
back inside here, we're back inside
 

3617
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,149
back inside here, we're back inside
previous day's low. If we get back

3618
01:33:44,149 --> 01:33:44,159
previous day's low. If we get back
 

3619
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:46,470
previous day's low. If we get back
inside here, we're back inside previous

3620
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:46,480
inside here, we're back inside previous
 

3621
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,790
inside here, we're back inside previous
day's value. You want to be very careful

3622
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:48,800
day's value. You want to be very careful
 

3623
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:51,669
day's value. You want to be very careful
being too biased one side. We can be

3624
01:33:51,669 --> 01:33:51,679
being too biased one side. We can be
 

3625
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:53,430
being too biased one side. We can be
biased once it really starts to break

3626
01:33:53,430 --> 01:33:53,440
biased once it really starts to break
 

3627

Alex's moved down happening in Asia.
 

3649
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,950
Alex's moved down happening in Asia.
Right, we already hit the target right

3650
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:20,960
Right, we already hit the target right
 

3651
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:23,510
Right, we already hit the target right
here. Right, these guys know what

01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:24,960
they're looking for. Mo correctly
 

3655
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,030
they're looking for. Mo correctly
identifying it. We hit this target,

3656
01:34:27,030 --> 01:34:27,040
identifying it. We hit this target,
 

3657
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,510
identifying it. We hit this target,
right? And I showed them last night.

3658
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:29,520
right? And I showed them last night.
 

3659
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,030
right? And I showed them last night.
We're trading into discount now. So, you

3660
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:31,040
We're trading into discount now. So, you
 

3661
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:34,470
We're trading into discount now. So, you
want to be careful and you just follow

want to be careful and you just follow
 

3663
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,910
want to be careful and you just follow
follow the process and let them build

3664
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:35,920
follow the process and let them build
 

3665
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,990
follow the process and let them build
out liquidity. Remember, like once we

3666
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:38,000
out liquidity. Remember, like once we
 

3667
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,950
out liquidity. Remember, like once we
once we liquidate a big level, all

3668
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:40,960
once we liquidate a big level, all
 

3669
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,790
once we liquidate a big level, all
right? Unless you get a cascade effect,

3670
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:42,800
right? Unless you get a cascade effect,
 

3671
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,470
right? Unless you get a cascade effect,
they're going to build more volume out

3672
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:44,480
they're going to build more volume out
 

3673
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,310
they're going to build more volume out
to then go for the next level and go for

3674
01:34:46,310 --> 01:34:46,320
to then go for the next level and go for
 

3675
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,750
to then go for the next level and go for
the next level and go for the next

3676
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:47,760
the next level and go for the next
 

3677
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,350
the next level and go for the next
level. They have to build volume out

3678
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:49,360
level. They have to build volume out
 

3679
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,750
level. They have to build volume out
each time. We don't just move straight.

3680
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:51,760
each time. We don't just move straight.
 

3681
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,310
each time. We don't just move straight.
So, even if we want to think about

3682
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:54,320
So, even if we want to think about
 

3683
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,470
So, even if we want to think about
Right?

3684
01:34:56,470 --> 01:34:56,480
Right?
 

3685
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:57,990
Right?
We've basically done this for a few

3686
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:58,000
We've basically done this for a few
 

3687
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,990
We've basically done this for a few
weeks. We've leaving this volume Friday

3688
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:00,000
weeks. We've leaving this volume Friday
 

3689
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,910
weeks. We've leaving this volume Friday
last week. We left the volume. We back

3690
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:01,920
last week. We left the volume. We back
 

3691
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,830
last week. We left the volume. We back
tested yesterday. We've crashed down

3692
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:03,840
tested yesterday. We've crashed down
 

3693
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,750
tested yesterday. We've crashed down
into a big level. We're coming back

3694
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:05,760
into a big level. We're coming back
 

3695
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:09,189
into a big level. We're coming back
here. The chances of just like doing

3696
01:35:09,189 --> 01:35:09,199
here. The chances of just like doing
 

3697
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:12,470
here. The chances of just like doing
this are slim because these legs here

3698
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:12,480
this are slim because these legs here
 

3699
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,470
this are slim because these legs here
are what builds out volume. So, if we're

3700
01:35:14,470 --> 01:35:14,480
are what builds out volume. So, if we're
 

3701
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,990
are what builds out volume. So, if we're
going to move lower, we're going to need

3702
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:16,000
going to move lower, we're going to need
 

3703
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,950
going to move lower, we're going to need
buyers in here. And if too many shorts

3704
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:18,960
buyers in here. And if too many shorts
 

3705
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,629
buyers in here. And if too many shorts
get caught at the lows, then we're going

3706
01:35:20,629 --> 01:35:20,639
get caught at the lows, then we're going
 

3707
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:22,629
get caught at the lows, then we're going
to back test higher up. That's the kind

3708
01:35:22,629 --> 01:35:22,639
to back test higher up. That's the kind
 

3709
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:25,430
to back test higher up. That's the kind
of day we're in today.

3710
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:25,440
of day we're in today.
 

3711
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:28,310
of day we're in today.
Right?

3712
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:28,320
Right?
 

3713
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,550
Right?
Those of you who are orb traders, like

3714
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:30,560
Those of you who are orb traders, like
 

3715
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,149
Those of you who are orb traders, like
you're not even outside your orb. You're

3716
01:35:32,149 --> 01:35:32,159
you're not even outside your orb. You're
 

3717
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,590
you're not even outside your orb. You're
not outside your initial balance. You're

3718
01:35:33,590 --> 01:35:33,600
not outside your initial balance. You're
 

3719
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,430
not outside your initial balance. You're
not outside current day's value. We are

3720
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:35,440
not outside current day's value. We are
 

3721
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,310
not outside current day's value. We are
outside previous day's value.

3722
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:38,320
outside previous day's value.
 

3723
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,310
outside previous day's value.
So potentially drift back up and defend,

3724
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:40,320
So potentially drift back up and defend,
 

3725
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:43,430
So potentially drift back up and defend,
but I'd be very careful because we've

3726
01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:43,440
but I'd be very careful because we've
 

3727
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:46,070
but I'd be very careful because we've
had one, two, three, four attempts to

3728
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:46,080
had one, two, three, four attempts to
 

3729
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:47,990
had one, two, three, four attempts to
break in underneath this box. Remember,

3730
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:48,000
break in underneath this box. Remember,
 

3731
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,390
break in underneath this box. Remember,
this box was identified

3732
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:50,400
this box was identified
 

3733
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,189
this box was identified
from GlobeEx, right? This was this is

3734
01:35:53,189 --> 01:35:53,199
from GlobeEx, right? This was this is
 

3735
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:55,350
from GlobeEx, right? This was this is
your naked point of control. This is a

your naked point of control. This is a
 

3737
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:58,629
your naked point of control. This is a

huge weekly level.
 

3739
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:01,189
huge weekly level.
Got a weekly weekly level that we

3740
01:36:01,189 --> 01:36:01,199
Got a weekly weekly level that we
 

3741
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:02,950
Got a weekly weekly level that we
drifted under and then reclaimed. This

3742
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:02,960
drifted under and then reclaimed. This
 

3743
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,470
drifted under and then reclaimed. This
red line is the point of control. We

3744
01:36:04,470 --> 01:36:04,480
red line is the point of control. We
 

3745
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:08,229
red line is the point of control. We
reclaimed it.

3746
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:08,239

 

3747
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:09,590

I can't draw it on the chart because

3748
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:09,600
I can't draw it on the chart because
 

3749
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,350
I can't draw it on the chart because
we're on the new contract. So, I can't

3750
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:11,360
we're on the new contract. So, I can't
 

3751
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:13,430
we're on the new contract. So, I can't
show you where it came from because the

3752
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:13,440
show you where it came from because the
 

3753
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:14,870
show you where it came from because the
uh candles don't exist on the new

3754
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:14,880
uh candles don't exist on the new
 

3755
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,149
uh candles don't exist on the new
contract. But if you look at the old

3756
01:36:16,149 --> 01:36:16,159
contract. But if you look at the old
 

3757
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:18,470
contract. But if you look at the old
contract, if you look at 930s on the old

01:36:32,229 --> 01:36:32,239
beginner to advanced course, it's a
 

3773
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:35,270
beginner to advanced course, it's a
onetime fee. Um, it's just for members.

3774
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:35,280
onetime fee. Um, it's just for members.
 

3775
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:36,870
onetime fee. Um, it's just for members.
It's talk about this all the time, but

3776
01:36:36,870 --> 01:36:36,880
It's talk about this all the time, but
 

3777
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,229
It's talk about this all the time, but
it's just so we all trade the same

3778
01:36:38,229 --> 01:36:38,239
it's just so we all trade the same
 

3779
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:39,830
it's just so we all trade the same
direction. All right. So, you're

3780
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:39,840
direction. All right. So, you're
 

3781
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,510
direction. All right. So, you're
starting to try and break up to here at

3782
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:41,520
starting to try and break up to here at
 

3783
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:42,629
starting to try and break up to here at
the moment. So, there's a low volume

3784
01:36:42,629 --> 01:36:42,639
the moment. So, there's a low volume
 

3785
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:44,667
the moment. So, there's a low volume
node here that that uh bears

3786
01:36:44,667 --> 01:36:44,677
node here that that uh bears
 

3787
01:36:44,677 --> 01:36:45,750
node here that that uh bears
[clears throat] want to defend. Failing

3788
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:45,760
[clears throat] want to defend. Failing
 

3789
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,510
[clears throat] want to defend. Failing
to defend this will cause a resqueeze

3790
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:47,520
to defend this will cause a resqueeze
 

3791
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,430
to defend this will cause a resqueeze
higher. This can be a buildout. There is

3792
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:49,440
higher. This can be a buildout. There is
 

3793
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,030
higher. This can be a buildout. There is
no doubt about it. Right. This can be a

3794
01:36:51,030 --> 01:36:51,040
no doubt about it. Right. This can be a
 

3795
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,430
no doubt about it. Right. This can be a
buildout of liquidity to break lower,

3796
01:36:53,430 --> 01:36:53,440
buildout of liquidity to break lower,
 

3797
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:56,149
buildout of liquidity to break lower,
but it can also find acceptance up here,

3798
01:36:56,149 --> 01:36:56,159
but it can also find acceptance up here,
 

3799
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:58,070
but it can also find acceptance up here,
right? It can do both because we're

3800
01:36:58,070 --> 01:36:58,080
right? It can do both because we're
 

3801
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:00,470
right? It can do both because we're
inside value.

3802
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:00,480
inside value.
 

3803
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,390
inside value.
It is a range rotational day.

3804
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:02,400
It is a range rotational day.
 

3805
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,470
It is a range rotational day.
Unfortunately, that is what we are being

3806
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:04,480
Unfortunately, that is what we are being
 

3807
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,310
Unfortunately, that is what we are being
dealt with today. So, edges are what's

3808
01:37:06,310 --> 01:37:06,320
dealt with today. So, edges are what's
 

3809
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,830
dealt with today. So, edges are what's
paying today. Where are the best trade

3810
01:37:07,830 --> 01:37:07,840
paying today. Where are the best trade
 

3811
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,990
paying today. Where are the best trade
locations today that have happened? The

3812
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:10,000
locations today that have happened? The
 

3813
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,229
locations today that have happened? The
failures up here and the failures down

3814
01:37:12,229 --> 01:37:12,239
failures up here and the failures down
 

3815
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:14,229
failures up here and the failures down
here. All right, we're going to go edge

3816
01:37:14,229 --> 01:37:14,239
here. All right, we're going to go edge
 

3817
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:16,070
here. All right, we're going to go edge
to edge and everyone in between is

3818
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:16,080
to edge and everyone in between is
 

3819
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,109
to edge and everyone in between is
probably going to get hurt. So, this is

3820
01:37:17,109 --> 01:37:17,119
probably going to get hurt. So, this is
 

3821
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:18,870
probably going to get hurt. So, this is
the red box test. So if you're long,

3822
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:18,880
the red box test. So if you're long,
 

3823
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,709
the red box test. So if you're long,
this is your next TP. And now you can

3824
01:37:20,709 --> 01:37:20,719
this is your next TP. And now you can
 

3825
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:22,229
this is your next TP. And now you can
look for previous day value. And if we

3826
01:37:22,229 --> 01:37:22,239
look for previous day value. And if we
 

3827
01:37:22,239 --> 01:37:23,830
look for previous day value. And if we
get back inside previous day value,

3828
01:37:23,830 --> 01:37:23,840
get back inside previous day value,
 

3829
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,990
get back inside previous day value,
guess what? We're rotating previous days

3830
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:26,000
guess what? We're rotating previous days
 

3831
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,830
guess what? We're rotating previous days
value if we get back inside it. All

3832
01:37:27,830 --> 01:37:27,840
value if we get back inside it. All
 

3833
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,189
value if we get back inside it. All
right. So make sure you're locking some

3834
01:37:29,189 --> 01:37:29,199
right. So make sure you're locking some
 

3835
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:33,910
right. So make sure you're locking some
profit here.

3836
01:37:33,910 --> 01:37:33,920

 

3837
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,750

And I'm trying to calm down, folks. I'm

3838
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:35,760
And I'm trying to calm down, folks. I'm
 

3839
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:39,510
And I'm trying to calm down, folks. I'm
trying to like I'm only human. Two days

3840
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:39,520
trying to like I'm only human. Two days
 

3841
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,950
trying to like I'm only human. Two days
in a row of not being able to trade

3842
01:37:40,950 --> 01:37:40,960
in a row of not being able to trade
 

3843
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,430
in a row of not being able to trade
effectively is uh mega frustrating,

3844
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:43,440
effectively is uh mega frustrating,
 

3845
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,189
effectively is uh mega frustrating,
believe it or not.

3846
01:37:45,189 --> 01:37:45,199
believe it or not.
 

3847
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:46,709
believe it or not.
Okay, so buyers will want to defend that

3848
01:37:46,709 --> 01:37:46,719
Okay, so buyers will want to defend that
 

3849
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:50,950
Okay, so buyers will want to defend that
low volume node. Now, I would imagine

3850
01:37:50,950 --> 01:37:50,960
low volume node. Now, I would imagine
 

3851
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,950
low volume node. Now, I would imagine
sellers will want to defend previous day

3852
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:52,960
sellers will want to defend previous day
 

3853
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:55,109
sellers will want to defend previous day
value. Buyers will want to defend this

3854
01:37:55,109 --> 01:37:55,119
value. Buyers will want to defend this
 

3855
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,350
value. Buyers will want to defend this
little nugget here, right? Buyers want

3856
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:57,360
little nugget here, right? Buyers want
 

3857
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:00,310
little nugget here, right? Buyers want
to defend this to cause this. And if we

3858
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:00,320
to defend this to cause this. And if we
 

3859
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,910
to defend this to cause this. And if we
get inside here, we're inside previous

3860
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:01,920
get inside here, we're inside previous
 

3861
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:03,350
get inside here, we're inside previous
day's value. That's going to find

3862
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:03,360
day's value. That's going to find
 

3863
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,750
day's value. That's going to find
acceptance higher. Then that's going to

3864
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:05,760
acceptance higher. Then that's going to
 

3865
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,350
acceptance higher. Then that's going to
basically say that all of today and all

3866
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:07,360
basically say that all of today and all
 

3867
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:09,830
basically say that all of today and all
of last night was a look below and fail.

3868
01:38:09,830 --> 01:38:09,840
of last night was a look below and fail.
 

3869
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,189
of last night was a look below and fail.
All right, so coming up to value area

3870
01:38:11,189 --> 01:38:11,199
All right, so coming up to value area
 

3871
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:12,709
All right, so coming up to value area
high on the session and previous day's

3872
01:38:12,709 --> 01:38:12,719
high on the session and previous day's
 

3873
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:14,390
high on the session and previous day's
value area high. If buyers get through

3874
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:14,400
value area high. If buyers get through
 

3875
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,990
value area high. If buyers get through
this and find acceptance into previous

3876
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:16,000
this and find acceptance into previous
 

3877
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,310
this and find acceptance into previous
days value, we can rotate and look for

3878
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:18,320
days value, we can rotate and look for
 

3879
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,229
days value, we can rotate and look for
previous day point of control again and

3880
01:38:20,229 --> 01:38:20,239
previous day point of control again and
 

3881
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:23,109
previous day point of control again and
above that uh previous day value area

3882
01:38:23,109 --> 01:38:23,119
above that uh previous day value area
 

3883
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:25,350
above that uh previous day value area
high.

3884
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:25,360
high.
 

3885
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,510
high.
Correct Eddie? Correct. Until it proves

3886
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:27,520
Correct Eddie? Correct. Until it proves
 

3887
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:29,590
Correct Eddie? Correct. Until it proves
otherwise, right? Range day because

3888
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:29,600
otherwise, right? Range day because
 

3889
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,030
otherwise, right? Range day because
that's what we've built. If we think

3890
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:31,040
that's what we've built. If we think
 

3891
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,590
that's what we've built. If we think
about this profile, this profile does if

3892
01:38:33,590 --> 01:38:33,600
about this profile, this profile does if
 

3893
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:38,310
about this profile, this profile does if
this profile looked like this,

3894
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:38,320

 

3895
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:39,990

then we can say we're in a trend day,

3896
01:38:39,990 --> 01:38:40,000
then we can say we're in a trend day,
 

3897
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,750
then we can say we're in a trend day,
right? And we could be looking for lower

3898
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:41,760
right? And we could be looking for lower
 

3899
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,310
right? And we could be looking for lower
prices. But we've got a bell curve.

3900
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:44,320
prices. But we've got a bell curve.
 

3901
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,550
prices. But we've got a bell curve.
That's a balance.

3902
01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:46,560
That's a balance.
 

3903
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,870
That's a balance.
And the day before it's balance here.

3904
01:38:48,870 --> 01:38:48,880
And the day before it's balance here.
 

3905
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,550
And the day before it's balance here.
So, we're trying to get back above

3906
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:50,560
So, we're trying to get back above
 

3907
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,310
So, we're trying to get back above
today's balance and get into yesterday's

3908
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:52,320
today's balance and get into yesterday's
 

3909
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,229
today's balance and get into yesterday's
balance. And bears will have to defend

3910
01:38:54,229 --> 01:38:54,239
balance. And bears will have to defend
 

3911
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:57,030
balance. And bears will have to defend
that. If they don't defend that,

3912
01:38:57,030 --> 01:38:57,040
that. If they don't defend that,
 

3913
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:58,629
that. If they don't defend that,
because at the moment, if we get back

3914
01:38:58,629 --> 01:38:58,639
because at the moment, if we get back
 

3915
01:38:58,639 --> 01:38:59,990
because at the moment, if we get back
inside, this is what I'm looking at,

3916
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:00,000
inside, this is what I'm looking at,
 

3917
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,070
inside, this is what I'm looking at,
right? Make this simple. If we get back

3918
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:02,080
right? Make this simple. If we get back
 

3919
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,790
right? Make this simple. If we get back
inside this, then what it's saying is

3920
01:39:04,790 --> 01:39:04,800
inside this, then what it's saying is
 

3921
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,550
inside this, then what it's saying is
we're not accepting lower prices. And

3922
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:06,560
we're not accepting lower prices. And
 

3923
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:09,510
we're not accepting lower prices. And
Alex's level here of the naked point of

3924
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:09,520
Alex's level here of the naked point of
 

3925
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,990
Alex's level here of the naked point of
control was the dip by. And if you

3926
01:39:11,990 --> 01:39:12,000
control was the dip by. And if you
 

3927
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,430
control was the dip by. And if you
joined yesterday, you'll know that we

3928
01:39:13,430 --> 01:39:13,440
joined yesterday, you'll know that we
 

3929
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,189
joined yesterday, you'll know that we
said this could be a high time frame dip

3930
01:39:15,189 --> 01:39:15,199
said this could be a high time frame dip
 

3931
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:18,550
said this could be a high time frame dip
by if they want to rotate it. Big if.

3932
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:18,560
by if they want to rotate it. Big if.
 

3933
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:20,550
by if they want to rotate it. Big if.
So if we get back inside here, this is

3934
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:20,560
So if we get back inside here, this is
 

3935
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,149
So if we get back inside here, this is
your look below and fail, which will

3936
01:39:22,149 --> 01:39:22,159
your look below and fail, which will
 

3937
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:25,189
your look below and fail, which will
leave short sellers trapped. So then the

3938
01:39:25,189 --> 01:39:25,199
leave short sellers trapped. So then the
 

3939
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:26,550
leave short sellers trapped. So then the
rotation is to here. And if they get

3940
01:39:26,550 --> 01:39:26,560
rotation is to here. And if they get
 

3941
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:29,910
rotation is to here. And if they get
back through that, it would be nasty.

3942
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:29,920
back through that, it would be nasty.
 

3943
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,109
back through that, it would be nasty.
Doesn't have to do that. I'm just

3944
01:39:31,109 --> 01:39:31,119
Doesn't have to do that. I'm just
 

3945
01:39:31,119 --> 01:39:33,658
Doesn't have to do that. I'm just
telling you what's available is

do you mean the volume profile course?

3982
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:16,560
do you mean the volume profile course?
 

3983
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,870
do you mean the volume profile course?
It's a separate course. Yes. So, if you

3984
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:18,880
It's a separate course. Yes. So, if you
 

3985

want to do volume profile on order flow,
I launched it yesterday. There is a

3988
01:40:22,149 --> 01:40:22,159
I launched it yesterday. There is a
 

3989
01:40:22,159 --> 01:40:24,550
I launched it yesterday. There is a
discount code. You can use capital

3990
01:40:24,550 --> 01:40:24,560
discount code. You can use capital
 

3991
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,629
discount code. You can use capital
letters L. Uh, just type in launch with

3992
01:40:26,629 --> 01:40:26,639
letters L. Uh, just type in launch with
 

3993
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:30,070
letters L. Uh, just type in launch with
capitals. You'll get $100 off.

3994
01:40:30,070 --> 01:40:30,080
capitals. You'll get $100 off.
 

3995
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,910
capitals. You'll get $100 off.
Okay. So, back testing where we just

3996
01:40:31,910 --> 01:40:31,920
Okay. So, back testing where we just
 

3997
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,990
Okay. So, back testing where we just
came from. So, this shelf here, you can

3998
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:34,000
came from. So, this shelf here, you can
 

3999
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,830
came from. So, this shelf here, you can
see the rotation. This shelf here

4000
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:37,840
see the rotation. This shelf here
 

4001
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:40,070
see the rotation. This shelf here
is your level.

4002
01:40:40,070 --> 01:40:40,080
is your level.
 

4003
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:43,030
is your level.
This value up here, we can adjust this,

4004
01:40:43,030 --> 01:40:43,040
This value up here, we can adjust this,
 

4005
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:45,430
This value up here, we can adjust this,
make it into this little node here. All

4006
01:40:45,430 --> 01:40:45,440
make it into this little node here. All
 

4007
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,189
make it into this little node here. All
right. This is now the rotation between

4008
01:40:47,189 --> 01:40:47,199
right. This is now the rotation between
 

4009
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:49,270
right. This is now the rotation between
these two levels. If they lose blue,

4010
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:49,280
these two levels. If they lose blue,
 

4011
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,550
these two levels. If they lose blue,
they come back down between blue and

4012
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:50,560
they come back down between blue and
 

4013
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,709
they come back down between blue and
green. Right? So, the current rotations

4014
01:40:52,709 --> 01:40:52,719
green. Right? So, the current rotations
 

4015
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:54,550
green. Right? So, the current rotations
because we're in a rotational market is

4016
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:54,560
because we're in a rotational market is
 

4017
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,070
because we're in a rotational market is
between here. If we lose this, it's

4018
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:56,080
between here. If we lose this, it's
 

4019
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:57,669
between here. If we lose this, it's
between here. If we get above this, it's

4020
01:40:57,669 --> 01:40:57,679
between here. If we get above this, it's
 

4021
01:40:57,679 --> 01:41:04,310
between here. If we get above this, it's
probably between here. [snorts]

The volume profile course is is like 6

4042
01:41:37,350 --> 01:41:37,360
The volume profile course is is like 6
 

4043
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:40,470
The volume profile course is is like 6
hours long and gets added to, but uh I

4044
01:41:40,470 --> 01:41:40,480
hours long and gets added to, but uh I
 

4045
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:43,590

still use um teachings from the beginner

4046
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:43,600
still use um teachings from the beginner
 

4047
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,830
still use um teachings from the beginner

4048
01:41:45,830 --> 01:41:45,840
to advanced course in it. So, it's like
 

4049
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,350
to advanced course in it. So, it's like
a supplement course, I guess, is the

4050
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:47,360
a supplement course, I guess, is the
 

4051
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,669
a supplement course, I guess, is the
best way of saying it.

4052
01:41:49,669 --> 01:41:49,679
best way of saying it.
 

4053
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:53,109

let's see. Last big sellers came in at
uh 336. So, back above that and they get

4062
01:42:04,470 --> 01:42:04,480
uh 336. So, back above that and they get
 

4063
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:20,310
uh 336. So, back above that and they get
squeezed out.

01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:41,760
If you want order flow
 

4083
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:44,149
If you want order flow
like footprint and bookmap, do the

4084
01:42:44,149 --> 01:42:44,159
like footprint and bookmap, do the
 

4085
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:45,990
like footprint and bookmap, do the
volume profile and order flow course. If

4086
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:46,000
volume profile and order flow course. If
 

4087
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,910
volume profile and order flow course. If
you want a 20our knowledge of everything

4088
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:47,920
you want a 20our knowledge of everything
 

4089
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:50,070
you want a 20our knowledge of everything
I do, which also has volume profile

4090
01:42:50,070 --> 01:42:50,080
I do, which also has volume profile
 

4091
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:58,149
I do, which also has volume profile
stuff in it, do the 20-hour course.

4092
01:42:58,149 --> 01:42:58,159

 

4093
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:00,470

I mean, GG, you can um I talk about my

4094
01:43:00,470 --> 01:43:00,480
I mean, GG, you can um I talk about my
 

4095
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:02,390
I mean, GG, you can um I talk about my
volume profile even on free videos on

4096
01:43:02,390 --> 01:43:02,400
volume profile even on free videos on
 

4097
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,830
volume profile even on free videos on
YouTube as well. So, you don't need to

4098
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:03,840
YouTube as well. So, you don't need to
 

4099
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,109
YouTube as well. So, you don't need to
buy the course if you just want the

4100
01:43:05,109 --> 01:43:05,119
buy the course if you just want the
 

4101
01:43:05,119 --> 01:43:07,350
buy the course if you just want the
settings. If you go to my volume profile

4102
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:07,360
settings. If you go to my volume profile
 

4103
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:09,430
settings. If you go to my volume profile
master, I think it's called or m

4104
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:09,440
master, I think it's called or m
 

4105
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:10,629
master, I think it's called or m
something like that. It's a free video

4106
01:43:10,629 --> 01:43:10,639
something like that. It's a free video
 

4107
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:12,229
something like that. It's a free video
on YouTube. I give you my settings on

4108
01:43:12,229 --> 01:43:12,239
on YouTube. I give you my settings on
 

4109
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:15,510
on YouTube. I give you my settings on
there.

4110
01:43:15,510 --> 01:43:15,520

 

4111
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:17,990

Okay, so retatting into previous day

4112
01:43:17,990 --> 01:43:18,000
Okay, so retatting into previous day
 

4113
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,350
Okay, so retatting into previous day
close and like I said, I think they're

4114
01:43:19,350 --> 01:43:19,360
close and like I said, I think they're
 

4115
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:21,910
close and like I said, I think they're
going to resqueeze this. And if they do,

4116
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:21,920
going to resqueeze this. And if they do,
 

4117
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:23,750
going to resqueeze this. And if they do,
if they find success inside of value,

4118
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:23,760
if they find success inside of value,
 

4119
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,030
if they find success inside of value,
then they're going to come and try and

4120
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:25,040
then they're going to come and try and
 

4121
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,669
then they're going to come and try and
get back up into here, the high of day.

4122
01:43:27,669 --> 01:43:27,679
get back up into here, the high of day.
 

4123
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:29,189
get back up into here, the high of day.
So far, buyers keep getting caught up

4124
01:43:29,189 --> 01:43:29,199
So far, buyers keep getting caught up
 

4125
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:39,189
So far, buyers keep getting caught up
here in the last few minutes.

4126
01:43:39,189 --> 01:43:39,199

 

4127
01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:41,510

I definitely just got caught up there

4128
01:43:41,510 --> 01:43:41,520
I definitely just got caught up there
 

4129
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,750
I definitely just got caught up there
above low. So bears are trying to defend

4130
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:43,760
above low. So bears are trying to defend
 

4131
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,510
above low. So bears are trying to defend
it. Aggressive buyers definitely just

4132
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:45,520
it. Aggressive buyers definitely just
 

4133
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,990
it. Aggressive buyers definitely just
got caught up there. They need to find

4134
01:43:47,990 --> 01:43:48,000
got caught up there. They need to find
 

4135
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,910
got caught up there. They need to find
acceptance above, which needs to be a

4136
01:43:49,910 --> 01:43:49,920
acceptance above, which needs to be a
 

4137
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,470
acceptance above, which needs to be a
close above, a pull back into it, and a

4138
01:43:52,470 --> 01:43:52,480
close above, a pull back into it, and a
 

4139
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:54,629
close above, a pull back into it, and a
hold. So acceptance above will be a

4140
01:43:54,629 --> 01:43:54,639
hold. So acceptance above will be a
 

4141
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:56,950
hold. So acceptance above will be a
close above, a pull back into it, and a

4142
01:43:56,950 --> 01:43:56,960
close above, a pull back into it, and a
 

4143
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:58,790
close above, a pull back into it, and a
hold. That's true acceptance. Or if they

4144
01:43:58,790 --> 01:43:58,800
hold. That's true acceptance. Or if they
 

4145
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:01,270
hold. That's true acceptance. Or if they
just drive really hard. But like just

4146
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:01,280
just drive really hard. But like just
 

4147
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,709
just drive really hard. But like just
tapping and tapping and tapping, that's

4148
01:44:02,709 --> 01:44:02,719
tapping and tapping and tapping, that's
 

4149
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:03,830
tapping and tapping and tapping, that's
saying that there's a passive seller

4150
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:03,840
saying that there's a passive seller
 

4151
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,430
saying that there's a passive seller
here, isn't there? Because we know that

4152
01:44:05,430 --> 01:44:05,440
here, isn't there? Because we know that
 

4153
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,669
here, isn't there? Because we know that
this is a shelf. And if they lose this

4154
01:44:07,669 --> 01:44:07,679
this is a shelf. And if they lose this
 

4155
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:19,270
this is a shelf. And if they lose this
shelf, then back down to here they come.

4156
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:19,280

 

4157
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,470

Where'd you get the buy and sell

4158
01:44:20,470 --> 01:44:20,480
Where'd you get the buy and sell
 

4159
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:38,950
Where'd you get the buy and sell
signals? Uh the flow zone pro indicator

4160
01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:38,960

 

4161
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,669

Danny. Yeah. So the H1 right now, you

4162
01:44:41,669 --> 01:44:41,679
Danny. Yeah. So the H1 right now, you
 

4163
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:43,270
Danny. Yeah. So the H1 right now, you
see the green box? We keep dipping and

4164
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:43,280
see the green box? We keep dipping and
 

4165
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,870
see the green box? We keep dipping and
holding it. If if you have a look at the

4166
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:44,880
holding it. If if you have a look at the
 

4167
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:46,390
holding it. If if you have a look at the
H1, what you're looking at right now,

4168
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:46,400
H1, what you're looking at right now,
 

4169
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:50,229
H1, what you're looking at right now,
why it's a rotation, think about

4170
01:44:50,229 --> 01:44:50,239
why it's a rotation, think about
 

4171
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:53,990
why it's a rotation, think about
I'll just do it on here.

4172
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:54,000
I'll just do it on here.
 

4173
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,910
I'll just do it on here.
All right, think about yesterday. Let's

4174
01:44:55,910 --> 01:44:55,920
All right, think about yesterday. Let's
 

4175
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:58,229
All right, think about yesterday. Let's
just take this off.

4176
01:44:58,229 --> 01:44:58,239
just take this off.
 

4177
01:44:58,239 --> 01:45:00,629
just take this off.
Think about yesterday. All right, so

4178
01:45:00,629 --> 01:45:00,639
Think about yesterday. All right, so
 

4179
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:03,350
Think about yesterday. All right, so
Monday, that was the overnight session

4180
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:03,360
Monday, that was the overnight session
 

4181
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:07,270
Monday, that was the overnight session
expansion. Yesterday built the liquidity

4182
01:45:07,270 --> 01:45:07,280
expansion. Yesterday built the liquidity
 

4183
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:09,990
expansion. Yesterday built the liquidity
expansion, right? overnight.

4184
01:45:09,990 --> 01:45:10,000
expansion, right? overnight.
 

4185
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,550
expansion, right? overnight.
Now, we need to build liquidity.

4186
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:12,560
Now, we need to build liquidity.
 

4187
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,629
Now, we need to build liquidity.
Look at these H1 guys here. If you were

4188
01:45:14,629 --> 01:45:14,639
Look at these H1 guys here. If you were
 

4189
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:17,189
Look at these H1 guys here. If you were
short in here, right, you're caught. And

4190
01:45:17,189 --> 01:45:17,199
short in here, right, you're caught. And
 

4191
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:18,310
short in here, right, you're caught. And
this is why I was saying this is

4192
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:18,320
this is why I was saying this is
 

4193
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:19,590
this is why I was saying this is
probably the level today while we put

4194
01:45:19,590 --> 01:45:19,600
probably the level today while we put
 

4195
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,270
probably the level today while we put
the blue box in. This is the naked point

4196
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:21,280
the blue box in. This is the naked point
 

4197
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:26,229
the blue box in. This is the naked point
of control. So, H1 back testing supply

4198
01:45:26,229 --> 01:45:26,239
of control. So, H1 back testing supply
 

4199
01:45:26,239 --> 01:45:28,790
of control. So, H1 back testing supply
but holding demand. So, build out of

4200
01:45:28,790 --> 01:45:28,800
but holding demand. So, build out of
 

4201
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:31,830
but holding demand. So, build out of
liquidity in here. And eventually, maybe

4202
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:31,840
liquidity in here. And eventually, maybe
 

4203
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,590
liquidity in here. And eventually, maybe
today, maybe tomorrow, maybe end of

4204
01:45:33,590 --> 01:45:33,600
today, maybe tomorrow, maybe end of
 

4205
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,510
today, maybe tomorrow, maybe end of
week, we don't know. We will break out

4206
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:35,520
week, we don't know. We will break out
 

4207
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:37,669
week, we don't know. We will break out
of this. And if we do this side, then

4208
01:45:37,669 --> 01:45:37,679
of this. And if we do this side, then
 

4209
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:38,870
of this. And if we do this side, then
we're going to come up to here. If we do

4210
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:38,880
we're going to come up to here. If we do
 

4211
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:41,350
we're going to come up to here. If we do
this side, then we expand into this box.

4212
01:45:41,350 --> 01:45:41,360
this side, then we expand into this box.
 

4213
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:42,950
this side, then we expand into this box.
Right? So, this is why I'm saying today

4214
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:42,960
Right? So, this is why I'm saying today
 

4215
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:44,629
Right? So, this is why I'm saying today
is more likely to be a rotational day

4216
01:45:44,629 --> 01:45:44,639
is more likely to be a rotational day
 

4217
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:46,550
is more likely to be a rotational day
because we've done that move overnight.

4218
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:46,560
because we've done that move overnight.
 

4219
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:48,310
because we've done that move overnight.
We're pinned in between yesterday's

4220
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:48,320
We're pinned in between yesterday's
 

4221
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,870
We're pinned in between yesterday's
area.

4222
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:50,880
area.
 

4223
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,470
area.
These are the days where I'm like, got

4224
01:45:52,470 --> 01:45:52,480
These are the days where I'm like, got
 

4225
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:55,510
These are the days where I'm like, got
to be careful. Got to be careful. Like,

4226
01:45:55,510 --> 01:45:55,520
to be careful. Got to be careful. Like,
 

4227
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:57,669
to be careful. Got to be careful. Like,
it's not like this day where we've done

4228
01:45:57,669 --> 01:45:57,679
it's not like this day where we've done
 

4229
01:45:57,679 --> 01:45:59,109
it's not like this day where we've done
the back test and we're going to sell

4230
01:45:59,109 --> 01:45:59,119
the back test and we're going to sell
 

4231
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:01,189
the back test and we're going to sell
the open or where they've created the

4232
01:46:01,189 --> 01:46:01,199
the open or where they've created the
 

4233
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:02,629
the open or where they've created the
liquidity overnight and they're selling

4234
01:46:02,629 --> 01:46:02,639
liquidity overnight and they're selling
 

4235
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:03,990
liquidity overnight and they're selling
back down to this. Remember, this is the

4236
01:46:03,990 --> 01:46:04,000
back down to this. Remember, this is the
 

4237
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,310
back down to this. Remember, this is the
magnet. So, we've now hit my magnet and

4238
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:06,320
magnet. So, we've now hit my magnet and
 

4239
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,550
magnet. So, we've now hit my magnet and
we're holding it. All right, look below.

4240
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:08,560
we're holding it. All right, look below.
 

4241
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:11,669
we're holding it. All right, look below.
Fail, hold, dip, hold, back to here.

4242
01:46:11,669 --> 01:46:11,679
Fail, hold, dip, hold, back to here.
 

4243
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:13,669
Fail, hold, dip, hold, back to here.
We're stuck. This is why I said today is

4244
01:46:13,669 --> 01:46:13,679
We're stuck. This is why I said today is
 

4245
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:17,430
We're stuck. This is why I said today is
a rotational day

4246
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:17,440
a rotational day
 

4247
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:19,830
a rotational day
until it proves otherwise.

4248
01:46:19,830 --> 01:46:19,840
until it proves otherwise.
 

4249
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:38,390
until it proves otherwise.
Hopefully that helps make sense.

4250
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:38,400

 

4251
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:40,310

See, we're just stuck up here for now.

4252
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:40,320
See, we're just stuck up here for now.
 

4253
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,390
See, we're just stuck up here for now.
So, if we lose this shelf, back down to

4254
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:42,400
So, if we lose this shelf, back down to
 

4255
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:45,750
So, if we lose this shelf, back down to
280s. If we lose the shelf and the edge

4256
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:45,760
280s. If we lose the shelf and the edge
 

4257
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:51,189
280s. If we lose the shelf and the edge
of this shelf, let's just draw this in

4258
01:46:51,189 --> 01:46:51,199

 

4259
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:55,590

your little gray box.

4260
01:46:55,590 --> 01:46:55,600

 

4261
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:57,430

This is the tiny little rotation right

4262
01:46:57,430 --> 01:46:57,440
This is the tiny little rotation right
 

4263
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:00,310
This is the tiny little rotation right
now. It's happening right here. There

4264
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:00,320
now. It's happening right here. There
 

4265
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:01,910
now. It's happening right here. There
you go. Starting to lose it. So it might

4266
01:47:01,910 --> 01:47:01,920
you go. Starting to lose it. So it might
 

4267
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:05,350
you go. Starting to lose it. So it might
come 280s now down into this. Very very

4268
01:47:05,350 --> 01:47:05,360
come 280s now down into this. Very very
 

4269
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:07,350
come 280s now down into this. Very very
possible. We do have a bit of an

4270
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:07,360
possible. We do have a bit of an
 

4271
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:10,790
possible. We do have a bit of an
imbalance down here into 300s where we

4272
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:10,800
imbalance down here into 300s where we
 

4273
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:14,870
imbalance down here into 300s where we
just broke out from

4274
01:47:14,870 --> 01:47:14,880

 

4275
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:18,059

this little nugget here. 300s.

4276
01:47:18,059 --> 01:47:18,069
this little nugget here. 300s.
 

4277
01:47:18,069 --> 01:47:21,510
this little nugget here. 300s.

4278
01:47:21,510 --> 01:47:21,520

 

4279
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,189

Yeah, exactly Danny. Well, really good

4280
01:47:23,189 --> 01:47:23,199
Yeah, exactly Danny. Well, really good
 

4281
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:25,430
Yeah, exactly Danny. Well, really good
for like well done in identifying this

4282
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:25,440
for like well done in identifying this
 

4283
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:28,070
for like well done in identifying this
is not the condition you like. Like I

4284
01:47:28,070 --> 01:47:28,080
is not the condition you like. Like I
 

4285
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:29,990
is not the condition you like. Like I
said, that's honestly like you improve

4286
01:47:29,990 --> 01:47:30,000
said, that's honestly like you improve
 

4287
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,830
said, that's honestly like you improve
your profit factor. Not by trading more,

4288
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:31,840
your profit factor. Not by trading more,
 

4289
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,910
your profit factor. Not by trading more,
by trading less, by by seeing what you

4290
01:47:33,910 --> 01:47:33,920
by trading less, by by seeing what you
 

4291
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,030
by trading less, by by seeing what you
don't want to trade. So, that's really

4292
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:35,040
don't want to trade. So, that's really
 

4293
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:40,390
don't want to trade. So, that's really
good.

4294
01:47:40,390 --> 01:47:40,400

 

4295
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,189

Nice indeed. Yeah. If you've made money

4296
01:47:43,189 --> 01:47:43,199
Nice indeed. Yeah. If you've made money
 

4297
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:44,870
Nice indeed. Yeah. If you've made money
and you don't like days like today, then

4298
01:47:44,870 --> 01:47:44,880
and you don't like days like today, then
 

4299
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:47,510
and you don't like days like today, then
uh be happy with it and walk. Um we will

4300

4303
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:51,669
do a giveaway here, folks, in in about
an hour. We'll do another Apex giveaway.

4304
01:47:51,669 --> 01:47:51,679
an hour. We'll do another Apex giveaway.
 

4305
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:53,109
an hour. We'll do another Apex giveaway.
Maybe we'll give away a little course as

4306
01:47:53,109 --> 01:47:53,119
Maybe we'll give away a little course as
 

4307
01:47:53,119 --> 01:47:55,510
Maybe we'll give away a little course as
well.

4308
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:55,520
well.
 

4309
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,270
well.
So, let's get those likes up. 400 of you

4310
01:47:57,270 --> 01:47:57,280
So, let's get those likes up. 400 of you
 

4311
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:58,709
So, let's get those likes up. 400 of you
watching at the moment. Let's smash that

4312
01:47:58,709 --> 01:47:58,719
watching at the moment. Let's smash that
 

4313
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:02,310
watching at the moment. Let's smash that
like button.

4314
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:02,320

 

4315
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:04,070

Okay. So, what would I be watching? Same

4316
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:04,080
Okay. So, what would I be watching? Same
 

4317
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:06,149
Okay. So, what would I be watching? Same
thing. Same rotation. All right. So,

4318
01:48:06,149 --> 01:48:06,159
thing. Same rotation. All right. So,
 

4319
01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:07,750
thing. Same rotation. All right. So,
we're starting to get stuck under this

4320
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:07,760
we're starting to get stuck under this
 

4321
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:09,750
we're starting to get stuck under this
little blue box. All right. Bulls need

4322
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:09,760
little blue box. All right. Bulls need
 

4323
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,350
little blue box. All right. Bulls need
to reclaim that for a squeeze. If they

4324
01:48:11,350 --> 01:48:11,360
to reclaim that for a squeeze. If they
 

4325
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,030
to reclaim that for a squeeze. If they
keep selling against it, the rotation is

4326
01:48:13,030 --> 01:48:13,040
keep selling against it, the rotation is
 

4327
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:14,390
keep selling against it, the rotation is
to here. Like I talked about, this is

4328
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:14,400
to here. Like I talked about, this is
 

4329
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,470
to here. Like I talked about, this is
this rotation. If we lose this box, this

4330
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:16,480
this rotation. If we lose this box, this
 

4331
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:19,030
this rotation. If we lose this box, this
is this rotation. If we reclaim this,

4332
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:19,040
is this rotation. If we reclaim this,
 

4333
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:25,830
is this rotation. If we reclaim this,
this is this rotation.

4334
01:48:25,830 --> 01:48:25,840

 

4335
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,270

Mag is looking a bit better. I'll give

4336
01:48:27,270 --> 01:48:27,280
Mag is looking a bit better. I'll give
 

4337
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:29,750
Mag is looking a bit better. I'll give
you a readout. Tesla 0.22% up. Nvidia

4338
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:29,760
you a readout. Tesla 0.22% up. Nvidia
 

4339
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:34,790
you a readout. Tesla 0.22% up. Nvidia
0.40% up. Meta 0.81% up. Amazon 0.34%

4340
01:48:34,790 --> 01:48:34,800
0.40% up. Meta 0.81% up. Amazon 0.34%
 

4341
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:37,109
0.40% up. Meta 0.81% up. Amazon 0.34%
up. And then you have Microsoft almost

4342
01:48:37,109 --> 01:48:37,119
up. And then you have Microsoft almost
 

4343
01:48:37,119 --> 01:48:40,229
up. And then you have Microsoft almost
flat on the day. Apple 0.16% down. And

4344
01:48:40,229 --> 01:48:40,239
flat on the day. Apple 0.16% down. And
 

4345
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:42,550
flat on the day. Apple 0.16% down. And
the bigger loser is Google which is a

4346
01:48:42,550 --> 01:48:42,560
the bigger loser is Google which is a
 

4347
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:43,910
the bigger loser is Google which is a
third of percent down. So they're trying

4348
01:48:43,910 --> 01:48:43,920
third of percent down. So they're trying
 

4349
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:47,430
third of percent down. So they're trying
to find a bid. And again, VIX has failed

4350
01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:47,440
to find a bid. And again, VIX has failed
 

4351
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:48,790
to find a bid. And again, VIX has failed
to break out. Like I talked about, I

4352
01:48:48,790 --> 01:48:48,800
to break out. Like I talked about, I
 

4353
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,390
to break out. Like I talked about, I
didn't like the look of that VIX for

4354
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:50,400
didn't like the look of that VIX for
 

4355
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,070
didn't like the look of that VIX for
shorts. It's failed to break out. It's

4356
01:48:52,070 --> 01:48:52,080
shorts. It's failed to break out. It's
 

4357
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,470
shorts. It's failed to break out. It's
come back down towards its lows. It's

4358
01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:54,480
come back down towards its lows. It's
 

4359
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:57,350
come back down towards its lows. It's
drifting under or it's under the 17s.

4360
01:48:57,350 --> 01:48:57,360
drifting under or it's under the 17s.
 

4361
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:00,790
drifting under or it's under the 17s.
It's at 1667. It's got a PDC which has

4362
01:49:00,790 --> 01:49:00,800
It's at 1667. It's got a PDC which has
 

4363
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:05,830
It's at 1667. It's got a PDC which has
already back tested once today at 1650

4364
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:05,840
already back tested once today at 1650
 

4365
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,229
already back tested once today at 1650
and VIX is looking like it's starting to

4366
01:49:08,229 --> 01:49:08,239
and VIX is looking like it's starting to
 

4367
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:11,350
and VIX is looking like it's starting to
sort of float lower which might help

4368
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:11,360
sort of float lower which might help
 

4369
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:13,350
sort of float lower which might help
market catch a bid. But right now ES and

4370
01:49:13,350 --> 01:49:13,360
market catch a bid. But right now ES and
 

4371
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:15,030
market catch a bid. But right now ES and
SPY can't get through their VWAP. So

4372
01:49:15,030 --> 01:49:15,040
SPY can't get through their VWAP. So
 

4373
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:17,030
SPY can't get through their VWAP. So
that's why we're stuck around here on

4374
01:49:17,030 --> 01:49:17,040
that's why we're stuck around here on
 

4375
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:19,510
that's why we're stuck around here on
the market.

4376
01:49:19,510 --> 01:49:19,520
the market.
 

4377
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:21,830
the market.
And you're just going to see that

4378
01:49:21,830 --> 01:49:21,840
And you're just going to see that
 

4379
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,590
And you're just going to see that
transition until one side's caught.

4380
01:49:23,590 --> 01:49:23,600
transition until one side's caught.
 

4381
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:32,950
transition until one side's caught.
They're building the liquidity.

4382
01:49:32,950 --> 01:49:32,960

 

4383
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:35,990

Yeah, exactly. Uh I'm not sure how to

4384
01:49:35,990 --> 01:49:36,000
Yeah, exactly. Uh I'm not sure how to
 

4385
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,270
Yeah, exactly. Uh I'm not sure how to
say your name. Na na n N N N N N N N N N

4386
01:49:37,270 --> 01:49:37,280
say your name. Na na n N N N N N N N N N

That's exactly it, right? So like any

4396
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:43,520
That's exactly it, right? So like any
 

4397
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:45,910
That's exactly it, right? So like any
trend

4398
01:49:45,910 --> 01:49:45,920
trend
 

4399
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:47,910
trend
even on a lower time frame, right? If

4400
01:49:47,910 --> 01:49:47,920
even on a lower time frame, right? If
 

4401
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:51,189
even on a lower time frame, right? If
the protrend is down, let's just imagine

4402
01:49:51,189 --> 01:49:51,199
the protrend is down, let's just imagine
 

4403
01:49:51,199 --> 01:49:53,430
the protrend is down, let's just imagine
this protrend is is down, which it is

4404
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:53,440
this protrend is is down, which it is
 

4405
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:54,790
this protrend is is down, which it is
technically. All right, if this is the

4406
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:54,800
technically. All right, if this is the
 

4407
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:58,390
technically. All right, if this is the
protrend is down,

4408
01:49:58,390 --> 01:49:58,400
protrend is down,
 

4409
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,870
protrend is down,
right? Then this is a rebalance. And if

4410
01:50:00,870 --> 01:50:00,880
right? Then this is a rebalance. And if
 

4411
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,709
right? Then this is a rebalance. And if
they resume this, the protrend will be

4412
01:50:02,709 --> 01:50:02,719
they resume this, the protrend will be
 

4413
01:50:02,719 --> 01:50:04,149
they resume this, the protrend will be
down again, right? Assume there's

4414
01:50:04,149 --> 01:50:04,159
down again, right? Assume there's
 

4415
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:05,830
down again, right? Assume there's
nothing down here. All right? And this

4416
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:05,840
nothing down here. All right? And this
 

4417
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:08,229
nothing down here. All right? And this
can be like assume this part is the

4418
01:50:08,229 --> 01:50:08,239
can be like assume this part is the
 

4419
01:50:08,239 --> 01:50:10,470
can be like assume this part is the
daily. This is all huge daily. So when

4420
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:10,480
daily. This is all huge daily. So when
 

4421
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:11,750
daily. This is all huge daily. So when
we're playing protrend, what we're

4422
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:11,760
we're playing protrend, what we're
 

4423
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:13,189
we're playing protrend, what we're
looking for is to time the lower time

4424
01:50:13,189 --> 01:50:13,199
looking for is to time the lower time
 

4425
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:15,030
looking for is to time the lower time
frame to get an alignment. So if we've

4426
01:50:15,030 --> 01:50:15,040
frame to get an alignment. So if we've
 

4427
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,270
frame to get an alignment. So if we've
had a huge sell on a daily and the 30

4428
01:50:17,270 --> 01:50:17,280
had a huge sell on a daily and the 30
 

4429
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:19,830
had a huge sell on a daily and the 30
minute is doing this, it's repricing

4430
01:50:19,830 --> 01:50:19,840
minute is doing this, it's repricing
 

4431
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,910
minute is doing this, it's repricing
some of the daily sell and then you're

4432
01:50:21,910 --> 01:50:21,920
some of the daily sell and then you're
 

4433
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:23,350
some of the daily sell and then you're
looking for that lower high. But what

4434
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:23,360
looking for that lower high. But what
 

4435
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:25,510
looking for that lower high. But what
you need is a lower low because if we

4436
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:25,520
you need is a lower low because if we
 

4437
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:27,109
you need is a lower low because if we
don't get the lower low, which is what

4438
01:50:27,109 --> 01:50:27,119
don't get the lower low, which is what
 

4439
01:50:27,119 --> 01:50:29,669
don't get the lower low, which is what
we saw here, this is where shorts get

4440
01:50:29,669 --> 01:50:29,679
we saw here, this is where shorts get
 

4441
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:31,109
we saw here, this is where shorts get
get trapped, right? Because they attack

4442
01:50:31,109 --> 01:50:31,119
get trapped, right? Because they attack
 

4443
01:50:31,119 --> 01:50:33,189
get trapped, right? Because they attack
the lows, right? So this is the main

4444
01:50:33,189 --> 01:50:33,199
the lows, right? So this is the main
 

4445
01:50:33,199 --> 01:50:34,709
the lows, right? So this is the main
trend. This is the pullback. They look

4446
01:50:34,709 --> 01:50:34,719
trend. This is the pullback. They look
 

4447
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:36,629
trend. This is the pullback. They look
for the continuation. If if the

4448
01:50:36,629 --> 01:50:36,639
for the continuation. If if the
 

4449
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:38,790
for the continuation. If if the
continuation doesn't happen, that's

4450
01:50:38,790 --> 01:50:38,800
continuation doesn't happen, that's
 

4451
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:41,510
continuation doesn't happen, that's
where they get stuck, right?

4452
01:50:41,510 --> 01:50:41,520
where they get stuck, right?
 

4453
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:43,109
where they get stuck, right?
So now you're seeing that rotation back

4454
01:50:43,109 --> 01:50:43,119
So now you're seeing that rotation back
 

4455
01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:45,510
So now you're seeing that rotation back
into this level here. All right. So

4456
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:45,520
into this level here. All right. So
 

4457
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:46,950
into this level here. All right. So
bulls will want to try and defend this.

4458
01:50:46,950 --> 01:50:46,960
bulls will want to try and defend this.
 

4459
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:48,629
bulls will want to try and defend this.
Now if they fail to defend it, we go for

4460
01:50:48,629 --> 01:50:48,639
Now if they fail to defend it, we go for
 

4461
01:50:48,639 --> 01:50:49,750
Now if they fail to defend it, we go for
the next level down. And you're just

4462
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:49,760
the next level down. And you're just
 

4463
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:51,590
the next level down. And you're just
going to see rinse, repeat, rinse,

4464
01:50:51,590 --> 01:50:51,600
going to see rinse, repeat, rinse,
 

4465
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:54,149
going to see rinse, repeat, rinse,
repeat, rinse, repeat, non-stop. That's

4466
01:50:54,149 --> 01:50:54,159
repeat, rinse, repeat, non-stop. That's
 

4467
01:50:54,159 --> 01:51:01,990
repeat, rinse, repeat, non-stop. That's
what you're going to see today.

4468
01:51:01,990 --> 01:51:02,000

 

4469
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,470

Yes. One minute. One minute. All right.

4470
01:51:04,470 --> 01:51:04,480
Yes. One minute. One minute. All right.
 

4471
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:06,310
Yes. One minute. One minute. All right.
So catching a bid off the 80s. All

4472
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:06,320
So catching a bid off the 80s. All
 

4473
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,629
So catching a bid off the 80s. All
right. Now maybe they test this little

4474
01:51:08,629 --> 01:51:08,639
right. Now maybe they test this little
 

4475
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:10,149
right. Now maybe they test this little
shelf here at 300s and if they get

4476
01:51:10,149 --> 01:51:10,159
shelf here at 300s and if they get
 

4477
01:51:10,159 --> 01:51:11,830
shelf here at 300s and if they get
through it they come back to 320. So

4478
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:11,840
through it they come back to 320. So
 

4479
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:14,229
through it they come back to 320. So
it's just the same thing over and over

4480
01:51:14,229 --> 01:51:14,239
it's just the same thing over and over
 

4481
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:18,790
it's just the same thing over and over
and over and over again. Level level

4482
01:51:18,790 --> 01:51:18,800
and over and over again. Level level
 

4483
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:22,629
and over and over again. Level level
level. That's all we do. Test test test.

4484
01:51:22,629 --> 01:51:22,639
level. That's all we do. Test test test.
 

4485
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:24,870
level. That's all we do. Test test test.
Who wins? Who wins? Who wins? Who's in?

4486
01:51:24,870 --> 01:51:24,880
Who wins? Who wins? Who wins? Who's in?
 

4487
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,390
Who wins? Who wins? Who wins? Who's in?
How much liquidity have we got? Have we

4488
01:51:26,390 --> 01:51:26,400
How much liquidity have we got? Have we
 

4489
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:29,030
How much liquidity have we got? Have we
got someone stuck? Yes, lift or yes

4490
01:51:29,030 --> 01:51:29,040
got someone stuck? Yes, lift or yes
 

4491
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:30,950
got someone stuck? Yes, lift or yes
dump. Right? That's all we do in a

4492
01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:30,960
dump. Right? That's all we do in a
 

4493
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:33,030
dump. Right? That's all we do in a
rotation.

4494
01:51:33,030 --> 01:51:33,040
rotation.
 

4495
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:34,950
rotation.
Understand the difference. They are very

4496
01:51:34,950 --> 01:51:34,960
Understand the difference. They are very
 

4497
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:44,950
Understand the difference. They are very
very different markets.

4498
01:51:44,950 --> 01:51:44,960

 

4499
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:46,229

Buyers getting stuck here. They keep

4500
01:51:46,229 --> 01:51:46,239
Buyers getting stuck here. They keep
 

4501
01:51:46,239 --> 01:51:48,709
Buyers getting stuck here. They keep
trying to get this lift back into this

4502
01:51:48,709 --> 01:51:48,719
trying to get this lift back into this
 

4503
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:50,709
trying to get this lift back into this
blue box and they keep trying and keep

4504
01:51:50,709 --> 01:51:50,719
blue box and they keep trying and keep
 

4505
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:52,310
blue box and they keep trying and keep
getting stuck in these last few wicks.

4506
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:52,320
getting stuck in these last few wicks.
 

4507
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:55,030
getting stuck in these last few wicks.
So this level here 302 looks pretty key

4508
01:51:55,030 --> 01:51:55,040
So this level here 302 looks pretty key
 

4509
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:56,870
So this level here 302 looks pretty key
right now. Buyers buyers are stuck at

4510
01:51:56,870 --> 01:51:56,880
right now. Buyers buyers are stuck at
 

4511
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,950
right now. Buyers buyers are stuck at
300. They've come in twice or three

4512
01:51:58,950 --> 01:51:58,960
300. They've come in twice or three
 

4513
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:00,390
300. They've come in twice or three
times actually up here and not got a

4514
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:00,400
times actually up here and not got a
 

4515
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:01,750
times actually up here and not got a
close above. So they need to get back

4516
01:52:01,750 --> 01:52:01,760
close above. So they need to get back
 

4517
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:03,669
close above. So they need to get back
above that. they get back above that,

4518
01:52:03,669 --> 01:52:03,679
above that. they get back above that,
 

4519
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:05,189
above that. they get back above that,
they're going to go and test 317s.

4520
01:52:05,189 --> 01:52:05,199
they're going to go and test 317s.
 

4521
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:06,310
they're going to go and test 317s.
That's where they want to test. There is

4522
01:52:06,310 --> 01:52:06,320
That's where they want to test. There is
 

4523
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:08,870
That's where they want to test. There is
a little imbalance into 305s. But so

4524
01:52:08,870 --> 01:52:08,880
a little imbalance into 305s. But so
 

4525
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,070
a little imbalance into 305s. But so
this level here is where they keep

4526
01:52:10,070 --> 01:52:10,080
this level here is where they keep
 

4527
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:11,510
this level here is where they keep
flying in. They need to get a squeeze

4528
01:52:11,510 --> 01:52:11,520
flying in. They need to get a squeeze
 

4529
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,030
flying in. They need to get a squeeze
back up, otherwise they get caught here

4530
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:13,040
back up, otherwise they get caught here
 

4531
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:16,470
back up, otherwise they get caught here
trying to buy the dip, these buyers.

4532
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:16,480
trying to buy the dip, these buyers.
 

4533
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:18,709
trying to buy the dip, these buyers.
So here's the little sellside imbalance.

4534
01:52:18,709 --> 01:52:18,719
So here's the little sellside imbalance.
 

4535
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:20,709
So here's the little sellside imbalance.
And it just got resold instantly, the

4536
01:52:20,709 --> 01:52:20,719
And it just got resold instantly, the
 

4537
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:33,510
And it just got resold instantly, the
305s.

4538
01:52:33,510 --> 01:52:33,520

 

4539
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:37,189

I don't like rotation. No, Indie. I I I

4540
01:52:37,189 --> 01:52:37,199
I don't like rotation. No, Indie. I I I
 

4541
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:39,270
I don't like rotation. No, Indie. I I I
try and sit out rotation as much as

4542
01:52:39,270 --> 01:52:39,280
try and sit out rotation as much as
 

4543
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:41,350
try and sit out rotation as much as
possible, especially rotation early

4544
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:41,360
possible, especially rotation early
 

4545
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:43,830
possible, especially rotation early
morning. Like if if it's nice early

4546
01:52:43,830 --> 01:52:43,840
morning. Like if if it's nice early
 

4547
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:45,589
morning. Like if if it's nice early
morning and it's a fresh test of a

4548
01:52:45,589 --> 01:52:45,599
morning and it's a fresh test of a
 

4549
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:48,070
morning and it's a fresh test of a
level,

4550
01:52:48,070 --> 01:52:48,080
level,
 

4551
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:50,950
level,
fresh test, fresh test, fresh test.

4552
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:50,960
fresh test, fresh test, fresh test.
 

4553
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:53,669
fresh test, fresh test, fresh test.
Fine. But as we go through the day, it

4554
01:52:53,669 --> 01:52:53,679
Fine. But as we go through the day, it
 

4555
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:55,750
Fine. But as we go through the day, it
gets more and more messy. I'm less

4556
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:55,760
gets more and more messy. I'm less
 

4557
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:57,270
gets more and more messy. I'm less
interested and I'll just let let

4558
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:57,280
interested and I'll just let let
 

4559
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:59,270
interested and I'll just let let
everyone else get trapped and then come

4560
01:52:59,270 --> 01:52:59,280
everyone else get trapped and then come
 

4561
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:01,270
everyone else get trapped and then come
back tomorrow or the day after when we

4562
01:53:01,270 --> 01:53:01,280
back tomorrow or the day after when we
 

4563
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:03,669
back tomorrow or the day after when we
start leaving the value, leaving the

4564
01:53:03,669 --> 01:53:03,679
start leaving the value, leaving the
 

4565
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:05,109
start leaving the value, leaving the
volume that we've created. And then we

4566
01:53:05,109 --> 01:53:05,119
volume that we've created. And then we
 

4567
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:08,149
volume that we've created. And then we
get days like yesterday and Friday where

4568
01:53:08,149 --> 01:53:08,159
get days like yesterday and Friday where
 

4569
01:53:08,159 --> 01:53:10,390
get days like yesterday and Friday where
we can be aggressive because it's market

4570
01:53:10,390 --> 01:53:10,400
we can be aggressive because it's market
 

4571
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:20,790
we can be aggressive because it's market
is directional.

4572
01:53:20,790 --> 01:53:20,800

 

4573
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:22,470

He's trying to step back up in here and

4574
01:53:22,470 --> 01:53:22,480
He's trying to step back up in here and
 

4575
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:25,910
He's trying to step back up in here and
they keep getting caught.

4576
01:53:25,910 --> 01:53:25,920
they keep getting caught.
 

4577
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:27,830
they keep getting caught.
They keep getting caught so far. There's

4578
01:53:27,830 --> 01:53:27,840
They keep getting caught so far. There's
 

4579
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,270
They keep getting caught so far. There's
passive selling here. They keep getting

4580
01:53:29,270 --> 01:53:29,280
passive selling here. They keep getting
 

4581
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:30,870
passive selling here. They keep getting
caught. They need to get closes back

4582
01:53:30,870 --> 01:53:30,880
caught. They need to get closes back
 

4583
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,870
caught. They need to get closes back
above and we're going to see this

4584
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:32,880
above and we're going to see this
 

4585
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,550
above and we're going to see this
rotation again. So, this technically now

4586
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:34,560
rotation again. So, this technically now
 

4587
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:39,589
rotation again. So, this technically now
would be red,

4588
01:53:39,589 --> 01:53:39,599

 

4589
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:41,030

right? So, sellers will want a lower

4590
01:53:41,030 --> 01:53:41,040
right? So, sellers will want a lower
 

4591
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:43,030
right? So, sellers will want a lower
high and a dump and buyers will want to

4592
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:43,040
high and a dump and buyers will want to
 

4593
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:55,910
high and a dump and buyers will want to
reclaim it.

4594
01:53:55,910 --> 01:53:55,920

 

4595
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:59,430

How do you know if there's enough folks

4596
01:53:59,430 --> 01:53:59,440
How do you know if there's enough folks
 

4597
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:02,070
How do you know if there's enough folks
get stuck for the counter move? Well, it

4598
01:54:02,070 --> 01:54:02,080
get stuck for the counter move? Well, it
 

4599
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:03,510
get stuck for the counter move? Well, it
you need to also understand what time

4600
01:54:03,510 --> 01:54:03,520
you need to also understand what time
 

4601
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:04,709
you need to also understand what time
frame you're looking at when you're

4602
01:54:04,709 --> 01:54:04,719
frame you're looking at when you're
 

4603
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:06,550
frame you're looking at when you're
calling talking about the counter trend

4604
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:06,560
calling talking about the counter trend
 

4605
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:09,510
calling talking about the counter trend
move. Um and then you need to trade in

4606
01:54:09,510 --> 01:54:09,520
move. Um and then you need to trade in
 

4607
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:11,669
move. Um and then you need to trade in
and around a key area and you need to

4608
01:54:11,669 --> 01:54:11,679
and around a key area and you need to
 

4609
01:54:11,679 --> 01:54:14,229
and around a key area and you need to
look for participants on volume profile

4610
01:54:14,229 --> 01:54:14,239
look for participants on volume profile
 

4611
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:16,870
look for participants on volume profile
or on bookmap whatever you're looking

4612
01:54:16,870 --> 01:54:16,880
or on bookmap whatever you're looking
 

4613
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:19,510
or on bookmap whatever you're looking
for to get stuck or even even like here

4614
01:54:19,510 --> 01:54:19,520
for to get stuck or even even like here
 

4615
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,990
for to get stuck or even even like here
right if we've been here long enough we

4616
01:54:21,990 --> 01:54:22,000
right if we've been here long enough we
 

4617
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,990
right if we've been here long enough we
couldn't break out we create this shelf

4618
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:24,000
couldn't break out we create this shelf
 

4619
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,830
couldn't break out we create this shelf
like I said like once we leave the shelf

4620
01:54:25,830 --> 01:54:25,840
like I said like once we leave the shelf
 

4621
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:27,270
like I said like once we leave the shelf
we're going to come to here all right if

4622
01:54:27,270 --> 01:54:27,280
we're going to come to here all right if
 

4623
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:28,950
we're going to come to here all right if
too many sellers come in at the low of

4624
01:54:28,950 --> 01:54:28,960
too many sellers come in at the low of
 

4625
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:30,229
too many sellers come in at the low of
the shelf and they reclaim the shelf

4626
01:54:30,229 --> 01:54:30,239
the shelf and they reclaim the shelf
 

4627
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:31,589
the shelf and they reclaim the shelf
then we're going to come back to here

4628
01:54:31,589 --> 01:54:31,599
then we're going to come back to here
 

4629
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:33,830
then we're going to come back to here
the easiest way to see that though for

4630
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:33,840
the easiest way to see that though for
 

4631
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:37,589
the easiest way to see that though for
me in my opinion would be

4632
01:54:37,589 --> 01:54:37,599
me in my opinion would be
 

4633
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:39,270
me in my opinion would be
I'm going have to change this on a uh

4634
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:39,280
I'm going have to change this on a uh
 

4635
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:44,229
I'm going have to change this on a uh
NQ.

4636
01:54:44,229 --> 01:54:44,239

 

4637
01:54:44,239 --> 01:54:58,149

All right. Would be in this.

4638
01:54:58,149 --> 01:54:58,159

 

4639
01:54:58,159 --> 01:54:59,910

And like I said, the buyers kept getting

4640
01:54:59,910 --> 01:54:59,920
And like I said, the buyers kept getting
 

4641
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:00,870
And like I said, the buyers kept getting
stuck here. Here's that little

4642
01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:00,880
stuck here. Here's that little
 

4643
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:03,910
stuck here. Here's that little
imbalance. Right. So in that last move,

4644
01:55:03,910 --> 01:55:03,920
imbalance. Right. So in that last move,
 

4645
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:06,070
imbalance. Right. So in that last move,
this is all market buy side and they got

4646
01:55:06,070 --> 01:55:06,080
this is all market buy side and they got
 

4647
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:08,310
this is all market buy side and they got
stuck and we flipped to sell. If we look

4648
01:55:08,310 --> 01:55:08,320
stuck and we flipped to sell. If we look
 

4649
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:12,149
stuck and we flipped to sell. If we look
at the highs up here, buyers had

4650
01:55:12,149 --> 01:55:12,159
at the highs up here, buyers had
 

4651
01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:15,990
at the highs up here, buyers had
numerous attempts to move higher

4652
01:55:15,990 --> 01:55:16,000
numerous attempts to move higher
 

4653
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,990
numerous attempts to move higher
and failed. And then we go big sell and

4654
01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:18,000
and failed. And then we go big sell and
 

4655
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,750
and failed. And then we go big sell and
this is where sellers came in. This why

4656
01:55:19,750 --> 01:55:19,760
this is where sellers came in. This why
 

4657
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:21,189
this is where sellers came in. This why
I'm saying buyers need to get back above

4658
01:55:21,189 --> 01:55:21,199
I'm saying buyers need to get back above
 

4659
01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:23,109
I'm saying buyers need to get back above
this otherwise they're caught, right?

4660
01:55:23,109 --> 01:55:23,119
this otherwise they're caught, right?
 

4661
01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:24,629
this otherwise they're caught, right?
And that's the easiest way to see it for

4662
01:55:24,629 --> 01:55:24,639
And that's the easiest way to see it for
 

4663
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:34,470
And that's the easiest way to see it for
in my opinion would be using orderflow.

4664
01:55:34,470 --> 01:55:34,480

 

4665
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:36,070

If we lose this, like I said, we can

4666
01:55:36,070 --> 01:55:36,080
If we lose this, like I said, we can
 

4667
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:37,270
If we lose this, like I said, we can
come straight back down to that New York

4668
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:37,280
come straight back down to that New York
 

4669
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:40,310
come straight back down to that New York
open and value area low on the day. And

4670
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:40,320
open and value area low on the day. And
 

4671
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:41,990
open and value area low on the day. And
if buyers can't defend that, then we can

4672
01:55:41,990 --> 01:55:42,000
if buyers can't defend that, then we can
 

4673
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,310
if buyers can't defend that, then we can
break.

4674
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:44,320
break.
 

4675
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:47,030
break.
ES looks very weak. Very, very weak.

4676
01:55:47,030 --> 01:55:47,040
ES looks very weak. Very, very weak.
 

4677
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:55,830
ES looks very weak. Very, very weak.
This feels like uh Friday now

4678
01:55:55,830 --> 01:55:55,840

 

4679
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:58,950

and yesterday. Same kind of thing.

4680
01:55:58,950 --> 01:55:58,960
and yesterday. Same kind of thing.
 

4681
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:24,149
and yesterday. Same kind of thing.
There we go.

4682
01:56:24,149 --> 01:56:24,159

 

4683
01:56:24,159 --> 01:56:26,070

And this kind of becomes gray now to be

4684
01:56:26,070 --> 01:56:26,080
And this kind of becomes gray now to be
 

4685
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:29,830
And this kind of becomes gray now to be
honest. That's your rotational zone.

4686
01:56:29,830 --> 01:56:29,840
honest. That's your rotational zone.
 

4687
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:33,189
honest. That's your rotational zone.
It's so thick.

4688
01:56:33,189 --> 01:56:33,199
It's so thick.
 

4689
01:56:33,199 --> 01:56:35,430
It's so thick.
I think it does, Richard. I don't I'm

4690
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:35,440
I think it does, Richard. I don't I'm
 

4691
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,350
I think it does, Richard. I don't I'm
not 100% sure, but yes, I think I think

4692
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:37,360
not 100% sure, but yes, I think I think
 

4693
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:39,270
not 100% sure, but yes, I think I think
that is the case that it will end today

4694
01:56:39,270 --> 01:56:39,280
that is the case that it will end today
 

4695
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:42,629
that is the case that it will end today
unless they extend it, you know,

4696
01:56:42,629 --> 01:56:42,639
unless they extend it, you know,
 

4697
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:44,950
unless they extend it, you know,
unless they extend it. Yeah, I think

4698
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:44,960
unless they extend it. Yeah, I think
 

4699
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:49,350
unless they extend it. Yeah, I think
that would be the case.

4700
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:49,360

 

4701
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:51,589

I don't know uh 100% but uh yeah, I

4702
01:56:51,589 --> 01:56:51,599
I don't know uh 100% but uh yeah, I
 

4703
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:53,109
I don't know uh 100% but uh yeah, I
think that that that is normally the

4704
01:56:53,109 --> 01:56:53,119
think that that that is normally the
 

4705
01:56:53,119 --> 01:56:55,430
think that that that is normally the
case with Apex. When the sale ends, the

4706
01:56:55,430 --> 01:56:55,440
case with Apex. When the sale ends, the
 

4707
01:56:55,440 --> 01:57:00,070
case with Apex. When the sale ends, the
activation fee ends.

4708
01:57:00,070 --> 01:57:00,080

 

4709
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:01,910

I don't know, random guy. Why does your

I don't know, random guy. Why does your
 

4711
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:03,910
I don't know, random guy. Why does your
one minute chart look different? I I

01:57:05,109 --> 01:57:05,119
don't know why your one minute chart
 

4715
01:57:05,119 --> 01:57:07,510
don't know why your one minute chart
looks different. Maybe you're looking at

01:57:07,510 --> 01:57:07,520
looks different. Maybe you're looking at
 

4717
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:08,950
looks different. Maybe you're looking at
a different instrument. Maybe you

01:57:08,950 --> 01:57:08,960
a different instrument. Maybe you
 

4719

a different instrument. Maybe you
haven't rolled over. Maybe I have no

4723
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:14,229

chart, so I can't tell the answer to

01:57:14,229 --> 01:57:14,239
chart, so I can't tell the answer to
 

4725

just looks very messy this market
 

4791
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:21,589
just looks very messy this market
to my eyes anyway. I don't look look at

Quite the opposite. This morning I

back into these lows where buyers have

01:59:43,750 --> 01:59:43,760
back into these lows where buyers have
 

4809
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:44,950
back into these lows where buyers have
stepped up. You got to think at some

4810
01:59:44,950 --> 01:59:44,960
stepped up. You got to think at some
 

4811
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:45,910
stepped up. You got to think at some
point they're not going to be able to

4812
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:45,920
point they're not going to be able to
 

4813
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,830
point they're not going to be able to
step up. We're seeing so much momentum

4814
01:59:47,830 --> 01:59:47,840
step up. We're seeing so much momentum
 

4815
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:50,550
step up. We're seeing so much momentum
here. Spy getting very aggressive now.

4816
01:59:50,550 --> 01:59:50,560
here. Spy getting very aggressive now.

So, is NQ going to follow suit

4818
01:59:53,589 --> 01:59:53,599
So, is NQ going to follow suit
 

4819
01:59:53,599 --> 01:59:56,229
So, is NQ going to follow suit
and take out the lows, IBOWs, or are we

4820
01:59:56,229 --> 01:59:56,239
and take out the lows, IBOWs, or are we
 

4821
01:59:56,239 --> 01:59:57,510
and take out the lows, IBOWs, or are we
just going to find bids off this same

4822
01:59:57,510 --> 01:59:57,520
just going to find bids off this same
 

4823
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:59,589
just going to find bids off this same
area? The momentum is very heavy. Like,

4824
01:59:59,589 --> 01:59:59,599
area? The momentum is very heavy. Like,
 

4825
01:59:59,599 --> 02:00:01,030
area? The momentum is very heavy. Like,
I would not be brave enough to be a

4826
02:00:01,030 --> 02:00:01,040
I would not be brave enough to be a
 

4827
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:04,550
I would not be brave enough to be a
buyer now. Let's put it that way.

4828
02:00:04,550 --> 02:00:04,560
buyer now. Let's put it that way.
 

4829
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,229
buyer now. Let's put it that way.
Right, we've just rejected value area

4830
02:00:06,229 --> 02:00:06,239
Right, we've just rejected value area
 

4831
02:00:06,239 --> 02:00:08,149
Right, we've just rejected value area
low again. So, we're outside previous

4832
02:00:08,149 --> 02:00:08,159
low again. So, we're outside previous
 

4833
02:00:08,159 --> 02:00:10,229
low again. So, we're outside previous
day value. We're inside current value.

4834
02:00:10,229 --> 02:00:10,239
day value. We're inside current value.
 

4835
02:00:10,239 --> 02:00:13,350
day value. We're inside current value.
But if we reject here, then you would

4836
02:00:13,350 --> 02:00:13,360
But if we reject here, then you would
 

4837
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:14,709
But if we reject here, then you would
expect them to try and complete the

4838
02:00:14,709 --> 02:00:14,719
expect them to try and complete the
 

4839
02:00:14,719 --> 02:00:16,709
expect them to try and complete the
rotation. The only thing is we have

4840
02:00:16,709 --> 02:00:16,719
rotation. The only thing is we have
 

4841
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:18,390
rotation. The only thing is we have
tested this naked point of control in

4842
02:00:18,390 --> 02:00:18,400
tested this naked point of control in
 

4843
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:22,229
tested this naked point of control in
the New York session and found a bid.

4844
02:00:22,229 --> 02:00:22,239
the New York session and found a bid.
 

4845
02:00:22,239 --> 02:00:24,709
the New York session and found a bid.
So, it's hard for me to be too biased

4846
02:00:24,709 --> 02:00:24,719
So, it's hard for me to be too biased
 

4847
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:35,030
So, it's hard for me to be too biased
directionally right now, I'd say.

4848
02:00:35,030 --> 02:00:35,040

 

4849
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:36,870

What's the difference of volume profile

4850
02:00:36,870 --> 02:00:36,880
What's the difference of volume profile
 

4851
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:39,510
What's the difference of volume profile
of session and day?

4852
02:00:39,510 --> 02:00:39,520
of session and day?
 

4853
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:40,950
of session and day?
Well, session would be the session

4854
02:00:40,950 --> 02:00:40,960
Well, session would be the session
 

4855
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:42,550
Well, session would be the session
you're looking at. Day would be the

4856
02:00:42,550 --> 02:00:42,560
you're looking at. Day would be the
 

4857
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:47,669
you're looking at. Day would be the
whole thing.

4858
02:00:47,669 --> 02:00:47,679

 

4859
02:00:47,679 --> 02:00:50,070

Correct, Max. I agree. Absolutely agree

4860
02:00:50,070 --> 02:00:50,080
Correct, Max. I agree. Absolutely agree
 

4861
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:53,910
Correct, Max. I agree. Absolutely agree
with you.

4862
02:00:53,910 --> 02:00:53,920

 

4863
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:55,270

Absolutely agree with you. All right.

4864
02:00:55,270 --> 02:00:55,280
Absolutely agree with you. All right.
 

4865
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:56,950
Absolutely agree with you. All right.
So, buyers are trying to defend the same

4866
02:00:56,950 --> 02:00:56,960
So, buyers are trying to defend the same
 

4867
02:00:56,960 --> 02:00:58,310
So, buyers are trying to defend the same
level. I don't think they're going to

4868
02:00:58,310 --> 02:00:58,320
level. I don't think they're going to
 

4869
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:00,470
level. I don't think they're going to
have too much success down here. They've

4870
02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:00,480
have too much success down here. They've
 

4871
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:03,910
have too much success down here. They've
had many, many attempts. It's possible

4872
02:01:03,910 --> 02:01:03,920
had many, many attempts. It's possible
 

4873
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:05,830
had many, many attempts. It's possible
because we're in a rotation that they do

4874
02:01:05,830 --> 02:01:05,840
because we're in a rotation that they do
 

4875
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:10,070
because we're in a rotation that they do
it, but uh it's kind of

4876
02:01:10,070 --> 02:01:10,080
it, but uh it's kind of
 

4877
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:13,589
it, but uh it's kind of
gh kind of day. You got to have balls of

4878
02:01:13,589 --> 02:01:13,599
gh kind of day. You got to have balls of
 

4879
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:15,109
gh kind of day. You got to have balls of
steel if you're going to defend this

4880
02:01:15,109 --> 02:01:15,119
steel if you're going to defend this
 

4881
02:01:15,119 --> 02:01:16,950
steel if you're going to defend this
three, four times over is all I would

4882
02:01:16,950 --> 02:01:16,960
three, four times over is all I would
 

4883
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:21,990
three, four times over is all I would
say right now. Balls of absolute steel.

4884
02:01:21,990 --> 02:01:22,000

 

4885
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,550

Vo up at VWAP. So, probably back tested

4886
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:24,560
Vo up at VWAP. So, probably back tested
 

4887
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:26,390
Vo up at VWAP. So, probably back tested
this gray box again where I said you

4888
02:01:26,390 --> 02:01:26,400
this gray box again where I said you
 

4889
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:28,070
this gray box again where I said you
probably don't want to trade around

4890
02:01:28,070 --> 02:01:28,080
probably don't want to trade around
 

4891
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:30,390
probably don't want to trade around
here. So sellers right now failed to

4892
02:01:30,390 --> 02:01:30,400
here. So sellers right now failed to
 

4893
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:32,950
here. So sellers right now failed to
break down, but this can be a lower high

4894
02:01:32,950 --> 02:01:32,960
break down, but this can be a lower high
 

4895
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:35,669
break down, but this can be a lower high
if they defend this big if. How long we

4896
02:01:35,669 --> 02:01:35,679
if they defend this big if. How long we
 

4897
02:01:35,679 --> 02:01:38,070
if they defend this big if. How long we
got left? 40 minutes. These are not

4898
02:01:38,070 --> 02:01:38,080
got left? 40 minutes. These are not
 

4899
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:40,310
got left? 40 minutes. These are not
trades I'm going to take. Sellers will

4900
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:40,320
trades I'm going to take. Sellers will
 

4901
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:43,109
trades I'm going to take. Sellers will
want this. Buyers will want this. Right,

4902
02:01:43,109 --> 02:01:43,119
want this. Buyers will want this. Right,
 

4903
02:01:43,119 --> 02:01:44,470
want this. Buyers will want this. Right,
that's the level. Sellers will want to

4904
02:01:44,470 --> 02:01:44,480
that's the level. Sellers will want to
 

4905
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:46,070
that's the level. Sellers will want to
defend into that. Buyers will want to

4906
02:01:46,070 --> 02:01:46,080
defend into that. Buyers will want to
 

4907
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:48,070
defend into that. Buyers will want to
reclaim it and go squeeze. And the VIX

4908
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:48,080
reclaim it and go squeeze. And the VIX
 

4909
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:50,709
reclaim it and go squeeze. And the VIX
is the VIX does not know what the [\h__\h]

4910
02:01:50,709 --> 02:01:50,719
is the VIX does not know what the [\h__\h]
 

4911
02:01:50,719 --> 02:01:52,390
is the VIX does not know what the [\h__\h]
it is doing right now. It looks

4912
02:01:52,390 --> 02:01:52,400
it is doing right now. It looks
 

4913
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:54,310
it is doing right now. It looks
terrible,

4914
02:01:54,310 --> 02:01:54,320
terrible,
 

4915
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:57,750
terrible,
which is common for rollover week. very

4916
02:01:57,750 --> 02:01:57,760
which is common for rollover week. very
 

4917
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:07,350
which is common for rollover week. very
common for rollover week.

4918
02:02:07,350 --> 02:02:07,360

 

4919
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:09,510

So, last lot of sellers came in, I'd say

4920
02:02:09,510 --> 02:02:09,520
So, last lot of sellers came in, I'd say
 

4921
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:11,830
So, last lot of sellers came in, I'd say
from 64 to 73, which is where we're

4922
02:02:11,830 --> 02:02:11,840
from 64 to 73, which is where we're
 

4923
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:14,310
from 64 to 73, which is where we're
coming up to now. So, they bid off that

4924
02:02:14,310 --> 02:02:14,320
coming up to now. So, they bid off that
 

4925
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:16,629
coming up to now. So, they bid off that
green box again and now we go gray box

4926
02:02:16,629 --> 02:02:16,639
green box again and now we go gray box
 

4927
02:02:16,639 --> 02:02:17,830
green box again and now we go gray box
again. Like we talked about the

4928
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:17,840
again. Like we talked about the
 

4929
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:19,830
again. Like we talked about the
rotations. This is the next rotation.

4930
02:02:19,830 --> 02:02:19,840
rotations. This is the next rotation.
 

4931
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:21,910
rotations. This is the next rotation.
So, we're doing the rotation. Now you

4932
02:02:21,910 --> 02:02:21,920
So, we're doing the rotation. Now you
 

4933
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:23,350
So, we're doing the rotation. Now you
have to see does the sellers defend the

4934
02:02:23,350 --> 02:02:23,360
have to see does the sellers defend the
 

4935
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:26,229
have to see does the sellers defend the
rotation or are they exhausted now and

4936
02:02:26,229 --> 02:02:26,239
rotation or are they exhausted now and
 

4937
02:02:26,239 --> 02:02:27,990
rotation or are they exhausted now and
thinking, "Oh my god, we've had so many

4938
02:02:27,990 --> 02:02:28,000
thinking, "Oh my god, we've had so many
 

4939
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,669
thinking, "Oh my god, we've had so many
attempts to go lower. Why have we not

4940
02:02:29,669 --> 02:02:29,679
attempts to go lower. Why have we not
 

4941
02:02:29,679 --> 02:02:31,589
attempts to go lower. Why have we not
gone lower?" I don't I don't know what

4942
02:02:31,589 --> 02:02:31,599
gone lower?" I don't I don't know what
 

4943
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:32,790
gone lower?" I don't I don't know what
they're going to do because we're in a

4944
02:02:32,790 --> 02:02:32,800
they're going to do because we're in a
 

4945
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:34,390
they're going to do because we're in a
rotation. Literally anything is possible

4946
02:02:34,390 --> 02:02:34,400
rotation. Literally anything is possible
 

4947
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:36,470
rotation. Literally anything is possible
in a rotation. Sellers should try and

4948
02:02:36,470 --> 02:02:36,480
in a rotation. Sellers should try and
 

4949
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:38,709
in a rotation. Sellers should try and
defend to like force this market lower

4950
02:02:38,709 --> 02:02:38,719
defend to like force this market lower
 

4951
02:02:38,719 --> 02:02:40,709
defend to like force this market lower
at this point, but they've done a pretty

4952
02:02:40,709 --> 02:02:40,719
at this point, but they've done a pretty
 

4953
02:02:40,719 --> 02:02:43,589
at this point, but they've done a pretty
[\h__\h] job of it this morning so far, I

4954
02:02:43,589 --> 02:02:43,599
[\h__\h] job of it this morning so far, I
 

4955
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:46,310
[\h__\h] job of it this morning so far, I
would say, which is uh not surprising.

4956
02:02:46,310 --> 02:02:46,320
would say, which is uh not surprising.
 

4957
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:49,430
would say, which is uh not surprising.
And like I said, VIX is literally in no

4958
02:02:49,430 --> 02:02:49,440
And like I said, VIX is literally in no
 

4959
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:51,669
And like I said, VIX is literally in no
man's land.

4960
02:02:51,669 --> 02:02:51,679
man's land.
 

4961
02:02:51,679 --> 02:02:53,669
man's land.
because it can't break down under PDC

4962
02:02:53,669 --> 02:02:53,679
because it can't break down under PDC
 

4963
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:55,830
because it can't break down under PDC
and it can't break out under over PDH.

4964
02:02:55,830 --> 02:02:55,840
and it can't break out under over PDH.
 

4965
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:57,910
and it can't break out under over PDH.
So, it's just stuck right in the middle

4966
02:02:57,910 --> 02:02:57,920
So, it's just stuck right in the middle
 

4967
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:03,990
So, it's just stuck right in the middle
of its range right now. The VIX,

4968
02:03:03,990 --> 02:03:04,000

 

4969
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,229

come on sellers. So, maybe they defend

4970
02:03:06,229 --> 02:03:06,239
come on sellers. So, maybe they defend
 

4971
02:03:06,239 --> 02:03:13,750
come on sellers. So, maybe they defend
this now.

4972
02:03:13,750 --> 02:03:13,760

 

4973
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:15,750

When I look at weeklys, I I just do the

4974
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:15,760
When I look at weeklys, I I just do the
 

4975
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:18,229
When I look at weeklys, I I just do the
whole thing. When I look at weeklys,

4976
02:03:18,229 --> 02:03:18,239
whole thing. When I look at weeklys,
 

4977
02:03:18,239 --> 02:03:20,870
whole thing. When I look at weeklys,
when I look at previous day, it's RTH.

4978
02:03:20,870 --> 02:03:20,880
when I look at previous day, it's RTH.
 

4979
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:22,629
when I look at previous day, it's RTH.
When I do weeklys, I just draw the whole

4980
02:03:22,629 --> 02:03:22,639
When I do weeklys, I just draw the whole
 

4981
02:03:22,639 --> 02:03:24,950
When I do weeklys, I just draw the whole
thing because it's it's so much data

4982
02:03:24,950 --> 02:03:24,960
thing because it's it's so much data
 

4983
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:26,310
thing because it's it's so much data
that it's not going to make a difference

4984
02:03:26,310 --> 02:03:26,320
that it's not going to make a difference
 

4985
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:27,990
that it's not going to make a difference
if there's like a little bit of GloEx in

4986
02:03:27,990 --> 02:03:28,000
if there's like a little bit of GloEx in
 

4987
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:35,430
if there's like a little bit of GloEx in
there in my opinion.

4988
02:03:35,430 --> 02:03:35,440

 

4989
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:39,109

All right. Well, here's the rotation for

4990
02:03:39,109 --> 02:03:39,119
All right. Well, here's the rotation for
 

4991
02:03:39,119 --> 02:03:41,270
All right. Well, here's the rotation for
this phase of this market, right? So,

4992
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:41,280
this phase of this market, right? So,
 

4993
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:43,109
this phase of this market, right? So,
this is the rotation. Once they make

4994
02:03:43,109 --> 02:03:43,119
this is the rotation. Once they make
 

4995
02:03:43,119 --> 02:03:50,229
this is the rotation. Once they make
their mind up, someone should win.

4996
02:03:50,229 --> 02:03:50,239

 

4997
02:03:50,239 --> 02:03:52,310

Can I use the bathroom while you guys

4998
02:03:52,310 --> 02:03:52,320
Can I use the bathroom while you guys
 

4999
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:56,709
Can I use the bathroom while you guys
watch this? I'll be back. I would uh

5000
02:03:56,709 --> 02:03:56,719
watch this? I'll be back. I would uh
 

5001
02:03:56,719 --> 02:03:58,310
watch this? I'll be back. I would uh
look, my opinion on this, I would lean

5002
02:03:58,310 --> 02:03:58,320
look, my opinion on this, I would lean
 

5003
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:01,270
look, my opinion on this, I would lean
short on it right now because

5004
02:04:01,270 --> 02:04:01,280
short on it right now because
 

5005
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:03,910
short on it right now because
if I had to pick a bias, we've defended

5006
02:04:03,910 --> 02:04:03,920
if I had to pick a bias, we've defended
 

5007
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:06,470
if I had to pick a bias, we've defended
that. We're defending this. We should

5008
02:04:06,470 --> 02:04:06,480
that. We're defending this. We should
 

5009
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:08,709
that. We're defending this. We should
break down. But this level here is a

5010
02:04:08,709 --> 02:04:08,719
break down. But this level here is a
 

5011
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:10,149
break down. But this level here is a
cover point. Not just because of this.

5012
02:04:10,149 --> 02:04:10,159
cover point. Not just because of this.
 

5013
02:04:10,159 --> 02:04:12,070
cover point. Not just because of this.
It's because it's the old naked level,

5014
02:04:12,070 --> 02:04:12,080
It's because it's the old naked level,
 

5015
02:04:12,080 --> 02:04:14,070
It's because it's the old naked level,
right? And below that, if you get lucky,

5016
02:04:14,070 --> 02:04:14,080
right? And below that, if you get lucky,
 

5017
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:16,550
right? And below that, if you get lucky,
you get GloEx. That would be my opinion.

5018
02:04:16,550 --> 02:04:16,560
you get GloEx. That would be my opinion.
 

5019
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:18,390
you get GloEx. That would be my opinion.
But right now, so far today, they've

5020
02:04:18,390 --> 02:04:18,400
But right now, so far today, they've
 

5021
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:20,870
But right now, so far today, they've
done a pretty pretty [\h__\h] awful job

5022
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:20,880
done a pretty pretty [\h__\h] awful job
 

5023
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:23,430
done a pretty pretty [\h__\h] awful job
in um doing that move, enforcing that

5024
02:04:23,430 --> 02:04:23,440
in um doing that move, enforcing that
 

5025
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:25,589
in um doing that move, enforcing that
move. But that's what I'd be looking for

5026
02:04:25,589 --> 02:04:25,599
move. But that's what I'd be looking for
 

5027
02:04:25,599 --> 02:04:29,270
move. But that's what I'd be looking for
is can they break down underneath into

5028
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:29,280
is can they break down underneath into
 

5029
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:33,510
is can they break down underneath into
that sort of uh red line.

5030
02:04:33,510 --> 02:04:33,520
that sort of uh red line.
 

5031
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:34,629
that sort of uh red line.
That's what I'd be looking for

5032
02:04:34,629 --> 02:04:34,639
That's what I'd be looking for
 

5033
02:04:34,639 --> 02:04:36,246
That's what I'd be looking for
personally.

5034
02:04:36,246 --> 02:04:36,256
personally.
 

5035
02:04:36,256 --> 02:05:17,350
personally.

02:06:27,910 --> 02:06:27,920
Hate it when it does this. They're
 

5085

5086
02:06:29,990 --> 02:06:30,000
looking to defend this. They need to get
 

5087
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,750
looking to defend this. They need to get
under New York and then they're going to

5088
02:06:31,750 --> 02:06:31,760
under New York and then they're going to
 

5089
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:34,069
under New York and then they're going to
look to swipe these guys out. That's

5090
02:06:34,069 --> 02:06:34,079
look to swipe these guys out. That's
 

5091
02:06:34,079 --> 02:06:35,430
look to swipe these guys out. That's
what they're looking to do. Whether they

5092
02:06:35,430 --> 02:06:35,440
what they're looking to do. Whether they
 

5093
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:36,950
what they're looking to do. Whether they
can do it or not is another thing

5094
02:06:36,950 --> 02:06:36,960
can do it or not is another thing
 

5095
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:39,030
can do it or not is another thing
because this is the edge of value. So

5096
02:06:39,030 --> 02:06:39,040
because this is the edge of value. So
 

5097
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:40,709
because this is the edge of value. So
value buyers keep trying to bid off

5098
02:06:40,709 --> 02:06:40,719
value buyers keep trying to bid off
 

5099
02:06:40,719 --> 02:06:43,750
value buyers keep trying to bid off
this. But like I said, I would stay with

5100
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:43,760
this. But like I said, I would stay with
 

5101
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:45,350
this. But like I said, I would stay with
the shorts at the moment because we've

5102
02:06:45,350 --> 02:06:45,360
the shorts at the moment because we've
 

5103
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:46,870
the shorts at the moment because we've
started to lose control of some key

5104
02:06:46,870 --> 02:06:46,880
started to lose control of some key
 

5105
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:59,189
started to lose control of some key
levels.

5106
02:06:59,189 --> 02:06:59,199

 

5107
02:06:59,199 --> 02:07:01,910

Can they sell it?

5108
02:07:01,910 --> 02:07:01,920
Can they sell it?
 

5109
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:03,270
Can they sell it?

5112
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:05,840
got to watch uh spy into this low day.
 

5113
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:07,830
got to watch uh spy into this low day.
Can see expansion. How long we got left

5114
02:07:07,830 --> 02:07:07,840
Can see expansion. How long we got left
 

5115
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:09,669
Can see expansion. How long we got left
or lunch? Not got too long left either.

5116
02:07:09,669 --> 02:07:09,679

5117
02:07:09,679 --> 02:07:13,350

35 minutes. Value still holding up.

5118
02:07:13,350 --> 02:07:13,360
35 minutes. Value still holding up.
 

5119
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:15,030
35 minutes. Value still holding up.
Still holding up. Buyers still coming in

5120
02:07:15,030 --> 02:07:15,040
Still holding up. Buyers still coming in
 

5121
02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:16,709
Still holding up. Buyers still coming in
here. Sellers just want one snap. I

5122
02:07:16,709 --> 02:07:16,719
here. Sellers just want one snap. I
 

5123
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:18,310
here. Sellers just want one snap. I
think once sellers get one good snap,

5124
02:07:18,310 --> 02:07:18,320
think once sellers get one good snap,
 

5125
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:19,669
think once sellers get one good snap,
they can get out of their positions and

5126
02:07:19,669 --> 02:07:19,679
they can get out of their positions and
 

5127
02:07:19,679 --> 02:07:25,990
they can get out of their positions and
they'll be happy for the day.

5128
02:07:25,990 --> 02:07:26,000

 

5129
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,510

Yeah, I think it's good that they've

5130
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:27,520
Yeah, I think it's good that they've
 

5131
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:29,189
Yeah, I think it's good that they've
done that, Otus. Like it means people

5132
02:07:29,189 --> 02:07:29,199
done that, Otus. Like it means people
 

5133
02:07:29,199 --> 02:07:31,589
done that, Otus. Like it means people
don't have to force, you know, when they

5134
02:07:31,589 --> 02:07:31,599
don't have to force, you know, when they
 

5135
02:07:31,599 --> 02:07:33,510
don't have to force, you know, when they
when they say it ends today probably

5136
02:07:33,510 --> 02:07:33,520
when they say it ends today probably
 

5137
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:35,109
when they say it ends today probably
makes you force trades a bit more. So,

5138
02:07:35,109 --> 02:07:35,119
makes you force trades a bit more. So,
 

5139
02:07:35,119 --> 02:07:36,390
makes you force trades a bit more. So,
now that they've extended it, I think

5140
02:07:36,390 --> 02:07:36,400
now that they've extended it, I think
 

5141
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:38,149
now that they've extended it, I think
that's really good. Gives you a bit more

5142
02:07:38,149 --> 02:07:38,159
that's really good. Gives you a bit more
 

5143
02:07:38,159 --> 02:07:41,030
that's really good. Gives you a bit more
time to do it. Okay, testing this level

5144
02:07:41,030 --> 02:07:41,040
time to do it. Okay, testing this level
 

5145
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:42,470
time to do it. Okay, testing this level

02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:59,350
for 215s on the tape. Still seeing
absorption here.

5160
02:07:59,350 --> 02:07:59,360

 

5161
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:04,390

Still seeing absorption here

5162
02:08:04,390 --> 02:08:04,400

 

5163
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:07,030

into 230 225. Once this guy moves, you

5164
02:08:07,030 --> 02:08:07,040
into 230 225. Once this guy moves, you
 

5165
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:09,030
into 230 225. Once this guy moves, you
get 215s, but he's still absorbing and

5166
02:08:09,030 --> 02:08:09,040
get 215s, but he's still absorbing and
 

5167
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:11,109
get 215s, but he's still absorbing and
he's trying to walk up. Once he moves,

5168
02:08:11,109 --> 02:08:11,119
he's trying to walk up. Once he moves,
 

5169
02:08:11,119 --> 02:08:12,790
he's trying to walk up. Once he moves,
he might get a wash, but he's not

5170
02:08:12,790 --> 02:08:12,800
he might get a wash, but he's not
 

5171
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:17,350
he might get a wash, but he's not
willing to move right now.

5172
02:08:17,350 --> 02:08:17,360

 

5173
02:08:17,360 --> 02:08:18,870

Soaking the bid here. He is really

5174
02:08:18,870 --> 02:08:18,880
Soaking the bid here. He is really
 

5175
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:22,790
Soaking the bid here. He is really
soaking the bid here.

5176
02:08:22,790 --> 02:08:22,800

 

5177
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:26,229

And he's walking up with it now.

5178
02:08:26,229 --> 02:08:26,239
And he's walking up with it now.
 

5179
02:08:26,239 --> 02:08:28,790
And he's walking up with it now.
So, I think 230 225. That's his pain

5180
02:08:28,790 --> 02:08:28,800
So, I think 230 225. That's his pain
 

5181
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:31,189
So, I think 230 225. That's his pain
point.

5182
02:08:31,189 --> 02:08:31,199
point.
 

5183
02:08:31,199 --> 02:08:33,510
point.
He's flashing 225 now. He's he's lifted

5184
02:08:33,510 --> 02:08:33,520
He's flashing 225 now. He's he's lifted
 

5185
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:35,189
He's flashing 225 now. He's he's lifted
and moved. Let's see if we drop under

5186
02:08:35,189 --> 02:08:35,199
and moved. Let's see if we drop under
 

5187
02:08:35,199 --> 02:08:37,510
and moved. Let's see if we drop under
him. No, he's trapped and soaked. God,

02:08:37,510 --> 02:08:37,520
him. No, he's trapped and soaked. God,
 

5189
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:39,030

he's playing some games here. Why so

5190
02:08:39,030 --> 02:08:39,040
he's playing some games here. Why so
 

5191
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:41,270
he's playing some games here. Why so
many games at this level in the New York

5192
02:08:41,270 --> 02:08:41,280
many games at this level in the New York
 

5193
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:53,430
many games at this level in the New York
Open?

5194
02:08:53,430 --> 02:08:53,440

 

5195
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:55,830

5199
02:08:58,560 --> 02:08:59,910
limits. Pulled it. He just pulled it.
Does he come in and soak like he did

5200
02:08:59,910 --> 02:08:59,920
Does he come in and soak like he did
 

5201
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:01,589
Does he come in and soak like he did
last time and trap? Yeah, he's trying

02:09:01,589 --> 02:09:01,599
last time and trap? Yeah, he's trying
 

5203
02:09:01,599 --> 02:09:04,390
last time and trap? Yeah, he's trying

5204
02:09:04,390 --> 02:09:04,400
the same move again.
 

5205
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:07,430
the same move again.
What are you doing, buddy?

5206
02:09:07,430 --> 02:09:07,440
What are you doing, buddy?
 

5207
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:10,870
What are you doing, buddy?
Now he's gone back on the tape at 30s.

5208
02:09:10,870 --> 02:09:10,880
Now he's gone back on the tape at 30s.
 

5209
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:12,310
Now he's gone back on the tape at 30s.
Does he pull it? Now he's pulled it.

5210
02:09:12,310 --> 02:09:12,320
Does he pull it? Now he's pulled it.
 

5211
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:13,750
Does he pull it? Now he's pulled it.
There we go. Now we're washing through

5212
02:09:13,750 --> 02:09:13,760
There we go. Now we're washing through
 

5213
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:15,430
There we go. Now we're washing through
probably to these 15s now, like we

5214
02:09:15,430 --> 02:09:15,440
probably to these 15s now, like we
 

5215
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:17,830
probably to these 15s now, like we
talked about. Here we go. So, coming to

5216
02:09:17,830 --> 02:09:17,840
talked about. Here we go. So, coming to
 

5217
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:23,030
talked about. Here we go. So, coming to
15s and then 200s.

5218
02:09:23,030 --> 02:09:23,040

 

5219
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:25,030

Weird dude that buyer the way he was

5220
02:09:25,030 --> 02:09:25,040
Weird dude that buyer the way he was
 

5221
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:30,550
Weird dude that buyer the way he was
acting there. Bit weird. Weird.

5222
02:09:30,550 --> 02:09:30,560

 

5223
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:31,910

So you need to defend that level. We

5224
02:09:31,910 --> 02:09:31,920
So you need to defend that level. We
 

5225
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:34,790
So you need to defend that level. We
just broke down from 30s. That's where

5226
02:09:34,790 --> 02:09:34,800
just broke down from 30s. That's where
 

5227
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:36,229
just broke down from 30s. That's where
he was absorbing. If they reclaim all

5228
02:09:36,229 --> 02:09:36,239
he was absorbing. If they reclaim all
 

5229
02:09:36,239 --> 02:09:38,310
he was absorbing. If they reclaim all
the 30s, he just gets back in the money.

5230
02:09:38,310 --> 02:09:38,320
the 30s, he just gets back in the money.
 

5231
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:39,830
the 30s, he just gets back in the money.
So he's back in the money at the moment

5232
02:09:39,830 --> 02:09:39,840
So he's back in the money at the moment
 

5233
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:44,870
So he's back in the money at the moment
for now.

5234
02:09:44,870 --> 02:09:44,880

 

5235
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:46,310

And he stepped back on the book above

5236
02:09:46,310 --> 02:09:46,320
And he stepped back on the book above
 

5237
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:48,470
And he stepped back on the book above
20s now. So he's lifted he's moved his

5238
02:09:48,470 --> 02:09:48,480
20s now. So he's lifted he's moved his
 

5239
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:52,629
20s now. So he's lifted he's moved his
his bid from 15s to 22s.

5240
02:09:52,629 --> 02:09:52,639
his bid from 15s to 22s.
 

5241
02:09:52,639 --> 02:09:54,069
his bid from 15s to 22s.
Mate, what are you doing? You are

5242
02:09:54,069 --> 02:09:54,079
Mate, what are you doing? You are
 

5243
02:09:54,079 --> 02:09:55,750
Mate, what are you doing? You are
playing games. You are playing games.

5244
02:09:55,750 --> 02:09:55,760
playing games. You are playing games.
 

5245
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:57,669
playing games. You are playing games.
Now he's at 20s. 150 lot. He's trying to

5246
02:09:57,669 --> 02:09:57,679
Now he's at 20s. 150 lot. He's trying to
 

5247
02:09:57,679 --> 02:09:59,990
Now he's at 20s. 150 lot. He's trying to
absorb 20s. If they snap this, you're

5248
02:09:59,990 --> 02:10:00,000
absorb 20s. If they snap this, you're
 

5249
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,589
absorb 20s. If they snap this, you're
going to go 200s, I think, cuz he's

5250
02:10:01,589 --> 02:10:01,599
going to go 200s, I think, cuz he's
 

5251
02:10:01,599 --> 02:10:07,589
going to go 200s, I think, cuz he's
moved from 215s.

5252
02:10:07,589 --> 02:10:07,599

 

5253
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:11,430

There you go. There's the break of it.

5254
02:10:11,430 --> 02:10:11,440
There you go. There's the break of it.
 

5255
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:13,030
There you go. There's the break of it.
There's the break of it. Now, can you

5256
02:10:13,030 --> 02:10:13,040
There's the break of it. Now, can you
 

5257
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:14,870
There's the break of it. Now, can you
see follow through? Because you had a

5258
02:10:14,870 --> 02:10:14,880
see follow through? Because you had a
 

5259
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:17,270
see follow through? Because you had a
big seller there at 220s, 150 lot. He

5260
02:10:17,270 --> 02:10:17,280
big seller there at 220s, 150 lot. He
 

5261
02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:19,030
big seller there at 220s, 150 lot. He
might get caught there at 220s. Like I

5262
02:10:19,030 --> 02:10:19,040
might get caught there at 220s. Like I
 

5263
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:20,149
might get caught there at 220s. Like I
said, he paired off. You can see him

5264
02:10:20,149 --> 02:10:20,159
said, he paired off. You can see him
 

5265
02:10:20,159 --> 02:10:23,270
said, he paired off. You can see him
there. 205 lot at 220s

5266
02:10:23,270 --> 02:10:23,280
there. 205 lot at 220s
 

5267
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:25,669
there. 205 lot at 220s
just got absorbed.

5268
02:10:25,669 --> 02:10:25,679
just got absorbed.
 

5269
02:10:25,679 --> 02:10:27,189
just got absorbed.
And if we go back upside then we're

5270
02:10:27,189 --> 02:10:27,199
And if we go back upside then we're
 

5271
02:10:27,199 --> 02:10:28,790
And if we go back upside then we're
going to go gray box or at least we're

5272
02:10:28,790 --> 02:10:28,800
going to go gray box or at least we're
 

5273
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:30,950
going to go gray box or at least we're
going to go 243s and then maybe gray

5274
02:10:30,950 --> 02:10:30,960
going to go 243s and then maybe gray
 

5275
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:33,990
going to go 243s and then maybe gray
box.

5276
02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:34,000

 

5277
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,790

He tried to sell through and he didn't

He tried to sell through and he didn't
 

5309

Once they use this,
it's possible that we can see expansion

it's possible that we can see expansion
 

5383
02:13:12,400 --> 02:13:14,069
it's possible that we can see expansion
if they are able to use it. Right now,

5384
02:13:14,069 --> 02:13:14,079
if they are able to use it. Right now,
 

5385
02:13:14,079 --> 02:13:20,790
if they are able to use it. Right now,
they've done not a very good job.

5386
02:13:20,790 --> 02:13:20,800

 

5387
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:22,870

If I'm mainly looking at hourly and

If I'm mainly looking at hourly and
 

5389
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:24,629
If I'm mainly looking at hourly and
daily time frames, what would the best

5390
02:13:24,629 --> 02:13:24,639
daily time frames, what would the best
 

5391
02:13:24,639 --> 02:13:27,030

areas to set up
 

5393
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:29,669
areas to set up
to set up profiles? I would say uh go to

5394
02:13:29,669 --> 02:13:29,679
to set up profiles? I would say uh go to
 

5395
02:13:29,679 --> 02:13:31,270
to set up profiles? I would say uh go to
a 30 minute if you're going to set up

5396
02:13:31,270 --> 02:13:31,280
a 30 minute if you're going to set up
 

5397
02:13:31,280 --> 02:13:32,790
a 30 minute if you're going to set up
profiles.

5398
02:13:32,790 --> 02:13:32,800
profiles.
 

5399
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:34,709
profiles.
You're going to use daily and hourly.

5400
02:13:34,709 --> 02:13:34,719
You're going to use daily and hourly.
 

5401
02:13:34,719 --> 02:13:38,069
You're going to use daily and hourly.
You want 30 minute profiles because you

5402
02:13:38,069 --> 02:13:38,079
You want 30 minute profiles because you
 

5403
02:13:38,079 --> 02:13:40,310
You want 30 minute profiles because you
my opinion is you want where the where

5404
02:13:40,310 --> 02:13:40,320
my opinion is you want where the where
 

5405
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:41,589
my opinion is you want where the where
the volume comes in. Where does the

5406
02:13:41,589 --> 02:13:41,599
the volume comes in. Where does the
 

5407
02:13:41,599 --> 02:13:44,390
the volume comes in. Where does the
volume come in? 9:30 open. So what I'm

5408
02:13:44,390 --> 02:13:44,400
volume come in? 9:30 open. So what I'm
 

5409
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:47,109
volume come in? 9:30 open. So what I'm
always interested in is 9:30 to 4:00.

5410
02:13:47,109 --> 02:13:47,119
always interested in is 9:30 to 4:00.
 

5411
02:13:47,119 --> 02:13:49,030
always interested in is 9:30 to 4:00.
9:30 to 4:00 is where the volume is. So

5412
02:13:49,030 --> 02:13:49,040
9:30 to 4:00 is where the volume is. So
 

5413
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:50,470
9:30 to 4:00 is where the volume is. So
that's what I'm interested in. If you if

5414
02:13:50,470 --> 02:13:50,480
that's what I'm interested in. If you if
 

5415
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:52,149
that's what I'm interested in. If you if
we're going to measure volume, we look

5416
02:13:52,149 --> 02:13:52,159
we're going to measure volume, we look
 

5417
02:13:52,159 --> 02:13:54,229
we're going to measure volume, we look
at the difference overnight.

5418
02:13:54,229 --> 02:13:54,239
at the difference overnight.
 

5419
02:13:54,239 --> 02:13:55,910
at the difference overnight.
This volume, no volume, no volume, no

5420
02:13:55,910 --> 02:13:55,920
This volume, no volume, no volume, no
 

5421
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:58,229
This volume, no volume, no volume, no
volume volume. All right? So if we think

5422
02:13:58,229 --> 02:13:58,239
volume volume. All right? So if we think
 

5423
02:13:58,239 --> 02:14:00,790
volume volume. All right? So if we think
about support and resistance, right? We

5424
02:14:00,790 --> 02:14:00,800
about support and resistance, right? We
 

5425
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:02,310
about support and resistance, right? We
need to know areas which were traded

5426
02:14:02,310 --> 02:14:02,320
need to know areas which were traded
 

5427
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:04,550
need to know areas which were traded
with high volume or low volume. We need

5428
02:14:04,550 --> 02:14:04,560
with high volume or low volume. We need
 

5429
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:06,470
with high volume or low volume. We need
to know the areas of low volume, but we

5430
02:14:06,470 --> 02:14:06,480
to know the areas of low volume, but we
 

5431
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:08,790
to know the areas of low volume, but we
don't need to know as much these areas

5432
02:14:08,790 --> 02:14:08,800
don't need to know as much these areas
 

5433
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:10,470
don't need to know as much these areas
here.

5434
02:14:10,470 --> 02:14:10,480
here.
 

5435
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:15,109
here.
if you're looking at profiles.

5436
02:14:15,109 --> 02:14:15,119

 

5437
02:14:15,119 --> 02:14:16,950

Okay, so they failed to break down and

5438
02:14:16,950 --> 02:14:16,960
Okay, so they failed to break down and
 

5439
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:18,229
Okay, so they failed to break down and
we're going to squeeze out probably back

5440
02:14:18,229 --> 02:14:18,239
we're going to squeeze out probably back
 

5441
02:14:18,239 --> 02:14:19,669
we're going to squeeze out probably back
towards this gray box. Now, we've just

5442
02:14:19,669 --> 02:14:19,679
towards this gray box. Now, we've just
 

5443
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:21,910
towards this gray box. Now, we've just
got above this node here. We're probably

5444
02:14:21,910 --> 02:14:21,920
got above this node here. We're probably
 

5445
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:23,109
got above this node here. We're probably
going to come all the way up here and

5446
02:14:23,109 --> 02:14:23,119
going to come all the way up here and
 

5447
02:14:23,119 --> 02:14:24,390
going to come all the way up here and
you're going to see this rotation we've

5448
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:24,400
you're going to see this rotation we've
 

5449
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:26,550
you're going to see this rotation we've
been talking about happening again.

5450
02:14:26,550 --> 02:14:26,560
been talking about happening again.
 

5451
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:30,229
been talking about happening again.
Right. So, first rotation was

5452
02:14:30,229 --> 02:14:30,239
Right. So, first rotation was
 

5453
02:14:30,239 --> 02:14:33,510
Right. So, first rotation was
here to here, here to here, here to

5454
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:33,520
here to here, here to here, here to
 

5455
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:35,589
here to here, here to here, here to
here. Failed this box down to this box.

5456
02:14:35,589 --> 02:14:35,599
here. Failed this box down to this box.
 

5457
02:14:35,599 --> 02:14:38,149
here. Failed this box down to this box.
Failed under this to green to gray to

5458
02:14:38,149 --> 02:14:38,159
Failed under this to green to gray to
 

5459
02:14:38,159 --> 02:14:39,990
Failed under this to green to gray to
green. Might well go to gray again. and

5460
02:14:39,990 --> 02:14:40,000
green. Might well go to gray again. and
 

5461
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,669
green. Might well go to gray again. and
then it may be up here or maybe back

5462
02:14:41,669 --> 02:14:41,679
then it may be up here or maybe back
 

5463
02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:43,189
then it may be up here or maybe back
down here again. I don't know because

5464
02:14:43,189 --> 02:14:43,199
down here again. I don't know because
 

5465
02:14:43,199 --> 02:14:44,870
down here again. I don't know because
this is a rotational market. Like I

5466
02:14:44,870 --> 02:14:44,880
this is a rotational market. Like I
 

5467
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:46,069
this is a rotational market. Like I
said, I don't know what we do in

5468
02:14:46,069 --> 02:14:46,079
said, I don't know what we do in
 

5469
02:14:46,079 --> 02:14:48,550
said, I don't know what we do in
rotation. You can only play the edges or

5470
02:14:48,550 --> 02:14:48,560
rotation. You can only play the edges or
 

5471
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:50,149
rotation. You can only play the edges or
you can be like me and just not play at

5472
02:14:50,149 --> 02:14:50,159
you can be like me and just not play at
 

5473
02:14:50,159 --> 02:14:55,189
you can be like me and just not play at
all.

5474
02:14:55,189 --> 02:14:55,199

 

5475
02:14:55,199 --> 02:14:57,750

I don't

5476
02:14:57,750 --> 02:14:57,760
I don't
 

5477
02:14:57,760 --> 02:14:59,510
I don't
I don't know if this is the same pattern

5478
02:14:59,510 --> 02:14:59,520
I don't know if this is the same pattern
 

5479
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:01,510
I don't know if this is the same pattern
as yesterday. I'm going to be honest. Uh

5480
02:15:01,510 --> 02:15:01,520
as yesterday. I'm going to be honest. Uh
 

5481
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:03,990
as yesterday. I'm going to be honest. Uh
trader tilt. Yesterday was Friday's

5482
02:15:03,990 --> 02:15:04,000
trader tilt. Yesterday was Friday's
 

5483
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:05,830
trader tilt. Yesterday was Friday's
pattern,

5484
02:15:05,830 --> 02:15:05,840
pattern,
 

5485
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:08,629
pattern,
right? For me, there's a big difference.

5486
02:15:08,629 --> 02:15:08,639
right? For me, there's a big difference.
 

5487
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:11,270
right? For me, there's a big difference.
This is the difference. Yesterday, we

5488
02:15:11,270 --> 02:15:11,280
This is the difference. Yesterday, we
 

5489
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:14,229
This is the difference. Yesterday, we
left value. We went into sell. That's

5490
02:15:14,229 --> 02:15:14,239
left value. We went into sell. That's
 

5491
02:15:14,239 --> 02:15:16,069
left value. We went into sell. That's
the repric. That's your sell point to

5492
02:15:16,069 --> 02:15:16,079
the repric. That's your sell point to
 

5493
02:15:16,079 --> 02:15:18,950
the repric. That's your sell point to
try and get down. Uh Friday was the

5494
02:15:18,950 --> 02:15:18,960
try and get down. Uh Friday was the
 

5495
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:21,910
try and get down. Uh Friday was the
same. We left value

5496
02:15:21,910 --> 02:15:21,920
same. We left value
 

5497
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:24,629
same. We left value
with a big sell. That was the repric. We

5498
02:15:24,629 --> 02:15:24,639
with a big sell. That was the repric. We
 

5499
02:15:24,639 --> 02:15:28,069
with a big sell. That was the repric. We
sold this to go down. Today,

5500
02:15:28,069 --> 02:15:28,079
sold this to go down. Today,
 

5501
02:15:28,079 --> 02:15:30,149
sold this to go down. Today,
we're not really aggressively leaving

5502
02:15:30,149 --> 02:15:30,159
we're not really aggressively leaving
 

5503
02:15:30,159 --> 02:15:31,750
we're not really aggressively leaving
value in the same way. It doesn't mean

5504
02:15:31,750 --> 02:15:31,760
value in the same way. It doesn't mean
 

5505
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:33,990
value in the same way. It doesn't mean
we can't go lower. But if we look at

5506
02:15:33,990 --> 02:15:34,000
we can't go lower. But if we look at
 

5507
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,510
we can't go lower. But if we look at
today's action, look at the sell this

5508
02:15:35,510 --> 02:15:35,520
today's action, look at the sell this
 

5509
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:36,950
today's action, look at the sell this
morning. Where's the big sell this

5510
02:15:36,950 --> 02:15:36,960
morning. Where's the big sell this
 

5511
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:38,390
morning. Where's the big sell this
morning? It's not really is it? It's

5512
02:15:38,390 --> 02:15:38,400
morning? It's not really is it? It's
 

5513
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:40,870
morning? It's not really is it? It's
it's it's a it's a creation of volume

5514
02:15:40,870 --> 02:15:40,880
it's it's a it's a creation of volume
 

5515
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:43,189
it's it's a it's a creation of volume
this morning. Right? You could say the

5516
02:15:43,189 --> 02:15:43,199
this morning. Right? You could say the
 

5517
02:15:43,199 --> 02:15:46,790
this morning. Right? You could say the
sell from here, but the difference is

5518
02:15:46,790 --> 02:15:46,800
sell from here, but the difference is
 

5519
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:49,030
sell from here, but the difference is
we've created structure. Whereas

5520
02:15:49,030 --> 02:15:49,040
we've created structure. Whereas
 

5521
02:15:49,040 --> 02:15:51,350
we've created structure. Whereas
yesterday and Friday, we hadn't created

5522
02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:51,360
yesterday and Friday, we hadn't created
 

5523
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:53,109
yesterday and Friday, we hadn't created
all this structure, right? We were big

5524
02:15:53,109 --> 02:15:53,119
all this structure, right? We were big
 

5525
02:15:53,119 --> 02:15:55,189
all this structure, right? We were big
cells into open land. Big cells into

5526
02:15:55,189 --> 02:15:55,199
cells into open land. Big cells into
 

5527
02:15:55,199 --> 02:15:57,510
cells into open land. Big cells into
open land. That's the big difference for

5528
02:15:57,510 --> 02:15:57,520
open land. That's the big difference for
 

5529
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:00,069
open land. That's the big difference for
me is we've created some structure now.

5530
02:16:00,069 --> 02:16:00,079
me is we've created some structure now.
 

5531
02:16:00,079 --> 02:16:02,550
me is we've created some structure now.
So, I'm

5532
02:16:02,550 --> 02:16:02,560
So, I'm
 

5533
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:06,069
So, I'm
would have to say I disagree with you

5534
02:16:06,069 --> 02:16:06,079
would have to say I disagree with you
 

5535
02:16:06,079 --> 02:16:09,430
would have to say I disagree with you
in terms of what we're doing.

5536
02:16:09,430 --> 02:16:09,440
in terms of what we're doing.
 

5537
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:11,510
in terms of what we're doing.
Not not to be a dick. I can easily be

5538
02:16:11,510 --> 02:16:11,520
Not not to be a dick. I can easily be
 

5539
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:13,030
Not not to be a dick. I can easily be
wrong. Like I said, I'm happy to be

5540
02:16:13,030 --> 02:16:13,040
wrong. Like I said, I'm happy to be
 

5541
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:14,550
wrong. Like I said, I'm happy to be
wrong. Hopefully, I'm wrong if you're

5542
02:16:14,550 --> 02:16:14,560
wrong. Hopefully, I'm wrong if you're
 

5543
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:16,470
wrong. Hopefully, I'm wrong if you're
positioned for the sale because I'm not

5544
02:16:16,470 --> 02:16:16,480
positioned for the sale because I'm not
 

5545
02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:18,390
positioned for the sale because I'm not
positioned in anything. But I would just

5546
02:16:18,390 --> 02:16:18,400
positioned in anything. But I would just
 

5547
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:20,069
positioned in anything. But I would just
be careful thinking about that. I think

5548
02:16:20,069 --> 02:16:20,079
be careful thinking about that. I think
 

5549
02:16:20,079 --> 02:16:22,390
be careful thinking about that. I think
today's market is not the same as

5550
02:16:22,390 --> 02:16:22,400
today's market is not the same as
 

5551
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:23,990
today's market is not the same as
yesterday and Friday's market. For me,

5552
02:16:23,990 --> 02:16:24,000
yesterday and Friday's market. For me,
 

5553
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:28,470
yesterday and Friday's market. For me,
they're very different.

5554
02:16:28,470 --> 02:16:28,480

 

5555
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:31,750

Uh, no li lifetime dogee. I can't

5556
02:16:31,750 --> 02:16:31,760
Uh, no li lifetime dogee. I can't
 

5557
02:16:31,760 --> 02:16:33,750
Uh, no li lifetime dogee. I can't
remember what the rebuild is. It's like

5558
02:16:33,750 --> 02:16:33,760
remember what the rebuild is. It's like
 

5559
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:36,070
remember what the rebuild is. It's like
50 or 60%.

5560
02:16:36,070 --> 02:16:36,080
50 or 60%.
 

5561
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:37,429
50 or 60%.
Something like that. So, you want you

5562
02:16:37,429 --> 02:16:37,439
Something like that. So, you want you
 

5563
02:16:37,439 --> 02:16:40,549
Something like that. So, you want you
want to pass them by the 23rd of uh

5564
02:16:40,549 --> 02:16:40,559
want to pass them by the 23rd of uh
 

5565
02:16:40,559 --> 02:16:41,750
want to pass them by the 23rd of uh
December or whenever they've just

5566
02:16:41,750 --> 02:16:41,760
December or whenever they've just
 

5567
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:43,910
December or whenever they've just
announced it. You want to pass by then.

5568
02:16:43,910 --> 02:16:43,920
announced it. You want to pass by then.
 

5569
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:46,790
announced it. You want to pass by then.
Okay. So, back up to uh VWOP and point

5570
02:16:46,790 --> 02:16:46,800
Okay. So, back up to uh VWOP and point
 

5571
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:49,910
Okay. So, back up to uh VWOP and point
of control 72s into this gray box up

5572
02:16:49,910 --> 02:16:49,920
of control 72s into this gray box up
 

5573
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:52,709
of control 72s into this gray box up
into here. All right. And do they defend

5574
02:16:52,709 --> 02:16:52,719
into here. All right. And do they defend
 

5575
02:16:52,719 --> 02:16:54,469
into here. All right. And do they defend
this gray box or do we find back

5576
02:16:54,469 --> 02:16:54,479
this gray box or do we find back
 

5577
02:16:54,479 --> 02:16:56,070
this gray box or do we find back
acceptance back inside? And we go

5578
02:16:56,070 --> 02:16:56,080
acceptance back inside? And we go
 

5579
02:16:56,080 --> 02:16:57,669
acceptance back inside? And we go
rotation back up again. All right. And

5580
02:16:57,669 --> 02:16:57,679
rotation back up again. All right. And
 

5581
02:16:57,679 --> 02:16:59,589
rotation back up again. All right. And
again, VIX doing a terrible job. Like I

5582
02:16:59,589 --> 02:16:59,599
again, VIX doing a terrible job. Like I
 

5583
02:16:59,599 --> 02:17:01,589
again, VIX doing a terrible job. Like I
talked said about, we're not seeing VIX

5584
02:17:01,589 --> 02:17:01,599
talked said about, we're not seeing VIX
 

5585
02:17:01,599 --> 02:17:04,070
talked said about, we're not seeing VIX
break out to the upside, which is

5586
02:17:04,070 --> 02:17:04,080
break out to the upside, which is
 

5587
02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:05,990
break out to the upside, which is
hurting people looking for shorts,

5588
02:17:05,990 --> 02:17:06,000
hurting people looking for shorts,
 

5589
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,070
hurting people looking for shorts,
looking for continuation lower today.

5590
02:17:08,070 --> 02:17:08,080
looking for continuation lower today.
 

5591
02:17:08,080 --> 02:17:09,750
looking for continuation lower today.
There hasn't been a continuation lower.

5592
02:17:09,750 --> 02:17:09,760
There hasn't been a continuation lower.
 

5593
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:12,549
There hasn't been a continuation lower.
We haven't broken down outside overnight

5594
02:17:12,549 --> 02:17:12,559
We haven't broken down outside overnight
 

5595
02:17:12,559 --> 02:17:17,349
We haven't broken down outside overnight
value.

5596
02:17:17,349 --> 02:17:17,359

 

5597
02:17:17,359 --> 02:17:18,790

I don't know what to think about the VIX

5598
02:17:18,790 --> 02:17:18,800
I don't know what to think about the VIX
 

5599
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:20,629
I don't know what to think about the VIX
expiry.

5600
02:17:20,629 --> 02:17:20,639
expiry.
 

5601
02:17:20,639 --> 02:17:22,389
expiry.
I think VIX is positioning for a really

5602
02:17:22,389 --> 02:17:22,399
I think VIX is positioning for a really
 

5603
02:17:22,399 --> 02:17:24,469
I think VIX is positioning for a really
nasty move, but I think we can position

5604
02:17:24,469 --> 02:17:24,479
nasty move, but I think we can position
 

5605
02:17:24,479 --> 02:17:26,709
nasty move, but I think we can position
here for months.

5606
02:17:26,709 --> 02:17:26,719
here for months.
 

5607
02:17:26,719 --> 02:17:29,270
here for months.
Um, I haven't checked the uh OPEX levels

5608
02:17:29,270 --> 02:17:29,280
Um, I haven't checked the uh OPEX levels
 

5609
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:48,469
Um, I haven't checked the uh OPEX levels
to be quite honest with you.

5610
02:17:48,469 --> 02:17:48,479

 

5611
02:17:48,479 --> 02:17:51,589

Uh, a lot, Patrick. A lot. A lot of

5612
02:17:51,589 --> 02:17:51,599
Uh, a lot, Patrick. A lot. A lot of
 

5613
02:17:51,599 --> 02:17:53,349
Uh, a lot, Patrick. A lot. A lot of
people do.

5614
02:17:53,349 --> 02:17:53,359
people do.
 

5615
02:17:53,359 --> 02:17:56,629
people do.
Um, because they don't understand,

5616
02:17:56,629 --> 02:17:56,639
Um, because they don't understand,
 

5617
02:17:56,639 --> 02:17:58,709
Um, because they don't understand,
like the guy that comes on talking crap

5618
02:17:58,709 --> 02:17:58,719
like the guy that comes on talking crap
 

5619
02:17:58,719 --> 02:18:01,349
like the guy that comes on talking crap
in here every day. They don't understand

5620
02:18:01,349 --> 02:18:01,359
in here every day. They don't understand
 

5621
02:18:01,359 --> 02:18:02,709
in here every day. They don't understand
when we're in a trend and when we're

5622
02:18:02,709 --> 02:18:02,719
when we're in a trend and when we're
 

5623
02:18:02,719 --> 02:18:06,309
when we're in a trend and when we're
not. And so, they get caught. It's why I

5624
02:18:06,309 --> 02:18:06,319
not. And so, they get caught. It's why I
 

5625
02:18:06,319 --> 02:18:08,070
not. And so, they get caught. It's why I
avoid it, right? Once I see this,

5626
02:18:08,070 --> 02:18:08,080
avoid it, right? Once I see this,
 

5627
02:18:08,080 --> 02:18:09,830
avoid it, right? Once I see this,
especially as we go into the like

5628
02:18:09,830 --> 02:18:09,840
especially as we go into the like
 

5629
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:11,429
especially as we go into the like
further into the day, it's like for me

5630
02:18:11,429 --> 02:18:11,439
further into the day, it's like for me
 

5631
02:18:11,439 --> 02:18:14,790
further into the day, it's like for me
it's why do I want to trade this? Why do

5632
02:18:14,790 --> 02:18:14,800
it's why do I want to trade this? Why do
 

5633
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:16,389
it's why do I want to trade this? Why do
I want to trade this when we like Friday

5634
02:18:16,389 --> 02:18:16,399
I want to trade this when we like Friday
 

5635
02:18:16,399 --> 02:18:19,349
I want to trade this when we like Friday
and Monday was so good? Why trade why

5636
02:18:19,349 --> 02:18:19,359
and Monday was so good? Why trade why
 

5637
02:18:19,359 --> 02:18:21,589
and Monday was so good? Why trade why
why trade the day where it needs to

5638
02:18:21,589 --> 02:18:21,599
why trade the day where it needs to
 

5639
02:18:21,599 --> 02:18:24,070
why trade the day where it needs to
build out? Why not f for me? Why not

5640
02:18:24,070 --> 02:18:24,080
build out? Why not f for me? Why not
 

5641
02:18:24,080 --> 02:18:26,070
build out? Why not f for me? Why not
focus on the day where we use the people

5642
02:18:26,070 --> 02:18:26,080
focus on the day where we use the people
 

5643
02:18:26,080 --> 02:18:28,870
focus on the day where we use the people
who have been caught? Those are the days

5644
02:18:28,870 --> 02:18:28,880
who have been caught? Those are the days
 

5645
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:31,429
who have been caught? Those are the days
that I like to focus on personally. But

5646
02:18:31,429 --> 02:18:31,439
that I like to focus on personally. But
 

5647
02:18:31,439 --> 02:18:32,950
that I like to focus on personally. But
it's each to their own. Some people love

5648
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:32,960
it's each to their own. Some people love
 

5649
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:34,870
it's each to their own. Some people love
trading rotation. There's nothing wrong

5650
02:18:34,870 --> 02:18:34,880
trading rotation. There's nothing wrong
 

5651
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:36,389
trading rotation. There's nothing wrong
with trading rotation as long as you

5652
02:18:36,389 --> 02:18:36,399
with trading rotation as long as you
 

5653
02:18:36,399 --> 02:18:37,910
with trading rotation as long as you
understand that's the condition that

5654
02:18:37,910 --> 02:18:37,920
understand that's the condition that
 

5655
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:39,910
understand that's the condition that
you're in. If you don't understand

5656
02:18:39,910 --> 02:18:39,920
you're in. If you don't understand
 

5657
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:41,750
you're in. If you don't understand
that's the condition you're in. That's

5658
02:18:41,750 --> 02:18:41,760
that's the condition you're in. That's
 

5659
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:51,030
that's the condition you're in. That's
where the pain comes

5660
02:18:51,030 --> 02:18:51,040

 

5661
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:53,349

into the gray box. Selling the gray box.

5662
02:18:53,349 --> 02:18:53,359
into the gray box. Selling the gray box.
 

5663
02:18:53,359 --> 02:18:55,349
into the gray box. Selling the gray box.
Now, what are they doing? I don't know,

5664
02:18:55,349 --> 02:18:55,359
Now, what are they doing? I don't know,
 

5665
02:18:55,359 --> 02:18:57,110
Now, what are they doing? I don't know,
folks. I don't know what they want to

5666
02:18:57,110 --> 02:18:57,120
folks. I don't know what they want to
 

5667
02:18:57,120 --> 02:18:59,750
folks. I don't know what they want to
do. I have no idea what these folks want

5668
02:18:59,750 --> 02:18:59,760
do. I have no idea what these folks want
 

5669
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:03,349
do. I have no idea what these folks want
to do,

5670
02:19:03,349 --> 02:19:03,359

 

5671
02:19:03,359 --> 02:19:06,230

but at least you can see the level to

5672
02:19:06,230 --> 02:19:06,240
but at least you can see the level to
 

5673
02:19:06,240 --> 02:19:08,070
but at least you can see the level to
level. Hopefully, it makes sense like

5674
02:19:08,070 --> 02:19:08,080
level. Hopefully, it makes sense like
 

5675
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:09,910
level. Hopefully, it makes sense like
even me plotting the boxes out for you.

5676
02:19:09,910 --> 02:19:09,920
even me plotting the boxes out for you.
 

5677
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:11,509
even me plotting the boxes out for you.
Hopefully, it helps you understand like

5678
02:19:11,509 --> 02:19:11,519
Hopefully, it helps you understand like
 

5679
02:19:11,519 --> 02:19:13,750
Hopefully, it helps you understand like
where we trade to and and and how and

5680
02:19:13,750 --> 02:19:13,760
where we trade to and and and how and
 

5681
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:17,509
where we trade to and and and how and
why. Beyond those levels, I don't I

5682
02:19:17,509 --> 02:19:17,519
why. Beyond those levels, I don't I
 

5683
02:19:17,519 --> 02:19:19,190
why. Beyond those levels, I don't I
can't tell you beyond those levels what

5684
02:19:19,190 --> 02:19:19,200
can't tell you beyond those levels what
 

5685
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:21,030
can't tell you beyond those levels what
we're going to do until we get through

5686
02:19:21,030 --> 02:19:21,040
we're going to do until we get through
 

5687
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:23,830
we're going to do until we get through
it, right? Until we get through it.

5688
02:19:23,830 --> 02:19:23,840
it, right? Until we get through it.
 

5689
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:25,669
it, right? Until we get through it.
So, we come back down. Look at the node

5690
02:19:25,669 --> 02:19:25,679
So, we come back down. Look at the node
 

5691
02:19:25,679 --> 02:19:27,589
So, we come back down. Look at the node
that we developed here. All right. So

5692
02:19:27,589 --> 02:19:27,599
that we developed here. All right. So
 

5693
02:19:27,599 --> 02:19:29,750
that we developed here. All right. So
bulls will now try and defend this. If

5694
02:19:29,750 --> 02:19:29,760
bulls will now try and defend this. If
 

5695
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:32,150
bulls will now try and defend this. If
they fail to defend it, then maybe they

5696
02:19:32,150 --> 02:19:32,160
they fail to defend it, then maybe they
 

5697
02:19:32,160 --> 02:19:34,070
they fail to defend it, then maybe they
just got caught up here. We can check

5698
02:19:34,070 --> 02:19:34,080
just got caught up here. We can check
 

5699
02:19:34,080 --> 02:19:36,309
just got caught up here. We can check
again.

5700
02:19:36,309 --> 02:19:36,319
again.
 

5701
02:19:36,319 --> 02:19:37,910
again.
Right. So we have some buyers in that

5702
02:19:37,910 --> 02:19:37,920
Right. So we have some buyers in that
 

5703
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:39,990
Right. So we have some buyers in that
last big candle.

5704
02:19:39,990 --> 02:19:40,000
last big candle.
 

5705
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:43,270
last big candle.
Yeah. So sellers need to defend 50s now,

5706
02:19:43,270 --> 02:19:43,280
Yeah. So sellers need to defend 50s now,
 

5707
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:44,469
Yeah. So sellers need to defend 50s now,
right? And then they can look for a

5708
02:19:44,469 --> 02:19:44,479
right? And then they can look for a
 

5709
02:19:44,479 --> 02:19:51,990
right? And then they can look for a
breakdown lower.

5710
02:19:51,990 --> 02:19:52,000

 

5711
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:53,910

Hopefully that helps. Trying my best

5712
02:19:53,910 --> 02:19:53,920
Hopefully that helps. Trying my best
 

5713
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:55,830
Hopefully that helps. Trying my best
here folks while trying to keep a calm

5714
02:19:55,830 --> 02:19:55,840
here folks while trying to keep a calm
 

5715
02:19:55,840 --> 02:20:00,710
here folks while trying to keep a calm
head.

5716
02:20:00,710 --> 02:20:00,720

 

5717
02:20:00,720 --> 02:20:02,870

back to value area low again after a big

5718
02:20:02,870 --> 02:20:02,880
back to value area low again after a big
 

5719
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:04,309
back to value area low again after a big
big sell. This is where they just bid

5720
02:20:04,309 --> 02:20:04,319
big sell. This is where they just bid
 

5721
02:20:04,319 --> 02:20:06,070
big sell. This is where they just bid
off. And if they fail to bid this time,

5722
02:20:06,070 --> 02:20:06,080
off. And if they fail to bid this time,
 

5723
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:08,150
off. And if they fail to bid this time,
then maybe you get initial balance low

5724
02:20:08,150 --> 02:20:08,160
then maybe you get initial balance low
 

5725
02:20:08,160 --> 02:20:10,389
then maybe you get initial balance low
if they go for expansion. You might get

5726
02:20:10,389 --> 02:20:10,399
if they go for expansion. You might get
 

5727
02:20:10,399 --> 02:20:12,950
if they go for expansion. You might get
a snap because that was a decent tug

5728
02:20:12,950 --> 02:20:12,960
a snap because that was a decent tug
 

5729
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:14,150
a snap because that was a decent tug
down, but you might need one more

5730
02:20:14,150 --> 02:20:14,160
down, but you might need one more
 

5731
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:16,870
down, but you might need one more
rebalance first. I don't know. Time will

5732
02:20:16,870 --> 02:20:16,880
rebalance first. I don't know. Time will
 

5733
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:20,389
rebalance first. I don't know. Time will
tell.

5734
02:20:20,389 --> 02:20:20,399

 

5735
02:20:20,399 --> 02:20:22,309

This guy's bidding at 200s again. Is

5736
02:20:22,309 --> 02:20:22,319
This guy's bidding at 200s again. Is
 

5737
02:20:22,319 --> 02:20:23,910
This guy's bidding at 200s again. Is
there anyone underneath? Not really. Not

5738
02:20:23,910 --> 02:20:23,920
there anyone underneath? Not really. Not
 

5739
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:27,830
there anyone underneath? Not really. Not
at the moment.

5740
02:20:27,830 --> 02:20:27,840

 

5741
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:29,349

blue account today. I'm sorry to hear

5742
02:20:29,349 --> 02:20:29,359
blue account today. I'm sorry to hear
 

5743
02:20:29,359 --> 02:20:32,469
blue account today. I'm sorry to hear
that. Sorry to hear that. Uh, use it as

5744
02:20:32,469 --> 02:20:32,479
that. Sorry to hear that. Uh, use it as
 

5745
02:20:32,479 --> 02:20:35,110
that. Sorry to hear that. Uh, use it as
a lesson. Use it as a lesson. Try and

5746
02:20:35,110 --> 02:20:35,120
a lesson. Use it as a lesson. Try and
 

5747
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:37,590
a lesson. Use it as a lesson. Try and
understand why did you blow the account?

5748
02:20:37,590 --> 02:20:37,600
understand why did you blow the account?
 

5749
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:38,950
understand why did you blow the account?
Did you chase? Did you fail to

5750
02:20:38,950 --> 02:20:38,960
Did you chase? Did you fail to
 

5751
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:41,270
Did you chase? Did you fail to
understand the market conditions?

5752
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:41,280
understand the market conditions?
 

5753
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:43,349
understand the market conditions?
Did you not know it was in a rotation?

5754
02:20:43,349 --> 02:20:43,359
Did you not know it was in a rotation?
 

5755
02:20:43,359 --> 02:20:46,309
Did you not know it was in a rotation?
Did you oversize? Did you not stop out?

5756
02:20:46,309 --> 02:20:46,319
Did you oversize? Did you not stop out?
 

5757
02:20:46,319 --> 02:20:47,910
Did you oversize? Did you not stop out?
Did you add into a loser? Like, make

5758
02:20:47,910 --> 02:20:47,920
Did you add into a loser? Like, make
 

5759
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:49,510
Did you add into a loser? Like, make
sure you understand why you blew the

5760
02:20:49,510 --> 02:20:49,520
sure you understand why you blew the
 

5761
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:51,510
sure you understand why you blew the
account. Because if you just blow

5762
02:20:51,510 --> 02:20:51,520
account. Because if you just blow
 

5763
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:53,510
account. Because if you just blow
accounts and you don't understand why,

5764
02:20:53,510 --> 02:20:53,520
accounts and you don't understand why,
 

5765
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:56,070
accounts and you don't understand why,
um, then it's a waste of money. But I do

5766
02:20:56,070 --> 02:20:56,080
um, then it's a waste of money. But I do
 

5767
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:57,750
um, then it's a waste of money. But I do
believe if you blow an account and you

5768
02:20:57,750 --> 02:20:57,760
believe if you blow an account and you
 

5769
02:20:57,760 --> 02:20:59,670
believe if you blow an account and you
learn from it, it's actually money well

5770
02:20:59,670 --> 02:20:59,680
learn from it, it's actually money well
 

5771
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:02,150
learn from it, it's actually money well
spent. As as painful as that might

5772
02:21:02,150 --> 02:21:02,160
spent. As as painful as that might

you're on top step. Yeah, I mean, look,
 

5937
02:26:29,600 --> 02:26:33,670
you're on top step. Yeah, I mean, look,
I I recommend a Apex, but it's a it's

5938
02:26:33,670 --> 02:26:33,680
I I recommend a Apex, but it's a it's
 

5939
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:35,429
I I recommend a Apex, but it's a it's
Apex is very different to a lot of the

5940
02:26:35,429 --> 02:26:35,439
Apex is very different to a lot of the
 

5941
02:26:35,439 --> 02:26:36,950
Apex is very different to a lot of the
other firms, right? You have to treat it

5942
02:26:36,950 --> 02:26:36,960
other firms, right? You have to treat it
 

5943
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:39,349
other firms, right? You have to treat it
differently. Um, Apex is great for

5944
02:26:39,349 --> 02:26:39,359
differently. Um, Apex is great for
 

5945
02:26:39,359 --> 02:26:41,190
differently. Um, Apex is great for
scaling. If you want to make big money

5946
02:26:41,190 --> 02:26:41,200
scaling. If you want to make big money
 

5947
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:43,429
scaling. If you want to make big money
and scale the accounts, Apex is great.

5948
02:26:43,429 --> 02:26:43,439
and scale the accounts, Apex is great.
 

5949
02:26:43,439 --> 02:26:45,429
and scale the accounts, Apex is great.
If you're also low on budget and you're

5950
02:26:45,429 --> 02:26:45,439
If you're also low on budget and you're
 

5951
02:26:45,439 --> 02:26:47,030
If you're also low on budget and you're
a newer trader and you just want to feel

5952
02:26:47,030 --> 02:26:47,040
a newer trader and you just want to feel
 

5953
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:50,309
a newer trader and you just want to feel
it out, Apex is great. But you have to

5954
02:26:50,309 --> 02:26:50,319
it out, Apex is great. But you have to
 

5955
02:26:50,319 --> 02:26:52,950
it out, Apex is great. But you have to
understand the rules. Trailing draw down

5956
02:26:52,950 --> 02:26:52,960
understand the rules. Trailing draw down
 

5957
02:26:52,960 --> 02:26:55,990
understand the rules. Trailing draw down
is a [\h__\h] So

5958
02:26:55,990 --> 02:26:56,000
is a [\h__\h] So
 

5959
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,550
is a [\h__\h] So
once you get into the PAS, you got to

5960
02:26:58,550 --> 02:26:58,560
once you get into the PAS, you got to
 

5961
02:26:58,560 --> 02:27:00,309
once you get into the PAS, you got to
take your time, right? Build your buffer

5962
02:27:00,309 --> 02:27:00,319
take your time, right? Build your buffer
 

5963
02:27:00,319 --> 02:27:02,389
take your time, right? Build your buffer
out. Once you build the buffer out, Apex

5964
02:27:02,389 --> 02:27:02,399
out. Once you build the buffer out, Apex
 

5965
02:27:02,399 --> 02:27:04,070
out. Once you build the buffer out, Apex
is the same as everywhere else. Like you

5966
02:27:04,070 --> 02:27:04,080
is the same as everywhere else. Like you
 

5967
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:05,670
is the same as everywhere else. Like you
can make good money from it, but it it

5968
02:27:05,670 --> 02:27:05,680
can make good money from it, but it it
 

5969
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:08,309
can make good money from it, but it it
depends. Can can you It's It's actually

5970
02:27:08,309 --> 02:27:08,319
depends. Can can you It's It's actually
 

5971
02:27:08,319 --> 02:27:09,750
depends. Can can you It's It's actually
a really good test. Do you have the

5972
02:27:09,750 --> 02:27:09,760
a really good test. Do you have the
 

5973
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:12,870
a really good test. Do you have the
discipline and patience? Because I I'm a

discipline into you because if you are a
 

6041
02:28:23,600 --> 02:28:25,190
discipline into you because if you are a

02:34:30,150 --> 02:34:30,160
what, if he's going to open up a
 

6323
02:34:30,160 --> 02:34:32,150
what, if he's going to open up a

lot because they can't pull this [\h__\h]

6326
02:34:33,910 --> 02:34:33,920
lot because they can't pull this [\h__\h]
 

6327
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:35,910
lot because they can't pull this [\h__\h]
with real money. And that's the [\h__\h]

6328
02:34:35,910 --> 02:34:35,920
with real money. And that's the [\h__\h]
 

6329
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:38,150
with real money. And that's the [\h__\h]
thing that I think is dangerous. If they

6330
02:34:38,150 --> 02:34:38,160
thing that I think is dangerous. If they
 

6331
02:34:38,160 --> 02:34:40,230
thing that I think is dangerous. If they
can't [\h__\h] run a sim, how are they

6332
02:34:40,230 --> 02:34:40,240
can't [\h__\h] run a sim, how are they
 

6333
02:34:40,240 --> 02:34:42,230
can't [\h__\h] run a sim, how are they
running real orders? That would worry

6334
02:34:42,230 --> 02:34:42,240
running real orders? That would worry
 

6335
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:44,389
running real orders? That would worry
me, guys.

6347
02:34:55,439 --> 02:34:57,110
to pass in five days, that means trading
one to two minis, not micros. Would you

6348
02:34:57,110 --> 02:34:57,120
one to two minis, not micros. Would you
 

6349
02:34:57,120 --> 02:35:01,349
one to two minis, not micros. Would you
agree? Uh,

02:35:01,349 --> 02:35:01,359
agree? Uh,
 

6351
02:35:01,359 --> 02:35:04,070
agree? Uh,
no, not necessarily. Uh if you break

6352
02:35:04,070 --> 02:35:04,080
no, not necessarily. Uh if you break
 

6353
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:06,389
no, not necessarily. Uh if you break
3,00 3,000 down into five days, you're

6354
02:35:06,389 --> 02:35:06,399
3,00 3,000 down into five days, you're
 

6355
02:35:06,399 --> 02:35:08,469
3,00 3,000 down into five days, you're
looking at $600 a day. You can easily do

6356
02:35:08,469 --> 02:35:08,479
looking at $600 a day. You can easily do
 

6357
02:35:08,479 --> 02:35:10,870
looking at $600 a day. You can easily do
that with micros, but it will depend on

6358
02:35:10,870 --> 02:35:10,880
that with micros, but it will depend on
 

6359
02:35:10,880 --> 02:35:13,190
that with micros, but it will depend on
the range available to you. Um we've got

6360
02:35:13,190 --> 02:35:13,200
the range available to you. Um we've got
 

6361
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:15,270
the range available to you. Um we've got
a volatile market right now. So, you

6362
02:35:15,270 --> 02:35:15,280
a volatile market right now. So, you
 

6363
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:16,790
a volatile market right now. So, you
know, if you're picking edgeto edge, I

6364
02:35:16,790 --> 02:35:16,800
know, if you're picking edgeto edge, I
 

6365
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:20,630
know, if you're picking edgeto edge, I
think you could do it right now, but

6366
02:35:20,630 --> 02:35:20,640
think you could do it right now, but
 

6367
02:35:20,640 --> 02:35:21,830
think you could do it right now, but
it would depend on the market

6368
02:35:21,830 --> 02:35:21,840
it would depend on the market
 

6369
02:35:21,840 --> 02:35:23,670
it would depend on the market
conditions. Would really depend on

6370
02:35:23,670 --> 02:35:23,680

02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:46,230
I was no,
I'm close to passing 30 Apex accounts.

6390
02:35:46,230 --> 02:35:46,240
I'm close to passing 30 Apex accounts.
 

6391
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:48,309
I'm close to passing 30 Apex accounts.
If all are activated, I can only trade

6392
02:35:48,309 --> 02:35:48,319
If all are activated, I can only trade
 

6393
02:35:48,319 --> 02:35:49,910
If all are activated, I can only trade
20 simultaneously. Could you please

6394
02:35:49,910 --> 02:35:49,920
20 simultaneously. Could you please
 

6395
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:53,670
20 simultaneously. Could you please
clarify? Yes. So, what you want to do is

6396
02:35:53,670 --> 02:35:53,680
clarify? Yes. So, what you want to do is
 

6397
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:56,790
clarify? Yes. So, what you want to do is
uh you will be able to activate 20. 10

6398
02:35:56,790 --> 02:35:56,800
uh you will be able to activate 20. 10
 

6399
02:35:56,800 --> 02:35:58,870
uh you will be able to activate 20. 10
will be on standby. Windows 10, you

6400
02:35:58,870 --> 02:35:58,880
will be on standby. Windows 10, you
 

6401
02:35:58,880 --> 02:36:01,910
will be on standby. Windows 10, you
might need to pay you'll have to sign

6402
02:36:01,910 --> 02:36:01,920
might need to pay you'll have to sign
 

6403
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:03,750
might need to pay you'll have to sign
the dock, but I think you'll you'll need

6404
02:36:03,750 --> 02:36:03,760
the dock, but I think you'll you'll need
 

6405
02:36:03,760 --> 02:36:07,110
the dock, but I think you'll you'll need
to pay for the monthly fee until you

6406
02:36:07,110 --> 02:36:07,120
to pay for the monthly fee until you
 

6407
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:08,790
to pay for the monthly fee until you
need them. I think that's how it works

6408
02:36:08,790 --> 02:36:08,800
need them. I think that's how it works
 

6409
02:36:08,800 --> 02:36:10,870
need them. I think that's how it works
with that.

6410
02:36:10,870 --> 02:36:10,880
with that.
 

6411
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:13,270
with that.
So, if you're paying 19 or $30 a month,

6412
02:36:13,270 --> 02:36:13,280
So, if you're paying 19 or $30 a month,
 

6413
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:15,110
So, if you're paying 19 or $30 a month,
you continue to pay $30 a month for the

6414
02:36:15,110 --> 02:36:15,120
you continue to pay $30 a month for the
 

6415
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:18,710
you continue to pay $30 a month for the
10 you're not using until you use it.

6416
02:36:18,710 --> 02:36:18,720
10 you're not using until you use it.
 

6417
02:36:18,720 --> 02:36:20,790
10 you're not using until you use it.

6429
02:36:32,240 --> 02:36:34,870
they did it last time. Like they had to
eat [\h__\h] for top steps error, but they

6457
02:37:09,520 --> 02:37:11,429

6465
02:37:18,399 --> 02:37:20,150
talked about this move from here to
here. We talked about this move from

6466
02:37:20,150 --> 02:37:20,160
here. We talked about this move from
 

6467
02:37:20,160 --> 02:37:22,309

move from here to here being the new
 

6471
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:25,990
move from here to here being the new
rotation. And if they lose this, we go

6472
02:37:25,990 --> 02:37:26,000
rotation. And if they lose this, we go
 

6473
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,150
rotation. And if they lose this, we go
back into this. If they hold this, we go

6474
02:37:28,150 --> 02:37:28,160
back into this. If they hold this, we go
 

6475
02:37:28,160 --> 02:37:30,790

02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:32,150
back into this. Okay?
Does everyone understand that? Because I

6478
02:37:32,150 --> 02:37:32,160
Does everyone understand that? Because I
 

6479
02:37:32,160 --> 02:37:33,349
Does everyone understand that? Because I
know I've said it a lot of times today,

6480
02:37:33,349 --> 02:37:33,359
know I've said it a lot of times today,
 

6481
02:37:33,359 --> 02:37:35,670
know I've said it a lot of times today,
but do you do you can you see it? Does

6482
02:37:35,670 --> 02:37:35,680
but do you do you can you see it? Does
 

6483
02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:37,429
but do you do you can you see it? Does
it make sense? Can you see what I'm on

6484
02:37:37,429 --> 02:37:37,439
it make sense? Can you see what I'm on
 

6485
02:37:37,439 --> 02:37:40,070
it make sense? Can you see what I'm on
about? That's all that really matters is

6486
02:37:40,070 --> 02:37:40,080
about? That's all that really matters is
 

6487
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:52,950
about? That's all that really matters is
can you see it?

6531
02:38:39,280 --> 02:38:41,110

Enough said. You can't be the biggest

6536
02:38:48,790 --> 02:38:48,800
Enough said. You can't be the biggest
 

6537
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:51,030
Enough said. You can't be the biggest
and the best if you can't do the very

6538
02:38:51,030 --> 02:38:51,040
and the best if you can't do the very
 

6539
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:53,349

this was the rotation. All right, we've

6588
02:39:55,910 --> 02:39:55,920
this was the rotation. All right, we've
 

6589
02:39:55,920 --> 02:39:57,670
this was the rotation. All right, we've
thickened up the rotation, but basically

6590
02:39:57,670 --> 02:39:57,680
thickened up the rotation, but basically
 

6591
02:39:57,680 --> 02:39:59,590
thickened up the rotation, but basically
basically earlier in the day, we were

6592
02:39:59,590 --> 02:39:59,600
basically earlier in the day, we were
 

6593
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:01,429
basically earlier in the day, we were
like this with a bell-shaped curve,

6594
02:40:01,429 --> 02:40:01,439
like this with a bell-shaped curve,
 

6595
02:40:01,439 --> 02:40:03,590
like this with a bell-shaped curve,
right? So, this is balance. Red line is

6596
02:40:03,590 --> 02:40:03,600
right? So, this is balance. Red line is
 

6597
02:40:03,600 --> 02:40:05,190
right? So, this is balance. Red line is
point of control. So, we know this is

6598
02:40:05,190 --> 02:40:05,200
point of control. So, we know this is
 

6599
02:40:05,200 --> 02:40:07,110
point of control. So, we know this is
the under over for the day. So, if Bulls

6600
02:40:07,110 --> 02:40:07,120
the under over for the day. So, if Bulls
 

6601
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:08,230
the under over for the day. So, if Bulls
can stay over this, they're going to try

6602
02:40:08,230 --> 02:40:08,240
can stay over this, they're going to try

an A+ day. If you're someone like me

6786
02:43:59,190 --> 02:43:59,200
an A+ day. If you're someone like me
 

6787
02:43:59,200 --> 02:44:01,590
an A+ day. If you're someone like me
that likes looking for higher time frame

6788
02:44:01,590 --> 02:44:01,600
that likes looking for higher time frame
 

6789
02:44:01,600 --> 02:44:03,269
that likes looking for higher time frame
narrative to line up with lower time

6790

narrative to line up with lower time
 

6791
02:44:03,279 --> 02:44:05,590

02:44:26,150 --> 02:44:26,160
you know if the Rams come to town, well,
 

6807
02:44:26,160 --> 02:44:27,349
you know if the Rams come to town, well,
they're [\h__\h] because they're used to

6808
02:44:27,349 --> 02:44:27,359
they're [\h__\h] because they're used to

heat. All right, so like that's your

6812
02:44:31,750 --> 02:44:31,760
heat. All right, so like that's your
 

6813
02:44:31,760 --> 02:44:33,269
heat. All right, so like that's your
edge, right? Your edge comes from the

6814
02:44:33,269 --> 02:44:33,279
edge, right? Your edge comes from the
 

6815
02:44:33,279 --> 02:44:35,429
edge, right? Your edge comes from the
conditions. It's the same as this. What

6816
02:44:35,429 --> 02:44:35,439
conditions. It's the same as this. What
 

6817
02:44:35,439 --> 02:44:37,510

02:44:40,479 --> 02:44:43,030
heat, altitude.
It's why it's you need home home

6822
02:44:43,030 --> 02:44:43,040
It's why it's you need home home
 

6823
02:44:43,040 --> 02:44:45,910
It's why it's you need home home
advantage. Home advantage for me is not

6824
02:44:45,910 --> 02:44:45,920
advantage. Home advantage for me is not
 

6825
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:47,670
advantage. Home advantage for me is not
this, but home advantage for you might

6826
02:44:47,670 --> 02:44:47,680
this, but home advantage for you might
 

6827
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:49,030
this, but home advantage for you might
be this. And this is why I always say, I

6831
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:51,990
will teach you what's there, but it
doesn't mean I will trade it. My edge

6832
02:44:51,990 --> 02:44:52,000
doesn't mean I will trade it. My edge
 

6833
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:53,830
doesn't mean I will trade it. My edge
comes from leaving [\h__\h] alone I don't

6834
02:44:53,830 --> 02:44:53,840
comes from leaving [\h__\h] alone I don't
 

6835
02:44:53,840 --> 02:44:55,269
comes from leaving [\h__\h] alone I don't
like. Here comes the expansion. Here's

02:50:17,120 --> 02:50:20,710
different
from this yesterday

7002
02:50:20,710 --> 02:50:20,720
from this yesterday
 

7003
02:50:20,720 --> 02:50:22,870
from this yesterday
and from this Friday. Okay, remember

7004
02:50:22,870 --> 02:50:22,880
and from this Friday. Okay, remember
 

7005
02:50:22,880 --> 02:50:24,950
and from this Friday. Okay, remember
we've had two big move downs and even

7006
02:50:24,950 --> 02:50:24,960
we've had two big move downs and even
 

7007
02:50:24,960 --> 02:50:27,510
we've had two big move downs and even
overnight a big move down. The target

7008
02:50:27,510 --> 02:50:27,520
overnight a big move down. The target
 

7009
02:50:27,520 --> 02:50:29,990
overnight a big move down. The target
for the week was this here. All right, I

7010
02:50:29,990 --> 02:50:30,000
for the week was this here. All right, I
 

7011
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:31,269
for the week was this here. All right, I
know the numbers are different to what I

7012
02:50:31,269 --> 02:50:31,279
know the numbers are different to what I
 

7013
02:50:31,279 --> 02:50:32,710
know the numbers are different to what I
give you in the newsletter, but it's cuz

7014
02:50:32,710 --> 02:50:32,720
give you in the newsletter, but it's cuz
 

7015
02:50:32,720 --> 02:50:35,349
give you in the newsletter, but it's cuz
it's a new contract. But this

7016
02:50:35,349 --> 02:50:35,359
it's a new contract. But this
 

7017
02:50:35,359 --> 02:50:38,469
it's a new contract. But this
is the 930 level, right? That was the

7018
02:50:38,469 --> 02:50:38,479
is the 930 level, right? That was the
 

7019
02:50:38,479 --> 02:50:40,389
is the 930 level, right? That was the
target for the week. This is the weekly

7020
02:50:40,389 --> 02:50:40,399
target for the week. This is the weekly
 

7021
02:50:40,399 --> 02:50:42,790
target for the week. This is the weekly
point of control, the untested naked

7022
02:50:42,790 --> 02:50:42,800
point of control, the untested naked
 

7023
02:50:42,800 --> 02:50:44,309
point of control, the untested naked
point of control. We've done that move.

7024
02:50:44,309 --> 02:50:44,319
point of control. We've done that move.
 

7025
02:50:44,319 --> 02:50:45,590
point of control. We've done that move.
Now, this is why I think we probably

7026
02:50:45,590 --> 02:50:45,600
Now, this is why I think we probably
 

7027
02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:47,349
Now, this is why I think we probably
need to build out liquidity because if I

7028
02:50:47,349 --> 02:50:47,359
need to build out liquidity because if I
 

7029
02:50:47,359 --> 02:50:49,750
need to build out liquidity because if I
was a higher time frame bull, there is a

7030
02:50:49,750 --> 02:50:49,760
was a higher time frame bull, there is a
 

7031
02:50:49,760 --> 02:50:51,590
was a higher time frame bull, there is a
good chance I would start buying from

7032
02:50:51,590 --> 02:50:51,600
good chance I would start buying from
 

7033
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:54,150
good chance I would start buying from
around here. You can see we built

7034
02:50:54,150 --> 02:50:54,160
around here. You can see we built
 

7035
02:50:54,160 --> 02:50:56,469
around here. You can see we built
liquidity, we broke down, we bid back

7036
02:50:56,469 --> 02:50:56,479
liquidity, we broke down, we bid back
 

7037
02:50:56,479 --> 02:50:58,309
liquidity, we broke down, we bid back
over, we've been holding it. This is why

7038
02:50:58,309 --> 02:50:58,319
over, we've been holding it. This is why
 

7039
02:50:58,319 --> 02:50:59,910
over, we've been holding it. This is why
I was saying I don't think today is a

7040
02:50:59,910 --> 02:50:59,920
I was saying I don't think today is a
 

7041
02:50:59,920 --> 02:51:03,269
I was saying I don't think today is a
trend day, right? Woke up, woke up, woke

7042
02:51:03,269 --> 02:51:03,279
trend day, right? Woke up, woke up, woke
 

7043
02:51:03,279 --> 02:51:05,110
trend day, right? Woke up, woke up, woke
up, early market, and all we've done

7044
02:51:05,110 --> 02:51:05,120
up, early market, and all we've done
 

7045
02:51:05,120 --> 02:51:07,110
up, early market, and all we've done
since is test each side of this. This

7046
02:51:07,110 --> 02:51:07,120
since is test each side of this. This
 

7047
02:51:07,120 --> 02:51:08,710
since is test each side of this. This
will be a buildout of liquidity. It

7048
02:51:08,710 --> 02:51:08,720
will be a buildout of liquidity. It
 

7049
02:51:08,720 --> 02:51:10,870
will be a buildout of liquidity. It
might be that we develop a trend day

7050
02:51:10,870 --> 02:51:10,880
might be that we develop a trend day
 

7051
02:51:10,880 --> 02:51:12,550
might be that we develop a trend day
tomorrow or later in the week where we

7052
02:51:12,550 --> 02:51:12,560
tomorrow or later in the week where we
 

7053
02:51:12,560 --> 02:51:15,030
tomorrow or later in the week where we
do this. Very well could happen. It

7054
02:51:15,030 --> 02:51:15,040
do this. Very well could happen. It
 

7055
02:51:15,040 --> 02:51:17,510
do this. Very well could happen. It
might also be that they say, "Hey,

7056
02:51:17,510 --> 02:51:17,520
might also be that they say, "Hey,
 

7057
02:51:17,520 --> 02:51:20,710
might also be that they say, "Hey,
enough. We need to repric a bit. Let's

7058
02:51:20,710 --> 02:51:20,720
enough. We need to repric a bit. Let's
 

7059
02:51:20,720 --> 02:51:22,389
enough. We need to repric a bit. Let's
look left. We want to come back and

7060
02:51:22,389 --> 02:51:22,399
look left. We want to come back and
 

7061
02:51:22,399 --> 02:51:24,550
look left. We want to come back and
visit here." That can also happen. And

7062
02:51:24,550 --> 02:51:24,560
visit here." That can also happen. And
 

7063
02:51:24,560 --> 02:51:26,230
visit here." That can also happen. And
it's what happens in here that creates

7064
02:51:26,230 --> 02:51:26,240
it's what happens in here that creates
 

7065
02:51:26,240 --> 02:51:27,830
it's what happens in here that creates
the liquidity to do that. This is your

7066
02:51:27,830 --> 02:51:27,840
the liquidity to do that. This is your
 

7067
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:30,630
the liquidity to do that. This is your
edgetoedge day. You had trend day one,

7068
02:51:30,630 --> 02:51:30,640
edgetoedge day. You had trend day one,
 

7069
02:51:30,640 --> 02:51:32,309
edgetoedge day. You had trend day one,
trend day two. You had last night as

7070
02:51:32,309 --> 02:51:32,319
trend day two. You had last night as
 

7071
02:51:32,319 --> 02:51:35,990
trend day two. You had last night as
well. Sorry, Friday, Monday, last night.

7072
02:51:35,990 --> 02:51:36,000
well. Sorry, Friday, Monday, last night.
 

7073
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:37,990
well. Sorry, Friday, Monday, last night.
Don't expect it every single time.

7074
02:51:37,990 --> 02:51:38,000
Don't expect it every single time.
 

7075
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,710
Don't expect it every single time.
Right? Understand we lack liquidity.

7076
02:51:40,710 --> 02:51:40,720
Right? Understand we lack liquidity.
 

7077
02:51:40,720 --> 02:51:42,230
Right? Understand we lack liquidity.
Now, what you what you have to ask

7078
02:51:42,230 --> 02:51:42,240
Now, what you what you have to ask
 

7079
02:51:42,240 --> 02:51:44,630
Now, what you what you have to ask
yourself is why are we moving lower? Why

7080
02:51:44,630 --> 02:51:44,640
yourself is why are we moving lower? Why
 

7081
02:51:44,640 --> 02:51:46,150
yourself is why are we moving lower? Why
if we're here, are we moving lower this

7082
02:51:46,150 --> 02:51:46,160
if we're here, are we moving lower this
 

7083
02:51:46,160 --> 02:51:47,990
if we're here, are we moving lower this
morning? If there's if there's no way

7084
02:51:47,990 --> 02:51:48,000
morning? If there's if there's no way
 

7085
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:49,590
morning? If there's if there's no way
there's no one to abuse, we've got like

7086
02:51:49,590 --> 02:51:49,600
there's no one to abuse, we've got like
 

7087
02:51:49,600 --> 02:51:52,230
there's no one to abuse, we've got like
really light volume here to move lower.

7088
02:51:52,230 --> 02:51:52,240
really light volume here to move lower.
 

7089
02:51:52,240 --> 02:51:53,990
really light volume here to move lower.
So, we need to build volume out into

7090
02:51:53,990 --> 02:51:54,000
So, we need to build volume out into
 

7091
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:55,670
So, we need to build volume out into
this. Even if we're going to move lower

7092
02:51:55,670 --> 02:51:55,680
this. Even if we're going to move lower
 

7093
02:51:55,680 --> 02:51:57,269
this. Even if we're going to move lower
or higher, we still need to build volume

7094
02:51:57,269 --> 02:51:57,279
or higher, we still need to build volume
 

7095
02:51:57,279 --> 02:51:59,110
or higher, we still need to build volume
out. So, that's what I'd be looking at.

7096
02:51:59,110 --> 02:51:59,120
out. So, that's what I'd be looking at.
 

7097
02:51:59,120 --> 02:52:01,910
out. So, that's what I'd be looking at.
If we zoom in, it's just the same levels

7098
02:52:01,910 --> 02:52:01,920
If we zoom in, it's just the same levels
 

7099
02:52:01,920 --> 02:52:05,670
If we zoom in, it's just the same levels
of rotation. Okay. Your edges

7100
02:52:05,670 --> 02:52:05,680
of rotation. Okay. Your edges
 

7101
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:08,309
of rotation. Okay. Your edges
are here,

7102
02:52:08,309 --> 02:52:08,319
are here,
 

7103
02:52:08,319 --> 02:52:10,070
are here,
here, and your bullish. I mean, it's

7104
02:52:10,070 --> 02:52:10,080
here, and your bullish. I mean, it's
 

7105
02:52:10,080 --> 02:52:11,590
here, and your bullish. I mean, it's
looking worse and worse. Look at this

7106
02:52:11,590 --> 02:52:11,600
looking worse and worse. Look at this
 

7107
02:52:11,600 --> 02:52:14,710
looking worse and worse. Look at this
fat old profile. This is

7108
02:52:14,710 --> 02:52:14,720
fat old profile. This is
 

7109
02:52:14,720 --> 02:52:17,510
fat old profile. This is
screaming rotation. All right, because

7110
02:52:17,510 --> 02:52:17,520
screaming rotation. All right, because
 

7111
02:52:17,520 --> 02:52:19,750
screaming rotation. All right, because
we're starting to lack low volume nodes.

7112
02:52:19,750 --> 02:52:19,760
we're starting to lack low volume nodes.
 

7113
02:52:19,760 --> 02:52:20,950
we're starting to lack low volume nodes.
They're just building the whole thing

7114
02:52:20,950 --> 02:52:20,960
They're just building the whole thing
 

7115
02:52:20,960 --> 02:52:22,309
They're just building the whole thing
out. This is probably just going to do

7116
02:52:22,309 --> 02:52:22,319
out. This is probably just going to do
 

7117
02:52:22,319 --> 02:52:23,830
out. This is probably just going to do
this all day. If we break above and

7118
02:52:23,830 --> 02:52:23,840
this all day. If we break above and
 

7119
02:52:23,840 --> 02:52:25,590
this all day. If we break above and
hold, we're going here. If we break

7120
02:52:25,590 --> 02:52:25,600
hold, we're going here. If we break
 

7121
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:28,950
hold, we're going here. If we break
below and hold, this and this. Other

7122
02:52:28,950 --> 02:52:28,960
below and hold, this and this. Other
 

7123
02:52:28,960 --> 02:52:30,469
below and hold, this and this. Other
than that, you're trading edge to edge

7124
02:52:30,469 --> 02:52:30,479
than that, you're trading edge to edge
 

7125
02:52:30,479 --> 02:52:32,870
than that, you're trading edge to edge
or like me, you're leaving it alone.

7126
02:52:32,870 --> 02:52:32,880
or like me, you're leaving it alone.
 

7127
02:52:32,880 --> 02:52:37,429
or like me, you're leaving it alone.
leaving it alone. Um,

7128
02:52:37,429 --> 02:52:37,439

 

7129
02:52:37,439 --> 02:52:40,469

no, only one only only one winner. Only
