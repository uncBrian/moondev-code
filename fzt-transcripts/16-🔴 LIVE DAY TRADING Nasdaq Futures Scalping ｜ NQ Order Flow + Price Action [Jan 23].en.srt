1
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,790

There we go.

2
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
There we go.
 

3
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,909
There we go.
Morning everyone. How's it going? How's

Morning everyone. How's it going? How's
it going? Hopefully you had a good uh

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
it going? Hopefully you had a good uh
 

7
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,469
it going? Hopefully you had a good uh
GlobeEx session or a good pre-market

8
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
GlobeEx session or a good pre-market
 

9
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,309
GlobeEx session or a good pre-market
session. Market is moving, but we are

10
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
session. Market is moving, but we are
 

11
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,110
session. Market is moving, but we are
inside previous days range. So, as

12
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
inside previous days range. So, as
 

13
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,990
inside previous days range. So, as
always, we're going to start on the

14
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
always, we're going to start on the
 

15
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,510
always, we're going to start on the
dailies here. Let's just zoom in a

16
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
dailies here. Let's just zoom in a
 

17
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,710
dailies here. Let's just zoom in a
minute. This key level up here, we still

18
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
minute. This key level up here, we still
 

19
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,110
minute. This key level up here, we still
cannot find acceptance over 700. You can

20
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
cannot find acceptance over 700. You can
 

21
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,510
cannot find acceptance over 700. You can
see on a daily every push over has

22
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,520
see on a daily every push over has
 

23
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,270
see on a daily every push over has
failed. All right. And we're trading

24
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
failed. All right. And we're trading
 

25
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,629
failed. All right. And we're trading
back inside what? Inside previous day.

26
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
back inside what? Inside previous day.
 

27
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,950
back inside what? Inside previous day.
All right. So, we have an inside bar to

28
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
All right. So, we have an inside bar to
 

29
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,390
All right. So, we have an inside bar to
start the session. All right. That's the

30
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
start the session. All right. That's the
 

31
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,830
start the session. All right. That's the
first thing we're thinking about. Inside

32
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
first thing we're thinking about. Inside
 

33
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,270
first thing we're thinking about. Inside
bar, which means what? We're probably

34
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
bar, which means what? We're probably
 

35
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,569
bar, which means what? We're probably
going to build liquidity, which means

36
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:15,579
going to build liquidity, which means
 

37
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:17,270
going to build liquidity, which means
[snorts] on an inside bar, we're aware

38
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
[snorts] on an inside bar, we're aware
 

39
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,830
[snorts] on an inside bar, we're aware
of the previous day high and lows. All

40
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840
of the previous day high and lows. All
 

41
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,189
of the previous day high and lows. All
right. And we're either looking for a

42
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
right. And we're either looking for a
 

43
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,189
right. And we're either looking for a
breakout and continuation or we're

44
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
breakout and continuation or we're
 

45
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,870
breakout and continuation or we're
looking for a failed breakout and return

46
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:24,880
looking for a failed breakout and return
 

47
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,309
looking for a failed breakout and return
inside. Failed breakout and return

48
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
inside. Failed breakout and return
 

49
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,749
inside. Failed breakout and return
inside. So, that's the first thing.

50
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
inside. So, that's the first thing.
 

51
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,990
inside. So, that's the first thing.
We're inside a range. Second thing to

52
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
We're inside a range. Second thing to
 

53
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,830
We're inside a range. Second thing to
note is this gap. We didn't quite uh

54
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
note is this gap. We didn't quite uh
 

55
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,909
note is this gap. We didn't quite uh
take out these uh and fill this sort of

56
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
take out these uh and fill this sort of
 

57
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,430
take out these uh and fill this sort of
imbalance yesterday. We talked about it

58
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
imbalance yesterday. We talked about it
 

59
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,350
imbalance yesterday. We talked about it
many many many times in the New York

60
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
many many many times in the New York
 

61
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,749
many many many times in the New York
session. All right. And we're also stuck

62
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
session. All right. And we're also stuck
 

63
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,469
session. All right. And we're also stuck
between the 20-day and [snorts] the 5day

64
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
between the 20-day and [snorts] the 5day
 

65
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,629
between the 20-day and [snorts] the 5day
50-day also in here. So, we're rotating

66
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
50-day also in here. So, we're rotating
 

67
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,990
50-day also in here. So, we're rotating
between this. This is a very common

68
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
between this. This is a very common
 

69
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,830
between this. This is a very common
liquidity building phase of a market

70
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
liquidity building phase of a market
 

71
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,670
liquidity building phase of a market
between a 5day and a 20-day while it

72
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
between a 5day and a 20-day while it
 

73
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,830
between a 5day and a 20-day while it
makes its mind up. This can change to

74
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:53,840
makes its mind up. This can change to
 

75
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,150
makes its mind up. This can change to
blue. We don't need this like this now.

76
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
blue. We don't need this like this now.
 

77
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,070
blue. We don't need this like this now.
Right. And you can see we're trying we

78
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
Right. And you can see we're trying we
 

79
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,869
Right. And you can see we're trying we
are trying to hold the edge of balance

80
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
are trying to hold the edge of balance
 

81
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,029
are trying to hold the edge of balance
here which is moving as I zoom out zoom

82
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
here which is moving as I zoom out zoom
 

83
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,469
here which is moving as I zoom out zoom
out a bit more. We're trying to hold

84
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
out a bit more. We're trying to hold
 

85
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,150
out a bit more. We're trying to hold
this edge of balance and we keep getting

86
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
this edge of balance and we keep getting
 

87
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,189
this edge of balance and we keep getting
stuck in this node towards the sort of

88
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
stuck in this node towards the sort of
 

89
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,189
stuck in this node towards the sort of
690700s.

90
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:11,199
690700s.
 

91
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,110
690700s.
Right? It's a big problem area for the

92
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
Right? It's a big problem area for the
 

93
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,950
Right? It's a big problem area for the
market. Let's move down into the hourlys

94
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
market. Let's move down into the hourlys
 

95
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,629
market. Let's move down into the hourlys
and see what we get. Here we go.

96
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
and see what we get. Here we go.
 

97
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,350
and see what we get. Here we go.
Get rid of this little guy. Okay.

98
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
Get rid of this little guy. Okay.
 

99
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,110
Get rid of this little guy. Okay.
Developing week profile. You can see

100
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
Developing week profile. You can see
 

101
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,830
Developing week profile. You can see
we're trying, we are attempting to find,

102
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
we're trying, we are attempting to find,
 

103
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,189
we're trying, we are attempting to find,
let's make this a bit bigger for you

104
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
let's make this a bit bigger for you
 

105
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,589
let's make this a bit bigger for you
guys. We are attempting to hold above it

106
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
guys. We are attempting to hold above it
 

107
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,110
guys. We are attempting to hold above it
right now. This is the developing week

108
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
right now. This is the developing week
 

109
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,709
right now. This is the developing week
profile. You can see from yesterday and

110
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
profile. You can see from yesterday and
 

111
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,029
profile. You can see from yesterday and
current day, well, really from Wednesday

112
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
current day, well, really from Wednesday
 

113
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,029
current day, well, really from Wednesday
all the way into now, we've built out a

114
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
all the way into now, we've built out a
 

115
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,870
all the way into now, we've built out a
huge amount of liquidity up here. You

116
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
huge amount of liquidity up here. You
 

117
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,710
huge amount of liquidity up here. You
can see we're very actually thin on the

118
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720
can see we're very actually thin on the
 

119
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,070
can see we're very actually thin on the
developing week in here. All right? So,

120
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
developing week in here. All right? So,
 

121
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,470
developing week in here. All right? So,
we don't really get thick until 416s

122
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
we don't really get thick until 416s
 

123
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,190
we don't really get thick until 416s
again. So, there is a case. All right.

124
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
again. So, there is a case. All right.
 

125
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,829
again. So, there is a case. All right.
There's an argument that if we start

126
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
There's an argument that if we start
 

127
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,829
There's an argument that if we start
breaking below this edge, let's [snorts]

128
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
breaking below this edge, let's [snorts]
 

129
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,990
breaking below this edge, let's [snorts]
call it 550s. All right. If we start

130
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
call it 550s. All right. If we start
 

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,550
call it 550s. All right. If we start
breaking below and failing that 550s,

132
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
breaking below and failing that 550s,
 

133
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,710
breaking below and failing that 550s,
there is an argument for the rotation

134
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
there is an argument for the rotation
 

135
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,310
there is an argument for the rotation
down towards 420s and 330s. I can see

136
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
down towards 420s and 330s. I can see
 

137
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,470
down towards 420s and 330s. I can see
that happening. We are thin in here like

138
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
that happening. We are thin in here like
 

139
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,750
that happening. We are thin in here like
we talked about. All right. At the

140
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:11,760
we talked about. All right. At the
 

141
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,150
we talked about. All right. At the
moment, every pull back into there is

142
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
moment, every pull back into there is
 

143
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,990
moment, every pull back into there is
being bid up and being bid up, but we're

144
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
being bid up and being bid up, but we're
 

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,509
being bid up and being bid up, but we're
back to this same area. You can see

146
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
back to this same area. You can see
 

147
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,670
back to this same area. You can see
we've had three drives now. One, two,

148
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
we've had three drives now. One, two,
 

149
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,070
we've had three drives now. One, two,
three. We're starting to see potential

150
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
three. We're starting to see potential
 

151
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,470
three. We're starting to see potential
backside into this key level here, 636s.

152
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
backside into this key level here, 636s.
 

153
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,630
backside into this key level here, 636s.
All right, so that's kind of the trigger

154
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
All right, so that's kind of the trigger
 

155
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,501
All right, so that's kind of the trigger
right now. We're watching 636es. Do

156
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:30,511
right now. We're watching 636es. Do
 

157
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:31,590
right now. We're watching 636es. Do
[clears throat] we reclaim and say

158
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
[clears throat] we reclaim and say
 

159
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,430
[clears throat] we reclaim and say
strong or are we looking for this fade

160
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
strong or are we looking for this fade
 

161
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,829
strong or are we looking for this fade
and the let go of sort of 550s for that

162
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
and the let go of sort of 550s for that
 

163
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,630
and the let go of sort of 550s for that
deeper rotation back down in towards the

164
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
deeper rotation back down in towards the
 

165
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,350
deeper rotation back down in towards the
sort of 340s, 350. So there is a move

166
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
sort of 340s, 350. So there is a move
 

167
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,750
sort of 340s, 350. So there is a move
there. There's a 200 point move there if

168
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
there. There's a 200 point move there if
 

169
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,150
there. There's a 200 point move there if
the market is willing to let go. But

170
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
the market is willing to let go. But
 

171
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,630
the market is willing to let go. But
what's going to be key is previous day.

172
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:48,640
what's going to be key is previous day.
 

173
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,670
what's going to be key is previous day.
So if we zoom up right now

174
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
So if we zoom up right now
 

175
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,990
So if we zoom up right now
and this should be previous day. Yes.

176
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
and this should be previous day. Yes.
 

177
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,790
and this should be previous day. Yes.
All right. Here's our rotation yesterday

178
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
All right. Here's our rotation yesterday
 

179
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,790
All right. Here's our rotation yesterday
and overnight. All right. Yesterday

180
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
and overnight. All right. Yesterday
 

181
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,269
and overnight. All right. Yesterday
failed to take out the highs,

182
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
failed to take out the highs,
 

183
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,230
failed to take out the highs,
failed to take out the lows. We drive

184
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
failed to take out the lows. We drive
 

185
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,630
failed to take out the lows. We drive
back up overnight. Failed to take out

186
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
back up overnight. Failed to take out
 

187
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,470
back up overnight. Failed to take out
the highs. We failed during London.

188
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480
the highs. We failed during London.
 

189
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,470
the highs. We failed during London.
Failed to take out the lows. You can see

190
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
Failed to take out the lows. You can see
 

191
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,870
Failed to take out the lows. You can see
this how much we're boxed in here. And

192
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
this how much we're boxed in here. And
 

193
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,389
this how much we're boxed in here. And
we're coming back down for this double

194
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:16,399
we're coming back down for this double
 

195
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,949
we're coming back down for this double
bottom. All right. So this is our box.

196
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
bottom. All right. So this is our box.
 

197
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,030
bottom. All right. So this is our box.
All right. This is your rotational box.

198
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
All right. This is your rotational box.
 

199
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,630
All right. This is your rotational box.
So outside of this box, you're either

200
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
So outside of this box, you're either
 

201
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,110
So outside of this box, you're either
looking for breakouts or fail breakouts.

202
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
looking for breakouts or fail breakouts.
 

203
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,710
looking for breakouts or fail breakouts.
Breakouts or fail breakouts. Breakouts

204
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720
Breakouts or fail breakouts. Breakouts
 

205
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,910
Breakouts or fail breakouts. Breakouts
or fail breakouts. In this box, this is

206
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
or fail breakouts. In this box, this is
 

207
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,470
or fail breakouts. In this box, this is
all you're expecting. All right. This is

208
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
all you're expecting. All right. This is
 

209
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,389
all you're expecting. All right. This is
liquidity building phase of the market.

210
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
liquidity building phase of the market.
 

211
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,750
liquidity building phase of the market.
All right. It was the same actually the

212
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
All right. It was the same actually the
 

213
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,750
All right. It was the same actually the
day before. Most of the liquidity was

214
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
day before. Most of the liquidity was
 

215
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,150
day before. Most of the liquidity was
built in here. All right. So those are

216
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
built in here. All right. So those are
 

217
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,590
built in here. All right. So those are
our big trigger points. Those are what

218
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
our big trigger points. Those are what
 

219
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,350
our big trigger points. Those are what
we have to watch right now. In fact, I'm

220
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
we have to watch right now. In fact, I'm
 

221
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,069
we have to watch right now. In fact, I'm
going to be somewhat cautious calling

222
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079
going to be somewhat cautious calling
 

223
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,670
going to be somewhat cautious calling
this demand. Let's just

224
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
this demand. Let's just
 

225
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,389
this demand. Let's just
make this a gray area more.

226
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399

 

227
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,430

All right. And really a letting go of

228
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
All right. And really a letting go of
 

229
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,310
All right. And really a letting go of
this guy here

230
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:04,320
this guy here
 

231
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,630
this guy here
will be what's important. All right.

232
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
will be what's important. All right.
 

233
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,750
will be what's important. All right.
Moving into lower time frame.

234
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:09,760
Moving into lower time frame.
 

235
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,269
Moving into lower time frame.
So you can see these same levels playing

236
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279
So you can see these same levels playing
 

237
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,430
So you can see these same levels playing
out. So if we start losing blue

238
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
out. So if we start losing blue
 

239
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,470
out. So if we start losing blue
definitely uh if we start losing this

240
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480
definitely uh if we start losing this
 

241
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,150
definitely uh if we start losing this
there is an argument for this drive down

242
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
there is an argument for this drive down
 

243
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,230
there is an argument for this drive down
into here. If we lose that there's an

244
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
into here. If we lose that there's an
 

245
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,230
into here. If we lose that there's an
argument for drive down into is it here?

246
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
argument for drive down into is it here?
 

247
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,870
argument for drive down into is it here?
No into this block here 300s. All right.

248
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
No into this block here 300s. All right.
 

249
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,269
No into this block here 300s. All right.
So if we start losing this target will

250
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
So if we start losing this target will
 

251
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,269
So if we start losing this target will
be this runners will be all the way down

252
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
be this runners will be all the way down
 

253
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,430
be this runners will be all the way down
here. If we do a fail breakout it will

254
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
here. If we do a fail breakout it will
 

255
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,870
here. If we do a fail breakout it will
look something like this. And we'll

256
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
look something like this. And we'll
 

257
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,030
look something like this. And we'll
target back the other side. Currently

258
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
target back the other side. Currently
 

259
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,110
target back the other side. Currently
previous day value area low previous day

260
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
previous day value area low previous day
 

261
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,990
previous day value area low previous day
value area high. previous week value low

262
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
value area high. previous week value low
 

263
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,790
value area high. previous week value low
and current week developing here as

264
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
and current week developing here as
 

265
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,590
and current week developing here as
well. So this this is huge on multiple

266
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600
well. So this this is huge on multiple
 

267
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,910
well. So this this is huge on multiple
time frames on on weekly and and

268
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
time frames on on weekly and and
 

269
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,150
time frames on on weekly and and
previous day levels.

270
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160
previous day levels.
 

271
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,630
previous day levels.
Okay. So in a rotational market don't

272
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:54,640
Okay. So in a rotational market don't
 

273
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,230
Okay. So in a rotational market don't
think beyond that right now. See money

274
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
think beyond that right now. See money
 

275
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,590
think beyond that right now. See money
take money until it proves otherwise

276
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
take money until it proves otherwise
 

277
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,470
take money until it proves otherwise
till we get out of the rotation.

278
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
till we get out of the rotation.
 

279
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,910
till we get out of the rotation.
Let's have a look what we're doing on

280
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
Let's have a look what we're doing on
 

281
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,069
Let's have a look what we're doing on
ES. Probably very much the same. Yeah,

282
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
ES. Probably very much the same. Yeah,
 

283
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,310
ES. Probably very much the same. Yeah,
you can see this pivot high that I put

284
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
you can see this pivot high that I put
 

285
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,870
you can see this pivot high that I put
in. Closed that gap. Well, almost closed

286
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
in. Closed that gap. Well, almost closed
 

287
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,310
in. Closed that gap. Well, almost closed
the gap. didn't quite get there. All

288
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
the gap. didn't quite get there. All
 

289
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,150
the gap. didn't quite get there. All
right, it's still yet to do this gap

290
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
right, it's still yet to do this gap
 

291
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,590
right, it's still yet to do this gap
fill. You can see yes, gap fill got an

292
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:13,600
fill. You can see yes, gap fill got an
 

293
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,829
fill. You can see yes, gap fill got an
alert still up there. We are starting to

294
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
alert still up there. We are starting to
 

295
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,550
alert still up there. We are starting to
hold a node here into sort of 30s,

296
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:18,560
hold a node here into sort of 30s,
 

297
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,310
hold a node here into sort of 30s,
right? Low volume node below. If we

298
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
right? Low volume node below. If we
 

299
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,990
right? Low volume node below. If we
start losing 30s, there's a case for a

300
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
start losing 30s, there's a case for a
 

301
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,590
start losing 30s, there's a case for a
drive all the way back down. But, you

302
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
drive all the way back down. But, you
 

303
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,110
drive all the way back down. But, you
know, you can see we've got lots of

304
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
know, you can see we've got lots of
 

305
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,269
know, you can see we've got lots of
nodes here on the way down. It's pretty

306
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:27,279
nodes here on the way down. It's pretty
 

307
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,069
nodes here on the way down. It's pretty
ugly because we built lots of liquidity

308
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
ugly because we built lots of liquidity
 

309
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,790
ugly because we built lots of liquidity
for this move and really the collapse

310
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
for this move and really the collapse
 

311
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,870
for this move and really the collapse
will need to come outside of this. We

312
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
will need to come outside of this. We
 

313
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,030
will need to come outside of this. We
have had relative strength on the daily

314
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
have had relative strength on the daily
 

315
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,790
have had relative strength on the daily
on the ES. Let's have a quick look at

316
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
on the ES. Let's have a quick look at
 

317
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,629
on the ES. Let's have a quick look at
the ETFs. We'll start with the spies.

318
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
the ETFs. We'll start with the spies.
 

319
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,110
the ETFs. We'll start with the spies.
We're looking at ES. Same kind of thing.

320
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
We're looking at ES. Same kind of thing.
 

321
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,110
We're looking at ES. Same kind of thing.
So, pivot is all the way down here. All

322
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
So, pivot is all the way down here. All
 

323
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,509
So, pivot is all the way down here. All
right. For the fill. So, buyers probably

324
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:47,519
right. For the fill. So, buyers probably
 

325
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,949
right. For the fill. So, buyers probably
hanging out right now around 85 and 84s,

326
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:50,959
hanging out right now around 85 and 84s,
 

327
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,870
hanging out right now around 85 and 84s,
waiting to see if they can find this

328
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
waiting to see if they can find this
 

329
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,389
waiting to see if they can find this
kind of move, especially if we don't

330
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
kind of move, especially if we don't
 

331
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,829
kind of move, especially if we don't
complete the gap fill. They might be

332
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
complete the gap fill. They might be
 

333
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,389
complete the gap fill. They might be
waiting for this. If we collapse 84s,

334
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
waiting for this. If we collapse 84s,
 

335
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,230
waiting for this. If we collapse 84s,
then there is the question of is this a

336
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
then there is the question of is this a
 

337
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,990
then there is the question of is this a
multi-le pullback which is just being

338
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
multi-le pullback which is just being
 

339
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,389
multi-le pullback which is just being
sold into into this balance for that

340
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
sold into into this balance for that
 

341
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,230
sold into into this balance for that
rotation back down. Obviously, we'll get

342
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,240
rotation back down. Obviously, we'll get
 

343
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,069
rotation back down. Obviously, we'll get
clean break of structure underneath

344
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
clean break of structure underneath
 

345
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,790
clean break of structure underneath
here. Very unlikely to come today, but

346
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
here. Very unlikely to come today, but
 

347
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,389
here. Very unlikely to come today, but
we can talk about that in the newsletter

348
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
we can talk about that in the newsletter
 

349
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,389
we can talk about that in the newsletter
for next week. Q's, same story. All

350
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
for next week. Q's, same story. All
 

351
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,470
for next week. Q's, same story. All
right, we actually filled the gap on the

352
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
right, we actually filled the gap on the
 

353
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,870
right, we actually filled the gap on the
Q's right here. All right, tech filled

354
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:18,880
Q's right here. All right, tech filled
 

355
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,509
Q's right here. All right, tech filled
the gap. Finding sellers here. This has

356
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
the gap. Finding sellers here. This has
 

357
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,870
the gap. Finding sellers here. This has
been the same story for weeks now.

358
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
been the same story for weeks now.
 

359
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,310
been the same story for weeks now.
Remember, this is a four or five week

360
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
Remember, this is a four or five week
 

361
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,590
Remember, this is a four or five week
balance range. Every time we're coming

362
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:25,600
balance range. Every time we're coming
 

363
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,670
balance range. Every time we're coming
up there, we can't seem to get back

364
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
up there, we can't seem to get back
 

365
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,110
up there, we can't seem to get back
through it, and we definitely can't seem

366
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
through it, and we definitely can't seem
 

367
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,590
through it, and we definitely can't seem
to get upside. So, do we come back down

368
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
to get upside. So, do we come back down
 

369
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,710
to get upside. So, do we come back down
to these 15s, right, this pivot in here

370
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
to these 15s, right, this pivot in here
 

371
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,430
to these 15s, right, this pivot in here
and find a bid? I don't know.

372
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
and find a bid? I don't know.
 

373
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,430
and find a bid? I don't know.
Potentially, potentially we sell through

374
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
Potentially, potentially we sell through
 

375
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,350
Potentially, potentially we sell through
it, but we're we're dancing between two

376
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
it, but we're we're dancing between two
 

377
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,550
it, but we're we're dancing between two
balance ranges. Dixie still falling down

378
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
balance ranges. Dixie still falling down
 

379
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,790
balance ranges. Dixie still falling down
like we talked about it would. VIX is at

380
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:46,800
like we talked about it would. VIX is at
 

381
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,150
like we talked about it would. VIX is at
an interesting level. All right, we're

382
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
an interesting level. All right, we're
 

383
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,150
an interesting level. All right, we're
still in this like huge channel. We

384
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
still in this like huge channel. We
 

385
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,670
still in this like huge channel. We
broke out. We've come back underneath

386
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:51,680
broke out. We've come back underneath
 

387
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,509
broke out. We've come back underneath
it. We're in these sort of two bid

388
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:53,519
it. We're in these sort of two bid
 

389
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,910
it. We're in these sort of two bid
zones. If I zoom out here, you'll see

390
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
zones. If I zoom out here, you'll see
 

391
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,590
zones. If I zoom out here, you'll see
how much congestion we've had in these

392
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:57,600
how much congestion we've had in these
 

393
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,670
how much congestion we've had in these
zones. So, if VIX can start holding a

394
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,680
zones. So, if VIX can start holding a
 

395
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,949
zones. So, if VIX can start holding a
bid and certainly it's going to need to

396
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
bid and certainly it's going to need to
 

397
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,350
bid and certainly it's going to need to
get over 1644s,

398
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
get over 1644s,
 

399
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,949
get over 1644s,
then we're looking for a drive up into

400
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
then we're looking for a drive up into
 

401
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,030
then we're looking for a drive up into
1740s and it's from that point that the

402
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
1740s and it's from that point that the
 

403
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,910
1740s and it's from that point that the
market might see weakness. If we if we

404
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
market might see weakness. If we if we
 

405
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,069
market might see weakness. If we if we
keep like rolling over here on the VIX

406
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
keep like rolling over here on the VIX
 

407
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,829
keep like rolling over here on the VIX
and coming down into the low teens,

408
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:13,839
and coming down into the low teens,
 

409
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,189
and coming down into the low teens,
you're probably more likely to see a

410
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:15,199
you're probably more likely to see a
 

411
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,910
you're probably more likely to see a
slow grind back upside.

412
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
slow grind back upside.
 

413
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,470
slow grind back upside.
All right, the MAG

414
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
All right, the MAG
 

415
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,030
All right, the MAG
still ugly. It's still ugly. All right,

416
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
still ugly. It's still ugly. All right,
 

417
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,030
still ugly. It's still ugly. All right,
inside a two-day balance range right

418
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,040
inside a two-day balance range right
 

419
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,710
inside a two-day balance range right
now. So, this is the low of week,

420
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
now. So, this is the low of week,
 

421
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,710
now. So, this is the low of week,
Tuesday. Anyone who's done the course

422
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:28,720
Tuesday. Anyone who's done the course
 

423
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,629
Tuesday. Anyone who's done the course
will see low week Tuesday. You'll know

424
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:30,639
will see low week Tuesday. You'll know
 

425
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,389
will see low week Tuesday. You'll know
what you're looking for there.

426
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399
what you're looking for there.
 

427
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,030
what you're looking for there.
Wednesday, we push back up. We set a pin

428
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,040
Wednesday, we push back up. We set a pin
 

429
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,110
Wednesday, we push back up. We set a pin
high. Thursday, we tried in we trade

430
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
high. Thursday, we tried in we trade
 

431
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,590
high. Thursday, we tried in we trade
inside Wednesday. Friday, we're opening

432
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600
inside Wednesday. Friday, we're opening
 

433
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,710
inside Wednesday. Friday, we're opening
up inside Thursday and definitely inside

434
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:42,720
up inside Thursday and definitely inside
 

435
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,110
up inside Thursday and definitely inside
of Wednesday. So again, we're building

436
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
of Wednesday. So again, we're building
 

437
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,710
of Wednesday. So again, we're building
balance right now in Apple.

438
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720
balance right now in Apple.
 

439
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,350
balance right now in Apple.
No real edge.

443
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,069

It's not so bad, but still stuck into

It's not so bad, but still stuck into

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,910
this pivot. Still cannot find acceptance
back through there. If Amazon gets back

448
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
back through there. If Amazon gets back
 

449
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,670
back through there. If Amazon gets back
in here, then you know what we've got,

450
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,680
in here, then you know what we've got,
 

451
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,990
in here, then you know what we've got,
right? If Amazon's able to get back in

452
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
right? If Amazon's able to get back in
 

453
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,590
right? If Amazon's able to get back in
there, then it's got a shot until that

454
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600
there, then it's got a shot until that
 

455
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,230

Google, this was strong a couple days

458
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
Google, this was strong a couple days
 

459
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,150
Google, this was strong a couple days
ago and opening up inside inside bar

460
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160

461
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,949
ago and opening up inside inside bar
here, right? Versus this pivot high on

462
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:18,959
here, right? Versus this pivot high on
 

463
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,750

looking pretty bad, right? So, that's

00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
looking pretty bad, right? So, that's
 

471
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,269
looking pretty bad, right? So, that's
the pivot. Uh, Meta

477
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,030

they find the bid over here, it's going

00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
they find the bid over here, it's going
 

483
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,750
they find the bid over here, it's going
to see a squeeze. We're back into the

00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:43,760
to see a squeeze. We're back into the
 

485
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,590
to see a squeeze. We're back into the

487
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,910
balance. Here's the balance, right?
We're back into it. So, does it hold the

488
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920
We're back into it. So, does it hold the
 

489
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,110
We're back into it. So, does it hold the
balance and try and come up to the

00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,120
balance and try and come up to the
 

491

you're probably going to see 626s again

579
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,590

right. I'm still interested if it comes

580
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:37,600
right. I'm still interested if it comes
 

581
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,590
right. I'm still interested if it comes
down here and scooping some more, but I

582
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
down here and scooping some more, but I
 

583
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,029
down here and scooping some more, but I
think longterm this would be all right.

584
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:41,039
think longterm this would be all right.
 

585
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,950
think longterm this would be all right.
But if if they want to give a weak flush

657
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,070

Yeah, you might well be right, Zar.

658
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
Yeah, you might well be right, Zar.
 

659
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,070
Yeah, you might well be right, Zar.
Yeah, we're in we're inside bar. We're

660
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
Yeah, we're in we're inside bar. We're
 

661
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,029
Yeah, we're in we're inside bar. We're
inside uh value. we are likely to see

662
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
inside uh value. we are likely to see
 

663
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,950
inside uh value. we are likely to see
rotation. So, we've got to look for, you

664
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:32,960
rotation. So, we've got to look for, you
 

665
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,789
rotation. So, we've got to look for, you
know, fail breakouts and edges or

666
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:34,799
know, fail breakouts and edges or
 

667
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,310
know, fail breakouts and edges or
breakouts if there's continuation

668
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
breakouts if there's continuation
 

669
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,710
breakouts if there's continuation
momentum if we stay heavy one side or we

670
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,720
momentum if we stay heavy one side or we
 

671
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,390
momentum if we stay heavy one side or we
stay [snorts]

672
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,400
stay [snorts]
 

673
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,870
stay [snorts]
uh aggressive the other side. But I am

674
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:42,880
uh aggressive the other side. But I am
 

675
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,630
uh aggressive the other side. But I am
very much like you. I don't like trading

676
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640
very much like you. I don't like trading
 

677
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,430
very much like you. I don't like trading
inside rotation very much unless we do a

678
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,440
inside rotation very much unless we do a
 

679
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,430
inside rotation very much unless we do a
big failure and we clean it all up one

680
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:49,440
big failure and we clean it all up one
 

681
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,350
big failure and we clean it all up one
side. That's when it gets more fun. What

682
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360
side. That's when it gets more fun. What
 

683
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,190
side. That's when it gets more fun. What
we didn't do yesterday, right? So, if

684
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,200
we didn't do yesterday, right? So, if
 

685
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,230
we didn't do yesterday, right? So, if
today wants to be nice, right, then we

686
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240
today wants to be nice, right, then we
 

687
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,070
today wants to be nice, right, then we
want to see it clean some of this up,

688
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,080
want to see it clean some of this up,
 

689
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,909
want to see it clean some of this up,
right? We want to see it come down here.

690
00:19:59,909 --> 00:19:59,919
right? We want to see it come down here.
 

691
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,590
right? We want to see it come down here.
And if we reclaimed this, then I'd be

692
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,600
And if we reclaimed this, then I'd be
 

693
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,430
And if we reclaimed this, then I'd be
long. From here to here, there's a

694
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
long. From here to here, there's a
 

695
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,029
long. From here to here, there's a
chance to be short. The continuation

696
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:05,039
chance to be short. The continuation
 

697
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,870
chance to be short. The continuation
runner is all the way down into here if

698
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:06,880
runner is all the way down into here if
 

699
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,750
runner is all the way down into here if
they let it go. So, but uh yeah, we're

700
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:09,760
they let it go. So, but uh yeah, we're
 

701
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,950
they let it go. So, but uh yeah, we're
just going to have to be careful. Gap

702
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:10,960
just going to have to be careful. Gap
 

703
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,470
just going to have to be careful. Gap
fill obviously is up here, which we've

704
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:12,480
fill obviously is up here, which we've
 

705
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,909
fill obviously is up here, which we've
already come into, but we haven't done

706
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919
already come into, but we haven't done
 

707
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,430
already come into, but we haven't done
it in the New York session yet. So, it

708
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,440
it in the New York session yet. So, it
 

709
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,870
it in the New York session yet. So, it
might be a morning drive up into that

710
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
might be a morning drive up into that
 

711
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,630
might be a morning drive up into that
and then see how we act in previous day

712
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:18,640
and then see how we act in previous day
 

713
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,789
and then see how we act in previous day
point control, yada yada yada yada. You

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,430
into here, but like we've seen the last
two days, they keep scooping it and not

930
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,440
two days, they keep scooping it and not
 

931
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,350
two days, they keep scooping it and not
cleaning anything up. So, it's somewhat

932
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:05,360
cleaning anything up. So, it's somewhat
 

933
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,669
cleaning anything up. So, it's somewhat
risky and dangerous. Google now gone

934
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:07,679
risky and dangerous. Google now gone
 

935
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,510
risky and dangerous. Google now gone
back red to green. Tesla trying to find

936
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:09,520
back red to green. Tesla trying to find
 

937
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,510
back red to green. Tesla trying to find
a bid. So, need to just let this settle

938
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
a bid. So, need to just let this settle
 

939
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,750
a bid. So, need to just let this settle
down here. Remember, we've got news 9:45

940
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:13,760
down here. Remember, we've got news 9:45
 

941
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:25,909
down here. Remember, we've got news 9:45
and 10:00.

942
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:25,919

 

943
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,669

And this just feels like the rest of the

944
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:27,679
And this just feels like the rest of the
 

945
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,430
And this just feels like the rest of the
week. They don't really know what they

946
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:29,440
week. They don't really know what they
 

947
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,789
week. They don't really know what they
want to do with it. I think they're just

948
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:30,799
want to do with it. I think they're just
 

949
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,870
want to do with it. I think they're just
trying to hold enough to get into

950
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:32,880
trying to hold enough to get into
 

951
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,470
trying to hold enough to get into
earnings without too much damage and

952
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,480
earnings without too much damage and
 

953
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:44,710
earnings without too much damage and
then make the decision.

954
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:44,720

 

955
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,630

Rejection in front of the gap fill on

00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:46,640
Rejection in front of the gap fill on
 

957
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,950
Rejection in front of the gap fill on
spy as well.

958
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:48,960

Trading between the 20-day and the 5day

also inside everything.

966
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:10,240

 

967
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,669

Be nice if they came and cleaned

968
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:11,679
Be nice if they came and cleaned
 

969
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,630
Be nice if they came and cleaned
everything out downside, but I wouldn't

970
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:14,640
everything out downside, but I wouldn't
 

971
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,669
everything out downside, but I wouldn't
trust it to do it.

972
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:19,679

 

973
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,149

Big rejection of VWAP on SPY. Big big

974
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:22,159
Big rejection of VWAP on SPY. Big big
 

975
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,909
Big rejection of VWAP on SPY. Big big
rejection of VWAP. Not cleaned out the

976
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:23,919
rejection of VWAP. Not cleaned out the
 

977
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,549
rejection of VWAP. Not cleaned out the
lows either. So, very much like

978
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:26,559
lows either. So, very much like
 

979
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,149
lows either. So, very much like
yesterday. Not cleaned out highs, not

980
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:28,159
yesterday. Not cleaned out highs, not
 

981
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:36,950
yesterday. Not cleaned out highs, not
cleaned out lows.

982
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:36,960

 

983
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,110

Let's see. If they reject uh previous

984
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:39,120
Let's see. If they reject uh previous
 

985
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,110
Let's see. If they reject uh previous
day value and New York open and this

986
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,120
day value and New York open and this
 

987
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,549
day value and New York open and this
shelf here, there's a chance for a

988
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:42,559
shelf here, there's a chance for a
 

989
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,070
shelf here, there's a chance for a
rotation here. They've built a shelf. If

990
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,080
rotation here. They've built a shelf. If
 

991
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,110
rotation here. They've built a shelf. If
they get through the shelf, then they

992
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,120
they get through the shelf, then they
 

993
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,590
they get through the shelf, then they
probably squeeze straight back to 20s.

994
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,600
probably squeeze straight back to 20s.
 

995
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,950
probably squeeze straight back to 20s.
So, they've got the chance for the

996
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:48,960
So, they've got the chance for the
 

997
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,029
So, they've got the chance for the
rotation to come and clean out the low.

998
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:51,039
rotation to come and clean out the low.
 

999
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,789
rotation to come and clean out the low.
It really depends what they want to do

1000
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
It really depends what they want to do
 

1001
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,470
It really depends what they want to do
with it. I'm not convinced of anything

1002
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:54,480
with it. I'm not convinced of anything
 

1003
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,269
with it. I'm not convinced of anything
right now

1004
00:26:59,269 --> 00:26:59,279

 

1005
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,190

into this low where they some sellers

1006
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,200
into this low where they some sellers
 

1007
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,909
into this low where they some sellers
keep getting stuck at 87s here.

1008
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:05,919

 

1009
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,070

If they trade through 87s, then there's

1010
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,080
If they trade through 87s, then there's
 

1011
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,430
If they trade through 87s, then there's
chance for them to trade down to 57s.

1012
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:11,440
chance for them to trade down to 57s.
 

1013
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,789
chance for them to trade down to 57s.
It's possible. Here's the 87s again. And

1014
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:14,799
It's possible. Here's the 87s again. And
 

1015
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,230
It's possible. Here's the 87s again. And
then if they get through that, there's a

1016
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:16,240
then if they get through that, there's a
 

1017
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,149
then if they get through that, there's a
chance to go back down to 540s, that

1018
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:18,159
chance to go back down to 540s, that
 

1019
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,870
chance to go back down to 540s, that
GlobeEx level, and then we can get weak.

1020
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:20,880
GlobeEx level, and then we can get weak.
 

1021
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,950
GlobeEx level, and then we can get weak.
So, it's building out liquidity in this

1022
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:22,960
So, it's building out liquidity in this
 

1023
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,149
So, it's building out liquidity in this
shelf here. Here's the 87s again. It's

1024
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159
shelf here. Here's the 87s again. It's
 

1025
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,430
shelf here. Here's the 87s again. It's
where sellers keep trying to trade

1026
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:27,440
where sellers keep trying to trade
 

1027
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,110
where sellers keep trying to trade
through. Unsuccessful so far. They're

1028
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,120
through. Unsuccessful so far. They're
 

1029
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,710
through. Unsuccessful so far. They're
trying again. They've come in with size

1030
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:30,720
trying again. They've come in with size
 

1031
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,070
trying again. They've come in with size
this time. They're trying to force it

1032
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,080
this time. They're trying to force it
 

1033
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,590
this time. They're trying to force it
lower. It's now point of control.

1034
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:33,600
lower. It's now point of control.
 

1035
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,510
lower. It's now point of control.
They've traded it so much.

1036
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:37,520
They've traded it so much.
 

1037
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,190
They've traded it so much.
Is there any follow through? No, still

1038
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,200
Is there any follow through? No, still
 

1039
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,549
Is there any follow through? No, still
no follow through. So, they can't get

1040
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:40,559
no follow through. So, they can't get
 

1041
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,789
no follow through. So, they can't get
through those 87s. Just a wick and

1042
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:42,799
through those 87s. Just a wick and
 

1043
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,310
through those 87s. Just a wick and
that's it. Point of control now for me

1044
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,320
that's it. Point of control now for me
 

1045
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,310
that's it. Point of control now for me
is shifted down there.

1046
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,320

 

1047
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,750

They're going to have another go into

1048
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:49,760
They're going to have another go into
 

1049
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,710
They're going to have another go into
these 80s. They're stacking now. 75, 70,

these 80s. They're stacking now. 75, 70,

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,590
these 80s. They're stacking now. 75, 70,
65, 55s, and there's a seller up at 620.

1052
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:55,600

65, 55s, and there's a seller up at 620.
This is awful, awful, awful action to

This is awful, awful, awful action to
 

1055

This is awful, awful, awful action to

cleaning each side out. Otherwise, we
 

1085
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,830
cleaning each side out. Otherwise, we
can't do anything especially on a

1086
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:39,840
can't do anything especially on a
 

1087
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,990
can't do anything especially on a
Friday. All right. rejection up at those

1088
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,000
Friday. All right. rejection up at those
 

1089
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,029
Friday. All right. rejection up at those
previous day value area low. Can they

1090
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:45,039
previous day value area low. Can they
 

1091
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,710
previous day value area low. Can they
clean out the other the lower side now?

1092
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:46,720
clean out the other the lower side now?
 

1093
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,029
clean out the other the lower side now?
Can they get acceptance under 87s?

1094
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:51,039

 

1095
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,110

If we start breaking down, I'll join it,

1096
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,120
If we start breaking down, I'll join it,
 

1097
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,669
If we start breaking down, I'll join it,
but not before.

1098
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:57,679

 

1099
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,669

Here's the 87s. Can they get under

1100
00:28:59,669 --> 00:28:59,679
Here's the 87s. Can they get under
 

1101
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,269
Here's the 87s. Can they get under
current value and start to snap? Looking

1102
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:01,279
current value and start to snap? Looking
 

1103
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,789
current value and start to snap? Looking
to see if we can find acceptance lower,

1104
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:02,799
to see if we can find acceptance lower,
 

1105
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,110
to see if we can find acceptance lower,
which we're starting to look for. Yes.

1106
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,120
which we're starting to look for. Yes.
 

1107
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,389
which we're starting to look for. Yes.
Okay, here we go. Beautiful. Lovely.

1108
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:08,399
Okay, here we go. Beautiful. Lovely.
 

1109
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,230
Okay, here we go. Beautiful. Lovely.
Fantastic. All right, in towards these

1110
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:10,240
Fantastic. All right, in towards these
 

1111
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,070
Fantastic. All right, in towards these
lows now. You can take a partial here if

1112
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,080
lows now. You can take a partial here if
 

1113
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,990
lows now. You can take a partial here if
you want or you can hold for 40s and

1114
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,000
you want or you can hold for 40s and
 

1115
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,310
you want or you can hold for 40s and
then all the way down underneath all of

1116
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:16,320
then all the way down underneath all of
 

1117
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,310
then all the way down underneath all of
this will be ideal if we can get very

1118
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:18,320
this will be ideal if we can get very
 

1119
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,549
this will be ideal if we can get very
very weak.

1120
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:22,559

 

1121
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,230

So this is demand here. If we can get

1122
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:24,240
So this is demand here. If we can get
 

1123
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,830
So this is demand here. If we can get
acceptance under here, we're looking to

1124
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:25,840
acceptance under here, we're looking to
 

1125
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,990
acceptance under here, we're looking to
trade under 40s and then down into this

1126
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,000
trade under 40s and then down into this
 

1127
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,149
trade under 40s and then down into this
block. And ultimately, if they really

1128
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:30,159
block. And ultimately, if they really
 

1129
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,230
block. And ultimately, if they really
want to get heavy, right, if we start

1130
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,240
want to get heavy, right, if we start
 

1131
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,269
want to get heavy, right, if we start
letting go of this uh current shelf,

1132
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:35,279
letting go of this uh current shelf,
 

1133
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,830
letting go of this uh current shelf,
which has developed at 560. All right,

1134
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:37,840
which has developed at 560. All right,
 

1135
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,029
which has developed at 560. All right,
if they let go of that, then we're

1136
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:39,039
if they let go of that, then we're
 

1137
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,190
if they let go of that, then we're
looking for a trade down into 470s and

1138
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,200
looking for a trade down into 470s and
 

1139
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,870
looking for a trade down into 470s and
ultimately 350s if they really want to

1140
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:42,880
ultimately 350s if they really want to
 

1141
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,470
ultimately 350s if they really want to
do it. But we're taking partials into

1142
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:44,480
do it. But we're taking partials into
 

1143
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,950
do it. But we're taking partials into
this blue box [snorts]

1144
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:46,960
this blue box [snorts]
 

1145
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,950
this blue box [snorts]
now. Need to see rejection of this next

1146
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:48,960
now. Need to see rejection of this next
 

1147
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,470
now. Need to see rejection of this next
try to come back in. Still watching the

1148
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:50,480
try to come back in. Still watching the
 

1149
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,389
try to come back in. Still watching the
mag. Tesla now starting to sell again.

1150
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:52,399
mag. Tesla now starting to sell again.
 

1151
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,789
mag. Tesla now starting to sell again.
Rest of the mag still holding on. Still

1152
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:54,799
Rest of the mag still holding on. Still
 

1153
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,870
Rest of the mag still holding on. Still
in a rotation. So, just scalping as we

1154
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:56,880
in a rotation. So, just scalping as we
 

1155
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:05,510
in a rotation. So, just scalping as we
go here.

1156
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:05,520

 

1157
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,990

The problem basically is

1158
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,000
The problem basically is
 

1159
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,830
The problem basically is
we can't find acceptance over this.

1160
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:09,840
we can't find acceptance over this.
 

1161
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,990
we can't find acceptance over this.
Sellers are trying to sell this. Buyers,

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,470
so you I can make you understand
are trying to bid this. All right? So

1166
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:16,480
are trying to bid this. All right? So
 

1167
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,070
are trying to bid this. All right? So
sellers are selling this. Buyers are

1168
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,080
sellers are selling this. Buyers are
 

1169
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,070
sellers are selling this. Buyers are
bidding this. This is the rotation. If

1170
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,080
bidding this. This is the rotation. If
 

1171
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,590
bidding this. This is the rotation. If
we find acceptance, we'll come down

1172
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:21,600
we find acceptance, we'll come down
 

1173
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,510
we find acceptance, we'll come down
here. If we can get back above this,

1174
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:23,520
here. If we can get back above this,
 

1175
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,029
here. If we can get back above this,
there's a chance to come up here and

1176
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:25,039
there's a chance to come up here and
 

1177
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,029
there's a chance to come up here and
finish this auction. Both sides of this

1178
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:27,039
finish this auction. Both sides of this
 

1179
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:41,430
finish this auction. Both sides of this
auction look messy.

1180
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:41,440

 

1181
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,430

Nice, Daryl. Yeah, you took that fade,

1182
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:43,440
Nice, Daryl. Yeah, you took that fade,
 

1183
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,070
Nice, Daryl. Yeah, you took that fade,
did you? Probably from value area low or

1184
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,080
did you? Probably from value area low or
 

1185
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,669
did you? Probably from value area low or
VW up or whatever into this level. I'm

1186
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:47,679
VW up or whatever into this level. I'm
 

1187
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,950
VW up or whatever into this level. I'm
waiting to see if we can get acceptance

1188
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:48,960
waiting to see if we can get acceptance
 

1189
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,789
waiting to see if we can get acceptance
lower here. It would be nice if we can.

1190
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:52,799
lower here. It would be nice if we can.
 

1191
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,149
lower here. It would be nice if we can.
Yes, looking like it's going to do it.

1192
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:54,159
Yes, looking like it's going to do it.
 

1193
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,669
Yes, looking like it's going to do it.
Yes, about to clean out that GlobeEx

00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:55,679
Yes, about to clean out that GlobeEx
 

1195
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,070
Yes, about to clean out that GlobeEx
level. Is NQ going to be kind and follow

1196
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,080
level. Is NQ going to be kind and follow
 

1197
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,211
level. Is NQ going to be kind and follow
through with it?

1198
00:31:00,211 --> 00:31:00,221
through with it?
 

1199
00:31:00,221 --> 00:31:02,870

Is NQ going to be kind and follow

Is NQ going to be kind and follow
through with it for these runners? I'm

1204
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:06,640
through with it for these runners? I'm
 

1205
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,430
through with it for these runners? I'm
willing to try and get into certainly to

1206
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:09,440
willing to try and get into certainly to
 

1207
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,029
willing to try and get into certainly to
here and possibly down here if they

1208
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:11,039
here and possibly down here if they
 

1209
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,029
here and possibly down here if they
really let it go, but at the moment

1210
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:13,039
really let it go, but at the moment
 

1211
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,990
really let it go, but at the moment
they're still bidding on this shelf.

1212
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,000
they're still bidding on this shelf.
 

1213
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,750
they're still bidding on this shelf.
Once this shelf lets go, there is a

1214
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:17,760
Once this shelf lets go, there is a
 

1215
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,430
Once this shelf lets go, there is a
chance for a wash. We need to be very

1216
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:19,440
chance for a wash. We need to be very
 

1217
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,269
chance for a wash. We need to be very
careful about fail breakouts today.

1218
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:21,279
careful about fail breakouts today.
 

1219
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,870
careful about fail breakouts today.
remember talked about it at the

1220
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:22,880
remember talked about it at the
 

1221
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,870
remember talked about it at the
beginning of the day because we're in a

1222
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:24,880
beginning of the day because we're in a
 

1223
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:32,789
beginning of the day because we're in a
rotation.

1224
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:32,799

 

1225
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,870

Starting to see some weakness come in

1226
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:34,880
Starting to see some weakness come in
 

1227
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,389
Starting to see some weakness come in
here. It's just can they get follow

1228
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:36,399
here. It's just can they get follow
 

1229
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,870
here. It's just can they get follow
through under these lows? That is the

1230
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:38,880
through under these lows? That is the
 

1231
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,990
through under these lows? That is the
question. Is there follow through

1232
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,000
question. Is there follow through
 

1233
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,710
question. Is there follow through
underneath this blue box? And this is

1234
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:42,720
underneath this blue box? And this is
 

1235
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,750
underneath this blue box? And this is
current developing profile, the high.

1236
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:45,760
current developing profile, the high.
 

1237
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,430
current developing profile, the high.
So, if we fail that, we're going to go

1238
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:47,440
So, if we fail that, we're going to go
 

1239
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,269
So, if we fail that, we're going to go
into the current weekly profile, which

1240
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:49,279
into the current weekly profile, which
 

1241
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,950
into the current weekly profile, which
is when we can really start rotating,

1242
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:50,960
is when we can really start rotating,
 

1243
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,630
is when we can really start rotating,
but they've got to fail under the

1244
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:52,640
but they've got to fail under the
 

1245
00:31:52,640 --> 00:32:00,149
but they've got to fail under the
moment. They keep absorbing on it.

1246
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:00,159

 

1247
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,990

Strong today. Nvidia starting to pull

1248
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,000
Strong today. Nvidia starting to pull
 

1249
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,750
Strong today. Nvidia starting to pull
back, but still holding green. Look at

1250
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:03,760
back, but still holding green. Look at
 

1251
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,990
back, but still holding green. Look at
that squeeze back up. They just very

1252
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,000
that squeeze back up. They just very
 

1253
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,750
that squeeze back up. They just very
much like the last few days, they cannot

1254
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:07,760
much like the last few days, they cannot
 

1255
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,590
much like the last few days, they cannot
let go of key levels. They can't even

1256
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:09,600
let go of key levels. They can't even
 

1257
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,070
let go of key levels. They can't even
clean them out. ES just cleaned out well

1258
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,080
clean them out. ES just cleaned out well
 

1259
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,509
clean them out. ES just cleaned out well
it cleaned out GlobeEx but it didn't

1260
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:13,519
it cleaned out GlobeEx but it didn't
 

1261
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,470
it cleaned out GlobeEx but it didn't
take out that 25 pivot.

1262
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:16,480
take out that 25 pivot.
 

1263
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:24,389
take out that 25 pivot.
It is messy. It's very very very messy.

1264
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:24,399

 

1265
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,950

Seriously, no follow through. All right,

1266
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:26,960
Seriously, no follow through. All right,
 

1267
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,070
Seriously, no follow through. All right,
runner's gone. That's that done all the

1268
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,080
runner's gone. That's that done all the
 

1269
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,070
runner's gone. That's that done all the
way back up to value area low.

1270
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,080
way back up to value area low.
 

1271
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,549
way back up to value area low.
This is why Alex hates trading rotations

1272
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:36,559
This is why Alex hates trading rotations
 

1273
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,590
This is why Alex hates trading rotations
because it's [\h__\h] to trade.

1274
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,600
because it's [\h__\h] to trade.
 

1275
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,070
because it's [\h__\h] to trade.
Uh, if you guys like it, maybe it's your

1276
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,080
Uh, if you guys like it, maybe it's your
 

1277
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,350
Uh, if you guys like it, maybe it's your
bread and butter. Some people love

1278
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:43,360
bread and butter. Some people love
 

1279
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:55,110
bread and butter. Some people love
rotational market.

1280
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,120

 

1281
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,190

All right, next node is up here into

1282
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,200
All right, next node is up here into
 

1283
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,669
All right, next node is up here into
26es. Squeeze will start to take place

1284
00:32:59,669 --> 00:32:59,679
26es. Squeeze will start to take place
 

1285
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,110
26es. Squeeze will start to take place
over that. There's definitely buyers

1286
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,120
over that. There's definitely buyers
 

1287
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,110
over that. There's definitely buyers
stuck at 650 today. All right, buyers

1288
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,120
stuck at 650 today. All right, buyers
 

1289
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,750
stuck at 650 today. All right, buyers
got stuck up here at 650.

1290
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:05,760
got stuck up here at 650.
 

1291
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,830
got stuck up here at 650.
See that right up here. All right, 650.

1292
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:07,840
See that right up here. All right, 650.
 

1293
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,269
See that right up here. All right, 650.
Lots of buyers got stuck above here. So,

1294
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:11,279
Lots of buyers got stuck above here. So,
 

1295
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,590
Lots of buyers got stuck above here. So,
let's see how they act if and when they

1296
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:13,600
let's see how they act if and when they
 

1297
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,549
let's see how they act if and when they
get up there.

1298
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:16,559
get up there.
 

1299
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,230
get up there.
This is really ugly, though. If we just

1300
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,240
This is really ugly, though. If we just
 

1301
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,070
This is really ugly, though. If we just
look at this for the last few days. All

1302
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,080
look at this for the last few days. All
 

1303
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,070
look at this for the last few days. All
right, just all these stops. Everyone's

1304
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,080
right, just all these stops. Everyone's
 

1305
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,750
right, just all these stops. Everyone's
just in check. Every dips's like a

1306
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:23,760
just in check. Every dips's like a
 

1307
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,110
just in check. Every dips's like a
higher low being absorbed, being

1308
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,120
higher low being absorbed, being
 

1309
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,789
higher low being absorbed, being
absorbed, being absorbed, but then they

1310
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:26,799
absorbed, being absorbed, but then they
 

1311
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,710
absorbed, being absorbed, but then they
can't take out the highs. It's really,

1312
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:28,720
can't take out the highs. It's really,
 

1313
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,190
can't take out the highs. It's really,
really not a nice auction to play.

1314
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,200
really not a nice auction to play.
 

1315
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,389
really not a nice auction to play.
Here's the squeeze now. [laughter]

1316
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:34,399
Here's the squeeze now. [laughter]
 

1317
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,950
Here's the squeeze now. [laughter]
So, they're coming for those 50s now.

1318
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:36,960
So, they're coming for those 50s now.
 

1319
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,549
So, they're coming for those 50s now.
Trying to see if that they can let that

1320
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:38,559
Trying to see if that they can let that
 

1321
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,990
Trying to see if that they can let that
buyer out who's a big delta at 50. Big

1322
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,000
buyer out who's a big delta at 50. Big
 

1323
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,430
buyer out who's a big delta at 50. Big
big delta at 50.

1324
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,440

 

1325
00:33:49,440 --> 00:34:03,509

Completely boxed in here.

1326
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:03,519

 

1327
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,350

Do they get the gap fill I guess is the

1328
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:05,360
Do they get the gap fill I guess is the
 

1329
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,110
Do they get the gap fill I guess is the
next question. Yes. Let that New York

1330
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,120
next question. Yes. Let that New York
 

1331
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:14,310
next question. Yes. Let that New York
open again.

1332
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,320

 

1333
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,310

More buyers caught up here so far above

1334
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:16,320
More buyers caught up here so far above
 

1335
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,389
More buyers caught up here so far above
30s. I don't trust anything I'm seeing

1336
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:18,399
30s. I don't trust anything I'm seeing
 

1337
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,389
30s. I don't trust anything I'm seeing
right now. We've done nothing really.

1338
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:20,399
right now. We've done nothing really.
 

1339
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,790
right now. We've done nothing really.
We've opened up, pushed, flushed,

1340
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:22,800
We've opened up, pushed, flushed,
 

1341
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,470
We've opened up, pushed, flushed,
reclaimed, and back to where we've

1342
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:24,480
reclaimed, and back to where we've
 

1343
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,550
reclaimed, and back to where we've
opened.

1344
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:26,560
opened.
 

1345
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:35,030
opened.
We haven't run anyone out.

1346
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,040

 

1347
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:45,990

VIX also trading at 16's flat right now.

1348
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,000

 

1349
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,510

There's previous day value area low

1350
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:47,520
There's previous day value area low
 

1351
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,909
There's previous day value area low
again and New York open. And if they

1352
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:49,919
again and New York open. And if they
 

1353
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:51,349
again and New York open. And if they
don't absorb this, we go all the way

1354
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:51,359
don't absorb this, we go all the way
 

1355
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,109
don't absorb this, we go all the way
back down to the lows in their

1356
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:53,119
back down to the lows in their
 

1357
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,030
back down to the lows in their
stupidity. If they absorb this, there's

1358
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,040
stupidity. If they absorb this, there's
 

1359
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,589
stupidity. If they absorb this, there's
a chance to take out 650 and close the

1360
00:34:57,589 --> 00:34:57,599
a chance to take out 650 and close the
 

1361
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,349
a chance to take out 650 and close the
gap. But I don't think they know what

1362
00:34:59,349 --> 00:34:59,359
gap. But I don't think they know what
 

1363
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,630
gap. But I don't think they know what
they want to do. I'm going to be honest

1364
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:00,640
they want to do. I'm going to be honest
 

1365
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,510
they want to do. I'm going to be honest
with you.

1366
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:03,520
with you.
 

1367

1371
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,510

We're just hanging around at BU for this

1372
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:15,520
We're just hanging around at BU for this
 

1373
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,790
We're just hanging around at BU for this
news.

1374
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:20,800

 

1375

Banging heads on brick walls.

1376
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:26,079

 

1377
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,550

Well, the good news is right that we've

1378
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:28,560
Well, the good news is right that we've
 

1379
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,670
Well, the good news is right that we've
created so much liquidity this week that

1380
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:31,680
created so much liquidity this week that
 

1381
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,349
created so much liquidity this week that
I would imagine if not next week, the

1382
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:33,359
I would imagine if not next week, the
 

1383
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,950
I would imagine if not next week, the
week after, we will have a big break out

1384
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:34,960
week after, we will have a big break out
 

1385
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,550
week after, we will have a big break out
of it one way or another. I do not think

1386
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:36,560
of it one way or another. I do not think
 

1387
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,390
of it one way or another. I do not think
we'll just keep going sideways around

1388
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:38,400
we'll just keep going sideways around
 

1389
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,470
we'll just keep going sideways around
these balance ranges for long. I think

1390
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:40,480
these balance ranges for long. I think
 

1391
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,910
these balance ranges for long. I think
the market will really struggle to do

1392
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:41,920
the market will really struggle to do
 

1393
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:49,190
the market will really struggle to do
that. Yes, rejecting New York open

1394

What are we doing?

1420
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:36,720
What are we doing?
 

1421
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,270
What are we doing?
No one knows. Clearly,

1422
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,280

 

1423
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,710

they're trying to get this squeeze up

1424

they're trying to get this squeeze up
 

1425
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:53,349
they're trying to get this squeeze up
here. They're just really struggling.

1426
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:53,359

 

1427
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,829

Lots of sellers up at 40s and 50s. They

1428
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:55,839
Lots of sellers up at 40s and 50s. They
 

1429
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,550
Lots of sellers up at 40s and 50s. They
can't even lift it up there right now.

1430
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:58,560
can't even lift it up there right now.
 

1431
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:05,990
can't even lift it up there right now.
This thing is just not moving.

1432
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,000

 

1433
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,829

They're trying.

1434
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:09,839

 

1435
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,670

They got to get through these highs to

1436
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:11,680
They got to get through these highs to
 

1437
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,190
They got to get through these highs to
clean out all these stops and then try

1438
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,200
clean out all these stops and then try
 

1439
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,870
clean out all these stops and then try
and get up to 700s if they're going to

1440
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:14,880
and get up to 700s if they're going to
 

1441
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,430
and get up to 700s if they're going to
do that.

1442
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:17,440
do that.
 

1443
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,310
do that.
Lots of selling up here. This is just uh

1444
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:20,320
Lots of selling up here. This is just uh
 

1445
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,990
Lots of selling up here. This is just uh
completely stuck on the book.

1446
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,000
completely stuck on the book.
 

1447
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:41,109
completely stuck on the book.
They're just stacked both sides.

1448
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:41,119

 

1449
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,870

If you look at the book right now,

1450
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:42,880
If you look at the book right now,
 

1451
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,349
If you look at the book right now,
there's bids 25 to 600 and there's

1452
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:45,359
there's bids 25 to 600 and there's
 

1453
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,670
there's bids 25 to 600 and there's
offers 40 to 60. It's literally just 20

1454
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:47,680
offers 40 to 60. It's literally just 20
 

1455
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,470
offers 40 to 60. It's literally just 20
points stacked each side. Right now,

1456
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:50,480
points stacked each side. Right now,
 

1457
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,270
points stacked each side. Right now,
we're just completely stacked. It's not

1458
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:53,280
we're just completely stacked. It's not
 

1459
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,030
we're just completely stacked. It's not
cleaning either out. No one knows right

1460
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,040
cleaning either out. No one knows right
 

1461
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,390
cleaning either out. No one knows right
now what they want to do with it. So,

1462
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:56,400
now what they want to do with it. So,
 

1463
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,990
now what they want to do with it. So,
I'm just like staying clear until

1464
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,000
I'm just like staying clear until
 

1465
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,470
I'm just like staying clear until
they're done and then we can hopefully

1466
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:00,480
they're done and then we can hopefully
 

1467
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,230
they're done and then we can hopefully
pick a direction at some point today

1468
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,240
pick a direction at some point today
 

1469
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:11,270
pick a direction at some point today
would be nice.

1470
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:11,280

 

1471
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,150

PMI 52.8 versus 52.7

1472
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,160
PMI 52.8 versus 52.7
 

1473
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,230
PMI 52.8 versus 52.7
estimate 53. I mean slightly cooler.

1474
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,240
estimate 53. I mean slightly cooler.
 

1475
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,990
estimate 53. I mean slightly cooler.
pretty much in line though.

1476
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,000

 

1477
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,870

Down we come then

1478
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:28,880
Down we come then
 

1479
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,270
Down we come then
into this edge probably at 90s. And if

1480
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:31,280
into this edge probably at 90s. And if
 

1481
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,109
into this edge probably at 90s. And if
they don't rebid this, then maybe we can

1482
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:33,119
they don't rebid this, then maybe we can
 

1483
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,710
they don't rebid this, then maybe we can
still clean out these lows if there's

1484
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:34,720
still clean out these lows if there's
 

1485
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,550
still clean out these lows if there's
actual follow through. But again, I'm

1486
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:36,560
actual follow through. But again, I'm
 

1487
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:44,310
actual follow through. But again, I'm
not really trusting anything yet.

1488
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:44,320

 

1489
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,950

So into these 80s again. Point of

1490
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:46,960
So into these 80s again. Point of
 

1491
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,670
So into these 80s again. Point of
control down here.

1492
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:49,680
control down here.
 

1493
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,589
control down here.

for me anyway on Ninja. They're trying
 

1495
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,790

to sell through it and they're not

1496
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:52,800

1497
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,550

If you're watching Bookmap right now,
you should see like there's so many

1509
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,710

And we haven't cleaned out these lows. I

1510
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:12,720
And we haven't cleaned out these lows. I
 

1511
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,990
And we haven't cleaned out these lows. I
mean, they should really have come and

1512
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,000
mean, they should really have come and
 

1513
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,349
mean, they should really have come and
tried to clean out the lows already.

1514
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:15,359
tried to clean out the lows already.
 

1515
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,910
tried to clean out the lows already.

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,550

Mag not in agreement either.

1554
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:50,560

 

1555
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,950

Yeah, just

1556
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:52,960
Yeah, just
 

1557
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,030
Yeah, just
be nice if it just comes to clean

1558
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,040
be nice if it just comes to clean
 

1559
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,870
be nice if it just comes to clean
something up today.

1560
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:58,880

 

1561
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,309

Trading around point of control right

1562
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:00,319
Trading around point of control right
 

1563
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,589
Trading around point of control right
now for me. Point of control is here.

1564
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:01,599
now for me. Point of control is here.
 

1565
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,950
now for me. Point of control is here.
Now it's shifted down.

1566
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:04,960
Now it's shifted down.
 

1567
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,309
Now it's shifted down.
No acceptance under it. Now we're

1568
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:06,319
No acceptance under it. Now we're
 

1569
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,510
No acceptance under it. Now we're
starting to see some bigger orders

1570
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:07,520
starting to see some bigger orders
 

1571
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,190
starting to see some bigger orders
starting to come onto the tape bid side

1572
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:09,200
starting to come onto the tape bid side
 

1573
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,430
starting to come onto the tape bid side
to be filled all the way down to 540s,

1574
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:11,440
to be filled all the way down to 540s,
 

1575
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,270
to be filled all the way down to 540s,
but

1576
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:13,280
but
 

1577
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,670
but
no, there's been no real selling to come

1578
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:15,680
no, there's been no real selling to come
 

1579
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,870
no, there's been no real selling to come
and clean anything out yet.

1580
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:20,880

 

1581
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,710

More news coming at 10:00, remember? And

1582
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:22,720
More news coming at 10:00, remember? And
 

1583
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,630
More news coming at 10:00, remember? And
then we're clean for the day. So maybe

1584
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:24,640
then we're clean for the day. So maybe
 

1585
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,309
then we're clean for the day. So maybe
after 10 we get some something a bit

1586
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:26,319
after 10 we get some something a bit
 

1587
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,790
after 10 we get some something a bit
cleaner.

1588
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:28,800
cleaner.
 

1589
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,030
cleaner.
ES trading near low of day right now. ES

1590
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,040
ES trading near low of day right now. ES
 

1591
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,030
ES trading near low of day right now. ES
looks like it wants to break down. NQ is

1592
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,040
looks like it wants to break down. NQ is
 

1593
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:44,230
looks like it wants to break down. NQ is
just holding up very very well.

1594
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:44,240

 

1595
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,069

Sellers right now are caught under 85.

1596
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:46,079
Sellers right now are caught under 85.
 

1597
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,550
Sellers right now are caught under 85.
So sellers need to get breaks under 85

1598
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:48,560
So sellers need to get breaks under 85
 

1599
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,550
So sellers need to get breaks under 85
and they are not getting it in this

1600
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:50,560
and they are not getting it in this
 

1601
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,430
and they are not getting it in this
market yet. So we have to be very

1602
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:53,440
market yet. So we have to be very
 

1603
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,710
market yet. So we have to be very
patient. Here's the squeeze because

1604
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:54,720
patient. Here's the squeeze because
 

1605
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,069
patient. Here's the squeeze because
those sellers are starting to get caught

1606
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:56,079
those sellers are starting to get caught
 

1607
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,630
those sellers are starting to get caught
under 85. They keep trying to get sell

1608
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:58,640
under 85. They keep trying to get sell
 

1609
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,309
under 85. They keep trying to get sell
underneath point of control. They're not

1610
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:00,319
underneath point of control. They're not
 

1611
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,670
underneath point of control. They're not
getting it. So we're reapproaching

1612
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:01,680
getting it. So we're reapproaching
 

1613
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,349
getting it. So we're reapproaching
previous day value area low. Come a bit

1614
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:03,359
previous day value area low. Come a bit
 

1615
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:07,430
previous day value area low. Come a bit
map. Catch up.

1616
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:07,440

 

1617
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,270

Still inside value. Still inside the

1618
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:09,280
Still inside value. Still inside the
 

1619
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,670
Still inside value. Still inside the
orb. Still no follow through. ES weaker

1620
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:11,680
orb. Still no follow through. ES weaker
 

1621
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,510

of the two.

1622
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:13,520
of the two.
 

1623
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,309
of the two.
Looking like it wants to break down.

1624
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:16,319
Looking like it wants to break down.
 

1625
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:17,910
Looking like it wants to break down.
I will join this if we start to see

1626
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:17,920
I will join this if we start to see
 

1627
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,750
I will join this if we start to see
weakness and follow through from sellers

1628
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:19,760
weakness and follow through from sellers
 

1629
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,550
weakness and follow through from sellers
until that point. No. Same with the

1630
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:22,560
until that point. No. Same with the
 

1631
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,390
until that point. No. Same with the
buyers. If we can if we reclaim and I

1632
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:24,400
buyers. If we can if we reclaim and I
 

1633
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,230
buyers. If we can if we reclaim and I
can see us starting to bid over here,

1634
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:26,240
can see us starting to bid over here,
 

1635
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,150
can see us starting to bid over here,
I'll be interested, but not until then.

1636
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,160
I'll be interested, but not until then.
 

1637
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,589
I'll be interested, but not until then.
Otherwise, there just there's just

1638
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:29,599
Otherwise, there just there's just
 

1639
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,870
Otherwise, there just there's just
nothing to do. It's just uh one of those

1640
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:32,880
nothing to do. It's just uh one of those
 

1641
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,790
nothing to do. It's just uh one of those
days.

1642
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:38,800

 

1643
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,390

Certainly not going to become liquidity

1644
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:40,400
Certainly not going to become liquidity
 

1645
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,829
Certainly not going to become liquidity
for them to go and run out of this

1646
00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:41,839
for them to go and run out of this
 

1647
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:50,950
for them to go and run out of this
market.

1648
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:50,960

 

1649
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,670

Best way of putting it, we're boxed in.

1650
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:53,680
Best way of putting it, we're boxed in.
 

1651
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,190
Best way of putting it, we're boxed in.
There's no buyers at the highs with

1652
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:55,200
There's no buyers at the highs with
 

1653
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,470
There's no buyers at the highs with
enough strength and there's no sellers

1654
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:56,480
enough strength and there's no sellers
 

1655
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,750
enough strength and there's no sellers
towards the lows with enough strength.

1656
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:57,760
towards the lows with enough strength.
 

1657
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,910
towards the lows with enough strength.
So, we're just getting tighter and

1658
00:42:59,910 --> 00:42:59,920
So, we're just getting tighter and
 

1659
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,190
So, we're just getting tighter and
tighter and tighter and tighter. Even on

1660
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:03,200
tighter and tighter and tighter. Even on
 

1661
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,630
tighter and tighter and tighter. Even on
a daily, you can see it. Here's the

1662
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:04,640
a daily, you can see it. Here's the
 

1663
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,069
a daily, you can see it. Here's the
squeeze all the way up because all those

1664
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:06,079
squeeze all the way up because all those
 

1665
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,309
squeeze all the way up because all those
sellers got stuck under 87. And now

1666
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:08,319
sellers got stuck under 87. And now
 

1667
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,069
sellers got stuck under 87. And now
we're back to value area high and point

1668
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:10,079
we're back to value area high and point
 

1669
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,510
we're back to value area high and point
of control up here. And can they

1670
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:11,520
of control up here. And can they
 

1671
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,829
of control up here. And can they
complete it to come and take out or at

1672
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:13,839
complete it to come and take out or at
 

1673
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,470
complete it to come and take out or at
least uh gap fill this? Probably not

1674
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:16,480
least uh gap fill this? Probably not
 

1675
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,069
least uh gap fill this? Probably not
because every time they've attempted it,

1676
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:18,079
because every time they've attempted it,
 

1677
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,550
because every time they've attempted it,
they've failed. But who knows? Tesla

1678
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:20,560
they've failed. But who knows? Tesla
 

1679
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,190
they've failed. But who knows? Tesla
suddenly found a bid out of nowhere.

1680
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:25,200

 

1681
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:34,790

Tesla found a bid out of nowhere there.

1682
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:34,800

 

1683
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,390

There you go. Back down to value area

1684
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:36,400
There you go. Back down to value area
 

1685
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,390
There you go. Back down to value area
low again. [laughter]

1686
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:42,400

 

1687
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,915

Well, this is fun. Not

1688
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:45,925
Well, this is fun. Not
 

1689
00:43:45,925 --> 00:43:48,950
Well, this is fun. Not
[laughter]

1690
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:48,960

 

1691
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,109

ES rejecting VWAP. We're just very tight

1692
00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:51,119
ES rejecting VWAP. We're just very tight
 

1693
00:43:51,119 --> 00:44:01,109
ES rejecting VWAP. We're just very tight
here, folks.

1694
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:01,119

 

1695
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:13,430

Oh my god.

1696
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:13,440

 

1697
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,670

But they can't even clean liquidity out.

1698
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:15,680
But they can't even clean liquidity out.
 

1699
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,670
But they can't even clean liquidity out.
Like I can't explain to you

1700
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:19,680
Like I can't explain to you
 

1701
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,470
Like I can't explain to you
how bad this is in both directions if

1702
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:22,480
how bad this is in both directions if
 

1703
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,550
how bad this is in both directions if
they can't clean some very basic

1704
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:24,560
they can't clean some very basic
 

1705
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,910
they can't clean some very basic
liquidity out. I don't think we can do a

1706
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:27,920
liquidity out. I don't think we can do a
 

1707
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,870
liquidity out. I don't think we can do a
thing with it. Like

1708
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:32,880

 

1709
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,470

they should have the ability to squeeze

1710
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:34,480
they should have the ability to squeeze
 

1711
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,550
they should have the ability to squeeze
here, but they don't. Look, every time

1712
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:36,560
here, but they don't. Look, every time
 

1713

They can't even close the gap and they

1716
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:39,200
They can't even close the gap and they
 

1717
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,550
They can't even close the gap and they
can't get under here.

can't get under here.
 

1719
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,550

00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:29,599
Val area high. They've got the chance to
 

1739
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:30,870
Val area high. They've got the chance to
squeeze to 50, but they got to get

1740
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:30,880
squeeze to 50, but they got to get
 

1741
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,790

the attempt to get up towards the 50s
that we talked about.

1794
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:49,760

 

1795
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,109

1799
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,950

Do you want the QQQ's closed their gaps

1800
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:56,960
Do you want the QQQ's closed their gaps
 

1801
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:05,430
Do you want the QQQ's closed their gaps
on the ETFs? I've just seen that.

1802
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:05,440

 

1803
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,710

They're trying to get up towards these

1804
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:06,720
They're trying to get up towards these
 

1805
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:16,870
They're trying to get up towards these
high days and 50s.

1806
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:16,880

 

1807
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,309

More buyers getting stuck up there

1808
00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:18,319
More buyers getting stuck up there
 

1809
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:29,270
More buyers getting stuck up there
again. No follow through on the push.

1810
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:29,280

 

1811
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,270

They're trying. Here they go. They're

1812
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:31,280
They're trying. Here they go. They're
 

1813

They're trying. Here they go. They're
really trying.

1814
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:34,960

 

1815
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,910

Here comes the 50s.

1816
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:37,920
Here comes the 50s.
 

1817
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,990
Here comes the 50s.
So was a buy stuck here. Once he gets

1818
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:40,000
So was a buy stuck here. Once he gets
 

1819
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,230
So was a buy stuck here. Once he gets
out, it should close the gap.

1820
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:44,240

 

1821
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,190

And I'll see what we do once we do that.

1822
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:47,200
And I'll see what we do once we do that.
 

1823
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,109
And I'll see what we do once we do that.
So gap fill yellow line. There we go.

1824
00:47:49,109 --> 00:47:49,119
So gap fill yellow line. There we go.
 

1825
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,829
So gap fill yellow line. There we go.
Finally, they're closing that gap.

1826
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:51,839
Finally, they're closing that gap.
 

1827
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,510
Finally, they're closing that gap.
So the question is, is this the

1828
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:53,520
So the question is, is this the
 

1829
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,030
So the question is, is this the
objective just to close this gap or is

1830
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:55,040
objective just to close this gap or is
 

1831
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,309
objective just to close this gap or is
there follow through through it? All

1832
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:56,319
there follow through through it? All
 

1833
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:57,589
there follow through through it? All
right, that's the question at this

1834
00:47:57,589 --> 00:47:57,599
right, that's the question at this
 

1835
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,230
right, that's the question at this
point. Was the objective just to close

1836
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:00,240
point. Was the objective just to close
 

1837
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,589
point. Was the objective just to close
this gap or is there follow through

1838
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:01,599
this gap or is there follow through
 

1839
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,750
this gap or is there follow through
through it?

1840
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:03,760
through it?
 

1841
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,829
through it?
So no cleaning up of the lows.

1842
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:07,839
So no cleaning up of the lows.
 

1843
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,990
So no cleaning up of the lows.
This is your gap fill. If we can get

1844
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:10,000
This is your gap fill. If we can get
 

1845
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,829
This is your gap fill. If we can get
over that into previous day point of

1846
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:11,839
over that into previous day point of
 

1847
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,430
over that into previous day point of
control will be their target and then it

1848
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:13,440
control will be their target and then it
 

1849
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,790
control will be their target and then it
just depends what the acceptance is.

1850
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:18,800

 

1851
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,390

See that yellow line how important it

1852
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:20,400
See that yellow line how important it
 

1853
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:30,549

was.

1874
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:55,520
because if we're doing something like
 

1875
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,950
because if we're doing something like
that you would expect the market to try

1876
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:56,960
that you would expect the market to try
 

1877
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,230
that you would expect the market to try
and do this means there's passive

1878
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:58,240
and do this means there's passive
 

1879
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,069
and do this means there's passive
sellers holding this market down right

1880
00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:00,079
sellers holding this market down right
 

1881
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:12,630
sellers holding this market down right
right now.

1882
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:12,640

 

1883
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,510

Can we buy now? I mean, for me, it's I

1884
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:15,520
Can we buy now? I mean, for me, it's I
 

1885
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,470
Can we buy now? I mean, for me, it's I
don't want to play this right now, but

1886
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:18,480
don't want to play this right now, but
 

1887
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,630
don't want to play this right now, but
I've been very clear. I don't do not

1888
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:20,640
I've been very clear. I don't do not
 

1889
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,030
I've been very clear. I don't do not
like taking rotations, right? So,

1890
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:23,040
like taking rotations, right? So,
 

1891
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,510
like taking rotations, right? So,
technically speaking, you could have

1892
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:25,520
technically speaking, you could have
 

1893
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,069
technically speaking, you could have
bought from here to here. TP1, TP2, and

1894
00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:28,079
bought from here to here. TP1, TP2, and
 

1895
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,150
bought from here to here. TP1, TP2, and
TP3. technically speaking, but you need

1896
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:30,160
TP3. technically speaking, but you need
 

1897
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,670
TP3. technically speaking, but you need
to be aware that if these sellers keep

1898
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:31,680
to be aware that if these sellers keep
 

1899
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,750
to be aware that if these sellers keep
stepping in here, that is possible

1900
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:33,760
stepping in here, that is possible
 

1901
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,750
stepping in here, that is possible
because we're in a rotation. Right? I

1902
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:35,760
because we're in a rotation. Right? I
 

1903
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,630
because we're in a rotation. Right? I
keep saying it. We are in a rotation.

1904
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:38,640
keep saying it. We are in a rotation.
 

1905
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,390
keep saying it. We are in a rotation.
Here is yesterday's rotation.

1906
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:42,400
Here is yesterday's rotation.
 

1907
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,349
Here is yesterday's rotation.
This is the current weekly rotational

1908
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:45,359
This is the current weekly rotational
 

1909
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,230
This is the current weekly rotational
high. This is current week value area

1910
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:48,240
high. This is current week value area
 

1911
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,150
high. This is current week value area
high, which we keep trying to bid off.

1912
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:50,160
high, which we keep trying to bid off.
 

1913
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,829
high, which we keep trying to bid off.
Their target would be point of control.

1914
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:51,839
Their target would be point of control.
 

1915
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,309
Their target would be point of control.
This is the most common value area from

1916
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:54,319
This is the most common value area from
 

1917
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:55,670
This is the most common value area from
yesterday. It's very possible from here

1918
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:55,680
yesterday. It's very possible from here
 

1919
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,670
yesterday. It's very possible from here
they sell. If they get through it, we

1920
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:57,680
they sell. If they get through it, we
 

1921
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,910
they sell. If they get through it, we
come up to previous day value area high

1922
00:49:59,910 --> 00:49:59,920
come up to previous day value area high
 

1923
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,670
come up to previous day value area high
and previous week value area low. The

1924
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:01,680
and previous week value area low. The
 

1925
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,349
and previous week value area low. The
question at this point is, can they find

1926
00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:03,359
question at this point is, can they find
 

1927
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,589
question at this point is, can they find
acceptance back up? Because if they

1928
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:05,599
acceptance back up? Because if they
 

1929
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,589
acceptance back up? Because if they
can't, we come back down again. Right?

1930
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:07,599
can't, we come back down again. Right?
 

1931
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,430
can't, we come back down again. Right?
We are in the middle of two balances.

1932
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:09,440
We are in the middle of two balances.
 

1933
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,430
We are in the middle of two balances.
We've said it for two days now. I went

1934
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:11,440
We've said it for two days now. I went
 

1935
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,750
We've said it for two days now. I went
over it pre-market. This is no man's

1936
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:13,760
over it pre-market. This is no man's
 

1937
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,589
over it pre-market. This is no man's
land. Between here and here is no man's

1938
00:50:17,589 --> 00:50:17,599
land. Between here and here is no man's
 

1939
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,309
land. Between here and here is no man's
land, right? This is a liquidity build

1940
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:20,319
land, right? This is a liquidity build
 

1941
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,150
land, right? This is a liquidity build
between here and here once they while

1942
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:22,160
between here and here once they while
 

1943
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:31,910
between here and here once they while
they make up their minds.

1944
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:31,920

 

1945
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,510

There you go. Human craft. [laughter]

1946
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:35,520
There you go. Human craft. [laughter]
 

1947
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,349
There you go. Human craft. [laughter]
Sell every push, buy every dip. Yeah.

1948
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:37,359
Sell every push, buy every dip. Yeah.
 

1949
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:38,790
Sell every push, buy every dip. Yeah.
Well, especially while we're in ro. You

1950
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:38,800
Well, especially while we're in ro. You
 

1951
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,270
Well, especially while we're in ro. You
just want to play the edges like this.

1952
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:41,280
just want to play the edges like this.
 

1953
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,150
just want to play the edges like this.
It's amazing to me, right? This is this

1954
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,160
It's amazing to me, right? This is this
 

1955
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,829
It's amazing to me, right? This is this
is current week value area high. It's

1956
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:45,839
is current week value area high. It's
 

1957
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,750
is current week value area high. It's
amazing to me that we haven't washed any

1958
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:47,760
amazing to me that we haven't washed any
 

1959
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,549
amazing to me that we haven't washed any
of this. Like we didn't wash this. Like

1960
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:50,559
of this. Like we didn't wash this. Like
 

1961
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,150
of this. Like we didn't wash this. Like
everything's being protected, which is

1962
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:52,160
everything's being protected, which is
 

1963
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,790
everything's being protected, which is
incredible. But that's the story, right?

1964
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:54,800
incredible. But that's the story, right?
 

1965
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,470
incredible. But that's the story, right?
We're protecting this. Until we see

1966
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:56,480
We're protecting this. Until we see
 

1967
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,670
We're protecting this. Until we see
this, there's no follow through

1968
00:50:59,670 --> 00:50:59,680
this, there's no follow through
 

1969
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,549
this, there's no follow through
until we see prints over this. There's

1970
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:02,559
until we see prints over this. There's
 

1971
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,230
until we see prints over this. There's
no follow through in here. We are

00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:04,240
no follow through in here. We are
 

1973
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,549
no follow through in here. We are
pinned.

1974
00:51:06,549 --> 00:51:06,559
pinned.
 

1975
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,549
pinned.
Right. This is midpoint. Do they pin

1976
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:08,559
Right. This is midpoint. Do they pin
 

1977
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,030
Right. This is midpoint. Do they pin
this or do we find acceptance back up? I

1978
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:11,040
this or do we find acceptance back up? I
 

1979
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,630
this or do we find acceptance back up? I
don't know, guys. I don't know. No one

1980
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:12,640
don't know, guys. I don't know. No one
 

1981
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,150
don't know, guys. I don't know. No one
knows. Anyone that tells you they know

1982
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:14,160
knows. Anyone that tells you they know
 

1983
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:27,589
knows. Anyone that tells you they know
is lying.

1984
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:27,599

 

1985
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,510

Okay, squeezing up previous day point of

1986
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:29,520
Okay, squeezing up previous day point of
 

1987
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,430
Okay, squeezing up previous day point of
control here. This red line. All right,

1988
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:31,440
control here. This red line. All right,
 

1989
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,589
control here. This red line. All right,
this red box is uh key level now. That

1990
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:35,599
this red box is uh key level now. That
 

1991
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,190
this red box is uh key level now. That
might well have been their target. ES

1992
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:37,200
might well have been their target. ES
 

1993
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:44,549
might well have been their target. ES
about to close its gap as well.

1994
00:51:44,549 --> 00:51:44,559

 

1995
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,270

And here comes the squeeze.

1996
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:47,280
And here comes the squeeze.
 

1997
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,829
And here comes the squeeze.
So, Apple the only one red. Now, here

1998
00:51:49,829 --> 00:51:49,839
So, Apple the only one red. Now, here
 

1999
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,670
So, Apple the only one red. Now, here
comes a squeeze up into previous week's

2000
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:51,680
comes a squeeze up into previous week's
 

2001
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,030
comes a squeeze up into previous week's
value area low. Remember, this is where

2002
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:53,040
value area low. Remember, this is where
 

2003
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,950
value area low. Remember, this is where
we cannot find acceptance through right

2004
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:54,960
we cannot find acceptance through right
 

2005
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,030
we cannot find acceptance through right
now. Every time we come over here, we

2006
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,040
now. Every time we come over here, we
 

2007
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,950
now. Every time we come over here, we
keep selling, but we need there are

2008
00:51:58,950 --> 00:51:58,960
keep selling, but we need there are
 

2009
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,549
keep selling, but we need there are
stops up here to clean up as well,

2010
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:00,559
stops up here to clean up as well,
 

2011
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,030
stops up here to clean up as well,
right? All the way to 740s. We talked

2012
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:03,040
right? All the way to 740s. We talked
 

2013
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,790
right? All the way to 740s. We talked
about it the last few days, right? We

2014
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:04,800
about it the last few days, right? We
 

2015
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,870
about it the last few days, right? We
kind of expected it to try and do it.

2016
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:06,880
kind of expected it to try and do it.
 

2017
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,470
kind of expected it to try and do it.
Um, and above that as well, actually

2018
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:10,480
Um, and above that as well, actually
 

2019
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,750
Um, and above that as well, actually
here, 750s. So, every time we come up

2020
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:13,760
here, 750s. So, every time we come up
 

2021
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,230
here, 750s. So, every time we come up
into those, we keep selling. But that's

2022
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:16,240
into those, we keep selling. But that's
 

2023
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,470
into those, we keep selling. But that's
ultimately what they're trying to get

2024
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:18,480
ultimately what they're trying to get
 

2025
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:30,630
ultimately what they're trying to get
through.

2026

Big old squeeze up. Big old squeeze up.

2028
00:52:35,109 --> 00:52:35,119
Big old squeeze up. Big old squeeze up.
 

2029

Big old squeeze up. Big old squeeze up.
He has now filled its gap. No closure

2035
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:04,636

>> Is that the same? Yeah, there abouts

2036
00:53:04,636 --> 00:53:04,646

 

2037
00:53:04,646 --> 00:53:12,230

[clears throat]

2038

2039
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,990

I mean, yeah. I mean, look, I just don't

2040
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:14,000
I mean, yeah. I mean, look, I just don't
 

2041
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,109
I mean, yeah. I mean, look, I just don't
love rotations, but they definitely pay.

2042
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:17,119
love rotations, but they definitely pay.
 

2043
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:18,790
love rotations, but they definitely pay.
Um, you don't need to hate them cuz I

2044
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:18,800
Um, you don't need to hate them cuz I
 

2045
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,470
Um, you don't need to hate them cuz I
hate them.

2046
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:20,480
hate them.
 

2047
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,309
hate them.
I like them when we clean a level up and

2048
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:22,319
I like them when we clean a level up and
 

2049
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,230
I like them when we clean a level up and
then we take and then we can go like I

2050
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:24,240
then we take and then we can go like I
 

2051
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,230
then we take and then we can go like I
feel much better about it then.

2052
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:28,240
feel much better about it then.
 

2053
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,230
feel much better about it then.
Okay. So, coming into previous week

2054
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:30,240
Okay. So, coming into previous week
 

2055
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,990
Okay. So, coming into previous week
value low, previous day value high.

2056
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:32,000
value low, previous day value high.
 

2057
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,270
value low, previous day value high.
Technically, we should probably kind of

2058
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:33,280
Technically, we should probably kind of
 

2059
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,750
Technically, we should probably kind of
take this out now. Um, you're very very

2060
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:35,760
take this out now. Um, you're very very
 

2061
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,670
take this out now. Um, you're very very
squeezy. Look from here. You're you're

2062
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:37,680
squeezy. Look from here. You're you're
 

2063
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,270
squeezy. Look from here. You're you're
almost 100 points up from this squeeze

2064
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:39,280
almost 100 points up from this squeeze
 

2065
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,710
almost 100 points up from this squeeze
trigger. All right, there's been no

2066
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:40,720
trigger. All right, there's been no
 

2067
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,549
trigger. All right, there's been no
significant pullback here. So don't be

2068
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:42,559
significant pullback here. So don't be
 

2069
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,829
significant pullback here. So don't be
chasing this long. All right, it's if it

2070
00:53:45,829 --> 00:53:45,839
chasing this long. All right, it's if it
 

2071
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,190
chasing this long. All right, it's if it
goes without you, it goes without you.

2072
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:47,200
goes without you, it goes without you.
 

2073
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,630
goes without you, it goes without you.
What you don't want to do is be chasing

2074
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:48,640
What you don't want to do is be chasing
 

2075
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,150
What you don't want to do is be chasing
the market long in a squeeze and then

2076
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:50,160
the market long in a squeeze and then
 

2077
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,990
the market long in a squeeze and then
have to sit through 50 60 points of draw

2078
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:52,000
have to sit through 50 60 points of draw
 

2079
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,910
have to sit through 50 60 points of draw
down. This thing's starting to really

2080
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:53,920
down. This thing's starting to really
 

2081
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,390
down. This thing's starting to really
start to move now.

2082
00:53:58,390 --> 00:53:58,400

 

2083
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,309

There's previous week value area low. So

2084
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:00,319
There's previous week value area low. So
 

2085
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:01,910
There's previous week value area low. So
this is the edge of the previous week's

2086
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:01,920
this is the edge of the previous week's
 

2087
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,390
this is the edge of the previous week's
balance and beyond that is a four-week

2088
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:04,400
balance and beyond that is a four-week
 

2089
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,630
balance and beyond that is a four-week
balance, isn't it? If we get through

2090
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:06,640
balance, isn't it? If we get through
 

2091
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,710
balance, isn't it? If we get through
previous week value low, I will say we

2092
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:08,720
previous week value low, I will say we
 

2093
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,790
previous week value low, I will say we
still have a naked point of control all

2094
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:10,800
still have a naked point of control all
 

2095
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,950
still have a naked point of control all
the way up towards 900 890s.

2096
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:14,960
the way up towards 900 890s.
 

2097
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,390
the way up towards 900 890s.
But I need to see us build out some

2098
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:16,400
But I need to see us build out some
 

2099
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,150
But I need to see us build out some
liquidity at this point, not just rocket

2100
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:18,160
liquidity at this point, not just rocket
 

2101
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:23,990
liquidity at this point, not just rocket
ship up.

2102
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:24,000

 

2103
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,150

Yeah, Vick's just Vick's just stuck. It

2104
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:26,160
Yeah, Vick's just Vick's just stuck. It
 

2105
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,990
Yeah, Vick's just Vick's just stuck. It
hasn't even closed its gap. It's very

2106
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:28,000
hasn't even closed its gap. It's very
 

2107
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:36,790
hasn't even closed its gap. It's very
odd.

2108
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:36,800

 

2109
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,309

I wait to see if there's a pullback

2110
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:38,319
I wait to see if there's a pullback
 

2111
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,630
I wait to see if there's a pullback
which is absorbed now or if we just give

2112
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:40,640
which is absorbed now or if we just give
 

2113
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,230
which is absorbed now or if we just give
this whole move back. But if there's a

2114
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:42,240
this whole move back. But if there's a
 

2115
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,750
this whole move back. But if there's a
pullback that's absorbed into previous

2116
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:43,760
pullback that's absorbed into previous
 

2117
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,510
pullback that's absorbed into previous
day point of control, otherwise into

2118
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:45,520
day point of control, otherwise into
 

2119
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,190
day point of control, otherwise into
640, I'd consider it. Or if we push

2120
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:49,200
640, I'd consider it. Or if we push
 

2121
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,950
640, I'd consider it. Or if we push
through and hold inside previous week's

2122
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:50,960
through and hold inside previous week's
 

2123
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,309
through and hold inside previous week's
value, I'd also consider it.

2124
00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:54,319
value, I'd also consider it.
 

2125
00:54:54,319 --> 00:55:27,910
value, I'd also consider it.
Certainly not buying up here.

2126
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:27,920

 

2127
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,390

Still squeezing. They've caught so many

00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:30,400
Still squeezing. They've caught so many
 

2129
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,910
Still squeezing. They've caught so many
shorts now. Still squeezing. Here's

2130
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:31,920
shorts now. Still squeezing. Here's
 

2131
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,990
shorts now. Still squeezing. Here's
previous day value area high now. Tagged

00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:34,000
previous day value area high now. Tagged

00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,390
Gloveex and previous day high above.
It's just not going to provide me an

2136
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:38,400
It's just not going to provide me an
 

2137
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,230
It's just not going to provide me an
opportunity to get into it. This is just

2138
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:40,240
opportunity to get into it. This is just
 

2139
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,230
opportunity to get into it. This is just
like the last few days. Once it goes, it

2140
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:42,240
like the last few days. Once it goes, it
 

2141
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:48,069
like the last few days. Once it goes, it
goes.

2142
00:55:48,069 --> 00:55:48,079

 

2143
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:49,829

So, we've completed full rotation from

2144
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:49,839
So, we've completed full rotation from
 

2145
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,270
So, we've completed full rotation from
previous day's value area low to

2146
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:51,280
previous day's value area low to
 

2147
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,030
previous day's value area low to
previous day's value area high. We only

2148
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:53,040
previous day's value area high. We only
 

2149
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,789
previous day's value area high. We only
have globeex and previous day high above

2150
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:54,799
have globeex and previous day high above
 

2151
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,789
have globeex and previous day high above
to aim for the 40s and 50s and above

2152
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:56,799
to aim for the 40s and 50s and above

to aim for the 40s and 50s and above
that it can potentially go and break

00:55:58,630 --> 00:55:58,640
that it can potentially go and break
 

2155
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,270
that it can potentially go and break
out. And just be very careful if if you

2156
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:01,280
out. And just be very careful if if you
 

2157
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,230
out. And just be very careful if if you
are long in any of this.

2158
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:02,240
are long in any of this.
 

2159
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,710
are long in any of this.
Congratulations. I mean, I guess I guess

2160
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:04,720
Congratulations. I mean, I guess I guess
 

2161
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,549
Congratulations. I mean, I guess I guess
you could have taken the point of

2162
00:56:06,549 --> 00:56:06,559
you could have taken the point of
 

2163
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,190
you could have taken the point of
control long. I don't love it, but we're

2164
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:09,200
control long. I don't love it, but we're
 

2165
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,630
control long. I don't love it, but we're
coming into the extremes here. You want

2166
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:10,640
coming into the extremes here. You want
 

2167
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,069
coming into the extremes here. You want
to be selling some into here and

2168
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:12,079
to be selling some into here and
 

2169
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,069
to be selling some into here and
potentially this is your target. All

2170
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:14,079
potentially this is your target. All
 

2171
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,910
potentially this is your target. All
right. potentially up towards a 900 is

2172
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:15,920
right. potentially up towards a 900 is
 

2173
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,589
right. potentially up towards a 900 is
the target, but this will be a congested

2174
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:17,599
the target, but this will be a congested
 

2175
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,510
the target, but this will be a congested
area here. We are in a straight squeeze.

2176
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:19,520
area here. We are in a straight squeeze.
 

2177
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,829
area here. We are in a straight squeeze.
You can see this for what the last 10

2178
00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:21,839
You can see this for what the last 10
 

2179
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,349
You can see this for what the last 10
minutes. It's gone nothing but squeeze

2180
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:23,359

and previous day. Come on. Come on,

2342
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:34,079
and previous day. Come on. Come on,
 

2343
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,390
and previous day. Come on. Come on,
Mark. Please don't do that. Please don't

2344
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:36,400
Mark. Please don't do that. Please don't
 

2345
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:45,990
Mark. Please don't do that. Please don't
get stuck between those two levels.

2346
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:46,000

 

2347
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,270

[\h__\h] market is so bad to trade for me

2348
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:49,280
[\h__\h] market is so bad to trade for me
 

2349
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,549
[\h__\h] market is so bad to trade for me
at the moment. It's been so bad. It

2350
01:01:52,549 --> 01:01:52,559
at the moment. It's been so bad. It
 

2351
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,470
at the moment. It's been so bad. It
offers these huge opportunities, but if

2352
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:54,480
offers these huge opportunities, but if
 

2353
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,190
offers these huge opportunities, but if
you don't get it exactly where it wants,

2354
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:57,200
you don't get it exactly where it wants,
 

2355
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,910
you don't get it exactly where it wants,
it's just gone. And then it does this

2356
01:01:59,910 --> 01:01:59,920
it's just gone. And then it does this
 

2357
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:05,349
it's just gone. And then it does this
nonsense. Oh god.

2358
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:05,359

 

2359
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:07,910

Four days of getting annoyed even though

2360
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:07,920
Four days of getting annoyed even though
 

2361
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,829
Four days of getting annoyed even though
making money.

2362
01:02:09,829 --> 01:02:09,839
making money.
 

2363
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:16,950
making money.
Four days of me getting stressed out.

2364
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:16,960

 

2365
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,710

These buyers cannot get it over these

2366
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:18,720
These buyers cannot get it over these
 

2367
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:26,150
These buyers cannot get it over these
15s.

2368
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:26,160

 

2369
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,950

How do we go in such tight ranges after

2370
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:28,960
How do we go in such tight ranges after
 

2371
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,710
How do we go in such tight ranges after
these massive squeezes? Come on.

2372
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:32,720
these massive squeezes? Come on.
 

2373
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,549
these massive squeezes? Come on.
If you're going to go, just go. Stop

2374
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:34,559
If you're going to go, just go. Stop
 

2375
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:44,710
If you're going to go, just go. Stop
[\h__\h] about.

2376
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:44,720

 

2377
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:59,670

Insane.

2378
01:02:59,670 --> 01:02:59,680

 

2379
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,589

What's this red 620 to 720 and then 20

2380
01:03:03,589 --> 01:03:03,599
What's this red 620 to 720 and then 20
 

2381
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,933
What's this red 620 to 720 and then 20
point rotation?

2382
01:03:05,933 --> 01:03:05,943
point rotation?
 

2383
01:03:05,943 --> 01:03:08,150
point rotation?
[laughter]

2384
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:08,160

 

2385
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,069

Incredible.

2386
01:03:10,069 --> 01:03:10,079
Incredible.
 

2387
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:14,710
Incredible.
Okay, watching here.

2388
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:14,720

 

2389
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:18,630

No follow through again.

2390
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:18,640

 

2391
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,549

Can't take out low hanging fruit. Can't

2392
01:03:20,549 --> 01:03:20,559
Can't take out low hanging fruit. Can't
 

2393
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:27,190
Can't take out low hanging fruit. Can't
give Alex a trade.

2394
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:27,200

 

2395
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,230

If they sell this back down again after

2396
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:30,240
If they sell this back down again after
 

2397
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,750
If they sell this back down again after
two days of doing it,

2398
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:33,760
two days of doing it,
 

2399
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,950
two days of doing it,
well, I don't know what I'm going to

2400
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:34,960
well, I don't know what I'm going to
 

2401
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,109
well, I don't know what I'm going to
say, but it's just if you zoom out and

2402
01:03:39,109 --> 01:03:39,119
say, but it's just if you zoom out and
 

2403
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:40,870
say, but it's just if you zoom out and
look at on an hourly, if you look at

2404
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:40,880
look at on an hourly, if you look at
 

2405
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,549
look at on an hourly, if you look at
from Wednesday 2:00 to now, it doesn't

2406
01:03:44,549 --> 01:03:44,559
from Wednesday 2:00 to now, it doesn't
 

2407
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:49,190
from Wednesday 2:00 to now, it doesn't
look very nice. It really does not look

2408
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:49,200
look very nice. It really does not look
 

2409
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,109
look very nice. It really does not look
very nice.

2410
01:03:51,109 --> 01:03:51,119
very nice.
 

2411
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,789
very nice.
We've been up here so much that we've

2412
01:03:52,789 --> 01:03:52,799
We've been up here so much that we've
 

2413
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:54,630
We've been up here so much that we've
actually moved current week's value area

2414
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:54,640
actually moved current week's value area
 

2415
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,470
actually moved current week's value area
high up here now as well. That's how

2416
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:56,480
high up here now as well. That's how
 

2417
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,789
high up here now as well. That's how
much volume we've now created up here

2418
01:03:58,789 --> 01:03:58,799
much volume we've now created up here
 

2419
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:24,390
much volume we've now created up here
without follow through.

2420
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:24,400

 

2421
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,750

I should be willing to play it short,

2422
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:25,760
I should be willing to play it short,
 

2423
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,910
I should be willing to play it short,
but I'm just not. I'm just not willing

2424
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:27,920
but I'm just not. I'm just not willing
 

2425
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,630
but I'm just not. I'm just not willing
to do it today.

2426
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:30,640
to do it today.
 

2427
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,150
to do it today.
I just feel like it's done it two days

2428
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:32,160
I just feel like it's done it two days
 

2429
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,230
I just feel like it's done it two days
in a row already at these levels. I'm

2430
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:34,240
in a row already at these levels. I'm
 

2431
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,750
in a row already at these levels. I'm
just not willing to do it. It might well

2432
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:35,760
just not willing to do it. It might well
 

2433
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,670
just not willing to do it. It might well
just flush without me, but I'm just not

2434
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:37,680
just flush without me, but I'm just not
 

2435
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,549
just flush without me, but I'm just not
willing to do it. Not when it's left

2436
01:04:40,549 --> 01:04:40,559
willing to do it. Not when it's left
 

2437
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:56,069
willing to do it. Not when it's left
those levels above again.

2438
01:04:56,069 --> 01:04:56,079

 

2439
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:57,589

It would be if I was going to play short

2440
01:04:57,589 --> 01:04:57,599
It would be if I was going to play short
 

2441
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,710
It would be if I was going to play short
and I'm not going to play it, it would

2442
01:04:58,710 --> 01:04:58,720
and I'm not going to play it, it would
 

2443
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,069
and I'm not going to play it, it would
be the same as yesterday, right? It

2444
01:05:00,069 --> 01:05:00,079
be the same as yesterday, right? It
 

2445
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:02,309
be the same as yesterday, right? It
would be leaving this and rotation back

2446
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:02,319
would be leaving this and rotation back
 

2447
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:03,670
would be leaving this and rotation back
down towards here. This is exactly what

2448
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:03,680
down towards here. This is exactly what
 

2449
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,109
down towards here. This is exactly what
we've done the last two days, which is

2450
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:05,119
we've done the last two days, which is
 

2451
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,069
we've done the last two days, which is
why I'm very I don't like it because I'm

2452
01:05:08,069 --> 01:05:08,079
why I'm very I don't like it because I'm
 

2453
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:09,349
why I'm very I don't like it because I'm
just like, but it's probably going to do

2454
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:09,359
just like, but it's probably going to do
 

2455
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,829
just like, but it's probably going to do
it. But

2456
01:05:11,829 --> 01:05:11,839
it. But
 

2457
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,349
it. But
I don't like the market trading this

2458
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:13,359
I don't like the market trading this
 

2459
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:15,910
I don't like the market trading this
way. There you go. [\h__\h] It's such

2460
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:15,920
way. There you go. [\h__\h] It's such
 

2461
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,549
way. There you go. [\h__\h] It's such
[\h__\h] mate. It's such [\h__\h] what

2462
01:05:18,549 --> 01:05:18,559
[\h__\h] mate. It's such [\h__\h] what
 

2463
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:20,950
[\h__\h] mate. It's such [\h__\h] what
they're doing here. [snorts]

2464
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:20,960
they're doing here. [snorts]
 

2465
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:28,069
they're doing here. [snorts]
I don't like it. I do not like it.

2466
01:05:28,069 --> 01:05:28,079

 

2467
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:29,589

So, there's your TP1. If you took the

2468
01:05:29,589 --> 01:05:29,599
So, there's your TP1. If you took the
 

2469
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,430
So, there's your TP1. If you took the
short, TP2 would be back all the way

2470
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:31,440
short, TP2 would be back all the way
 

2471
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,630
short, TP2 would be back all the way
down into value. Um, I just think it's

2472
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:34,640
down into value. Um, I just think it's
 

2473
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,870
down into value. Um, I just think it's
way too risky with how they're setting

2474
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:36,880
way too risky with how they're setting
 

2475
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,430
way too risky with how they're setting
this up in this in this range on an

2476
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:39,440
this up in this in this range on an
 

2477
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,470
this up in this in this range on an
hourly is what or on the daily, right? I

2478
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:42,480
hourly is what or on the daily, right? I
 

2479
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,950
hourly is what or on the daily, right? I
don't like what they've just done here.

2480
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:44,960
don't like what they've just done here.
 

2481
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,510
don't like what they've just done here.
They've just moved value up.

2482
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:47,520
They've just moved value up.
 

2483
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,829
They've just moved value up.
Value was here. Where was it? here on

2484
01:05:49,829 --> 01:05:49,839
Value was here. Where was it? here on
 

2485
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:52,069
Value was here. Where was it? here on
the week and they've just moved up to

2486
01:05:52,069 --> 01:05:52,079
the week and they've just moved up to
 

2487
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,150
the week and they've just moved up to
here and look how we're trapped in here.

2488
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:54,160
here and look how we're trapped in here.
 

2489
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,870
here and look how we're trapped in here.
I don't like this range. I do not like

2490
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:56,880
I don't like this range. I do not like
 

2491
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,510
I don't like this range. I do not like
this. Someone's got to get hurt. They

2492
01:05:59,510 --> 01:05:59,520
this. Someone's got to get hurt. They
 

2493
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,549
this. Someone's got to get hurt. They
have not cleaned out either side. I just

2494
01:06:02,549 --> 01:06:02,559
have not cleaned out either side. I just
 

2495
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,630
have not cleaned out either side. I just
think it's way too risky leaving this

2496
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:04,640
think it's way too risky leaving this
 

2497
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,029
think it's way too risky leaving this
like this and the lows like this, all

2498
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:07,039
like this and the lows like this, all
 

2499
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:09,910
like this and the lows like this, all
the stops each side. I don't want to be

2500
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:09,920
the stops each side. I don't want to be
 

2501
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,589
the stops each side. I don't want to be
the guy who comes and plays the same

2502
01:06:11,589 --> 01:06:11,599
the guy who comes and plays the same
 

2503
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,510
the guy who comes and plays the same
trade three days in a row and gets like

2504
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:13,520
trade three days in a row and gets like
 

2505
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,630
trade three days in a row and gets like
skipped by, you know, 100, 200 points. I

2506
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:16,640
skipped by, you know, 100, 200 points. I
 

2507
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:27,349
skipped by, you know, 100, 200 points. I
just don't want to be that guy.

2508
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:27,359

 

2509
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:29,430

Mag also has no idea what it's doing

2510
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:29,440
Mag also has no idea what it's doing
 

2511
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,349
Mag also has no idea what it's doing
right now. So, here's the retest. If

2512
01:06:31,349 --> 01:06:31,359
right now. So, here's the retest. If
 

2513
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:32,789
right now. So, here's the retest. If
they don't resell this, then the squeeze

2514
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:32,799
they don't resell this, then the squeeze
 

2515
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:35,990
they don't resell this, then the squeeze
is on where we just talked about leaving

2516
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:36,000
is on where we just talked about leaving
 

2517
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,829
is on where we just talked about leaving
this liquidity. This is my worry is

2518
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:37,839
this liquidity. This is my worry is
 

2519
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:39,589
this liquidity. This is my worry is
there's so many stops up here, which is

2520
01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:39,599
there's so many stops up here, which is
 

2521
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,510
there's so many stops up here, which is
why I'm not playing it short side today.

2522
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:41,520
why I'm not playing it short side today.
 

2523
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,349
why I'm not playing it short side today.
Last two days, no, no worries. But this

2524
01:06:43,349 --> 01:06:43,359
Last two days, no, no worries. But this
 

2525
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:45,190
Last two days, no, no worries. But this
is day three or four of all these stops

2526
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:45,200
is day three or four of all these stops
 

2527
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,829
is day three or four of all these stops
up at 40s and above. And you just think

2528
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:47,839
up at 40s and above. And you just think
 

2529
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:50,309
up at 40s and above. And you just think
if they come for it, oh my god, like

2530
01:06:50,309 --> 01:06:50,319
if they come for it, oh my god, like
 

2531
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:52,309
if they come for it, oh my god, like
imagine three days of huge lots of

2532
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:52,319
imagine three days of huge lots of
 

2533
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:54,630
imagine three days of huge lots of
stops. Then I think we probably go 900.

2534
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:54,640
stops. Then I think we probably go 900.
 

2535
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,390
stops. Then I think we probably go 900.
And that is my concern why I'm not

2536
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:56,400
And that is my concern why I'm not
 

2537
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,309
And that is my concern why I'm not
playing short today because I don't like

2538
01:06:58,309 --> 01:06:58,319
playing short today because I don't like
 

2539
01:06:58,319 --> 01:06:59,829
playing short today because I don't like
their games of how they're setting it

2540
01:06:59,829 --> 01:06:59,839
their games of how they're setting it
 

2541
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:02,870
their games of how they're setting it
up.

2542
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:02,880

 

2543
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,230

And they're going to go for the reclaim.

2544
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:04,240
And they're going to go for the reclaim.
 

2545
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,510
And they're going to go for the reclaim.
They might well do the squeeze now. I'm

2546
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:05,520
They might well do the squeeze now. I'm
 

2547
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,029
They might well do the squeeze now. I'm
more willing to actually play it higher

2548
01:07:07,029 --> 01:07:07,039
more willing to actually play it higher
 

2549
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,150
more willing to actually play it higher
if they're going to break because

2550
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:08,160
if they're going to break because
 

2551
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:14,390
if they're going to break because
there's so many stops to aim for.

2552
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:14,400

 

2553
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:19,109

Need ES to get going though.

2554
01:07:19,109 --> 01:07:19,119

 

2555
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,349

the battle up here. We get through the

01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:21,359
the battle up here. We get through the
 

2557
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,910
the battle up here. We get through the
teams. We're going here. We go in

teams. We're going here. We go in
 

2559
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,750
teams. We're going here. We go in
towards the teens. Can they find

2560
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:25,760
towards the teens. Can they find
 

2561
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,349
towards the teens. Can they find
acceptance over previous day value area

2562
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:27,359
acceptance over previous day value area
 

2563
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,950
acceptance over previous day value area
high? That's all we're looking for at

2564
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:28,960
high? That's all we're looking for at
 

2565
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,710
high? That's all we're looking for at
the moment. Can they find acceptance

2566
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:30,720
the moment. Can they find acceptance
 

2567
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:40,150
the moment. Can they find acceptance
back over this

They didn't even fill the guy down there

01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:49,120
They didn't even fill the guy down there
 

2589

They didn't even fill the guy down there

2595
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,229

I'm ready to go back to bed. I can't

2596
01:09:02,229 --> 01:09:02,239
I'm ready to go back to bed. I can't
 

2597
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:05,749
I'm ready to go back to bed. I can't
trade this. If we can't do a move which

2598
01:09:05,749 --> 01:09:05,759
trade this. If we can't do a move which
 

2599
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:07,269
trade this. If we can't do a move which
is not the same as last two days, I'm

2600
01:09:07,269 --> 01:09:07,279
is not the same as last two days, I'm
 

2601
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:08,870
is not the same as last two days, I'm
not going to trade it. It's too

2602
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:08,880
not going to trade it. It's too
 

2603
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,910
not going to trade it. It's too
dangerous. There's too many stops

2604
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:11,920
dangerous. There's too many stops
 

2605
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,910
dangerous. There's too many stops
waiting to get run. It's way too

2606
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:13,920
waiting to get run. It's way too
 

2607
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,149
waiting to get run. It's way too
dangerous on a third day of doing it.

2608
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:16,159
dangerous on a third day of doing it.
 

2609
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,829

Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Can't do

2610
01:09:17,829 --> 01:09:17,839
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Can't do
 

2611
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:25,110
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Can't do
it. No way.

2612

2613
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,870

You think it's about to flush, Raph? I

2614
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:26,880
You think it's about to flush, Raph? I
 

2615
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,470
You think it's about to flush, Raph? I
think it's might do the opposite, which

2616
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:28,480
think it's might do the opposite, which
 

2617
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,470
think it's might do the opposite, which
is why I'm not willing to trade it. It's

2618
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:30,480
is why I'm not willing to trade it. It's
 

2619
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,829
is why I'm not willing to trade it. It's
going to do the for me. I think it's

2620
01:09:31,829 --> 01:09:31,839
going to do the for me. I think it's
 

2621
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:33,189
going to do the for me. I think it's
going to do the opposite of the last two

2622
01:09:33,189 --> 01:09:33,199
going to do the opposite of the last two
 

2623
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:35,829
going to do the opposite of the last two
days. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong and I'm

2624
01:09:35,829 --> 01:09:35,839
days. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong and I'm
 

2625
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,669
days. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong and I'm
not in it, and that's okay. But, you

2626
01:09:37,669 --> 01:09:37,679
not in it, and that's okay. But, you
 

2627
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,030
not in it, and that's okay. But, you
know, the last two days I played these

2628
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:39,040
know, the last two days I played these
 

2629
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,030
know, the last two days I played these
shorts back down to here. My my problem

2630
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:41,040
shorts back down to here. My my problem
 

2631
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:45,510
shorts back down to here. My my problem
is we've done this move once, twice,

2632
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:45,520
is we've done this move once, twice,
 

2633
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,669
is we've done this move once, twice,
three times. Think about all the resting

2634
01:09:47,669 --> 01:09:47,679
three times. Think about all the resting
 

2635
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,709
three times. Think about all the resting
liquidity above. That worries me. That

2636
01:09:50,709 --> 01:09:50,719
liquidity above. That worries me. That
 

2637
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,870
liquidity above. That worries me. That
worries me that they're luring people in

2638
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:52,880
worries me that they're luring people in
 

2639
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,430
worries me that they're luring people in
to look for the same move and that it

2640
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:55,440
to look for the same move and that it
 

2641
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,270
to look for the same move and that it
will go the other way, which is the only

2642
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:57,280
will go the other way, which is the only
 

2643
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,030
will go the other way, which is the only
reason why I'm like, I don't like the

2644
01:09:59,030 --> 01:09:59,040
reason why I'm like, I don't like the
 

2645
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,189
reason why I'm like, I don't like the
psychology of this. Maybe I'm wrong and

2646
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:01,199
psychology of this. Maybe I'm wrong and
 

2647
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,030
psychology of this. Maybe I'm wrong and
they flush it, in which case all that I

2648
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:03,040
they flush it, in which case all that I
 

2649
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,189
they flush it, in which case all that I
miss is a trade, but I'm not going to

2650
01:10:05,189 --> 01:10:05,199
miss is a trade, but I'm not going to
 

2651
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:06,870
miss is a trade, but I'm not going to
get hurt.

2652
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:06,880
get hurt.
 

2653
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:12,790
get hurt.
Maybe you're right, Raph.

2654
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:12,800

 

2655
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,709

Yes, much weaker though. Tell you that

2656
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:14,719
Yes, much weaker though. Tell you that
 

2657
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:19,110
Yes, much weaker though. Tell you that
much.

2658
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:19,120

 

2659
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,630

Well, that's the thing. Spearhead,

2660
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:20,640
Well, that's the thing. Spearhead,
 

2661
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,390
Well, that's the thing. Spearhead,
waiting for the manipulation. We

2662
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:22,400
waiting for the manipulation. We
 

2663
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:26,229
waiting for the manipulation. We
actually haven't had any for any of this

2664
01:10:26,229 --> 01:10:26,239
actually haven't had any for any of this
 

2665
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:28,390
actually haven't had any for any of this
week, right? Since we've gone into

2666
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:28,400
week, right? Since we've gone into
 

2667
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,310
week, right? Since we've gone into
range, we have not swept or cleaned

2668
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:30,320
range, we have not swept or cleaned
 

2669
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:31,830
range, we have not swept or cleaned
anything up. That's half the problem,

2670
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:31,840
anything up. That's half the problem,
 

2671
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,350
anything up. That's half the problem,
right? That's kind of what I'm saying.

2672
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:33,360
right? That's kind of what I'm saying.
 

2673
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,750
right? That's kind of what I'm saying.
Like, we need to clean up one side and

2674
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:35,760
Like, we need to clean up one side and
 

2675
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,070
Like, we need to clean up one side and
we're not. The auctions do not look good

2676
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:38,080
we're not. The auctions do not look good
 

2677
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,430
we're not. The auctions do not look good
at the highs and lows. We talked about

2678
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:39,440
at the highs and lows. We talked about
 

2679
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,030
at the highs and lows. We talked about
it yesterday. The low of day had buyers

2680
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:41,040
it yesterday. The low of day had buyers
 

2681
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,149
it yesterday. The low of day had buyers
on. You don't want that. You want

2682
01:10:42,149 --> 01:10:42,159
on. You don't want that. You want
 

2683
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:44,390
on. You don't want that. You want
sellers on it. We didn't take it out the

2684
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:44,400
sellers on it. We didn't take it out the
 

2685
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,910
sellers on it. We didn't take it out the
previous day. We haven't taken it out

2686
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:45,920
previous day. We haven't taken it out
 

2687
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,350
previous day. We haven't taken it out
today.

2688
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:49,360

 

2689
01:10:49,360 --> 01:11:01,669

Can't really do much. Like

2690
01:11:01,669 --> 01:11:01,679

 

2691
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:14,149

back to VWAP.

2692
01:11:14,149 --> 01:11:14,159

 

2693
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:15,590

Wonder if ES comes all the way down to

2694
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:15,600
Wonder if ES comes all the way down to
 

2695
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,470
Wonder if ES comes all the way down to
35 and then rebids.

2696
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:20,480

 

2697
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:23,669

Oh, it's such a shame, man. [sighs]

2698
01:11:23,669 --> 01:11:23,679
Oh, it's such a shame, man. [sighs]
 

2699
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,270
Oh, it's such a shame, man. [sighs]
You get up early and this is what you're

2700
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:25,280
You get up early and this is what you're
 

2701
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,350
You get up early and this is what you're
dealt with. It's such a shame. I find it

2702
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:27,360
dealt with. It's such a shame. I find it
 

2703
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:47,110
dealt with. It's such a shame. I find it
exhausting when they do this.

2704
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:47,120

 

2705
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:54,390

They can't get under this right now.

2706
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:54,400

 

2707
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,030

So thick here now on an hourly. It's so

2708
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:57,040
So thick here now on an hourly. It's so
 

2709
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:01,990
So thick here now on an hourly. It's so
thick.

2710
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:02,000

 

2711
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,310

I'm telling you, if a breakout comes, I

2712
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:04,320
I'm telling you, if a breakout comes, I
 

2713
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,630
I'm telling you, if a breakout comes, I
can see this at 8.90 today. That's what

2714
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:06,640
can see this at 8.90 today. That's what
 

2715
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,950
can see this at 8.90 today. That's what
I'm That's my worry. That's why I'm not

2716
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:08,960
I'm That's my worry. That's why I'm not
 

2717
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,870
I'm That's my worry. That's why I'm not
fading it. If a breakout comes, I can

2718
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:10,880
fading it. If a breakout comes, I can
 

2719
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:17,030
fading it. If a breakout comes, I can
see this at 8.90 today.

2720
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:17,040

 

2721
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,550

Here they go. They've just dipped it

2722
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:18,560
Here they go. They've just dipped it
 

2723
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,709
Here they go. They've just dipped it
again. All right. I'm interested. I'm

2727
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,830
interested. Watching see if we can get

potentially 890s,
 

2733
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:34,229
potentially 890s,
that naked PC.

2734

that naked PC.
 

2735
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,229
that naked PC.
So, they might well do that trap that I

2736
01:12:36,229 --> 01:12:36,239
So, they might well do that trap that I
 

2737
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:38,229
So, they might well do that trap that I
just talked about.

2738
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:38,239

We'll see.
 

2741
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:46,950
We'll see.
This is where they need to get to.

2742
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:46,960

 

2743
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,990

Here we go. So, at least I was right.

2744
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:50,000
Here we go. So, at least I was right.
 

2745
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,430
Here we go. So, at least I was right.

They're not going to do the same thing

2748

2749
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,709

you in.

I'm telling you, no one will understand
why we're doing that. Most people would

2804
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:14,800
why we're doing that. Most people would
 

2805
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,630
why we're doing that. Most people would
been looking for that drop today. Three

2809
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,630
days in a row, we're not doing the same
thing. If we go 890s now, I'm a happy

2810
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:20,640
thing. If we go 890s now, I'm a happy
 

2811
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,870
thing. If we go 890s now, I'm a happy

naked point of control.

2818
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:31,600

 

2819
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,830

that when I'm not here, you understand

2830
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:47,280
that when I'm not here, you understand
 

2831
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,790
that when I'm not here, you understand
why I didn't want to play that today.

2832
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:50,800
why I didn't want to play that today.
 

2833
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,510

It's this. Okay, this is how they're

2834
01:14:53,510 --> 01:14:53,520
It's this. Okay, this is how they're
 

2835
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,470
It's this. Okay, this is how they're
luring you, luring you in, right? We

2836
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:56,480
luring you, luring you in, right? We
 

2837
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,590
luring you, luring you in, right? We
fade away from value last week. We

2838
01:14:59,590 --> 01:14:59,600
fade away from value last week. We
 

2839
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,390
fade away from value last week. We
create value. We push up. Fade. Fade,

2840
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:04,400
create value. We push up. Fade. Fade,
 

2841
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,630
create value. We push up. Fade. Fade,
fade, fade. Do we ever sweep? No, we

2842
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:08,640
fade, fade. Do we ever sweep? No, we
 

2843
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,470
fade, fade. Do we ever sweep? No, we
never sweep. Do we ever sweep these

2844
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:10,480
never sweep. Do we ever sweep these
 

2845
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,790
never sweep. Do we ever sweep these
lows? No. So, if we're coming this high,

2846
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:12,800
lows? No. So, if we're coming this high,
 

2847
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,590
lows? No. So, if we're coming this high,
what are we going to do? If we run one,

2848
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:15,600
what are we going to do? If we run one,
 

2849
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,149
what are we going to do? If we run one,
two, three, four lots of stops out,

2850
01:15:18,149 --> 01:15:18,159
two, three, four lots of stops out,
 

2851
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:20,470
two, three, four lots of stops out,
where's this market going to go? All

2852
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:20,480
where's this market going to go? All
 

2853
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,149
where's this market going to go? All
right. Because these short sellers

2854
01:15:22,149 --> 01:15:22,159
right. Because these short sellers
 

2855
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:24,310
right. Because these short sellers
become what? Market buyers. All right.

2856
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:24,320
become what? Market buyers. All right.
 

2857
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,910
become what? Market buyers. All right.
And then we can get a squeeze. So, we're

2858
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:25,920
And then we can get a squeeze. So, we're
 

2859
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,990
And then we can get a squeeze. So, we're
long to take that out because they are

2860
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:28,000
long to take that out because they are
 

2861
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,310
long to take that out because they are
hoping everyone shorts for the rotation

2862
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:30,320
hoping everyone shorts for the rotation
 

2863
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,070
hoping everyone shorts for the rotation
back down. But we've done that rotation.

2864
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:32,080
back down. But we've done that rotation.
 

2865
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,709
back down. But we've done that rotation.

up the same thing over and over and over
 

2881
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,470
up the same thing over and over and over
and over and over again, all right, it's

Like guy, great work. Make sure you're
 

2895
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:11,590
Like guy, great work. Make sure you're
paying yourself. I paid myself most my

2896
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:11,600
paying yourself. I paid myself most my
 

2897
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,030
paying yourself. I paid myself most my
money. I'm going to lock in some good

2898
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:13,040
money. I'm going to lock in some good
 

2899
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,870
money. I'm going to lock in some good
money here no matter what. Uh I just

2900
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:14,880
money here no matter what. Uh I just
 

2901
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,189
money here no matter what. Uh I just
know the next lot of stops are the top

2902
01:16:17,189 --> 01:16:17,199
know the next lot of stops are the top
 

2903
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:19,510
know the next lot of stops are the top
of this gray box or technically is

2904
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:19,520
of this gray box or technically is
 

2905
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:23,030
of this gray box or technically is
actually here. All right. So, we need to

2906
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:23,040
actually here. All right. So, we need to
 

2907
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,870
actually here. All right. So, we need to
run through this. Once we run through

2908
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:24,880
run through this. Once we run through
 

2909
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,709
run through this. Once we run through
this, there is squeeze potential up to

2910
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:26,719
this, there is squeeze potential up to
 

2911
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:27,990
this, there is squeeze potential up to
this naked point of control. But we're

2912
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:28,000
this naked point of control. But we're
 

2913
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,669
this naked point of control. But we're
paying ourselves no matter what. See how

2914
01:16:29,669 --> 01:16:29,679
paying ourselves no matter what. See how
 

2915
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:30,950
paying ourselves no matter what. See how
this previous day point of control

2916
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:30,960
this previous day point of control
 

2917
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,870
this previous day point of control
mattered. They couldn't get back under

2918
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:32,880
mattered. They couldn't get back under
 

2919
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,189
mattered. They couldn't get back under
fair value flipped. All right, they

2920
01:16:35,189 --> 01:16:35,199
fair value flipped. All right, they
 

2921
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:38,149
fair value flipped. All right, they
built this and then we're long, right?

2922
01:16:38,149 --> 01:16:38,159
built this and then we're long, right?
 

2923
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,310
built this and then we're long, right?
Paying ourselves. And if we get a

2924
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:40,320
Paying ourselves. And if we get a
 

2925
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,669
Paying ourselves. And if we get a
trigger through here, we'll get up into

2926
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:41,679
trigger through here, we'll get up into
 

2927
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:42,950
trigger through here, we'll get up into
there and then this would be a great

2928
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:42,960
there and then this would be a great
 

2929
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:51,910
there and then this would be a great
Friday.

2930
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:51,920

Somewhere in a cupboard at home.

3014
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:05,040

 

3015
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,030

Do we have a re-entry? Uh, well, you

3016
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:07,040
Do we have a re-entry? Uh, well, you
 

3017
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,350
Do we have a re-entry? Uh, well, you
want to be careful. We're We're squeezy,

3018
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:09,360
want to be careful. We're We're squeezy,
 

3019
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:14,070
want to be careful. We're We're squeezy,
right? So you'd want to see a basin hold

3020
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:14,080
right? So you'd want to see a basin hold
 

3021
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,390
right? So you'd want to see a basin hold
really here. It's trying to hold. It's

3022
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:16,400
really here. It's trying to hold. It's
 

3023
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,990
really here. It's trying to hold. It's
trying to now hold current weak value.

3024
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:18,000
trying to now hold current weak value.
 

3025
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,350
trying to now hold current weak value.
See this blue line moving up? That's

3026
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:19,360
See this blue line moving up? That's
 

3027
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,430
See this blue line moving up? That's
current weak value area high developing

3028
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:21,440
current weak value area high developing
 

3029
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,270
current weak value area high developing
profile. All right. So it's trying to

3030
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:23,280
profile. All right. So it's trying to
 

3031
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:26,470
profile. All right. So it's trying to
hold this to complete this. But the

3032
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:26,480
hold this to complete this. But the
 

3033
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,790
hold this to complete this. But the
re-entry could be down here. It could be

3034
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:28,800
re-entry could be down here. It could be
 

3035
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,310
re-entry could be down here. It could be
something like that. All right. They

3036
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:30,320
something like that. All right. They
 

3037
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,590
something like that. All right. They
might be even that they want to do

3038
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:31,600
might be even that they want to do
 

3039
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,350
might be even that they want to do
something dirty like this later in the

3040
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:33,360
something dirty like this later in the
 

3041
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:36,070
something dirty like this later in the
day.

3042
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:36,080
day.
 

3043
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,149
day.
But I wouldn't be buying up here now.

3044
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:38,159
But I wouldn't be buying up here now.
 

3045
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:39,990
But I wouldn't be buying up here now.
You'd almost be better off if if it

3046
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:40,000
You'd almost be better off if if it
 

3047
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,310
You'd almost be better off if if it
doesn't offer a pullback or a sweep and

3048
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:42,320
doesn't offer a pullback or a sweep and
 

3049
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,830
doesn't offer a pullback or a sweep and
a reclaim, you're almost better off

3050
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:43,840
a reclaim, you're almost better off
 

3051
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,669
a reclaim, you're almost better off
letting it base above this at that

3052
01:19:45,669 --> 01:19:45,679
letting it base above this at that
 

3053
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,750
letting it base above this at that
point. Be very careful as we build out

3054
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:47,760
point. Be very careful as we build out
 

3055
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:54,470
point. Be very careful as we build out
volume.

3056
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:54,480

 

3057
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,030

What if it rejects here? What's the top

3058
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:57,040
What if it rejects here? What's the top
 

3059
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,110
What if it rejects here? What's the top
of the box? Top top of the box, mate. It

3060
01:19:59,110 --> 01:19:59,120
of the box? Top top of the box, mate. It
 

3061
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:02,630
of the box? Top top of the box, mate. It
is the stops from Friday, right? 10:00

3062
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:02,640
is the stops from Friday, right? 10:00
 

3063
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,229
is the stops from Friday, right? 10:00
a.m. Friday the 16th. All right. If I

3064
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:06,239
a.m. Friday the 16th. All right. If I
 

3065
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:10,630
a.m. Friday the 16th. All right. If I
move you to 1H.

3066
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:10,640
move you to 1H.
 

3067
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,550
move you to 1H.
All right, these guys here. If we think

3068
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:12,560
All right, these guys here. If we think
 

3069
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,870
All right, these guys here. If we think
about how we faded this market last week

3070
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:14,880
about how we faded this market last week
 

3071
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,669
about how we faded this market last week
on Friday,

3072
01:20:17,669 --> 01:20:17,679
on Friday,
 

3073
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,510
on Friday,
right? It's all these stops. So, anyone

3074
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:19,520
right? It's all these stops. So, anyone
 

3075
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,510
right? It's all these stops. So, anyone
who's swing short from here, this is

3076
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:21,520
who's swing short from here, this is
 

3077
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,550
who's swing short from here, this is
where they're swing short. Okay, so if

3078
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:24,560
where they're swing short. Okay, so if
 

3079
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:25,910
where they're swing short. Okay, so if
we pop through that, then we're going to

3080
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:25,920
we pop through that, then we're going to
 

3081
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,910
we pop through that, then we're going to
go back inside previous week's value.

3082
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:27,920
go back inside previous week's value.
 

3083
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,830
go back inside previous week's value.
And then the rotation next week would be

3084
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:29,840
And then the rotation next week would be
 

3085
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:35,030
And then the rotation next week would be
between here. If we do that,

3086
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:35,040

 

3087
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,310

we can go over that in the weekly

3088
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:36,320
we can go over that in the weekly
 

3089
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:44,425
we can go over that in the weekly
newsletter though.

3090
01:20:44,425 --> 01:20:44,435

 

3091
01:20:44,435 --> 01:20:46,630

3092
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:46,640

 

3093
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,390

Not only am I making money, I'm learning

3094
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:48,400
Not only am I making money, I'm learning
 

3095

3101
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,430

01:20:59,430 --> 01:20:59,440
Order flow for me is what I use. So map
 

3103
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:04,310

anyone who's been with me the last few
 

3109
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,229
anyone who's been with me the last few

been with me, anyone who's done the

3116
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:18,640

smart. What are we seeing in these
 

3121
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:29,590
smart. What are we seeing in these
candles at the lows?

3122
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:29,600

 

3123
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,070

There you go. Trapped. Yeah, sellers

3124
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:32,080
There you go. Trapped. Yeah, sellers
 

3125
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,590
There you go. Trapped. Yeah, sellers
stuck. Right. These are aggressive

3126
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:33,600
stuck. Right. These are aggressive
 

3127
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,110
stuck. Right. These are aggressive
sellers

3128
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:35,120
sellers
 

3129
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:38,390
sellers
stuck. Are we moving lower? No. What

3130
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:38,400
stuck. Are we moving lower? No. What
 

3131
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,390
stuck. Are we moving lower? No. What
does that mean? It means there's limit

3132
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:40,400
does that mean? It means there's limit
 

3133
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,189
does that mean? It means there's limit
buyers refreshing the bid here non-stop.

3134
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:43,199
buyers refreshing the bid here non-stop.
 

3135
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,270
buyers refreshing the bid here non-stop.
And once these sellers are stuck,

3136
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:45,280
And once these sellers are stuck,
 

3137
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,149
And once these sellers are stuck,
where's their stop?

3138
01:21:48,149 --> 01:21:48,159
where's their stop?
 

3139
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:50,709
where's their stop?
What happens? They become market buyers,

3140
01:21:50,709 --> 01:21:50,719
What happens? They become market buyers,
 

3141
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:52,629
What happens? They become market buyers,
right? So, these sellers become these

3142
01:21:52,629 --> 01:21:52,639
right? So, these sellers become these
 

3143
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:54,390
right? So, these sellers become these
market buyers. Why? Because when you

3144
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:54,400
market buyers. Why? Because when you
 

3145
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,709
market buyers. Why? Because when you
stop out, they put their stops here.

3146
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:56,719
stop out, they put their stops here.
 

3147
01:21:56,719 --> 01:21:58,870
stop out, they put their stops here.
They become a market order in the

3148
01:21:58,870 --> 01:21:58,880
They become a market order in the
 

3149
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,189
They become a market order in the
market. We come up. We're still holding.

3150
01:22:01,189 --> 01:22:01,199
market. We come up. We're still holding.
 

3151
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:02,550
market. We come up. We're still holding.
All right. We have some imbalances down

3152
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:02,560
All right. We have some imbalances down
 

3153
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,990
All right. We have some imbalances down
here. We can feel if it wants to pull

3154
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:04,000
here. We can feel if it wants to pull
 

3155
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,390
here. We can feel if it wants to pull
back and hold to go again. So when

3156
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:06,400
back and hold to go again. So when
 

3157
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,830
back and hold to go again. So when
someone asks, "What's my confirmation?"

3158
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:07,840
someone asks, "What's my confirmation?"
 

3159
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,669
someone asks, "What's my confirmation?"
My confirmation is, "Can I see sellers

3160
01:22:09,669 --> 01:22:09,679
My confirmation is, "Can I see sellers
 

3161
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:11,750
My confirmation is, "Can I see sellers
stuck at a low?" This is a good auction,

3162
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:11,760
stuck at a low?" This is a good auction,
 

3163
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,830
stuck at a low?" This is a good auction,
right? We see sellers stuck at the low.

3164
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:13,840
right? We see sellers stuck at the low.
 

3165
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,669
right? We see sellers stuck at the low.
This gives us thesis to move higher.

3166
01:22:15,669 --> 01:22:15,679
This gives us thesis to move higher.
 

3167
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:17,270
This gives us thesis to move higher.
That's what we're looking for. That's

3168
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:17,280
That's what we're looking for. That's
 

3169
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,750
That's what we're looking for. That's
not what we've seen, right, the last few

3170
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:19,760
not what we've seen, right, the last few
 

3171
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,149
not what we've seen, right, the last few
sessions at the lows, right? I don't

3172
01:22:22,149 --> 01:22:22,159
sessions at the lows, right? I don't
 

3173
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:24,709
sessions at the lows, right? I don't
like this, right? Buyers at the lows

3174
01:22:24,709 --> 01:22:24,719
like this, right? Buyers at the lows
 

3175
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:28,149
like this, right? Buyers at the lows
absorbing without a sweep. No, this is

3176
01:22:28,149 --> 01:22:28,159
absorbing without a sweep. No, this is
 

3177
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:29,990
absorbing without a sweep. No, this is
not a healthy auction, right? So, when I

3178
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:30,000
not a healthy auction, right? So, when I
 

3179
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,430
not a healthy auction, right? So, when I
say I don't like the auction at the low

3180
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:31,440
say I don't like the auction at the low
 

3181
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,590
say I don't like the auction at the low
or the high, that's why what I want to

3182
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:33,600
or the high, that's why what I want to
 

3183
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,750
or the high, that's why what I want to
see is like, for example, if we drove

3184
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:37,760
see is like, for example, if we drove
 

3185
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,910
see is like, for example, if we drove
down under here this morning and we saw

3186
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:39,920
down under here this morning and we saw
 

3187
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,629
down under here this morning and we saw
delta and this was sellside delta and we

3188
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:42,639
delta and this was sellside delta and we
 

3189
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:45,110
delta and this was sellside delta and we
reclaimed, okay, then I'm long off the

3190
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:45,120
reclaimed, okay, then I'm long off the
 

3191
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,870
reclaimed, okay, then I'm long off the
bottom, right? Because I know sellers

3192
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:46,880
bottom, right? Because I know sellers
 

3193
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:49,110
bottom, right? Because I know sellers
played the breakout short and got stuck,

3194
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:49,120
played the breakout short and got stuck,
 

3195
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,990
played the breakout short and got stuck,
for example, right? So confirmation for

3196
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:52,000
for example, right? So confirmation for
 

3197
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,390
for example, right? So confirmation for
me comes from order flow, understanding

3198
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:54,400
me comes from order flow, understanding
 

3199
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,550
me comes from order flow, understanding
levels, understanding where I'm looking

3200
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:56,560
levels, understanding where I'm looking
 

3201
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,709
levels, understanding where I'm looking
to execute, where I think stops are, and

3202
01:22:58,709 --> 01:22:58,719
to execute, where I think stops are, and
 

3203
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:00,950
to execute, where I think stops are, and
then it's about can I execute based on

3204
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:00,960
then it's about can I execute based on
 

3205
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,189
then it's about can I execute based on
who I know who not I think is trapped,

3206
01:23:03,189 --> 01:23:03,199
who I know who not I think is trapped,
 

3207
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:05,270
who I know who not I think is trapped,
who I now know is trapped because it's

3208
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:05,280
who I now know is trapped because it's
 

3209
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:10,629
who I now know is trapped because it's
showing me

lots here trapped between here. This is
 

3233
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:33,830
lots here trapped between here. This is
why I was getting frustrated. I was

3234
01:23:33,830 --> 01:23:33,840
why I was getting frustrated. I was
 

3235
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,189
why I was getting frustrated. I was
like, please don't dance between here

3236

because it's going to be I can't do
anything. But once we run these stops,

01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,870

What is delta? Delta is the difference

3248
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:52,880
What is delta? Delta is the difference

right? If the I've got to do this the

3260
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:05,280
right? If the I've got to do this the
 

3261
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,790
right? If the I've got to do this the
right way around because it's reversed,

3262
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:06,800
right way around because it's reversed,
 

3263
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,350
right way around because it's reversed,
right? If the offer is here and the bids

3264
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:09,360
right? If the offer is here and the bids
 

3265
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,270
right? If the offer is here and the bids
are here and if you're a market buyer,

3266
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:11,280
are here and if you're a market buyer,
 

3267
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,950
are here and if you're a market buyer,
you're filling that offer. You're not

3268
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:12,960
you're filling that offer. You're not
 

3269
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,390
you're filling that offer. You're not
joining the bid. You're filling the

3270
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:14,400
joining the bid. You're filling the
 

3271
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,590
joining the bid. You're filling the
offer. That's someone that's being

3272
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:15,600
offer. That's someone that's being
 

3273
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,510
offer. That's someone that's being
aggressive. So, if we've got aggressive

3274
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:17,520
aggressive. So, if we've got aggressive
 

3275
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:20,709
aggressive. So, if we've got aggressive
sellers trying to sell, all right,

3276
01:24:20,709 --> 01:24:20,719
sellers trying to sell, all right,
 

3277
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:22,870
sellers trying to sell, all right,
against the bid, right? They're selling

3278
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:22,880
against the bid, right? They're selling
 

3279
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,709
against the bid, right? They're selling
against the bid. If they come piling in

3280
01:24:24,709 --> 01:24:24,719
against the bid. If they come piling in
 

3281
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:27,430
against the bid. If they come piling in
here and price doesn't move lower, it

3282
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:27,440
here and price doesn't move lower, it
 

3283
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,110
here and price doesn't move lower, it
means that someone is just bidding and

3284
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:29,120
means that someone is just bidding and
 

3285
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,629
means that someone is just bidding and
holding and holding and holding and we

3286
01:24:30,629 --> 01:24:30,639
holding and holding and holding and we
 

3287
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:32,229
holding and holding and holding and we
call that absorption, right? Think about

3288
01:24:32,229 --> 01:24:32,239
call that absorption, right? Think about
 

3289
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:34,470
call that absorption, right? Think about
a sponge. Someone's trying to sell.

3290
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:34,480
a sponge. Someone's trying to sell.
 

3291
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,990
a sponge. Someone's trying to sell.
There's a big sponge being like, I'm

3292
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:36,000
There's a big sponge being like, I'm
 

3293
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,830
There's a big sponge being like, I'm
going to take all your orders. We're

3294
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:37,840
going to take all your orders. We're
 

3295
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,189
going to take all your orders. We're
going to move up. Because remember the

3296
01:24:39,189 --> 01:24:39,199
going to move up. Because remember the
 

3297
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,350
going to move up. Because remember the
market cannot move unless there's

3298
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:41,360
market cannot move unless there's
 

3299
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,950
market cannot move unless there's
aggressive participants. If you just

3300
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:42,960
aggressive participants. If you just
 

3301
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:47,669
aggressive participants. If you just
have like um offers here and bids here

3302
01:24:47,669 --> 01:24:47,679
have like um offers here and bids here
 

3303
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,830
have like um offers here and bids here
between is what we call the spread. If

3304
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:49,840
between is what we call the spread. If
 

3305
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,270
between is what we call the spread. If
we just have that, it's never going to

3306
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:51,280
we just have that, it's never going to
 

3307
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,590
we just have that, it's never going to
move, is it? It's never ever going to

3308
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:53,600
move, is it? It's never ever going to
 

3309
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,350
move, is it? It's never ever going to
move, right? We always talk about the

3310
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:55,360
move, right? We always talk about the
 

3311
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:58,790
move, right? We always talk about the
Rolex. If I want to buy a road a Daytona

3312
01:24:58,790 --> 01:24:58,800
Rolex. If I want to buy a road a Daytona
 

3313
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,990
Rolex. If I want to buy a road a Daytona
for $20,000 and the cheapest one on the

3314
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:02,000
for $20,000 and the cheapest one on the
 

3315
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,790
for $20,000 and the cheapest one on the
market is $30,000, then we got a $10,000

3316
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:04,800
market is $30,000, then we got a $10,000
 

3317
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,790
market is $30,000, then we got a $10,000
spread. Until I'm willing to buy it for

3318
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:06,800
spread. Until I'm willing to buy it for
 

3319
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,030
spread. Until I'm willing to buy it for
$30,000 or he's willing to sell it to me

3320
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:09,040
$30,000 or he's willing to sell it to me
 

3321
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,350
$30,000 or he's willing to sell it to me
for $20,000, the market doesn't move.

3322
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:11,360
for $20,000, the market doesn't move.
 

3323
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:21,990
for $20,000, the market doesn't move.
It's exactly the same in this scenario.

3324
01:25:21,990 --> 01:25:22,000

 

3325
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,830

Joe, am I sec? No. So what I'm saying

3326
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:23,840
Joe, am I sec? No. So what I'm saying
 

3327
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,390
Joe, am I sec? No. So what I'm saying
is, let me get you on a higher time

3328
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:26,400
is, let me get you on a higher time
 

3329
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,550
is, let me get you on a higher time
frame. We have a what we call a naked

3330
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:28,560
frame. We have a what we call a naked
 

3331
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,669
frame. We have a what we call a naked
point of control on a weekly, right? So

3332
01:25:31,669 --> 01:25:31,679
point of control on a weekly, right? So
 

3333
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:34,629
point of control on a weekly, right? So
this level here has not been retested

3334
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:34,639
this level here has not been retested
 

3335
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:36,470
this level here has not been retested
since we left it, right? Because this is

3336
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:36,480
since we left it, right? Because this is
 

3337
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:39,189
since we left it, right? Because this is
the old week. We have not retested this.

3338
01:25:39,189 --> 01:25:39,199
the old week. We have not retested this.
 

3339
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:42,070
the old week. We have not retested this.
So if we break above these stops, it is

3340
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:42,080
So if we break above these stops, it is
 

3341
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,790
So if we break above these stops, it is
very probable that we will retest this

3342
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:44,800
very probable that we will retest this
 

3343
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,709
very probable that we will retest this
level, right? That's what the market's

3344
01:25:46,709 --> 01:25:46,719
level, right? That's what the market's
 

3345
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:47,750
level, right? That's what the market's
trying to do. We're now starting to

3346
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:47,760
trying to do. We're now starting to
 

3347
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,110
trying to do. We're now starting to
break above these stops. So they're

3348
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:49,120
break above these stops. So they're
 

3349
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,270
break above these stops. So they're
going to try and get all the way up to

3350
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:51,280
going to try and get all the way up to
 

3351
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,189
going to try and get all the way up to
8.90ish. That's what they're going to

3352
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:53,199
8.90ish. That's what they're going to
 

3353
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,510
8.90ish. That's what they're going to
attempt to do today if they can. They

3354
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:55,520
attempt to do today if they can. They
 

3355
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,270
attempt to do today if they can. They
might not make it, but this is what they

3356
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:57,280
might not make it, but this is what they
 

3357
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:12,629
might not make it, but this is what they
want to do. [cough]

3358
01:26:12,629 --> 01:26:12,639

 

3359
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:15,270

You think I IB trade is on the table? Is

3360
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:15,280
You think I IB trade is on the table? Is
 

3361
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:18,550
You think I IB trade is on the table? Is
it too bullish? Well,

3362
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:18,560
it too bullish? Well,
 

3363
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,310
it too bullish? Well,
it might be an IB. It just might not be

3364
01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:20,320
it might be an IB. It just might not be
 

3365
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:23,110
it might be an IB. It just might not be
the IB reversal. It might be because

3366
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:23,120
the IB reversal. It might be because
 

3367
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,790
the IB reversal. It might be because
look where the IB is right on the gray

3368
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:24,800
look where the IB is right on the gray
 

3369
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,950
look where the IB is right on the gray
box. It might be the IB expansion. It

3370
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:26,960
box. It might be the IB expansion. It
 

3371
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,590
box. It might be the IB expansion. It
might be a trend day expansion. It

3372
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:29,600
might be a trend day expansion. It
 

3373
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,430
might be a trend day expansion. It
doesn't have to be the IB to VWAP.

3374
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:31,440
doesn't have to be the IB to VWAP.
 

3375
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:34,470
doesn't have to be the IB to VWAP.
Remember the other side of it is the IB

3376
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:34,480
Remember the other side of it is the IB
 

3377
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,629
Remember the other side of it is the IB
expansion. If we're in a trend day above

3378
01:26:36,629 --> 01:26:36,639
expansion. If we're in a trend day above
 

3379
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:38,550
expansion. If we're in a trend day above
IB, we don't be short, do we? If we're

3380
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:38,560
IB, we don't be short, do we? If we're
 

3381
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,470
IB, we don't be short, do we? If we're
if we keep bidding above IB, we're not

3382
01:26:40,470 --> 01:26:40,480
if we keep bidding above IB, we're not
 

3383
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,750
if we keep bidding above IB, we're not
going to get short because we're going

3384
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:41,760
going to get short because we're going
 

3385
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,070
going to get short because we're going
for expansion. If we get under here,

3386
01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:44,080
for expansion. If we get under here,
 

3387
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,709
for expansion. If we get under here,
right? If we get under here,

3388
01:26:46,709 --> 01:26:46,719
right? If we get under here,
 

3389
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:49,189
right? If we get under here,
that might be valid. But we're not under

3390
01:26:49,189 --> 01:26:49,199
that might be valid. But we're not under
 

3391
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:51,189
that might be valid. But we're not under
there. We're in expansion mode and we're

3392
01:26:51,189 --> 01:26:51,199
there. We're in expansion mode and we're
 

3393
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:59,110
there. We're in expansion mode and we're
long and strong.

3394
01:26:59,110 --> 01:26:59,120

 

3395
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:03,669

Here we go. Here we go, folks. So, 800

3396
01:27:03,669 --> 01:27:03,679
Here we go. Here we go, folks. So, 800
 

3397
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:06,629
Here we go. Here we go, folks. So, 800
psychological level. It would be nice if

3398
01:27:06,629 --> 01:27:06,639
psychological level. It would be nice if
 

3399
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:09,430
psychological level. It would be nice if
uh ES can join in. The great thing is

3400
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:09,440
uh ES can join in. The great thing is
 

3401
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,270
uh ES can join in. The great thing is
here we're long in NQ, which has

3402
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:11,280
here we're long in NQ, which has
 

3403
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,550
here we're long in NQ, which has
relative strength. So if we look at the

3404
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:12,560
relative strength. So if we look at the
 

3405
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,750
relative strength. So if we look at the
broader markets, RTY down 1%, YM, this

3406
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:15,760
broader markets, RTY down 1%, YM, this
 

3407
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,390
broader markets, RTY down 1%, YM, this
is really good by the way. RTY down 1%,

3408
01:27:18,390 --> 01:27:18,400
is really good by the way. RTY down 1%,
 

3409
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:22,070
is really good by the way. RTY down 1%,
YM down 0.59%, ES just above flat. We

3410
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:22,080
YM down 0.59%, ES just above flat. We
 

3411
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,149
YM down 0.59%, ES just above flat. We
are almost half% up. What does that

3412
01:27:24,149 --> 01:27:24,159
are almost half% up. What does that
 

3413
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:25,750
are almost half% up. What does that
mean?

3414
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:25,760
mean?
 

3415
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,510
mean?
In November and December, we started a

3416
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:27,520
In November and December, we started a
 

3417
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,310
In November and December, we started a
rotation out of tech into small and

3418
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:30,320
rotation out of tech into small and
 

3419
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,390
rotation out of tech into small and
midcaps, right? Which is why RTY has

3420
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:32,400
midcaps, right? Which is why RTY has
 

3421
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,550
midcaps, right? Which is why RTY has
been at all-time highs. If we're seeing

3422
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:34,560
been at all-time highs. If we're seeing
 

3423
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,189
been at all-time highs. If we're seeing
strength come back into the tech market,

3424
01:27:37,189 --> 01:27:37,199
strength come back into the tech market,
 

3425
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:38,470
strength come back into the tech market,
what does that mean? It means we're

3426
01:27:38,470 --> 01:27:38,480
what does that mean? It means we're
 

3427
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,189
what does that mean? It means we're
rotating back into the mag, back into

3428
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:41,199
rotating back into the mag, back into
 

3429
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:43,430
rotating back into the mag, back into
big tech companies, which means ENQ is

3430
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:43,440
big tech companies, which means ENQ is
 

3431
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:44,629
big tech companies, which means ENQ is
going to have relative strength, which

3432
01:27:44,629 --> 01:27:44,639
going to have relative strength, which
 

3433
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:47,110
going to have relative strength, which
is why we want to be long in this when

3434
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:47,120
is why we want to be long in this when
 

3435
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:51,030
is why we want to be long in this when
we're going to see that.

01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:54,390
770. That's where they're trying to sell
through back down to this node. Buyers,

3482
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:54,400
through back down to this node. Buyers,
 

3483
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,229
through back down to this node. Buyers,
all right, will want to hold 60. That's

over that, this market is going to

complete opposite of what everyone
 

3593
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:41,430
complete opposite of what everyone
expected, including myself. It means

All right,

01:31:53,830 --> 01:31:53,840
All right,
 

3603
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:58,709
All right,
we've undercut this.

3604
01:31:58,709 --> 01:31:58,719

 

3605
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:00,870

3609
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,350

over this. Remember, this is like the

01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:05,360
over this. Remember, this is like the
 

3611
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:07,510
over this. Remember, this is like the
old balance. The old balance. The old

01:32:09,669 --> 01:32:09,679
balance. The old balance. All right,
 

3615
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:11,030
balance. The old balance. All right,
this is where we're trying to trade in

3616
01:32:11,030 --> 01:32:11,040
this is where we're trying to trade in
 

3617
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,430
this is where we're trying to trade in
towards this point of control as well.

3618
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:13,440
towards this point of control as well.
 

3619
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,310
towards this point of control as well.
Right, if we get up over here and base,

3620
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:16,320
Right, if we get up over here and base,
 

3621
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:17,750
Right, if we get up over here and base,
then the next target would be here. All

3622
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:17,760
then the next target would be here. All
 

3623
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,830
then the next target would be here. All
right. The big question is if they do

3624
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:19,840
right. The big question is if they do
 

3625
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:23,110
right. The big question is if they do
this, all right, and base above it, not

3626
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:23,120
this, all right, and base above it, not
 

3627
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,110
this, all right, and base above it, not
spike and fail. If they base above this,

3628
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:25,120
spike and fail. If they base above this,
 

3629
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:31,910
spike and fail. If they base above this,
we're going to have all these sellers

3630
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:31,920

 

3631
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,070

trapped in the market, which means

3632
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:34,080
trapped in the market, which means
 

3633
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,470
trapped in the market, which means
everyone from November will be trapped.

3634
01:32:36,470 --> 01:32:36,480
everyone from November will be trapped.
 

3635
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,510
everyone from November will be trapped.
And if they base above that, this will

3636
01:32:39,510 --> 01:32:39,520
And if they base above that, this will
 

3637
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,110
And if they base above that, this will
absolutely

3638
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:41,120
absolutely
 

3639
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:44,310
absolutely
rocket. It will rocket if we base above

3640
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:44,320
rocket. It will rocket if we base above
 

3641
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,070
rocket. It will rocket if we base above
this. All right? because everyone's

3642
01:32:46,070 --> 01:32:46,080
this. All right? because everyone's
 

3643
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,070
this. All right? because everyone's
looking for, including me, thinking

3644
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:48,080
looking for, including me, thinking
 

3645
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,629
looking for, including me, thinking
we're going to eventually come back down

3646
01:32:50,629 --> 01:32:50,639
we're going to eventually come back down
 

3647
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:54,310
we're going to eventually come back down
towards here, right? And maybe even

3648
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:54,320
towards here, right? And maybe even
 

3649
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,149
towards here, right? And maybe even
there's an argument for a retest back

3650
01:32:56,149 --> 01:32:56,159
there's an argument for a retest back
 

3651
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:57,590
there's an argument for a retest back
down to here. So maybe a little dunk

3652
01:32:57,590 --> 01:32:57,600
down to here. So maybe a little dunk
 

3653
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,430
down to here. So maybe a little dunk
underneath and a reclaim. If we don't do

3654
01:32:59,430 --> 01:32:59,440
underneath and a reclaim. If we don't do
 

3655
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,030
underneath and a reclaim. If we don't do
that and everyone's positioned for the

3656
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:01,040
that and everyone's positioned for the
 

3657
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:02,870
that and everyone's positioned for the
fail, then we're going to keep going

3658
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:02,880
fail, then we're going to keep going
 

3659
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,910
fail, then we're going to keep going
higher, aren't we? So, you know, have to

3660
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:05,920
higher, aren't we? So, you know, have to
 

3661
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,629
higher, aren't we? So, you know, have to
be flexible in markets. This is why like

3662
01:33:08,629 --> 01:33:08,639
be flexible in markets. This is why like
 

3663
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:10,390
be flexible in markets. This is why like

3720
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:50,000
weight in the ENQ. What's really red
 

3721
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,149
weight in the ENQ. What's really red
which isn't in the ENQ? Financials. All

3722
01:34:52,149 --> 01:34:52,159
which isn't in the ENQ? Financials. All
 

3723
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:54,629
which isn't in the ENQ? Financials. All
right, look at all these red, right? So,

3724
01:34:54,629 --> 01:34:54,639
right, look at all these red, right? So,
 

3725
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:56,550
right, look at all these red, right? So,
that's dragging ES. What else is red?

3726
01:34:56,550 --> 01:34:56,560
that's dragging ES. What else is red?
 

3727
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,629
that's dragging ES. What else is red?
Healthcare. Guess what? That's also in

3728
01:34:58,629 --> 01:34:58,639
Healthcare. Guess what? That's also in
 

3729
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:01,750
Healthcare. Guess what? That's also in
ES. Okay. So this is why this is why you

3730
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:01,760
ES. Okay. So this is why this is why you
 

3731
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,030
ES. Okay. So this is why this is why you
need to understand when we have relative

3732
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:03,040
need to understand when we have relative
 

3733
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:05,350
need to understand when we have relative
strength. We're seeing rotation out of

3734
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:05,360
strength. We're seeing rotation out of
 

3735
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,270
strength. We're seeing rotation out of
these sectors out of healthcare. Well,

3736
01:35:07,270 --> 01:35:07,280
these sectors out of healthcare. Well,
 

3737
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:08,870
these sectors out of healthcare. Well,
there's never really rotation into it.

3738
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:08,880
there's never really rotation into it.
 

3739
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:11,750
there's never really rotation into it.
Out of finances into some of these big

3740
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:11,760
Out of finances into some of these big
 

3741
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,910
Out of finances into some of these big
tech names, then we're going to be

3742
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:13,920
tech names, then we're going to be
 

3743
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:22,470
tech names, then we're going to be
stronger in NQ.

3744
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:22,480

 

3745
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,229

Where's my stop? Uh, I'm probably going

3746
01:35:24,229 --> 01:35:24,239
Where's my stop? Uh, I'm probably going
 

3747
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:26,550
Where's my stop? Uh, I'm probably going
to move it up to just around this IB,

3748
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:26,560
to move it up to just around this IB,
 

3749
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,510
to move it up to just around this IB,
which might be silly, but I can always

3750
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:29,520
which might be silly, but I can always
 

3751
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,990
which might be silly, but I can always
re-enter. I just want to watch the order

3752
01:35:31,990 --> 01:35:32,000
re-enter. I just want to watch the order
 

3753
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,189
re-enter. I just want to watch the order
flow as we come into. Well, I don't want

3754
01:35:33,189 --> 01:35:33,199
flow as we come into. Well, I don't want
 

3755
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:35,669
flow as we come into. Well, I don't want
to get caught in.

3756
01:35:35,669 --> 01:35:35,679
to get caught in.
 

3757
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:37,030
to get caught in.
Maybe I'll give it a little bit more

3758
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:37,040
Maybe I'll give it a little bit more
 

3759
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,350
Maybe I'll give it a little bit more
room because this is acceptable to do

3760
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:39,360
room because this is acceptable to do
 

3761
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,430
room because this is acceptable to do
this. We need to be careful of these two

3762
01:35:41,430 --> 01:35:41,440
this. We need to be careful of these two
 

3763
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,590
this. We need to be careful of these two
nodes. If we lose these two nodes,

3764
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:43,600
nodes. If we lose these two nodes,
 

3765
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:44,950
nodes. If we lose these two nodes,
there's a bigger fade and I don't want

01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:44,960
there's a bigger fade and I don't want
 

3767
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:53,910

Alex, do you use London and Asia high

3790
01:36:22,629 --> 01:36:22,639
Alex, do you use London and Asia high
 

3791
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:24,390
Alex, do you use London and Asia high
and lows? Yeah, I do. But we didn't

3792
01:36:24,390 --> 01:36:24,400
and lows? Yeah, I do. But we didn't
 

3793
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,149
and lows? Yeah, I do. But we didn't
sweep Well, we didn't sweep the lows

3794
01:36:26,149 --> 01:36:26,159
sweep Well, we didn't sweep the lows
 

3795
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:29,350
sweep Well, we didn't sweep the lows
today. We didn't sweep London low. And I

3796
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:29,360
today. We didn't sweep London low. And I
 

3797
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,550
today. We didn't sweep London low. And I
don't think we did it yesterday either.

3798
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:30,560
don't think we did it yesterday either.
 

3799
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:31,910
don't think we did it yesterday either.
We didn't do it yesterday either, which

3800
01:36:31,910 --> 01:36:31,920
We didn't do it yesterday either, which
 

3801
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:34,390
We didn't do it yesterday either, which
is why my bias was long because I feel

3802
01:36:34,390 --> 01:36:34,400
is why my bias was long because I feel
 

3803
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:35,590
is why my bias was long because I feel
like we're going to we we're going to

3804
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:35,600
like we're going to we we're going to
 

3805
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:36,950
like we're going to we we're going to
run all of these guys out. And we're

3806
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:36,960
run all of these guys out. And we're
 

3807
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:42,790
run all of these guys out. And we're
starting to see that

3808
01:36:42,790 --> 01:36:42,800

 

3809
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,390

today. I was really wrong on my

3810
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:44,400
today. I was really wrong on my
 

3811
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,709
today. I was really wrong on my
assumptions. I don't have edge in the

3812
01:36:46,709 --> 01:36:46,719
assumptions. I don't have edge in the
 

3813
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:47,910
assumptions. I don't have edge in the
market.

3814
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:47,920
market.
 

3815
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:52,390

I missed out on 200.

3816
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:52,400
I missed out on 200.
 

3817
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,149
I missed out on 200.
You mean I was wrong and you missed out

3818
01:36:54,149 --> 01:36:54,159
You mean I was wrong and you missed out
 

3819
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:57,350
You mean I was wrong and you missed out
because of me? Well, I wasn't wrong. We

3820
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:57,360
because of me? Well, I wasn't wrong. We
 

3821
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,590
because of me? Well, I wasn't wrong. We
didn't sweep either side. I wasn't

3822
01:36:59,590 --> 01:36:59,600
didn't sweep either side. I wasn't
 

3823
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,229
didn't sweep either side. I wasn't
wrong. I didn't like it. I waited for it

3824
01:37:02,229 --> 01:37:02,239
wrong. I didn't like it. I waited for it
 

3825
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:07,590
wrong. I didn't like it. I waited for it
to hold and guess what? We're long. So,

3826
01:37:07,590 --> 01:37:07,600
to hold and guess what? We're long. So,
 

3827
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:11,350
to hold and guess what? We're long. So,
you're waiting for signals. And I told

3828
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:11,360
you're waiting for signals. And I told
 

3829
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:12,950
you're waiting for signals. And I told
you what I'm looking for. When everyone

3830
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:12,960
you what I'm looking for. When everyone
 

3831
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,709
you what I'm looking for. When everyone
was talking about this collapsing, I

3832
01:37:14,709 --> 01:37:14,719
was talking about this collapsing, I
 

3833
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:16,310
was talking about this collapsing, I
told you what I was looking for. I don't

3834
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:16,320
told you what I was looking for. I don't
 

3835
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:23,990
told you what I was looking for. I don't
know what crack you're smoking, mate.

3836
01:37:23,990 --> 01:37:24,000

 

3837
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,669

Do I use ENT in the course? I've just

Do I use ENT in the course? I've just
 

3839
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:27,109
Do I use ENT in the course? I've just
bought ENT and have a really hard time

3840
01:37:27,109 --> 01:37:27,119
bought ENT and have a really hard time
 

3841
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:31,109
bought ENT and have a really hard time
with it. Yeah, uh I I teach on here. Um

3842
01:37:31,109 --> 01:37:31,119
with it. Yeah, uh I I teach on here. Um
 

3843
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:33,590
with it. Yeah, uh I I teach on here. Um
but we go over some NT stuff and in the

01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:33,600
but we go over some NT stuff and in the

long for this partial out early into

3856
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:48,960
long for this partial out early into
 

3857
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,830
long for this partial out early into
here bit more here and I'll just see if

3858
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:51,840
here bit more here and I'll just see if
 

3859
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,270
here bit more here and I'll just see if
we can get up here. We might not be able

3860
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:53,280
we can get up here. We might not be able
 

3861
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:56,390
we can get up here. We might not be able
to but hopefully we can. If ES can't get

3862
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:56,400
to but hopefully we can. If ES can't get
 

3863
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,390
to but hopefully we can. If ES can't get
going then we might end up cutting this

3864
01:37:58,390 --> 01:37:58,400
going then we might end up cutting this
 

3865
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:02,790
going then we might end up cutting this
early.

execution and for order flow. So I have

3874
01:38:10,709 --> 01:38:10,719
execution and for order flow. So I have
 

3875
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:12,629
execution and for order flow. So I have
my footprint charts on there and then

3876
01:38:12,629 --> 01:38:12,639
my footprint charts on there and then
 

3877
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:14,470
my footprint charts on there and then
bookmap as well. I just like like the

3878
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:14,480
bookmap as well. I just like like the
 

3879
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:16,229
bookmap as well. I just like like the
visual representation. I like to see the

3880
01:38:16,229 --> 01:38:16,239
visual representation. I like to see the
 

3881
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:19,990
visual representation. I like to see the
tape. Sometimes like I might see like a

3882
01:38:19,990 --> 01:38:20,000
tape. Sometimes like I might see like a
 

3883
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,030
tape. Sometimes like I might see like a
like a delta on the volume profile delta

3884
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:23,040
like a delta on the volume profile delta
 

3885
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:25,430
like a delta on the volume profile delta
on the the uh level two. Sometimes I

3886
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:25,440
on the the uh level two. Sometimes I
 

3887
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:29,189
on the the uh level two. Sometimes I
might see it stand out on um on the

3888
01:38:29,189 --> 01:38:29,199
might see it stand out on um on the
 

3889
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:32,310
might see it stand out on um on the
footprint. So just any way that I that

3890
01:38:32,310 --> 01:38:32,320
footprint. So just any way that I that
 

3891
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,990
footprint. So just any way that I that
gives me edge really anywhere where I

3892
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:34,000
gives me edge really anywhere where I
 

3893
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,709
gives me edge really anywhere where I
can see it.

3894
01:38:36,709 --> 01:38:36,719
can see it.
 

3895
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:41,910
can see it.
There you go.

win rate. A lot of my winners might be
 

3925
01:39:31,119 --> 01:39:32,709
win rate. A lot of my winners might be
like one tick winners because I get

3926
01:39:32,709 --> 01:39:32,719
like one tick winners because I get
 

3927
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:34,390
like one tick winners because I get
knocked out break even. You'll see me so

3928
01:39:34,390 --> 01:39:34,400
knocked out break even. You'll see me so
 

3929
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:37,350

3939
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:05,510
use 100 rows on AVP. Uh I I would advise
using either a thousand rows or two

3940
01:40:05,510 --> 01:40:05,520
using either a thousand rows or two
 

3941
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:19,509
using either a thousand rows or two
ticks. I use two ticks currently.

01:40:53,669 --> 01:40:53,679
Everything I learned from other mentors
 

3961
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:55,910
Everything I learned from other mentors
was terrible

3962
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:55,920
was terrible
 

3963
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:58,149
was terrible
and coupe will testify to that as well.

3964
01:40:58,149 --> 01:40:58,159
and coupe will testify to that as well.
 

3965
01:40:58,159 --> 01:41:02,149

Other that's not fair. Other than the

01:41:02,149 --> 01:41:02,159
Other that's not fair. Other than the
 

3967
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:05,350
Other that's not fair. Other than the
guy guys that investors underground, but

3968
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:05,360
guy guys that investors underground, but
 

3969
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:08,550
guy guys that investors underground, but
they really focus on small caps

3970
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:08,560
they really focus on small caps
 

3971
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,310
they really focus on small caps
other than them, but I don't think

3972
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:10,320
other than them, but I don't think
 

3973
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,709
other than them, but I don't think
they're necessarily great teachers.

3974

they're necessarily great teachers.
 

3975
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:14,229
they're necessarily great teachers.
That's not like a disrespect. I think

3976
01:41:14,229 --> 01:41:14,239
That's not like a disrespect. I think
 

3977
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:16,149
That's not like a disrespect. I think
they're really good traders. They're

3978
01:41:16,149 --> 01:41:16,159
they're really good traders. They're
 

3979
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:18,470
they're really good traders. They're
really good or for me, they were really

3980
01:41:18,470 --> 01:41:18,480
really good or for me, they were really
 

3981
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:19,990
really good or for me, they were really
good at making me understand levels.

3982
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:20,000
good at making me understand levels.
 

3983
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,510
good at making me understand levels.
What I struggled with is like the

3984
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:21,520
What I struggled with is like the
 

3985
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:22,950
What I struggled with is like the
pedagogy. I couldn't like necessarily

3986
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:22,960
pedagogy. I couldn't like necessarily
 

3987
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:24,870
pedagogy. I couldn't like necessarily
always absorb what was being said, but

3988

always absorb what was being said, but
 

3989
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:29,350
always absorb what was being said, but
maybe I was just too new. [snorts]

All my entries are based on people being
 

4029
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:15,830
All my entries are based on people being
trapped in a market. All the market only

4030
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:15,840
trapped in a market. All the market only
 

4031
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:17,430
trapped in a market. All the market only
moves based on people being trapped in

4032
01:42:17,430 --> 01:42:17,440
moves based on people being trapped in
 

4033
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,189
moves based on people being trapped in
the market. You should understand that.

4034
01:42:19,189 --> 01:42:19,199
the market. You should understand that.
 

4035
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:21,340
the market. You should understand that.
It's the only reason the market moves.

4036
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:21,350
It's the only reason the market moves.
 

4037
01:42:21,350 --> 01:42:27,030
It's the only reason the market moves.

01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,270

How do you validate a low volume node?

4040
01:42:29,270 --> 01:42:29,280
How do you validate a low volume node?
 

4041
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:31,270
How do you validate a low volume node?
uh the reaction and what happens in that

4042
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:31,280
uh the reaction and what happens in that
 

4043
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:33,350
uh the reaction and what happens in that
low volume node. Really, you can't

4044
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:33,360
low volume node. Really, you can't
 

4045
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:34,950
low volume node. Really, you can't
always validate a trades. I would I

4046
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:34,960
always validate a trades. I would I
 

4047
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,870
always validate a trades. I would I
would say though that's one thing like

4048
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:36,880
would say though that's one thing like
 

4049
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,750
would say though that's one thing like
there is

4050
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:39,760
there is
 

4051
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:42,310
there is
I like to look for reactions. Sometimes

4052
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:42,320
I like to look for reactions. Sometimes
 

4053
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,790
I like to look for reactions. Sometimes
it costs me the ability to get in. For

4054
01:42:44,790 --> 01:42:44,800
it costs me the ability to get in. For
 

4055
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:47,430
it costs me the ability to get in. For
example, if you were willing to long in

4056
01:42:47,430 --> 01:42:47,440
example, if you were willing to long in
 

4057
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:49,990
example, if you were willing to long in
this low volume node and maybe add all

4058
01:42:49,990 --> 01:42:50,000
this low volume node and maybe add all
 

4059
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,990
this low volume node and maybe add all
the way down into this high volume node

4060
01:42:51,990 --> 01:42:52,000
the way down into this high volume node
 

4061
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,750
the way down into this high volume node
and risk the other side of this high

4062
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:53,760
and risk the other side of this high
 

4063
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,830
and risk the other side of this high
volume node, right? There is an there is

4064
01:42:55,830 --> 01:42:55,840
volume node, right? There is an there is
 

4065
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:59,270
volume node, right? There is an there is
a case for this being support right down

4066
01:42:59,270 --> 01:42:59,280
a case for this being support right down
 

4067
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:01,590
a case for this being support right down
all the way down to the bottom and for

4068
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:01,600
all the way down to the bottom and for
 

4069
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:04,149
all the way down to the bottom and for
this running up here. What I like to

4070
01:43:04,149 --> 01:43:04,159
this running up here. What I like to
 

4071
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:06,470
this running up here. What I like to
look for is for this to come down into

4072
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:06,480
look for is for this to come down into
 

4073
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,109
look for is for this to come down into
here to see sellers get stuck to see

4074
01:43:09,109 --> 01:43:09,119
here to see sellers get stuck to see
 

4075
01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:11,590
here to see sellers get stuck to see
absorption and to move higher. That

4076
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:11,600
absorption and to move higher. That
 

4077
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,270
absorption and to move higher. That
might mean that I'm joining slightly

4078
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:13,280
might mean that I'm joining slightly
 

4079
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:15,750
might mean that I'm joining slightly
later. But what it means is I know or I

4080
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:15,760
later. But what it means is I know or I
 

4081
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:16,870
later. But what it means is I know or I
have more confidence that we're going to

4082
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:16,880
have more confidence that we're going to
 

4083
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:19,669
have more confidence that we're going to
go higher. So sometimes I don't get the

4084
01:43:19,669 --> 01:43:19,679
go higher. So sometimes I don't get the
 

4085
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:21,990
go higher. So sometimes I don't get the
best price but I get the momentum.

4086
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:22,000
best price but I get the momentum.
 

4087
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,590
best price but I get the momentum.
Hopefully that makes sense.

4088
01:43:25,590 --> 01:43:25,600
Hopefully that makes sense.
 

4089
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,669
Hopefully that makes sense.
So, like if if you were willing to just

4090
01:43:27,669 --> 01:43:27,679
So, like if if you were willing to just
 

4091
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:29,669
So, like if if you were willing to just
buy this in this node all the way down

4092
01:43:29,669 --> 01:43:29,679
buy this in this node all the way down
 

4093
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:32,550
buy this in this node all the way down
to here, it might be that we do this. I

4094
01:43:32,550 --> 01:43:32,560
to here, it might be that we do this. I
 

4095
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,310
to here, it might be that we do this. I
would if I was going to buy that, I'd

4096
01:43:34,310 --> 01:43:34,320
would if I was going to buy that, I'd
 

4097
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:38,070
would if I was going to buy that, I'd
need to see in here,

4098
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:38,080
need to see in here,
 

4099
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:40,709
need to see in here,
right? I'd need to see sellers

4100
01:43:40,709 --> 01:43:40,719
right? I'd need to see sellers
 

4101
01:43:40,719 --> 01:43:43,189
right? I'd need to see sellers
get stuck,

4102
01:43:43,189 --> 01:43:43,199
get stuck,
 

4103
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:45,350
get stuck,
right? I need to see this to be red and

4104
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:45,360
right? I need to see this to be red and
 

4105
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,590
right? I need to see this to be red and
buyers absorbing and us to move price

4106
01:43:47,590 --> 01:43:47,600
buyers absorbing and us to move price
 

4107
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,350
buyers absorbing and us to move price
higher. That's what I would need to see

4108
01:43:49,350 --> 01:43:49,360
higher. That's what I would need to see
 

4109
01:43:49,360 --> 01:44:11,189
higher. That's what I would need to see
for how I like to trade with momentum.

4110
01:44:11,189 --> 01:44:11,199

 

4111
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:13,590

What sites for news, dates, and

01:44:13,590 --> 01:44:13,600
What sites for news, dates, and
 

4113
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,470
What sites for news, dates, and
calendar? Um, market watch and financial

4114
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:16,480
calendar? Um, market watch and financial
 

4115
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:20,709
calendar? Um, market watch and financial
juice probably the best places.

4116
01:44:20,709 --> 01:44:20,719

 

4117
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:22,070

Sorry guys, trying to catch up with

4118
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:22,080
Sorry guys, trying to catch up with
 

4119
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:25,109
Sorry guys, trying to catch up with
everything you're saying here.

4120
01:44:25,109 --> 01:44:25,119
everything you're saying here.
 

4121
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:26,950
everything you're saying here.
How quickly do I move my stock to break

4122
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:26,960
How quickly do I move my stock to break
 

4123
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:29,030
How quickly do I move my stock to break
even? If we're in a squeeze, then pretty

4124
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:29,040
even? If we're in a squeeze, then pretty
 

4125
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:30,629
even? If we're in a squeeze, then pretty
quickly because when we squeeze and we

4126
01:44:30,629 --> 01:44:30,639
quickly because when we squeeze and we
 

4127
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,310
quickly because when we squeeze and we
latch structure, when we're like

4128
01:44:32,310 --> 01:44:32,320
latch structure, when we're like
 

4129
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:33,830
latch structure, when we're like
grinding like this, you don't have to

4130
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:33,840
grinding like this, you don't have to
 

4131
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:47,189
grinding like this, you don't have to
worry about it so much.

4132
01:44:47,189 --> 01:44:47,199

 

4133
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:48,709

So squeeze still going. We're still

4134
01:44:48,709 --> 01:44:48,719
So squeeze still going. We're still
 

4135
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:50,149
So squeeze still going. We're still
looking for those. It might not do it in

4136
01:44:50,149 --> 01:44:50,159
looking for those. It might not do it in
 

4137
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:51,669
looking for those. It might not do it in
one go, folks. All right, we are to a

4138
01:44:51,669 --> 01:44:51,679
one go, folks. All right, we are to a
 

4139
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:53,109
one go, folks. All right, we are to a
pullback. Just be aware of that. So if

4140
01:44:53,109 --> 01:44:53,119
pullback. Just be aware of that. So if
 

4141
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:53,990
pullback. Just be aware of that. So if
you don't want to sit through a

4142
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:54,000
you don't want to sit through a
 

4143
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,270
you don't want to sit through a
pullback, you can move your stop

4144
01:44:55,270 --> 01:44:55,280
pullback, you can move your stop
 

4145
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:59,750
pullback, you can move your stop
tighter.

4146
01:44:59,750 --> 01:44:59,760

01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,030

I remember seeing a video
 

4173
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:53,109
I remember seeing a video
not that long ago. Flash up and uh it

4174

not that long ago. Flash up and uh it
 

4175

was an orderflow video.

No, they haven't. Apex don't do that

No, they haven't. Apex don't do that

No, they haven't. Apex don't do that
compliance stuff. That was like like two

compliance stuff. That was like like two

years ago now. That stopped a long time

At the moment, I'm in my TPT. So, I've

4190
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:32,880
At the moment, I'm in my TPT. So, I've
 

4191
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:34,709
At the moment, I'm in my TPT. So, I've
just got one left. Trying to get all the

4192
01:46:34,709 --> 01:46:34,719
just got one left. Trying to get all the
 

4193
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:36,070
just got one left. Trying to get all the
way up there. See if I can make like

4194
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:36,080
way up there. See if I can make like
 

4195
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:39,189
way up there. See if I can make like
another $200 on that one. I was

4196
01:46:39,189 --> 01:46:39,199
another $200 on that one. I was
 

4197
01:46:39,199 --> 01:46:40,550
another $200 on that one. I was
aggressive for the first part of the

4198
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:40,560
aggressive for the first part of the
 

4199
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:43,350
aggressive for the first part of the
move, but we're getting quite extended

4200
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:43,360
move, but we're getting quite extended
 

4201
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:46,390
move, but we're getting quite extended
here. If we think about

4202
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:46,400
here. If we think about
 

4203
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,310
here. If we think about
if we think about projected targets from

4204
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:48,320
if we think about projected targets from
 

4205
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:53,990
if we think about projected targets from
what we've done in New York,

4206
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:54,000

 

4207
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,070

right, we're at coming up to 300% move.

4208
01:46:58,070 --> 01:46:58,080
right, we're at coming up to 300% move.
 

4209
01:46:58,080 --> 01:46:59,830
right, we're at coming up to 300% move.
If we go from like some of these

4210
01:46:59,830 --> 01:46:59,840
If we go from like some of these
 

4211
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:03,590
If we go from like some of these
pullbacks here,

4212
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:03,600

 

4213
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:06,709

same thing.

4214
01:47:06,709 --> 01:47:06,719
same thing.
 

4215
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:09,430
same thing.
Even if we go from this flat top. Oh,

4216
01:47:09,430 --> 01:47:09,440
Even if we go from this flat top. Oh,
 

4217
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:14,790
Even if we go from this flat top. Oh,
don't move that one. I need that one.

4218
01:47:14,790 --> 01:47:14,800

 

4219
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,790

same thing. So, we're doing 300%. No

4220
01:47:16,790 --> 01:47:16,800
same thing. So, we're doing 300%. No
 

4221
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,310
same thing. So, we're doing 300%. No
matter what pullback we're looking at,

4222
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:18,320
matter what pullback we're looking at,
 

4223
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,229
matter what pullback we're looking at,
we're doing 300% moves. So, if we're

4224
01:47:20,229 --> 01:47:20,239
we're doing 300% moves. So, if we're
 

4225
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:22,550
we're doing 300% moves. So, if we're
lucky, they'll count this as one, but I

4226
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:22,560
lucky, they'll count this as one, but I
 

4227
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:23,590
lucky, they'll count this as one, but I
don't think we've built out enough

4228
01:47:23,590 --> 01:47:23,600
don't think we've built out enough
 

4229
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:25,270
don't think we've built out enough
liquidity here. And then we'd almost be

4230
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:25,280
liquidity here. And then we'd almost be
 

4231
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:27,590
liquidity here. And then we'd almost be
getting there. But, we are probably due

4232
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:27,600
getting there. But, we are probably due
 

4233
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,510
getting there. But, we are probably due
a nasty little pullback soon because

4234
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:29,520
a nasty little pullback soon because

very easily see this

going to sit through that. In fact, I

going to sit through that. In fact, I
 

4245
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:40,149
going to sit through that. In fact, I
might move my stop up here and just

4246
01:47:40,149 --> 01:47:40,159
might move my stop up here and just
 

4247
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:41,590
might move my stop up here and just
protect everything. make sure I'm going

4248

protect everything. make sure I'm going

have of it going somewhere. Like we're

4304
01:49:23,669 --> 01:49:23,679
have of it going somewhere. Like we're
 

4305
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:26,149

very The hard thing now is right, we're

01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:28,310
very The hard thing now is right, we're
almost here. We need another 60 points

4308
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:28,320
almost here. We need another 60 points
 

4309
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:31,669
almost here. We need another 60 points
higher. Have we pulled back?

4310
01:49:31,669 --> 01:49:31,679
higher. Have we pulled back?
 

4311
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:34,550
higher. Have we pulled back?
Like let me get like very very simple,

4312
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:34,560
Like let me get like very very simple,
 

4313
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:37,350

right? Have we pulled back? No. The

4314
01:49:37,350 --> 01:49:37,360
right? Have we pulled back? No. The
 

4315
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:40,229
right? Have we pulled back? No. The
pullback can easily be, you know, 70 80

4316
01:49:40,229 --> 01:49:40,239
pullback can easily be, you know, 70 80
 

4317
01:49:40,239 --> 01:49:41,830
pullback can easily be, you know, 70 80
points. I don't really want to give all

4318
01:49:41,830 --> 01:49:41,840
points. I don't really want to give all
 

4319
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,350
points. I don't really want to give all
that back. Like if we start seeing

4320
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:43,360
that back. Like if we start seeing
 

4321
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:44,950
that back. Like if we start seeing
flushes in this market, I'll probably

4322
01:49:44,950 --> 01:49:44,960
flushes in this market, I'll probably
 

4323
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:47,189
flushes in this market, I'll probably
get get out and then just like look to

4324
01:49:47,189 --> 01:49:47,199
get get out and then just like look to
 

4325
01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:49,109
get get out and then just like look to
rejoin if I think that the target is

4326
01:49:49,109 --> 01:49:49,119
rejoin if I think that the target is
 

4327
01:49:49,119 --> 01:50:01,910
rejoin if I think that the target is
still very viable.

4328

4332
01:50:04,870 --> 01:50:04,880
pullback level to look for? I'd be
 

4333
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:09,109
pullback level to look for? I'd be

4339
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,750
initial balance because this is the top
of the stops. Remember the gray box is

4340
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:15,760
of the stops. Remember the gray box is
 

4341
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:17,669
of the stops. Remember the gray box is
the top of the stops from a swing

4342
01:50:17,669 --> 01:50:17,679
the top of the stops from a swing
 

4343
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:19,830
the top of the stops from a swing
perspective. If it pulls back into here

4344
01:50:19,830 --> 01:50:19,840
perspective. If it pulls back into here
 

4345
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,990
perspective. If it pulls back into here
and does something like this, then it's

4346
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:22,000
and does something like this, then it's
 

4347
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,629
and does something like this, then it's
probably a chance to get long again. If

4348
01:50:24,629 --> 01:50:24,639
probably a chance to get long again. If
 

4349
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:26,550
probably a chance to get long again. If
you start losing this though, you do not

4350
01:50:26,550 --> 01:50:26,560
you start losing this though, you do not
 

4351
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,910
you start losing this though, you do not
want to be adding long because this

4352
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:27,920
want to be adding long because this
 

4353
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:30,470
want to be adding long because this
collapse back down here is possible. So,

4354
01:50:30,470 --> 01:50:30,480
collapse back down here is possible. So,
 

4355
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:32,229
collapse back down here is possible. So,
this this area here becomes key for

4356
01:50:32,229 --> 01:50:32,239
this this area here becomes key for
 

4357
01:50:32,239 --> 01:50:33,350
this this area here becomes key for
sentiment all the time. We're above

4358
01:50:33,350 --> 01:50:33,360
sentiment all the time. We're above
 

4359
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:34,550
sentiment all the time. We're above
that. Remember, we're above initial

4360
01:50:34,550 --> 01:50:34,560
that. Remember, we're above initial
 

4361
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:35,590
that. Remember, we're above initial
balance. We talked about it. Someone

4362
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:35,600
balance. We talked about it. Someone
 

4363
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:36,870
balance. We talked about it. Someone
talked about the IB trade and I said,

4364
01:50:36,870 --> 01:50:36,880
talked about the IB trade and I said,
 

4365
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:38,709
talked about the IB trade and I said,
well, we might be in the IB expansion

4366
01:50:38,709 --> 01:50:38,719
well, we might be in the IB expansion
 

4367
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:40,870
well, we might be in the IB expansion
trade. Here you go. Absorption of IB

4368
01:50:40,870 --> 01:50:40,880
trade. Here you go. Absorption of IB
 

4369
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:43,270
trade. Here you go. Absorption of IB
expansion move. Right. Even if we

4370
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:43,280
expansion move. Right. Even if we
 

4371
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:46,229
expansion move. Right. Even if we
measure out the IB today. Let's see

4372
01:50:46,229 --> 01:50:46,239
measure out the IB today. Let's see
 

4373
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:51,830
measure out the IB today. Let's see
where the six um the measured move is.

4374
01:50:51,830 --> 01:50:51,840

 

4375
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:55,030

Well, that's pretty good, isn't it? I

4376
01:50:55,030 --> 01:50:55,040
Well, that's pretty good, isn't it? I
 

4377
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:57,430
Well, that's pretty good, isn't it? I
wonder if they did that on purpose. So,

4378
01:50:57,430 --> 01:50:57,440
wonder if they did that on purpose. So,
 

4379
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:59,270
wonder if they did that on purpose. So,
the previous week naked point of control

4380
01:50:59,270 --> 01:50:59,280
the previous week naked point of control
 

4381
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:02,310
the previous week naked point of control
is right at the 1618 of the initial

4382
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:02,320
is right at the 1618 of the initial
 

4383
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:04,390
is right at the 1618 of the initial
balance expansion.

4384
01:51:04,390 --> 01:51:04,400
balance expansion.
 

4385
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:05,910
balance expansion.
Well, that gives me a lot of confidence

4386
01:51:05,910 --> 01:51:05,920
Well, that gives me a lot of confidence
 

4387
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:12,709
Well, that gives me a lot of confidence
that's where we're going to try and go.

4388
01:51:12,709 --> 01:51:12,719

 

4389
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:16,229

that can um that can actually work in

4390
01:51:16,229 --> 01:51:16,239
that can um that can actually work in
 

4391
01:51:16,239 --> 01:51:17,430
that can um that can actually work in
your favor, Tyson, because you're going

4392
01:51:17,430 --> 01:51:17,440
your favor, Tyson, because you're going
 

4393
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:18,870
your favor, Tyson, because you're going
to trade eight more days now and you'll

4394
01:51:18,870 --> 01:51:18,880
to trade eight more days now and you'll
 

4395
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:21,109
to trade eight more days now and you'll
build out more of a buffer. Sometimes it

4396
01:51:21,109 --> 01:51:21,119
build out more of a buffer. Sometimes it
 

4397
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:29,750
build out more of a buffer. Sometimes it
works in your favor.

4398
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:29,760

 

4399
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,109

So, you got to think, why are we going

4400
01:51:31,109 --> 01:51:31,119
So, you got to think, why are we going
 

4401
01:51:31,119 --> 01:51:33,430
So, you got to think, why are we going
higher here? Well, the mag's all gone

4402
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:33,440
higher here? Well, the mag's all gone
 

4403
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:36,550
higher here? Well, the mag's all gone
green. Apple's gone green. And guess

4404
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:36,560
green. Apple's gone green. And guess
 

4405
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,470
green. Apple's gone green. And guess
who's making us go higher? The shorts

4406
01:51:38,470 --> 01:51:38,480
who's making us go higher? The shorts
 

4407
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:40,070
who's making us go higher? The shorts
that tried here. the shorts that tried

4408
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:40,080
that tried here. the shorts that tried
 

4409
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:41,669
that tried here. the shorts that tried
here, the shorts that tried here, the

4410
01:51:41,669 --> 01:51:41,679
here, the shorts that tried here, the
 

4411
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:43,189
here, the shorts that tried here, the
shorts that tried here, the shorts that

4412
01:51:43,189 --> 01:51:43,199
shorts that tried here, the shorts that
 

4413
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:45,030
shorts that tried here, the shorts that
tried here, and every time we go higher,

4414
01:51:45,030 --> 01:51:45,040
tried here, and every time we go higher,
 

4415
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:47,030
tried here, and every time we go higher,
they stop out. And we go and we go and

4416
01:51:47,030 --> 01:51:47,040
they stop out. And we go and we go and
 

4417
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:49,030
they stop out. And we go and we go and
we go. Once we see exhaustion, you'll

4418
01:51:49,030 --> 01:51:49,040
we go. Once we see exhaustion, you'll
 

4419
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:50,709
we go. Once we see exhaustion, you'll
see the pull back and attempt to go

4420
01:51:50,709 --> 01:51:50,719
see the pull back and attempt to go
 

4421
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:52,310
see the pull back and attempt to go
higher again. We're almost there, folks.

4422
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:52,320
higher again. We're almost there, folks.
 

4423
01:51:52,320 --> 01:52:24,950
higher again. We're almost there, folks.
We are almost there.

4424
01:52:24,950 --> 01:52:24,960

 

4425
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:27,030

is this NQ or NQ1? That's the same

4426
01:52:27,030 --> 01:52:27,040
is this NQ or NQ1? That's the same
 

4427
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:30,870
is this NQ or NQ1? That's the same
thing, right? NQ1 is the same as NQ. NQ1

4428
01:52:30,870 --> 01:52:30,880
thing, right? NQ1 is the same as NQ. NQ1
 

4429
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:31,910
thing, right? NQ1 is the same as NQ. NQ1
is always going to be the current

4430
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:31,920
is always going to be the current
 

4431
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:34,070
is always going to be the current
contract. The current contract is NQ.

4432
01:52:34,070 --> 01:52:34,080
contract. The current contract is NQ.
 

4433
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:40,629
contract. The current contract is NQ.
It's the same thing.

4434
01:52:40,629 --> 01:52:40,639

 

4435
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:43,189

Yeah, I do use fibs. Yeah, absolutely.

4436
01:52:43,189 --> 01:52:43,199
Yeah, I do use fibs. Yeah, absolutely.
 

4437
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:44,709
Yeah, I do use fibs. Yeah, absolutely.
Often I don't draw them on because I

4438
01:52:44,709 --> 01:52:44,719
Often I don't draw them on because I
 

4439
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:47,030
Often I don't draw them on because I
can, you know, I can kind of visualize

4440
01:52:47,030 --> 01:52:47,040
can, you know, I can kind of visualize
 

4441
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:50,390
can, you know, I can kind of visualize
where a 50% drawback or a 61% or a 33%

4442
01:52:50,390 --> 01:52:50,400
where a 50% drawback or a 61% or a 33%
 

4443
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:53,990
where a 50% drawback or a 61% or a 33%
draw like pullback would be.

4444
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:54,000
draw like pullback would be.
 

4445
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,950
draw like pullback would be.
Rain life, I spent $7,000 on one teacher

4446
01:52:56,950 --> 01:52:56,960
Rain life, I spent $7,000 on one teacher
 

4447
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:59,270
Rain life, I spent $7,000 on one teacher
a couple years ago

4448
01:52:59,270 --> 01:52:59,280
a couple years ago
 

4449
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:01,510
a couple years ago
and for $699, it's a bargain. I've

4450
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:01,520
and for $699, it's a bargain. I've
 

4451
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,109
and for $699, it's a bargain. I've
learned so much just the past week

4452
01:53:03,109 --> 01:53:03,119
learned so much just the past week
 

4453
01:53:03,119 --> 01:53:04,870
learned so much just the past week
trading with you. That's awesome. I'm

4454
01:53:04,870 --> 01:53:04,880
trading with you. That's awesome. I'm
 

4455
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:07,589
trading with you. That's awesome. I'm
sorry that you spent7,000 on someone and

4456
01:53:07,589 --> 01:53:07,599
sorry that you spent7,000 on someone and
 

4457
01:53:07,599 --> 01:53:09,830
sorry that you spent7,000 on someone and
it's it's ridiculous, isn't it? The the

4458
01:53:09,830 --> 01:53:09,840
it's it's ridiculous, isn't it? The the
 

4459
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:19,910
it's it's ridiculous, isn't it? The the
garbage they teach for insane money.

4460
01:53:19,910 --> 01:53:19,920

 

4461
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:22,390

What was the 860? I said no. 8.90 up

4462
01:53:22,390 --> 01:53:22,400
What was the 860? I said no. 8.90 up
 

4463
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:25,430
What was the 860? I said no. 8.90 up
here. All right. It's a naked point of

4464
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:25,440
here. All right. It's a naked point of
 

4465
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:29,830
here. All right. It's a naked point of
control on a weekly and it's also a 168

4466
01:53:29,830 --> 01:53:29,840
control on a weekly and it's also a 168
 

4467
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,750
control on a weekly and it's also a 168
expansion of the initial balance. So if

4468
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:31,760
expansion of the initial balance. So if
 

4469
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:36,390
expansion of the initial balance. So if
you do a fib of the initial balance,

4470
01:53:36,390 --> 01:53:36,400
you do a fib of the initial balance,
 

4471
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:39,109
you do a fib of the initial balance,
you can see the 1618 is right into the

4472
01:53:39,109 --> 01:53:39,119
you can see the 1618 is right into the
 

4473
01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:41,510
you can see the 1618 is right into the
same level

4474
01:53:41,510 --> 01:53:41,520
same level
 

4475
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:43,430
same level
literally to the tick pretty much. Yeah,

4476
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:43,440
literally to the tick pretty much. Yeah,
 

4477
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:45,589
literally to the tick pretty much. Yeah,
to the tick of the previous week point

4478
01:53:45,589 --> 01:53:45,599
to the tick of the previous week point
 

4479
01:53:45,599 --> 01:53:46,790
to the tick of the previous week point
of control. That is where they want to

4480
01:53:46,790 --> 01:53:46,800
of control. That is where they want to
 

4481
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:48,390
of control. That is where they want to
go. We haven't pulled back. So just be

4482
01:53:48,390 --> 01:53:48,400
go. We haven't pulled back. So just be
 

4483
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,310
go. We haven't pulled back. So just be
aware it might pull back like we are

4484
01:53:50,310 --> 01:53:50,320
aware it might pull back like we are
 

4485
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:51,910
aware it might pull back like we are

4539
01:55:05,119 --> 01:55:06,709

because we've not swept that liquidity.

01:58:50,320 --> 01:59:14,870
130 odd points. Not bad.
Not bad.

4646
01:59:14,870 --> 01:59:14,880

 

4647
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:16,550

Nice work everyone. Yeah, lovely work

4648
01:59:16,550 --> 01:59:16,560
Nice work everyone. Yeah, lovely work
 

4649
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:18,550
Nice work everyone. Yeah, lovely work
everyone.

4650
01:59:18,550 --> 01:59:18,560
everyone.
 

4651
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:20,950
everyone.
No, I swear just it required so much

4652
01:59:20,950 --> 01:59:20,960
No, I swear just it required so much
 

4653
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:24,310
No, I swear just it required so much
patience today. We had to avoid it was

4654
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:24,320
patience today. We had to avoid it was
 

4655
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:25,910
patience today. We had to avoid it was
it was very I was getting very

4656
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:25,920
it was very I was getting very
 

4657
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:27,270
it was very I was getting very
frustrated when we were doing this

4658
01:59:27,270 --> 01:59:27,280
frustrated when we were doing this
 

4659
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:29,430
frustrated when we were doing this
nonsense here because we weren't

4660
01:59:29,430 --> 01:59:29,440
nonsense here because we weren't
 

4661
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:30,870
nonsense here because we weren't
sweeping anyone and we weren't

4662
01:59:30,870 --> 01:59:30,880
sweeping anyone and we weren't
 

4663
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:33,030
sweeping anyone and we weren't
reclaiming a level. But you see like the

4664
01:59:33,030 --> 01:59:33,040
reclaiming a level. But you see like the
 

4665
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:34,870
reclaiming a level. But you see like the
importance like even here I got pissed

4666
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:34,880
importance like even here I got pissed
 

4667
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:36,390
importance like even here I got pissed
off because I'm like this goes all the

4668
01:59:36,390 --> 01:59:36,400
off because I'm like this goes all the
 

4669
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:38,070
off because I'm like this goes all the
way up. My fear was that we did

4670
01:59:38,070 --> 01:59:38,080
way up. My fear was that we did
 

4671
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:39,910
way up. My fear was that we did
something stupid.

4672
01:59:39,910 --> 01:59:39,920
something stupid.
 

4673
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:42,709
something stupid.
But fortunately, all right, fortunately

4674
01:59:42,709 --> 01:59:42,719
But fortunately, all right, fortunately
 

4675
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:44,950
But fortunately, all right, fortunately
they played the game in here and that

4676
01:59:44,950 --> 01:59:44,960
they played the game in here and that
 

4677
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:46,790
they played the game in here and that
gave us the entry. And that's the kind

4678
01:59:46,790 --> 01:59:46,800
gave us the entry. And that's the kind
 

4679
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:48,229
gave us the entry. And that's the kind
of build if you look at that. Just a

4680
01:59:48,229 --> 01:59:48,239
of build if you look at that. Just a
 

4681
01:59:48,239 --> 01:59:51,030
of build if you look at that. Just a
basic two-leg flag, isn't it? So in

4682
01:59:51,030 --> 01:59:51,040
basic two-leg flag, isn't it? So in
 

4683
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:52,390
basic two-leg flag, isn't it? So in
here, I'd be looking for an inverted

4684
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:52,400
here, I'd be looking for an inverted
 

4685
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:53,589
here, I'd be looking for an inverted
head and shoulders or something. Some

4686
01:59:53,589 --> 01:59:53,599
head and shoulders or something. Some
 

4687
01:59:53,599 --> 01:59:55,510
head and shoulders or something. Some
form of juicy trap. Now, if I was going

4688
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:55,520
form of juicy trap. Now, if I was going
 

4689
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:57,990
form of juicy trap. Now, if I was going
to reong, right? You'd want all the

4690
01:59:57,990 --> 01:59:58,000
to reong, right? You'd want all the
 

4691
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:01,669
to reong, right? You'd want all the
shorts to pile in and something like

4692
02:00:01,669 --> 02:00:01,679
shorts to pile in and something like
 

4693
02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:04,470
shorts to pile in and something like
this. It might take time to develop.

4694
02:00:04,470 --> 02:00:04,480
this. It might take time to develop.
 

4695
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:05,750
this. It might take time to develop.
Might be that they have to go sideways

4696
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:05,760
Might be that they have to go sideways
 

4697
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:08,070
Might be that they have to go sideways
into lunch and then do it later on in

4698
02:00:08,070 --> 02:00:08,080
into lunch and then do it later on in
 

4699
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:10,390
into lunch and then do it later on in
the day. But I think this will get

4700
02:00:10,390 --> 02:00:10,400
the day. But I think this will get
 

4701
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:12,310
the day. But I think this will get
tagged. I think it will get tagged.

4702
02:00:12,310 --> 02:00:12,320
tagged. I think it will get tagged.
 

4703
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:13,510
tagged. I think it will get tagged.
We're still holding flow zones. I mean,

4704
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:13,520
We're still holding flow zones. I mean,
 

4705
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:14,629
We're still holding flow zones. I mean,
some of you can still be long. There's

4706
02:00:14,629 --> 02:00:14,639
some of you can still be long. There's
 

4707
02:00:14,639 --> 02:00:16,208
some of you can still be long. There's
nothing wrong with still being long.

4708
02:00:16,208 --> 02:00:16,218
nothing wrong with still being long.
 

4709
02:00:16,218 --> 02:00:22,310
nothing wrong with still being long.
[snorts]

4710
02:00:22,310 --> 02:00:22,320

 

4711
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:24,229

Yeah, I felt the same. I felt the same.

4712
02:00:24,229 --> 02:00:24,239
Yeah, I felt the same. I felt the same.
 

4713
02:00:24,239 --> 02:00:25,750
Yeah, I felt the same. I felt the same.
Full forward. I felt the same. I was

4714
02:00:25,750 --> 02:00:25,760
Full forward. I felt the same. I was
 

4715
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:27,830
Full forward. I felt the same. I was
like, do I just hold it? Like I know

4716
02:00:27,830 --> 02:00:27,840
like, do I just hold it? Like I know
 

4717
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:29,430
like, do I just hold it? Like I know
it's going to go there, but the other

4718
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:29,440
it's going to go there, but the other
 

4719
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,589
it's going to go there, but the other
thing is like, do I really want to give

4720
02:00:31,589 --> 02:00:31,599
thing is like, do I really want to give
 

4721
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:33,750
thing is like, do I really want to give
100 point back on a pullback? Like I get

4722
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:33,760
100 point back on a pullback? Like I get
 

4723
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:39,270
100 point back on a pullback? Like I get
caught in that kind of frame of mind.

4724
02:00:39,270 --> 02:00:39,280

 

4725
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:42,229

900 up on the day. Can you sell? I mean,

4726
02:00:42,229 --> 02:00:42,239
900 up on the day. Can you sell? I mean,
 

4727
02:00:42,239 --> 02:00:44,310
900 up on the day. Can you sell? I mean,
I I wouldn't be selling. I wouldn't be a

4728
02:00:44,310 --> 02:00:44,320
I I wouldn't be selling. I wouldn't be a
 

4729
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:46,950
I I wouldn't be selling. I wouldn't be a
seller in this market right now. It's

4730
02:00:46,950 --> 02:00:46,960
seller in this market right now. It's
 

4731
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:49,430
seller in this market right now. It's
why it's we've got low hanging fruit up

4732
02:00:49,430 --> 02:00:49,440
why it's we've got low hanging fruit up
 

4733
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:51,350
why it's we've got low hanging fruit up
here to hit. You've not left volume yet.

4734
02:00:51,350 --> 02:00:51,360
here to hit. You've not left volume yet.
 

4735
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:52,870
here to hit. You've not left volume yet.
You've not created enough. I don't think

4736
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:52,880
You've not created enough. I don't think
 

4737
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:54,550
You've not created enough. I don't think
the high is even very good. I'll have a

4738
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:54,560
the high is even very good. I'll have a
 

4739
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:57,350
the high is even very good. I'll have a
look. It's not bad actually. It's not

4740
02:00:57,350 --> 02:00:57,360
look. It's not bad actually. It's not
 

4741
02:00:57,360 --> 02:01:00,310
look. It's not bad actually. It's not
too bad.

4742
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:00,320
too bad.
 

4743
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:01,990
too bad.
You can see absorption happening down

4744
02:01:01,990 --> 02:01:02,000
You can see absorption happening down
 

4745
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,270
You can see absorption happening down
here. Point of control on this

4746
02:01:03,270 --> 02:01:03,280
here. Point of control on this
 

4747
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:04,709
here. Point of control on this
fiveminute candle. How long have we got

4748
02:01:04,709 --> 02:01:04,719
fiveminute candle. How long have we got
 

4749
02:01:04,719 --> 02:01:06,470
fiveminute candle. How long have we got
left? One more minute on this fivem

4750
02:01:06,470 --> 02:01:06,480
left? One more minute on this fivem
 

4751
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:08,550
left? One more minute on this fivem
minute candle. We've just flipped point

4752
02:01:08,550 --> 02:01:08,560
minute candle. We've just flipped point
 

4753
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:10,070
minute candle. We've just flipped point
control up. Sellers right now stuck

4754
02:01:10,070 --> 02:01:10,080
control up. Sellers right now stuck
 

4755
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:11,350
control up. Sellers right now stuck
here. We have an imbalance down here

4756
02:01:11,350 --> 02:01:11,360
here. We have an imbalance down here
 

4757
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:13,910
here. We have an imbalance down here
into 800s. I think they they'll want to

4758
02:01:13,910 --> 02:01:13,920
into 800s. I think they they'll want to
 

4759
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:16,629
into 800s. I think they they'll want to
do a dip and rip. It just depends how

4760
02:01:16,629 --> 02:01:16,639
do a dip and rip. It just depends how
 

4761
02:01:16,639 --> 02:01:20,629
do a dip and rip. It just depends how
long they uh need to take to do it.

4762
02:01:20,629 --> 02:01:20,639
long they uh need to take to do it.
 

4763
02:01:20,639 --> 02:01:26,229
long they uh need to take to do it.
I don't think this is done yet.

4764
02:01:26,229 --> 02:01:26,239

 

4765
02:01:26,239 --> 02:01:29,910

625 690. Thanks, mate. Uh all right. So

4766
02:01:29,910 --> 02:01:29,920
625 690. Thanks, mate. Uh all right. So
 

4767
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:31,990
625 690. Thanks, mate. Uh all right. So
690 is where we're above it. It's

4768
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:32,000
690 is where we're above it. It's
 

4769
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,629
690 is where we're above it. It's
previous day high there for it to come

4770
02:01:34,629 --> 02:01:34,639
previous day high there for it to come
 

4771
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:36,950
previous day high there for it to come
and hit on spy

4772
02:01:36,950 --> 02:01:36,960
and hit on spy
 

4773
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:39,750
and hit on spy
65. Clear. Yeah, clearly a level on

4774
02:01:39,750 --> 02:01:39,760
65. Clear. Yeah, clearly a level on
 

4775
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:42,310
65. Clear. Yeah, clearly a level on
cues. Clearly levels. But if we get

4776
02:01:42,310 --> 02:01:42,320
cues. Clearly levels. But if we get
 

4777
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:43,990
cues. Clearly levels. But if we get
through that, we'll get positive gamma

4778
02:01:43,990 --> 02:01:44,000
through that, we'll get positive gamma
 

4779
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,070
through that, we'll get positive gamma
squeeze up to 627, I'd say. And the same

4780
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:48,080
squeeze up to 627, I'd say. And the same
 

4781
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:49,990
squeeze up to 627, I'd say. And the same
on ES. Remember ES is trying to do the

4782
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:50,000
on ES. Remember ES is trying to do the
 

4783
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,830
on ES. Remember ES is trying to do the
gap fill. We tal we talked about this

4784
02:01:51,830 --> 02:01:51,840
gap fill. We tal we talked about this
 

4785
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:55,990
gap fill. We tal we talked about this
yesterday on the spiders.

4786
02:01:55,990 --> 02:01:56,000
yesterday on the spiders.
 

4787
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,589
yesterday on the spiders.
Right, we've got gap fill above. There

4788
02:01:57,589 --> 02:01:57,599
Right, we've got gap fill above. There
 

4789
02:01:57,599 --> 02:01:59,510
Right, we've got gap fill above. There
it is. All right, that's the gap fill.

4790
02:01:59,510 --> 02:01:59,520
it is. All right, that's the gap fill.
 

4791
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:02,149
it is. All right, that's the gap fill.
We still haven't filled I move this out.

4792
02:02:02,149 --> 02:02:02,159
We still haven't filled I move this out.
 

4793
02:02:02,159 --> 02:02:04,390
We still haven't filled I move this out.
We still have not filled this gap. All

4794
02:02:04,390 --> 02:02:04,400
We still have not filled this gap. All
 

4795
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:05,910
We still have not filled this gap. All
right, we filled this on the cues

4796
02:02:05,910 --> 02:02:05,920
right, we filled this on the cues
 

4797
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:07,589
right, we filled this on the cues
yesterday. We have not filled this gap.

4798
02:02:07,589 --> 02:02:07,599
yesterday. We have not filled this gap.
 

4799
02:02:07,599 --> 02:02:09,669
yesterday. We have not filled this gap.
It's where the market wants to go. It's

4800
02:02:09,669 --> 02:02:09,679
It's where the market wants to go. It's
 

4801
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:26,310
It's where the market wants to go. It's
trying to fill this gap if it can

4802
02:02:26,310 --> 02:02:26,320

 

4803
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:29,109

pass 250 TPTs today. Nice work, order

4806
02:02:33,510 --> 02:02:33,520

 

4807
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:34,870

One of three today, but a good week.

4808
02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:34,880
One of three today, but a good week.
 

4809
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:36,629
One of three today, but a good week.
That's all that matters. Don't judge

4810
02:02:36,629 --> 02:02:36,639
That's all that matters. Don't judge
 

4811
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:38,310
That's all that matters. Don't judge
yourself on one day, right? judge it

4812
02:02:38,310 --> 02:02:38,320
yourself on one day, right? judge it
 

4813
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:40,870
yourself on one day, right? judge it
over like a month and a year

4814
02:02:40,870 --> 02:02:40,880
over like a month and a year
 

4815
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:42,629
over like a month and a year
trend day for longs. Yeah, absolutely.

4816
02:02:42,629 --> 02:02:42,639
trend day for longs. Yeah, absolutely.
 

4817
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:45,910
trend day for longs. Yeah, absolutely.
We we are that we're above IB, right?

4818
02:02:45,910 --> 02:02:45,920
We we are that we're above IB, right?
 

4819
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:47,669
We we are that we're above IB, right?
We're above IB. What else are we above?

4820
02:02:47,669 --> 02:02:47,679
We're above IB. What else are we above?
 

4821
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:49,910
We're above IB. What else are we above?
Previous days value area high. What else

4822
02:02:49,910 --> 02:02:49,920
Previous days value area high. What else
 

4823
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:51,910
Previous days value area high. What else
are we above? Current week's value area

4824
02:02:51,910 --> 02:02:51,920
are we above? Current week's value area
 

4825
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:54,149
are we above? Current week's value area
high, right? We're in expansion mode

4826
02:02:54,149 --> 02:02:54,159
high, right? We're in expansion mode
 

4827
02:02:54,159 --> 02:02:58,950
high, right? We're in expansion mode
right now with a clear target.

4828
02:02:58,950 --> 02:02:58,960

 

4829
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:00,950

This is the target,

4830
02:03:00,950 --> 02:03:00,960
This is the target,
 

4831
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:03,189
This is the target,
right? from starting from the week of

4832
02:03:03,189 --> 02:03:03,199
right? from starting from the week of
 

4833
02:03:03,199 --> 02:03:05,030
right? from starting from the week of
the 12th,

4834
02:03:05,030 --> 02:03:05,040
the 12th,
 

4835
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:07,910
the 12th,
we're trying to get into this node

4836
02:03:07,910 --> 02:03:07,920
we're trying to get into this node
 

4837
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:09,990
we're trying to get into this node
and that's the point of control bang in

4838
02:03:09,990 --> 02:03:10,000
and that's the point of control bang in
 

4839
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,669
and that's the point of control bang in
the middle of it. Right? So, we're

4840
02:03:11,669 --> 02:03:11,679
the middle of it. Right? So, we're
 

4841
02:03:11,679 --> 02:03:15,030
the middle of it. Right? So, we're
expansion over here, over here, trying

4842
02:03:15,030 --> 02:03:15,040
expansion over here, over here, trying
 

4843
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:16,790
expansion over here, over here, trying
to get into here. It's what the market's

4844
02:03:16,790 --> 02:03:16,800
to get into here. It's what the market's
 

4845
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:19,750
to get into here. It's what the market's
trying to do right now.

4846
02:03:19,750 --> 02:03:19,760
trying to do right now.
 

4847
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:21,830
trying to do right now.
Right? We were rotation in here.

4848
02:03:21,830 --> 02:03:21,840
Right? We were rotation in here.
 

4849
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:24,950
Right? We were rotation in here.
Rotation was in here. Now, we're in

4850
02:03:24,950 --> 02:03:24,960
Rotation was in here. Now, we're in
 

4851
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:27,189
Rotation was in here. Now, we're in
expansion after that rotation. If we

4852
02:03:27,189 --> 02:03:27,199
expansion after that rotation. If we
 

4853
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:28,790
expansion after that rotation. If we
came under here today, I know the person

4854
02:03:28,790 --> 02:03:28,800
came under here today, I know the person
 

4855
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,790
came under here today, I know the person
got annoyed. We came under here. Guess

4856
02:03:30,790 --> 02:03:30,800
got annoyed. We came under here. Guess
 

4857
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:32,149
got annoyed. We came under here. Guess
what? But we would have been expansion

4858
02:03:32,149 --> 02:03:32,159
what? But we would have been expansion
 

4859
02:03:32,159 --> 02:03:34,550
what? But we would have been expansion
underneath this rotation. It's how we

4860
02:03:34,550 --> 02:03:34,560
underneath this rotation. It's how we
 

4861
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:37,189
underneath this rotation. It's how we
build liquidity. Like I can't say this

4862
02:03:37,189 --> 02:03:37,199
build liquidity. Like I can't say this
 

4863
02:03:37,199 --> 02:03:38,950
build liquidity. Like I can't say this
enough especially for you newer traders

4864
02:03:38,950 --> 02:03:38,960
enough especially for you newer traders
 

4865
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:40,950
enough especially for you newer traders
or you guys that are getting frustrated

4866
02:03:40,950 --> 02:03:40,960
or you guys that are getting frustrated
 

4867
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:43,189
or you guys that are getting frustrated
like if you don't understand that when

4868
02:03:43,189 --> 02:03:43,199
like if you don't understand that when
 

4869
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:45,830
like if you don't understand that when
you are seeing this being done for

4870
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:45,840
you are seeing this being done for
 

4871
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:47,750
you are seeing this being done for
sessions and sessions on end. When we're

4872
02:03:47,750 --> 02:03:47,760
sessions and sessions on end. When we're
 

4873
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:49,750
sessions and sessions on end. When we're
boxed in, we talked about it pre-market

4874
02:03:49,750 --> 02:03:49,760
boxed in, we talked about it pre-market
 

4875
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:51,990
boxed in, we talked about it pre-market
today and yesterday and the day before.

4876
02:03:51,990 --> 02:03:52,000
today and yesterday and the day before.
 

4877
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,310
today and yesterday and the day before.
When we're boxed in, this is a liquidity

4878
02:03:54,310 --> 02:03:54,320
When we're boxed in, this is a liquidity
 

4879
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:55,990
When we're boxed in, this is a liquidity
build. When we break out, we will

4880
02:03:55,990 --> 02:03:56,000
build. When we break out, we will
 

4881
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,589
build. When we break out, we will
squeeze. When we break down, we will

4882
02:03:57,589 --> 02:03:57,599
squeeze. When we break down, we will
 

4883
02:03:57,599 --> 02:03:59,510
squeeze. When we break down, we will
squeeze. This is a liquidity building

4884
02:03:59,510 --> 02:03:59,520
squeeze. This is a liquidity building
 

4885
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:02,310
squeeze. This is a liquidity building
phase. If we come above here, we are

4886
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:02,320
phase. If we come above here, we are
 

4887
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:03,910
phase. If we come above here, we are
probably truly bullish in the market at

4888
02:04:03,910 --> 02:04:03,920
probably truly bullish in the market at
 

4889
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:13,109
probably truly bullish in the market at
that point.

4890
02:04:13,109 --> 02:04:13,119

 

4891
02:04:13,119 --> 02:04:21,109

Okay.

4892
02:04:21,109 --> 02:04:21,119

 

4893
02:04:21,119 --> 02:04:22,550

Yeah. You're welcome everyone. You're

4894
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:22,560
Yeah. You're welcome everyone. You're
 

4895
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:46,149
Yeah. You're welcome everyone. You're
welcome.

4896
02:04:46,149 --> 02:04:46,159

 

4897
02:04:46,159 --> 02:04:47,990

These chips might start grabbing a bit

4898
02:04:47,990 --> 02:04:48,000
These chips might start grabbing a bit
 

4899
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:54,629
These chips might start grabbing a bit
again.

4900
02:04:54,629 --> 02:04:54,639

 

4901
02:04:54,639 --> 02:04:57,830

Weaker video

4902
02:04:57,830 --> 02:04:57,840
Weaker video
 

4903
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:01,430
Weaker video
weaker INTC

4904
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:01,440

 

4905
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:03,510

IBGO.

4906
02:05:03,510 --> 02:05:03,520
IBGO.
 

4907
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:06,470
IBGO.
What about the broader names?

4908
02:05:06,470 --> 02:05:06,480
What about the broader names?
 

4909
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:27,589
What about the broader names?
O fable corp today.

4910
02:05:27,589 --> 02:05:27,599

 

4911
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:30,470

You're welcome, guys. 1.6,000 long

4912
02:05:30,470 --> 02:05:30,480
You're welcome, guys. 1.6,000 long
 

4913
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:33,350
You're welcome, guys. 1.6,000 long
today. Nice.

4914
02:05:33,350 --> 02:05:33,360
today. Nice.
 

4915
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:35,030
today. Nice.
Is it okay to buy? I wouldn't be buying

4916
02:05:35,030 --> 02:05:35,040
Is it okay to buy? I wouldn't be buying
 

4917
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:38,870
Is it okay to buy? I wouldn't be buying
here. I wouldn't be buying here.

4918
02:05:38,870 --> 02:05:38,880
here. I wouldn't be buying here.
 

4919
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:41,030
here. I wouldn't be buying here.
We were long out from down here, right?

4920
02:05:41,030 --> 02:05:41,040
We were long out from down here, right?
 

4921
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:43,669
We were long out from down here, right?
We've just sold. There's a chance we

4922
02:05:43,669 --> 02:05:43,679
We've just sold. There's a chance we
 

4923
02:05:43,679 --> 02:05:55,830
We've just sold. There's a chance we
move higher, but uh

4924
02:05:55,830 --> 02:05:55,840

 

4925
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:57,750

it's just you're deep into premium now.

4926
02:05:57,750 --> 02:05:57,760
it's just you're deep into premium now.
 

4927
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:01,109
it's just you're deep into premium now.
Unfortunately,

4928
02:06:01,109 --> 02:06:01,119

 

4929
02:06:01,119 --> 02:06:02,709

I think momentum's still up. It would be

4930
02:06:02,709 --> 02:06:02,719
I think momentum's still up. It would be
 

4931
02:06:02,719 --> 02:06:05,350
I think momentum's still up. It would be
nice if it did a second leg down

4932
02:06:05,350 --> 02:06:05,360
nice if it did a second leg down
 

4933
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:06,870
nice if it did a second leg down
and then did this, but it might be that

4934
02:06:06,870 --> 02:06:06,880
and then did this, but it might be that
 

4935
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:08,950
and then did this, but it might be that
it just does this.

4936
02:06:08,950 --> 02:06:08,960
it just does this.
 

4937
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:09,990
it just does this.
But you just got to know if you're

4938
02:06:09,990 --> 02:06:10,000
But you just got to know if you're
 

4939
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,390
But you just got to know if you're
buying high to go high. It's very, very,

4940
02:06:12,390 --> 02:06:12,400
buying high to go high. It's very, very,
 

4941
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:19,830
buying high to go high. It's very, very,
very risky.

4942
02:06:19,830 --> 02:06:19,840

 

4943
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:21,589

No, I'm out of it. I'm out of it. I sold

4944
02:06:21,589 --> 02:06:21,599
No, I'm out of it. I'm out of it. I sold
 

4945
02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:23,510
No, I'm out of it. I'm out of it. I sold
I sold here. I don't want to sit through

4946
02:06:23,510 --> 02:06:23,520
I sold here. I don't want to sit through
 

4947
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:26,070
I sold here. I don't want to sit through
the draw down or give like a 100 points

4948
02:06:26,070 --> 02:06:26,080
the draw down or give like a 100 points
 

4949
02:06:26,080 --> 02:06:28,070
the draw down or give like a 100 points
back if they feel like they need to do a

4950
02:06:28,070 --> 02:06:28,080
back if they feel like they need to do a
 

4951
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:29,990
back if they feel like they need to do a
deeper drive into here. I didn't want to

4952
02:06:29,990 --> 02:06:30,000
deeper drive into here. I didn't want to
 

4953
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,669
deeper drive into here. I didn't want to
give it back. So, it might be that it

4954
02:06:31,669 --> 02:06:31,679
give it back. So, it might be that it
 

4955
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:33,510
give it back. So, it might be that it
continues to come up, but I'm happy with

4956
02:06:33,510 --> 02:06:33,520
continues to come up, but I'm happy with
 

4957
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:35,910
continues to come up, but I'm happy with
what I made. So, I'm just going to take

4958
02:06:35,910 --> 02:06:35,920
what I made. So, I'm just going to take
 

4959
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:39,030
what I made. So, I'm just going to take
that and be okay with it. What time do I

4960
02:06:39,030 --> 02:06:39,040
that and be okay with it. What time do I
 

4961
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:47,510
that and be okay with it. What time do I
go live every day? 9:15 Eastern time.

4962
02:06:47,510 --> 02:06:47,520

 

4963
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:49,350

Would you take a short for the pullback

4964
02:06:49,350 --> 02:06:49,360
Would you take a short for the pullback
 

4965
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:51,030
Would you take a short for the pullback
or is it too much risk? I'm not going to

4966
02:06:51,030 --> 02:06:51,040
or is it too much risk? I'm not going to
 

4967
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:55,109
or is it too much risk? I'm not going to
short counter trend trade it like

4968
02:06:55,109 --> 02:06:55,119
short counter trend trade it like
 

4969
02:06:55,119 --> 02:06:57,270
short counter trend trade it like
it is it possible it wants to do this?

4970
02:06:57,270 --> 02:06:57,280
it is it possible it wants to do this?
 

4971
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:59,750
it is it possible it wants to do this?
It is, but we are above initial balance.

4972
02:06:59,750 --> 02:06:59,760
It is, but we are above initial balance.
 

4973
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:01,589
It is, but we are above initial balance.
We're holding flow zones. We are in a

4974
02:07:01,589 --> 02:07:01,599
We're holding flow zones. We are in a
 

4975
02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:04,149
We're holding flow zones. We are in a
very bullish state right now. Like why

4976
02:07:04,149 --> 02:07:04,159
very bullish state right now. Like why
 

4977
02:07:04,159 --> 02:07:07,109
very bullish state right now. Like why
try and time that perfectly?

4978
02:07:07,109 --> 02:07:07,119
try and time that perfectly?
 

4979
02:07:07,119 --> 02:07:10,149
try and time that perfectly?
It's this is different now, okay, to the

4980
02:07:10,149 --> 02:07:10,159
It's this is different now, okay, to the
 

4981
02:07:10,159 --> 02:07:13,109
It's this is different now, okay, to the
last few days. Why is it different?

4982
02:07:13,109 --> 02:07:13,119
last few days. Why is it different?
 

4983
02:07:13,119 --> 02:07:15,189
last few days. Why is it different?
The last few days we had people to lean

4984
02:07:15,189 --> 02:07:15,199
The last few days we had people to lean
 

4985
02:07:15,199 --> 02:07:21,510
The last few days we had people to lean
on, right? So

4986
02:07:21,510 --> 02:07:21,520

 

4987
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:26,790

come here.

4988
02:07:26,790 --> 02:07:26,800

 

4989
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:30,629

We had lots of volume to lean on.

4990
02:07:30,629 --> 02:07:30,639
We had lots of volume to lean on.
 

4991
02:07:30,639 --> 02:07:32,709
We had lots of volume to lean on.
And Thursday,

4992
02:07:32,709 --> 02:07:32,719
And Thursday,
 

4993
02:07:32,719 --> 02:07:34,550
And Thursday,
we hadn't taken out the highs. We were

4994
02:07:34,550 --> 02:07:34,560
we hadn't taken out the highs. We were
 

4995
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:36,310
we hadn't taken out the highs. We were
protecting the highs and we had volume

4996
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:36,320
protecting the highs and we had volume
 

4997
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:39,109
protecting the highs and we had volume
to lean on on a straight squeeze up.

4998
02:07:39,109 --> 02:07:39,119
to lean on on a straight squeeze up.
 

4999
02:07:39,119 --> 02:07:42,229
to lean on on a straight squeeze up.
Right? This was a straight squeeze up.

5000
02:07:42,229 --> 02:07:42,239
Right? This was a straight squeeze up.
 

5001
02:07:42,239 --> 02:07:45,510
Right? This was a straight squeeze up.
And here, oh, the same thing.

5002
02:07:45,510 --> 02:07:45,520
And here, oh, the same thing.
 

5003
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:47,430
And here, oh, the same thing.
Straight squeeze up. You can see we

5004
02:07:47,430 --> 02:07:47,440
Straight squeeze up. You can see we
 

5005
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:48,870
Straight squeeze up. You can see we
where we played these longs earlier in

5006
02:07:48,870 --> 02:07:48,880
where we played these longs earlier in
 

5007
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:50,870
where we played these longs earlier in
the week. Straight squeeze up. And then

5008
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:50,880
the week. Straight squeeze up. And then
 

5009
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:53,669
the week. Straight squeeze up. And then
we faded this

5010
02:07:53,669 --> 02:07:53,679
we faded this
 

5011
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:57,669
we faded this
right into key level. Lent on it. This

5012
02:07:57,669 --> 02:07:57,679
right into key level. Lent on it. This
 

5013
02:07:57,679 --> 02:08:02,629
right into key level. Lent on it. This
is different. Now we're above value.

5014
02:08:02,629 --> 02:08:02,639

 

5015
02:08:02,639 --> 02:08:09,030

We're running stops.

5016
02:08:09,030 --> 02:08:09,040

 

5017
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:10,550

Doesn't mean it can't come lower, but

5018
02:08:10,550 --> 02:08:10,560
Doesn't mean it can't come lower, but
 

5019
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:14,870
Doesn't mean it can't come lower, but
it's my bias for deeper prices is is not

5020
02:08:14,870 --> 02:08:14,880
it's my bias for deeper prices is is not
 

5021
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:20,790
it's my bias for deeper prices is is not
really there today. now.

5022
02:08:20,790 --> 02:08:20,800

 

5023
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:22,709

No, I don't trade fixed size. You can't

5024
02:08:22,709 --> 02:08:22,719
No, I don't trade fixed size. You can't
 

5025
02:08:22,719 --> 02:08:24,709
No, I don't trade fixed size. You can't
trade like I don't understand like you

5026
02:08:24,709 --> 02:08:24,719
trade like I don't understand like you
 

5027
02:08:24,719 --> 02:08:26,069
trade like I don't understand like you
can trade fixed size if you're a

5028
02:08:26,069 --> 02:08:26,079
can trade fixed size if you're a
 

5029
02:08:26,079 --> 02:08:27,189
can trade fixed size if you're a
beginner and you're trading like very

5030
02:08:27,189 --> 02:08:27,199
beginner and you're trading like very
 

5031
02:08:27,199 --> 02:08:29,990
beginner and you're trading like very
small lots. You can't trade fixed size

5032
02:08:29,990 --> 02:08:30,000
small lots. You can't trade fixed size
 

5033
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,390
small lots. You can't trade fixed size
when you have to risk based on ATR and

5034
02:08:32,390 --> 02:08:32,400
when you have to risk based on ATR and
 

5035
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:35,910
when you have to risk based on ATR and
swing points. [snorts]

5036
02:08:35,910 --> 02:08:35,920
swing points. [snorts]
 

5037
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:37,270
swing points. [snorts]
Can I explain previous week point of

5038
02:08:37,270 --> 02:08:37,280
Can I explain previous week point of
 

5039
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:39,109
Can I explain previous week point of
control? Yeah, it's just the value of

5040
02:08:39,109 --> 02:08:39,119
control? Yeah, it's just the value of
 

5041
02:08:39,119 --> 02:08:40,629
control? Yeah, it's just the value of
the previous week and it's the level

5042
02:08:40,629 --> 02:08:40,639
the previous week and it's the level
 

5043
02:08:40,639 --> 02:08:42,390
the previous week and it's the level
which was traded the most and it's never

5044
02:08:42,390 --> 02:08:42,400
which was traded the most and it's never
 

5045
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:50,390
which was traded the most and it's never
been touched.

5046
02:08:50,390 --> 02:08:50,400

 

5047
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:52,069

And I take a look at QQQ. It's going to

5048
02:08:52,069 --> 02:08:52,079
And I take a look at QQQ. It's going to
 

5049
02:08:52,079 --> 02:09:02,709
And I take a look at QQQ. It's going to
be exactly the same as this pretty much.

5050
02:09:02,709 --> 02:09:02,719

 

5051
02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:06,069

25s is the gamma level. If we get over

5052
02:09:06,069 --> 02:09:06,079
25s is the gamma level. If we get over
 

5053
02:09:06,079 --> 02:09:07,750
25s is the gamma level. If we get over
25s,

5054
02:09:07,750 --> 02:09:07,760
25s,
 

5055
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:10,069
25s,
then 27s is where probably where we're

5056
02:09:10,069 --> 02:09:10,079
then 27s is where probably where we're
 

5057
02:09:10,079 --> 02:09:12,950
then 27s is where probably where we're
going to try and come. Um, you are if

5058
02:09:12,950 --> 02:09:12,960
going to try and come. Um, you are if
 

5059
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:15,030
going to try and come. Um, you are if
you're short at 22, is that what you're

5060
02:09:15,030 --> 02:09:15,040
you're short at 22, is that what you're
 

5061
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:16,709
you're short at 22, is that what you're
saying? You're short of this breakout.

5062
02:09:16,709 --> 02:09:16,719
saying? You're short of this breakout.
 

5063
02:09:16,719 --> 02:09:17,910
saying? You're short of this breakout.
This is the prop. This is what I'm

5064
02:09:17,910 --> 02:09:17,920
This is the prop. This is what I'm
 

5065
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:20,229
This is the prop. This is what I'm
saying. This is exactly why I'm saying

5066
02:09:20,229 --> 02:09:20,239
saying. This is exactly why I'm saying
 

5067
02:09:20,239 --> 02:09:22,149
saying. This is exactly why I'm saying
why I said that the short here today

5068
02:09:22,149 --> 02:09:22,159
why I said that the short here today
 

5069
02:09:22,159 --> 02:09:26,629
why I said that the short here today
wouldn't work. One, two, three, four,

5070
02:09:26,629 --> 02:09:26,639
wouldn't work. One, two, three, four,
 

5071
02:09:26,639 --> 02:09:28,229
wouldn't work. One, two, three, four,
five. Probably go back. There's probably

5072
02:09:28,229 --> 02:09:28,239
five. Probably go back. There's probably
 

5073
02:09:28,239 --> 02:09:30,790
five. Probably go back. There's probably
more.

5074
02:09:30,790 --> 02:09:30,800
more.
 

5075
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:33,669
more.
Yep.

5076
02:09:33,669 --> 02:09:33,679
Yep.
 

5077
02:09:33,679 --> 02:09:37,030
Yep.
Six, 7, eight. Lots of stops there,

5078
02:09:37,030 --> 02:09:37,040
Six, 7, eight. Lots of stops there,
 

5079
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:38,470
Six, 7, eight. Lots of stops there,
right? Which is why we didn't want to be

5080
02:09:38,470 --> 02:09:38,480
right? Which is why we didn't want to be
 

5081
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:40,310
right? Which is why we didn't want to be
short there today. You can't. If we

5082
02:09:40,310 --> 02:09:40,320
short there today. You can't. If we
 

5083
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:42,069
short there today. You can't. If we
imagine that this is cell pressure and

5084
02:09:42,069 --> 02:09:42,079
imagine that this is cell pressure and
 

5085
02:09:42,079 --> 02:09:44,470
imagine that this is cell pressure and
this is a brick wall,

5086
02:09:44,470 --> 02:09:44,480
this is a brick wall,
 

5087
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:46,629
this is a brick wall,
right? How many times if I keep banging

5088
02:09:46,629 --> 02:09:46,639
right? How many times if I keep banging
 

5089
02:09:46,639 --> 02:09:49,830
right? How many times if I keep banging
into that brick wall, eventually the

5090
02:09:49,830 --> 02:09:49,840
into that brick wall, eventually the
 

5091
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:51,350
into that brick wall, eventually the
brick wall is going to break, which is

5092
02:09:51,350 --> 02:09:51,360
brick wall is going to break, which is
 

5093
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:59,589
brick wall is going to break, which is
what happened today.

5094
02:09:59,589 --> 02:09:59,599

 

5095
02:09:59,599 --> 02:10:01,270

I'd say you'd look in trouble on those

5096
02:10:01,270 --> 02:10:01,280
I'd say you'd look in trouble on those
 

5097
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:06,950
I'd say you'd look in trouble on those
puts.

5098
02:10:06,950 --> 02:10:06,960

 

5099
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:16,550

Yeah, I consider ATR.

5100
02:10:16,550 --> 02:10:16,560

 

5101
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:19,510

Alex, what data broker? I I pay for it

5102
02:10:19,510 --> 02:10:19,520
Alex, what data broker? I I pay for it
 

5103
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:21,510
Alex, what data broker? I I pay for it
all, Rob. I pay for it all from bookmap.

5104
02:10:21,510 --> 02:10:21,520
all, Rob. I pay for it all from bookmap.
 

5105
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:24,470
all, Rob. I pay for it all from bookmap.
Uh what's it called? Maybe I can find it

5106
02:10:24,470 --> 02:10:24,480
Uh what's it called? Maybe I can find it
 

5107
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:34,470
Uh what's it called? Maybe I can find it
in here.

5108
02:10:34,470 --> 02:10:34,480

 

5109
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:39,030

How can I find my global plus yearly

So, most of you probably already in this

5118
02:10:55,189 --> 02:10:55,199
So, most of you probably already in this

5125
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:12,229

Yeah, the problem. So, the the problem

5126
02:11:12,229 --> 02:11:12,239
Yeah, the problem. So, the the problem
 

5127

5131
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:21,189
problem is yes, you're right,
but how many times are we going to come

5132
02:11:21,189 --> 02:11:21,199
but how many times are we going to come
 

5133
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:23,109
but how many times are we going to come
back up here? You're right in what

5134
02:11:23,109 --> 02:11:23,119
back up here? You're right in what
 

5135
02:11:23,119 --> 02:11:28,550
back up here? You're right in what
you're saying,

5136
02:11:28,550 --> 02:11:28,560

 

5137
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:31,350

but it's like a four week range.

5138
02:11:31,350 --> 02:11:31,360
but it's like a four week range.
 

5139
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:32,790
but it's like a four week range.
Okay. Okay, so let's think about it. We

5140
02:11:32,790 --> 02:11:32,800
Okay. Okay, so let's think about it. We
 

5141
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:36,470
Okay. Okay, so let's think about it. We
left it here, traded back inside,

5142
02:11:36,470 --> 02:11:36,480
left it here, traded back inside,
 

5143
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:39,910
left it here, traded back inside,
created balance, poked above, failed,

5144
02:11:39,910 --> 02:11:39,920
created balance, poked above, failed,
 

5145
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:44,069
created balance, poked above, failed,
flushed, coming back into it. We We have

5146
02:11:44,069 --> 02:11:44,079
flushed, coming back into it. We We have
 

5147
02:11:44,079 --> 02:11:45,589
flushed, coming back into it. We We have
They haven't defended the bottom side of

5148
02:11:45,589 --> 02:11:45,599
They haven't defended the bottom side of
 

5149
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:47,830
They haven't defended the bottom side of
this range. They tried early week. We're

5150
02:11:47,830 --> 02:11:47,840
this range. They tried early week. We're
 

5151
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:51,030
this range. They tried early week. We're
through it. We're coming up to P. If we

5152
02:11:51,030 --> 02:11:51,040
through it. We're coming up to P. If we
 

5153
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:54,229
through it. We're coming up to P. If we
hold above PC next week, then it means

5154
02:11:54,229 --> 02:11:54,239
hold above PC next week, then it means
 

5155
02:11:54,239 --> 02:11:56,629
hold above PC next week, then it means
there are no buyers uh who are no longer

5156
02:11:56,629 --> 02:11:56,639
there are no buyers uh who are no longer
 

5157
02:11:56,639 --> 02:11:58,390
there are no buyers uh who are no longer
stuck. They probably already stopped out

5158
02:11:58,390 --> 02:11:58,400
stuck. They probably already stopped out
 

5159
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:00,709
stuck. They probably already stopped out
or they reaccumulated and everyone tried

5160
02:12:00,709 --> 02:12:00,719
or they reaccumulated and everyone tried
 

5161
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:03,270
or they reaccumulated and everyone tried
to sell against them. So if we go

5162
02:12:03,270 --> 02:12:03,280
to sell against them. So if we go
 

5163
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:07,030
to sell against them. So if we go
sideways here for a bit,

5164
02:12:07,030 --> 02:12:07,040
sideways here for a bit,
 

5165
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:08,870
sideways here for a bit,
then we have the room to run these

5166
02:12:08,870 --> 02:12:08,880
then we have the room to run these
 

5167
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:10,390
then we have the room to run these
stops.

5168
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:10,400
stops.
 

5169
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:12,390
stops.
All right?

5170
02:12:12,390 --> 02:12:12,400
All right?
 

5171
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:13,910
All right?
Doesn't have to do it, but we have to be

5172
02:12:13,910 --> 02:12:13,920
Doesn't have to do it, but we have to be
 

5173
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:15,750
Doesn't have to do it, but we have to be
willing to understand that that is now

5174
02:12:15,750 --> 02:12:15,760
willing to understand that that is now
 

5175
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:18,310

5297
02:17:01,359 --> 02:17:03,349
Uh, if you want to look at gamma levels,
look at stuff like unusual whales and

look at stuff like unusual whales and
 

5299
02:17:03,359 --> 02:17:04,469
look at stuff like unusual whales and
stuff like that. They've probably got

5300

stuff like that. They've probably got
 

5301
02:17:04,479 --> 02:17:09,190

All right, if you've traded before, it's
 

5359

All right, if you've traded before, it's

5369
02:19:03,519 --> 02:19:05,270

I'm not looking for a short today. I'm

5370
02:19:05,270 --> 02:19:05,280
I'm not looking for a short today. I'm
 

5371
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:06,469
I'm not looking for a short today. I'm
not looking for a short today. People

5372
02:19:06,469 --> 02:19:06,479
not looking for a short today. People
 

5373
02:19:06,479 --> 02:19:07,990
not looking for a short today. People
keep asking. I'm not looking for a short

5374
02:19:07,990 --> 02:19:08,000
keep asking. I'm not looking for a short
 

5375
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,830
keep asking. I'm not looking for a short
today. We've got a clear target above

5376
02:19:09,830 --> 02:19:09,840
today. We've got a clear target above
 

5377
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:11,750
today. We've got a clear target above
that it wants to go to. It's possible

5378
02:19:11,750 --> 02:19:11,760
that it wants to go to. It's possible
 

5379
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:13,509
that it wants to go to. It's possible
that it leaves this. There is like

5380
02:19:13,509 --> 02:19:13,519
that it leaves this. There is like
 

5381
02:19:13,519 --> 02:19:15,110
that it leaves this. There is like
there's a counter trend short down to

5382
02:19:15,110 --> 02:19:15,120
there's a counter trend short down to
 

5383
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:18,070
there's a counter trend short down to
here, right? But I would be of the

5384
02:19:18,070 --> 02:19:18,080
here, right? But I would be of the
 

5385
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:19,910
here, right? But I would be of the
assumption we probably do this later in

5386
02:19:19,910 --> 02:19:19,920
assumption we probably do this later in
 

5387
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:22,389
assumption we probably do this later in
the day. So, you just got to know if

5388
02:19:22,389 --> 02:19:22,399
the day. So, you just got to know if
 

5389
02:19:22,399 --> 02:19:23,589
the day. So, you just got to know if
you're going to play this counter trend

5390
02:19:23,589 --> 02:19:23,599
you're going to play this counter trend
 

5391
02:19:23,599 --> 02:19:26,230
you're going to play this counter trend
short, you've got like 50 points max,

5392
02:19:26,230 --> 02:19:26,240
short, you've got like 50 points max,
 

5393
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:28,389
short, you've got like 50 points max,
right? As we leave this volume here,

5394
02:19:28,389 --> 02:19:28,399
right? As we leave this volume here,
 

5395
02:19:28,399 --> 02:19:30,309
right? As we leave this volume here,
max. They can stop short. All right,

5396
02:19:30,309 --> 02:19:30,319
max. They can stop short. All right,
 

5397
02:19:30,319 --> 02:19:33,349
max. They can stop short. All right,
they have a node here. I'd expect buyers

5398
02:19:33,349 --> 02:19:33,359
they have a node here. I'd expect buyers
 

5399
02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:35,509
they have a node here. I'd expect buyers
to step in somewhere around here and try

5400
02:19:35,509 --> 02:19:35,519
to step in somewhere around here and try
 

5401
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:38,870
to step in somewhere around here and try
and absor absorb and go again. So maybe

5402
02:19:38,870 --> 02:19:38,880
and absor absorb and go again. So maybe
 

5403
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:40,629
and absor absorb and go again. So maybe
you're in it here for this move down to

5404
02:19:40,629 --> 02:19:40,639
you're in it here for this move down to
 

5405
02:19:40,639 --> 02:19:42,309
you're in it here for this move down to
here. But you better be paying yourself.

5406
02:19:42,309 --> 02:19:42,319
here. But you better be paying yourself.
 

5407
02:19:42,319 --> 02:19:44,950
here. But you better be paying yourself.
You cannot assume that today collapses

5408
02:19:44,950 --> 02:19:44,960
You cannot assume that today collapses
 

5409
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:46,870
You cannot assume that today collapses
like the other days. It's very possible

5410
02:19:46,870 --> 02:19:46,880
like the other days. It's very possible
 

5411
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:51,030
like the other days. It's very possible
that they hold anywhere in here.

5412
02:19:51,030 --> 02:19:51,040
that they hold anywhere in here.
 

5413
02:19:51,040 --> 02:19:52,630
that they hold anywhere in here.
This is your second leg when we talk

5414
02:19:52,630 --> 02:19:52,640
This is your second leg when we talk
 

5415
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:55,910
This is your second leg when we talk
about the two legs. One,

5416
02:19:55,910 --> 02:19:55,920
about the two legs. One,
 

5417
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:58,230
about the two legs. One,
two. What I want to see down here is

5418
02:19:58,230 --> 02:19:58,240
two. What I want to see down here is
 

5419
02:19:58,240 --> 02:20:04,950
two. What I want to see down here is
someone get trapped. And then this.

5420
02:20:04,950 --> 02:20:04,960

 

5421
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:06,309

Okay. Give you guys a couple more

5422
02:20:06,309 --> 02:20:06,319
Okay. Give you guys a couple more
 

5423
02:20:06,319 --> 02:20:11,670
Okay. Give you guys a couple more
seconds.

5424
02:20:11,670 --> 02:20:11,680

 

5425
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:13,030

Hopefully, even me like telling you

5426
02:20:13,030 --> 02:20:13,040

5433
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:20,710

what I'm looking for. This is where I

5436
02:20:22,790 --> 02:20:22,800
what I'm looking for. This is where I
 

5437
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:25,030
what I'm looking for. This is where I
think price can go. I don't think it can

5438
02:20:25,030 --> 02:20:25,040
think price can go. I don't think it can
 

5439
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:26,469
think price can go. I don't think it can
necessarily go further than that. So,

5440
02:20:26,469 --> 02:20:26,479
necessarily go further than that. So,
 

5441
02:20:26,479 --> 02:20:27,990
necessarily go further than that. So,
I'm going to take profit into that

5442
02:20:27,990 --> 02:20:28,000
I'm going to take profit into that
 

5443
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:46,870
I'm going to take profit into that
level.

Stephen. You're here.
Yeah, should work for you. Sorry, mate.

5584
02:24:20,230 --> 02:24:20,240
Yeah, should work for you. Sorry, mate.
 

5585

Yeah, should work for you. Sorry, mate.
Only just see that now.

5586
02:24:23,270 --> 02:24:23,280
Only just see that now.
 

5587
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:25,830
Only just see that now.
should be all good. Okay, into this gray

5588
02:24:25,830 --> 02:24:25,840
should be all good. Okay, into this gray
 

5589
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:27,910
should be all good. Okay, into this gray
box. They refaded. Buyers couldn't

5590
02:24:27,910 --> 02:24:27,920
box. They refaded. Buyers couldn't
 

5591
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:29,670
box. They refaded. Buyers couldn't
reclaim this level. So, there's no

5592
02:24:29,670 --> 02:24:29,680
reclaim this level. So, there's no
 

5593
02:24:29,680 --> 02:24:31,349
reclaim this level. So, there's no
squeeze points. They tried to bid here.

5594
02:24:31,349 --> 02:24:31,359
squeeze points. They tried to bid here.
 

5595
02:24:31,359 --> 02:24:33,750
squeeze points. They tried to bid here.
They failed to reclaim. We drift down.

5596
02:24:33,750 --> 02:24:33,760
They failed to reclaim. We drift down.
 

5597
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:36,230
They failed to reclaim. We drift down.
This is the key point now. And if they

5598
02:24:36,230 --> 02:24:36,240
This is the key point now. And if they
 

5599
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:38,630
This is the key point now. And if they
really let this go,

5600
02:24:38,630 --> 02:24:38,640
really let this go,
 

5601
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:40,790
really let this go,
I'd find it somewhat surprising, but I

5602
02:24:40,790 --> 02:24:40,800
I'd find it somewhat surprising, but I
 

5603
02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:42,230
I'd find it somewhat surprising, but I
mean there is an argument to come back

5604
02:24:42,230 --> 02:24:42,240
mean there is an argument to come back
 

5605
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:44,150
mean there is an argument to come back
down to previous day value high, but I'd

5606
02:24:44,150 --> 02:24:44,160
down to previous day value high, but I'd
 

5607
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:45,510
down to previous day value high, but I'd
expect them to try and defend in front

5608
02:24:45,510 --> 02:24:45,520
expect them to try and defend in front
 

5609
02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:48,550
expect them to try and defend in front
of that.

5610
02:24:48,550 --> 02:24:48,560
of that.
 

5611
02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:50,309
of that.
But you're on a Friday coming into

5614
02:24:52,710 --> 02:24:52,720
lunch. So, this is why I'm kind of like
 

5615
02:24:52,720 --> 02:24:55,590
lunch. So, this is why I'm kind of like
happy to just chill at this point.

5616
02:24:55,590 --> 02:24:55,600
happy to just chill at this point.

5679
02:26:40,720 --> 02:26:42,710

If I buy the indicator and later the

5680
02:26:42,710 --> 02:26:42,720
If I buy the indicator and later the
 

5681
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:44,630
If I buy the indicator and later the
course is their discount on the course

5682
02:26:44,630 --> 02:26:44,640
course is their discount on the course
 

5683
02:26:44,640 --> 02:26:46,870
course is their discount on the course
as it's indicator included. The

5684
02:26:46,870 --> 02:26:46,880
as it's indicator included. The
 

5685
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:48,550
as it's indicator included. The
indicator that comes in the course is

5686
02:26:48,550 --> 02:26:48,560
indicator that comes in the course is
 

5687
02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:50,070
indicator that comes in the course is
just like a simplified version of the

5688
02:26:50,070 --> 02:26:50,080
just like a simplified version of the
 

5689
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:52,630
just like a simplified version of the
flow zones. The pro that you're seeing

5690
02:26:52,630 --> 02:26:52,640
flow zones. The pro that you're seeing
 

5691
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:56,870
flow zones. The pro that you're seeing
on here with like uh GlobeEx and

5692
02:26:56,870 --> 02:26:56,880
on here with like uh GlobeEx and
 

5693
02:26:56,880 --> 02:27:00,950
on here with like uh GlobeEx and
Orb and uh some other key things is an

5694
02:27:00,950 --> 02:27:00,960
Orb and uh some other key things is an
 

5695
02:27:00,960 --> 02:27:02,790
Orb and uh some other key things is an
upgrade but you don't have to get it.

5696
02:27:02,790 --> 02:27:02,800
upgrade but you don't have to get it.
 

5697
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:04,070
upgrade but you don't have to get it.
There is a version that you can trade

5698
02:27:04,070 --> 02:27:04,080
There is a version that you can trade
 

5699
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:05,910
There is a version that you can trade
off that comes free with the course. So

5700
02:27:05,910 --> 02:27:05,920
off that comes free with the course. So
 

5701
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:09,030
off that comes free with the course. So
you can see they've just dipped this IB.

5702
02:27:09,030 --> 02:27:09,040
you can see they've just dipped this IB.
 

5703
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:10,630
you can see they've just dipped this IB.
It's interesting to play long here. I'm

going to be honest. Very interesting to
 

5707
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:15,030
going to be honest. Very interesting to
play long here. Watching how they act

5708
02:27:15,030 --> 02:27:15,040
play long here. Watching how they act
 

5709
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:18,550
play long here. Watching how they act
into 800

5710
02:27:18,550 --> 02:27:18,560

 

5711
02:27:18,560 --> 02:27:20,870

to just scalp a bit up into this

5712
02:27:20,870 --> 02:27:20,880
to just scalp a bit up into this
 

5713
02:27:20,880 --> 02:27:24,469
to just scalp a bit up into this
imbalance.

5714
02:27:24,469 --> 02:27:24,479

 

5715
02:27:24,479 --> 02:27:26,070

That's why I saying this area here I

5716
02:27:26,070 --> 02:27:26,080
That's why I saying this area here I
 

5717
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:28,550
That's why I saying this area here I
expect them to react into. Going to try

5718
02:27:28,550 --> 02:27:28,560
expect them to react into. Going to try
 

5719
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:30,469
expect them to react into. Going to try
and stop myself trading. It's very I'm

5720
02:27:30,469 --> 02:27:30,479
and stop myself trading. It's very I'm
 

5721
02:27:30,479 --> 02:27:32,790
and stop myself trading. It's very I'm
very interested in rebidding this

5722
02:27:32,790 --> 02:27:32,800
very interested in rebidding this
 

5723
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:33,990
very interested in rebidding this
because I think we've got unfinished

5724
02:27:33,990 --> 02:27:34,000
because I think we've got unfinished
 

5725
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:35,429
because I think we've got unfinished
business. But it's probably better that

5726
02:27:35,429 --> 02:27:35,439
business. But it's probably better that
 

5727
02:27:35,439 --> 02:27:50,710
business. But it's probably better that
I just behave myself here.

5728
02:27:50,710 --> 02:27:50,720

 

5729
02:27:50,720 --> 02:27:52,150

Does it work on Trading View? What's

5730
02:27:52,150 --> 02:27:52,160
Does it work on Trading View? What's
 

5731
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:53,510
Does it work on Trading View? What's
that, Chris? Sorry, I'm not sure what

5732
02:27:53,510 --> 02:27:53,520

5733
02:27:53,520 --> 02:27:55,990
that, Chris? Sorry, I'm not sure what
you're talking about. Does what work on

5734
02:27:55,990 --> 02:27:56,000
you're talking about. Does what work on
 

5735
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:57,910
you're talking about. Does what work on
Trading View?

5736
02:27:57,910 --> 02:27:57,920
Trading View?
 

5737
02:27:57,920 --> 02:27:59,990
Trading View?
So, I would still say this node up here.

5738
02:27:59,990 --> 02:28:00,000
So, I would still say this node up here.
 

5739
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:01,349
So, I would still say this node up here.
Buyers buyers are going to try and

5740
02:28:01,349 --> 02:28:01,359
Buyers buyers are going to try and
 

5741
02:28:01,359 --> 02:28:03,429
Buyers buyers are going to try and
defend this and come up into here now,

5742
02:28:03,429 --> 02:28:03,439
defend this and come up into here now,
 

5743
02:28:03,439 --> 02:28:04,790
defend this and come up into here now,
right? Which is what we're seeing off

5744
02:28:04,790 --> 02:28:04,800
right? Which is what we're seeing off
 

5745
02:28:04,800 --> 02:28:07,429
right? Which is what we're seeing off
the IB off this level. Remember this is

5746
02:28:07,429 --> 02:28:07,439
the IB off this level. Remember this is
 

5747
02:28:07,439 --> 02:28:09,110
the IB off this level. Remember this is
where the stops were that we broke out

5748
02:28:09,110 --> 02:28:09,120
where the stops were that we broke out
 

5749
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:12,150
where the stops were that we broke out
from on from last Friday. This is from

5750
02:28:12,150 --> 02:28:12,160
from on from last Friday. This is from
 

5751
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:14,070
from on from last Friday. This is from
last week Friday top of the gray box

5752
02:28:14,070 --> 02:28:14,080
last week Friday top of the gray box
 

5753
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:16,630
last week Friday top of the gray box
breakout pull back. This level here

5754
02:28:16,630 --> 02:28:16,640
breakout pull back. This level here
 

5755
02:28:16,640 --> 02:28:18,950
breakout pull back. This level here
becomes key. If they get through this

5756
02:28:18,950 --> 02:28:18,960
becomes key. If they get through this
 

5757
02:28:18,960 --> 02:28:20,630
becomes key. If they get through this
then we are still going for up here. All

5758
02:28:20,630 --> 02:28:20,640
then we are still going for up here. All
 

5759
02:28:20,640 --> 02:28:21,830
then we are still going for up here. All
right. This is what I was saying to you

5760
02:28:21,830 --> 02:28:21,840
right. This is what I was saying to you
 

5761
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:24,550
right. This is what I was saying to you
the whole time.

5762
02:28:24,550 --> 02:28:24,560
the whole time.
 

5763
02:28:24,560 --> 02:28:25,830
the whole time.
Hopefully this is going to start making

5764
02:28:25,830 --> 02:28:25,840
Hopefully this is going to start making
 

5765
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:28,070
Hopefully this is going to start making
sense. If sellers defend this all right

5766
02:28:28,070 --> 02:28:28,080
sense. If sellers defend this all right
 

5767
02:28:28,080 --> 02:28:29,590
sense. If sellers defend this all right
and they get under here then there's an

5768
02:28:29,590 --> 02:28:29,600
and they get under here then there's an
 

5769
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:31,349
and they get under here then there's an
argument for lower but not until then.

5770
02:28:31,349 --> 02:28:31,359
argument for lower but not until then.
 

5771
02:28:31,359 --> 02:28:34,309
argument for lower but not until then.
This is a pullback. That will be a

5772
02:28:34,309 --> 02:28:34,319
This is a pullback. That will be a
 

5773
02:28:34,319 --> 02:28:35,990
This is a pullback. That will be a
squeeze.

5774
02:28:35,990 --> 02:28:36,000
squeeze.
 

5775
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,950
squeeze.
This will be a resell.

5776
02:28:38,950 --> 02:28:38,960
This will be a resell.
 

5777
02:28:38,960 --> 02:28:41,670
This will be a resell.
Two options. Personally, I'd be more

5778
02:28:41,670 --> 02:28:41,680
Two options. Personally, I'd be more
 

5779
02:28:41,680 --> 02:28:43,190
Two options. Personally, I'd be more
bullish in this market right now with

5780
02:28:43,190 --> 02:28:43,200
bullish in this market right now with
 

5781
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:46,550
bullish in this market right now with
how we're operating. Here we go. So, I

5782
02:28:46,550 --> 02:28:46,560
how we're operating. Here we go. So, I
 

5783
02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:48,150
how we're operating. Here we go. So, I
was very tempted to take this squeeze up

5784
02:28:48,150 --> 02:28:48,160
was very tempted to take this squeeze up
 

5785
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:49,910
was very tempted to take this squeeze up
to this level. There you go. So, into

5786
02:28:49,910 --> 02:28:49,920
to this level. There you go. So, into
 

5787
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:52,150
to this level. There you go. So, into
into this level. If you find acceptance

5788
02:28:52,150 --> 02:28:52,160
into this level. If you find acceptance
 

5789
02:28:52,160 --> 02:28:53,750
into this level. If you find acceptance
over here now and then go sideways for a

5790
02:28:53,750 --> 02:28:53,760
over here now and then go sideways for a
 

5791
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:54,950
over here now and then go sideways for a
bit, you're probably going to get that

5792
02:28:54,950 --> 02:28:54,960
bit, you're probably going to get that
 

5793
02:28:54,960 --> 02:28:59,533
bit, you're probably going to get that
naked point control.

5794
02:28:59,533 --> 02:28:59,543

 

5795
02:28:59,543 --> 02:29:02,469

[laughter]

5796
02:29:02,469 --> 02:29:02,479

 

5797
02:29:02,479 --> 02:29:04,230

I know it's doing exactly as I said. I

5798
02:29:04,230 --> 02:29:04,240
I know it's doing exactly as I said. I
 

5799
02:29:04,240 --> 02:29:05,990
I know it's doing exactly as I said. I
know it is. I know it is. That's not

5800
02:29:05,990 --> 02:29:06,000
know it is. I know it is. That's not
 

5801
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,630
know it is. I know it is. That's not
because I'm magic. It's because it

5802
02:29:08,630 --> 02:29:08,640
because I'm magic. It's because it
 

5803
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:11,030
because I'm magic. It's because it
respects levels. When NQ's doing the

5804
02:29:11,030 --> 02:29:11,040
respects levels. When NQ's doing the
 

5805
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:12,309
respects levels. When NQ's doing the
right thing, there was a moment this

5806
02:29:12,309 --> 02:29:12,319
right thing, there was a moment this
 

5807
02:29:12,319 --> 02:29:13,349
right thing, there was a moment this
week when it really pissed me off

5808
02:29:13,349 --> 02:29:13,359
week when it really pissed me off
 

5809
02:29:13,359 --> 02:29:14,630
week when it really pissed me off
because it wasn't respecting stuff. But

5810
02:29:14,630 --> 02:29:14,640
because it wasn't respecting stuff. But
 

5811
02:29:14,640 --> 02:29:16,870
because it wasn't respecting stuff. But
it respects levels, right? There's a

5812
02:29:16,870 --> 02:29:16,880
it respects levels, right? There's a
 

5813
02:29:16,880 --> 02:29:18,469
it respects levels, right? There's a
reason there's a purple line on my

5814
02:29:18,469 --> 02:29:18,479
reason there's a purple line on my
 

5815
02:29:18,479 --> 02:29:23,270
reason there's a purple line on my
chart, right? It's the initial balance.

5816
02:29:23,270 --> 02:29:23,280
chart, right? It's the initial balance.
 

5817
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:24,950
chart, right? It's the initial balance.
There's a reason for the top of the gray

5818
02:29:24,950 --> 02:29:24,960
There's a reason for the top of the gray
 

5819
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:27,830
There's a reason for the top of the gray
box. All right? It's because it's where

5820
02:29:27,830 --> 02:29:27,840
box. All right? It's because it's where
 

5821
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:30,150
box. All right? It's because it's where
we popped the stops from last Friday.

5822
02:29:30,150 --> 02:29:30,160
we popped the stops from last Friday.
 

5823
02:29:30,160 --> 02:29:33,030
we popped the stops from last Friday.
Right. Right here. All right. There's a

5824
02:29:33,030 --> 02:29:33,040
Right. Right here. All right. There's a
 

5825
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:34,469
Right. Right here. All right. There's a
reason for it. So, there's a reason for

5826
02:29:34,469 --> 02:29:34,479
reason for it. So, there's a reason for
 

5827
02:29:34,479 --> 02:29:35,990
reason for it. So, there's a reason for
this to be a pull back into it, isn't

5828
02:29:35,990 --> 02:29:36,000
this to be a pull back into it, isn't
 

5829
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:37,830
this to be a pull back into it, isn't
it? And now there's a reason for it to

5830
02:29:37,830 --> 02:29:37,840
it? And now there's a reason for it to
 

5831
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:39,270
it? And now there's a reason for it to
get back into this level. And if it

5832
02:29:39,270 --> 02:29:39,280
get back into this level. And if it
 

5833
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:42,150
get back into this level. And if it
squeezes over here, think about

5834
02:29:42,150 --> 02:29:42,160
squeezes over here, think about
 

5835
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:44,150
squeezes over here, think about
guess who would have come flying in.

5836
02:29:44,150 --> 02:29:44,160
guess who would have come flying in.
 

5837
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:47,110
guess who would have come flying in.
Yes, there they are underneath the IB.

5838
02:29:47,110 --> 02:29:47,120
Yes, there they are underneath the IB.
 

5839
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:49,510
Yes, there they are underneath the IB.
These silly, silly people. All right.

5840
02:29:49,510 --> 02:29:49,520
These silly, silly people. All right.
 

5841
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:51,510
These silly, silly people. All right.
So, you had big selling here, here,

5842
02:29:51,510 --> 02:29:51,520
So, you had big selling here, here,
 

5843
02:29:51,520 --> 02:29:53,670
So, you had big selling here, here,
here, here. All right. And if we hold

5844
02:29:53,670 --> 02:29:53,680
here, here. All right. And if we hold
 

5845
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:55,750
here, here. All right. And if we hold
now bids above that and certainly above

5846
02:29:55,750 --> 02:29:55,760
now bids above that and certainly above
 

5847
02:29:55,760 --> 02:29:58,389
now bids above that and certainly above
this, anywhere above this, this can now

5848
02:29:58,389 --> 02:29:58,399
this, anywhere above this, this can now
 

5849
02:29:58,399 --> 02:30:00,550
this, anywhere above this, this can now
continue higher. That's why I said I

5850
02:30:00,550 --> 02:30:00,560
continue higher. That's why I said I
 

5851
02:30:00,560 --> 02:30:01,990
continue higher. That's why I said I
wouldn't be selling it today unless it's

5852
02:30:01,990 --> 02:30:02,000
wouldn't be selling it today unless it's
 

5853
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:03,750
wouldn't be selling it today unless it's
just like for a scalp down to this level

5854
02:30:03,750 --> 02:30:03,760
just like for a scalp down to this level
 

5855
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:05,910
just like for a scalp down to this level
as a maximum point point that we could

5856
02:30:05,910 --> 02:30:05,920
as a maximum point point that we could
 

5857
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:08,389
as a maximum point point that we could
go down to. [snorts]

5858
02:30:08,389 --> 02:30:08,399
go down to. [snorts]
 

5859
02:30:08,399 --> 02:30:10,230
go down to. [snorts]
Hopefully it makes sense to you, right?

5860
02:30:10,230 --> 02:30:10,240
Hopefully it makes sense to you, right?
 

5861
02:30:10,240 --> 02:30:12,230
Hopefully it makes sense to you, right?
Hopefully what I'm trying to teach you

Hopefully what I'm trying to teach you
 

5863
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:13,830
Hopefully what I'm trying to teach you
for free is making sense. Hopefully it's

5864
02:30:13,830 --> 02:30:13,840
for free is making sense. Hopefully it's
 

5865
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:15,429
for free is making sense. Hopefully it's
going in that brain of yours and next

02:30:15,429 --> 02:30:15,439
going in that brain of yours and next
 

5867
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:17,750
going in that brain of yours and next
time you'll be like, "Okay,

we are bullish. Why am I trying to

we are bullish. Why am I trying to

short?
 

5873
02:30:21,359 --> 02:30:22,950
short?
Can I share my volume profile

5874
02:30:22,950 --> 02:30:22,960
Can I share my volume profile
 

5875
02:30:22,960 --> 02:30:26,150
Can I share my volume profile
parameters?" Yeah, it's just two ticks

5876
02:30:26,150 --> 02:30:26,160
parameters?" Yeah, it's just two ticks
 

5877
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:28,710
parameters?" Yeah, it's just two ticks
right here. I have it on ticks per row.

5878
02:30:28,710 --> 02:30:28,720
right here. I have it on ticks per row.
 

5879
02:30:28,720 --> 02:30:29,910
right here. I have it on ticks per row.
You can have a number of rows. If you do

5880
02:30:29,910 --> 02:30:29,920
You can have a number of rows. If you do
 

5881
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:31,270
You can have a number of rows. If you do
number of rows, have it on a th00and and

5882
02:30:31,270 --> 02:30:31,280
number of rows, have it on a th00and and
 

5883
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:33,190
number of rows, have it on a th00and and
two ticks. That's all I change. That's

5884
02:30:33,190 --> 02:30:33,200
two ticks. That's all I change. That's
 

5885
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:41,429
two ticks. That's all I change. That's
all I change. [snorts]

Nice, Stephen. Nice work, mate. Nice

Yeah, I was very tempted to take it, but

5892
02:30:47,270 --> 02:30:47,280
Yeah, I was very tempted to take it, but
 

5893
02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:48,469
Yeah, I was very tempted to take it, but
I'm just like telling myself it's

5894
02:30:48,469 --> 02:30:48,479
I'm just like telling myself it's
 

5895
02:30:48,479 --> 02:30:51,030
I'm just like telling myself it's
Friday. I'm pretty tired. It's been a

5896
02:30:51,030 --> 02:30:51,040
Friday. I'm pretty tired. It's been a
 

5897
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:53,830
Friday. I'm pretty tired. It's been a
really nice week. We've locked in four

5898
02:30:53,830 --> 02:30:53,840
really nice week. We've locked in four
 

5899
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:55,910
really nice week. We've locked in four
figures. Going to pay myself another

5900
02:30:55,910 --> 02:30:55,920
figures. Going to pay myself another
 

5901
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:57,510
figures. Going to pay myself another
four figures today. It's pretty much

5902
02:30:57,510 --> 02:30:57,520
four figures today. It's pretty much
 

5903
02:30:57,520 --> 02:31:04,469
four figures today. It's pretty much
every day this week on TPT and um yeah,

5904
02:31:04,469 --> 02:31:04,479
every day this week on TPT and um yeah,
 

5905
02:31:04,479 --> 02:31:06,309
every day this week on TPT and um yeah,
little resistance. Yeah, for sure. For

5906
02:31:06,309 --> 02:31:06,319
little resistance. Yeah, for sure. For
 

5907
02:31:06,319 --> 02:31:07,670
little resistance. Yeah, for sure. For
sure there is a little resistance here,

5908
02:31:07,670 --> 02:31:07,680
sure there is a little resistance here,
 

5909
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:09,910
sure there is a little resistance here,
right? You can see this node, but my

5910
02:31:09,910 --> 02:31:09,920
right? You can see this node, but my
 

5911
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:11,349
right? You can see this node, but my
anticipation would be that we're

5912
02:31:11,349 --> 02:31:11,359
anticipation would be that we're
 

5913
02:31:11,359 --> 02:31:13,190
anticipation would be that we're
probably going to get through it. We

5914
02:31:13,190 --> 02:31:13,200
probably going to get through it. We
 

5915
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:14,870
probably going to get through it. We
might have to go sideways for a bit. It

5916
02:31:14,870 --> 02:31:14,880
might have to go sideways for a bit. It
 

5917
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:17,750
might have to go sideways for a bit. It
might be that we do like this,

5918
02:31:17,750 --> 02:31:17,760
might be that we do like this,
 

5919
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:19,670
might be that we do like this,
but my anticipation is we will probably

5920
02:31:19,670 --> 02:31:19,680
but my anticipation is we will probably
 

5921
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:22,309
but my anticipation is we will probably
come up here today, right? So all all

5922
02:31:22,309 --> 02:31:22,319
come up here today, right? So all all
 

5923
02:31:22,319 --> 02:31:31,495
come up here today, right? So all all
day long once we start breaking out.

5924
02:31:31,495 --> 02:31:31,505

 

5925
02:31:31,505 --> 02:31:39,270

[snorts]

5926
02:31:39,270 --> 02:31:39,280

 

5927
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:40,870

What are you seeing from last Friday?

5928
02:31:40,870 --> 02:31:40,880
What are you seeing from last Friday?
 

5929
02:31:40,880 --> 02:31:43,270
What are you seeing from last Friday?
Exactly. It It's just a high wick of a

5930
02:31:43,270 --> 02:31:43,280
Exactly. It It's just a high wick of a
 

5931
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:46,469
Exactly. It It's just a high wick of a
candle. If you go back to last Friday

5932
02:31:46,469 --> 02:31:46,479
candle. If you go back to last Friday
 

5933
02:31:46,479 --> 02:31:49,349
candle. If you go back to last Friday
and you look at 10:00 a.m. All right.

5934
02:31:49,349 --> 02:31:49,359
and you look at 10:00 a.m. All right.
 

5935
02:31:49,359 --> 02:31:50,790
and you look at 10:00 a.m. All right.
That's where we started shorting last

5936
02:31:50,790 --> 02:31:50,800
That's where we started shorting last
 

5937
02:31:50,800 --> 02:31:52,870
That's where we started shorting last
Friday. So, think about anyone who was

5938
02:31:52,870 --> 02:31:52,880
Friday. So, think about anyone who was
 

5939
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:54,630
Friday. So, think about anyone who was
short last Friday. Where would their

5940
02:31:54,630 --> 02:31:54,640
short last Friday. Where would their
 

5941
02:31:54,640 --> 02:31:56,150
short last Friday. Where would their
stop have been? It would have been

5942
02:31:56,150 --> 02:31:56,160
stop have been? It would have been
 

5943
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:57,750
stop have been? It would have been
there, right? So, we had a group of

5944
02:31:57,750 --> 02:31:57,760
there, right? So, we had a group of
 

5945
02:31:57,760 --> 02:32:00,550
there, right? So, we had a group of
stops at 40s, 740s, and then we had a

5946
02:32:00,550 --> 02:32:00,560
stops at 40s, 740s, and then we had a
 

5947
02:32:00,560 --> 02:32:02,710
stops at 40s, 740s, and then we had a
group of stops basically at that sort of

5948
02:32:02,710 --> 02:32:02,720
group of stops basically at that sort of
 

5949
02:32:02,720 --> 02:32:05,670
group of stops basically at that sort of
65 level. Okay? Once we get through that

5950
02:32:05,670 --> 02:32:05,680
65 level. Okay? Once we get through that
 

5951
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:07,830
65 level. Okay? Once we get through that
group of stops, we're assuming pullbacks

5952
02:32:07,830 --> 02:32:07,840
group of stops, we're assuming pullbacks
 

5953
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:09,590
group of stops, we're assuming pullbacks
hold into that because anyone who is a

5954
02:32:09,590 --> 02:32:09,600
hold into that because anyone who is a
 

5955
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:11,750
hold into that because anyone who is a
seller there then becomes a buyer,

5956
02:32:11,750 --> 02:32:11,760
seller there then becomes a buyer,
 

5957
02:32:11,760 --> 02:32:13,510
seller there then becomes a buyer,
right? So, they become a buyer again

5958
02:32:13,510 --> 02:32:13,520
right? So, they become a buyer again
 

5959
02:32:13,520 --> 02:32:15,750
right? So, they become a buyer again
here. And the anticipation is that we'd

5960
02:32:15,750 --> 02:32:15,760
here. And the anticipation is that we'd
 

5961
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:17,510
here. And the anticipation is that we'd
probably come up into this naked point

5962
02:32:17,510 --> 02:32:17,520
probably come up into this naked point
 

5963
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:28,790
probably come up into this naked point
control.

5964
02:32:28,790 --> 02:32:28,800

 

5965
02:32:28,800 --> 02:32:30,230

Thank you. Followed exactly what you

5966
02:32:30,230 --> 02:32:30,240
Thank you. Followed exactly what you
 

5967
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:31,910
Thank you. Followed exactly what you
said for the pullback and reversal for

5968
02:32:31,910 --> 02:32:31,920
said for the pullback and reversal for
 

5969
02:32:31,920 --> 02:32:34,630
said for the pullback and reversal for
$1,000. There you go.

5970
02:32:34,630 --> 02:32:34,640
$1,000. There you go.
 

5971
02:32:34,640 --> 02:32:37,110
$1,000. There you go.
Need four figures daily living in LA. I

5972
02:32:37,110 --> 02:32:37,120
Need four figures daily living in LA. I
 

5973

Oh my god, I nuked two funded accounts

5976
02:32:46,710 --> 02:32:46,720
Oh my god, I nuked two funded accounts
 

5977
02:32:46,720 --> 02:32:48,790
Oh my god, I nuked two funded accounts
by a tick or two and it immediately came

5978
02:32:48,790 --> 02:32:48,800
by a tick or two and it immediately came
 

5979
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:50,870
by a tick or two and it immediately came
all the way back. Sounds like you were

5980
02:32:50,870 --> 02:32:50,880
all the way back. Sounds like you were
 

5981
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:52,550
all the way back. Sounds like you were
maybe overleveraged a bit there, my

5982
02:32:52,550 --> 02:32:52,560
maybe overleveraged a bit there, my
 

5983
02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:54,389
maybe overleveraged a bit there, my
friend.

5984

5985
02:32:54,399 --> 02:32:55,830

5996
02:33:13,030 --> 02:33:13,040

 

5997
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:15,030

How do I mark my previous point control?

5998
02:33:15,030 --> 02:33:15,040
How do I mark my previous point control?
 

5999
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:18,070
How do I mark my previous point control?
I I just measure out that whole week.

6000
02:33:18,070 --> 02:33:18,080
I I just measure out that whole week.
 

6001
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:23,670
I I just measure out that whole week.
That's all I do.

6002
02:33:23,670 --> 02:33:23,680

 

6003
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:26,870

Define naked by non- naked. Uh a naked

6004
02:33:26,870 --> 02:33:26,880
Define naked by non- naked. Uh a naked
 

6005
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:28,630
Define naked by non- naked. Uh a naked
point of control is just an untested

6006
02:33:28,630 --> 02:33:28,640
point of control is just an untested
 

6007
02:33:28,640 --> 02:33:29,670
point of control is just an untested
level. Or if you were doing like

6008
02:33:29,670 --> 02:33:29,680
level. Or if you were doing like
 

6009
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:31,349
level. Or if you were doing like
Malaysian SNR, you'd call it a fresh

6010
02:33:31,349 --> 02:33:31,359
Malaysian SNR, you'd call it a fresh
 

6011
02:33:31,359 --> 02:33:33,910
Malaysian SNR, you'd call it a fresh
level. This is a fresh level, right?

6012
02:33:33,910 --> 02:33:33,920
level. This is a fresh level, right?
 

6013
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:36,630
level. This is a fresh level, right?
Because this is from last week. Since

6014
02:33:36,630 --> 02:33:36,640
Because this is from last week. Since
 

6015
02:33:36,640 --> 02:33:38,950
Because this is from last week. Since
last week in this week, have we ever

6016
02:33:38,950 --> 02:33:38,960
last week in this week, have we ever
 

6017
02:33:38,960 --> 02:33:40,790
last week in this week, have we ever
tested it?

6018
02:33:40,790 --> 02:33:40,800
tested it?
 

6019
02:33:40,800 --> 02:33:42,870
tested it?
No. Right? We gapped down. We never

6020
02:33:42,870 --> 02:33:42,880
No. Right? We gapped down. We never
 

6021
02:33:42,880 --> 02:33:44,950
No. Right? We gapped down. We never
tested it. Right? So, if this is fair

6022
02:33:44,950 --> 02:33:44,960
tested it. Right? So, if this is fair
 

6023
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:46,630
tested it. Right? So, if this is fair
value from last week, we're trying to

6024
02:33:46,630 --> 02:33:46,640
value from last week, we're trying to
 

6025
02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:50,150
value from last week, we're trying to
test is this fair value. All right?

6026
02:33:50,150 --> 02:33:50,160
test is this fair value. All right?
 

6027
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:51,750
test is this fair value. All right?
We're trying to get back up to last

6028
02:33:51,750 --> 02:33:51,760
We're trying to get back up to last
 

6029
02:33:51,760 --> 02:34:06,070
We're trying to get back up to last
week's fair value.

I'll have a look at everything when I

How do we know those sellers haven't

6040
02:34:13,510 --> 02:34:13,520
How do we know those sellers haven't
 

6041
02:34:13,520 --> 02:34:14,950
How do we know those sellers haven't
taken profit and left the market

6042
02:34:14,950 --> 02:34:14,960
taken profit and left the market
 

6043
02:34:14,960 --> 02:34:17,190
taken profit and left the market
already? Whi which sellers? The one from

6044
02:34:17,190 --> 02:34:17,200
already? Whi which sellers? The one from
 

6045
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:18,790
already? Whi which sellers? The one from
last Friday. I mean, you don't. They

6046
02:34:18,790 --> 02:34:18,800

6064
02:34:41,270 --> 02:34:41,280

 

6065
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:43,590

Malaysian SNR. I'm Malaysian. Then then

6066
02:34:43,590 --> 02:34:43,600
Malaysian SNR. I'm Malaysian. Then then
 

6067
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:46,309
Malaysian SNR. I'm Malaysian. Then then
you know Malaysian SNR or I assume you

because if you're from there it's very

6072
02:34:53,030 --> 02:34:53,040
because if you're from there it's very
 

6073
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:55,510
because if you're from there it's very
it's very popular. Okay. So this is what

it's very popular. Okay. So this is what
 

6075
02:34:55,520 --> 02:34:58,469
it's very popular. Okay. So this is what
we just talked about this pullback.

6076
02:34:58,469 --> 02:34:58,479
we just talked about this pullback.
 

6077
02:34:58,479 --> 02:35:00,790
we just talked about this pullback.
Do they hold this little imbalance and

6078
02:35:00,790 --> 02:35:00,800
Do they hold this little imbalance and
 

6079
02:35:00,800 --> 02:35:03,910
Do they hold this little imbalance and
leave these guys here stuck? All right.

6080
02:35:03,910 --> 02:35:03,920
leave these guys here stuck? All right.
 

6081
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:05,670
leave these guys here stuck? All right.
If they leave these guys stuck and they

6082
02:35:05,670 --> 02:35:05,680
If they leave these guys stuck and they
 

6083
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:14,389
If they leave these guys stuck and they
hold this and they reclaim then upside

6084
02:35:14,389 --> 02:35:14,399

 

6085
02:35:14,399 --> 02:35:16,630

this gray box so far offering some

6086
02:35:16,630 --> 02:35:16,640
this gray box so far offering some
 

6087
02:35:16,640 --> 02:35:18,309
this gray box so far offering some
resistance but I would still anticipate

6088
02:35:18,309 --> 02:35:18,319
resistance but I would still anticipate
 

6089
02:35:18,319 --> 02:35:20,710
resistance but I would still anticipate
we will go through it. It might take a

6090
02:35:20,710 --> 02:35:20,720
we will go through it. It might take a
 

6091
02:35:20,720 --> 02:35:26,150
we will go through it. It might take a
while but I would anticipate that.

6092
02:35:26,150 --> 02:35:26,160

 

6093
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:27,830

I don't have it measured out on ES.

6094
02:35:27,830 --> 02:35:27,840
I don't have it measured out on ES.
 

6095
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:30,389
I don't have it measured out on ES.
Sorry mate. I'm not going to go through

6096
02:35:30,389 --> 02:35:30,399
Sorry mate. I'm not going to go through
 

6097
02:35:30,399 --> 02:35:35,190
Sorry mate. I'm not going to go through
all my charts and do it now.

6098
02:35:35,190 --> 02:35:35,200

 

6099
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:36,550

How do we know they were higher time

6100
02:35:36,550 --> 02:35:36,560
How do we know they were higher time
 

6101
02:35:36,560 --> 02:35:38,389
How do we know they were higher time
frame traders? Well, you you don't know.

6102
02:35:38,389 --> 02:35:38,399
frame traders? Well, you you don't know.
 

6103
02:35:38,399 --> 02:35:39,590
frame traders? Well, you you don't know.
You just need to make the assumption

6104
02:35:39,590 --> 02:35:39,600
You just need to make the assumption
 

6105
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:41,190
You just need to make the assumption
that institutional traders are not

6106
02:35:41,190 --> 02:35:41,200
that institutional traders are not
 

6107
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:43,429
that institutional traders are not
trading for a tick,

6108
02:35:43,429 --> 02:35:43,439
trading for a tick,
 

6109
02:35:43,439 --> 02:35:45,910
trading for a tick,
right? And pivots will always be pivots.

6110
02:35:45,910 --> 02:35:45,920
right? And pivots will always be pivots.
 

6111
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:59,030
right? And pivots will always be pivots.
That's why the market moves.

6112
02:35:59,030 --> 02:35:59,040

 

6113
02:35:59,040 --> 02:36:00,469

So, more absorption leaving these

6114
02:36:00,469 --> 02:36:00,479
So, more absorption leaving these
 

6115
02:36:00,479 --> 02:36:03,270
So, more absorption leaving these
sellers down here stuck. And again, the

6116
02:36:03,270 --> 02:36:03,280
sellers down here stuck. And again, the
 

6117
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:07,429
sellers down here stuck. And again, the
longer it's here,

6118
02:36:07,429 --> 02:36:07,439

 

6119
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:08,870

the more this becomes possible because

6120
02:36:08,870 --> 02:36:08,880
the more this becomes possible because
 

6121
02:36:08,880 --> 02:36:11,429
the more this becomes possible because

talked about. So, if you did take this
 

6207
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:42,469
talked about. So, if you did take this
long or you rebid this long, right, you

6208
02:40:42,469 --> 02:40:42,479
long or you rebid this long, right, you
 

6209
02:40:42,479 --> 02:40:44,309
long or you rebid this long, right, you
can trim some into this high and then

6210
02:40:44,309 --> 02:40:44,319
can trim some into this high and then
 

6211
02:40:44,319 --> 02:40:46,710
can trim some into this high and then
try and get all the way up into here,

6212
02:40:46,710 --> 02:40:46,720
try and get all the way up into here,
 

6213
02:40:46,720 --> 02:40:49,030
try and get all the way up into here,
right? So, this could be 100 points. If

6214
02:40:49,030 --> 02:40:49,040
right? So, this could be 100 points. If
 

6215
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:51,110
right? So, this could be 100 points. If
you took it from here or here, you

6216
02:40:51,110 --> 02:40:51,120
you took it from here or here, you
 

6217
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:52,790
you took it from here or here, you
should almost get 100 points up into

6218
02:40:52,790 --> 02:40:52,800
should almost get 100 points up into
 

6219
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:55,590
should almost get 100 points up into
this final target.

6220
02:40:55,590 --> 02:40:55,600
this final target.
 

6221
02:40:55,600 --> 02:40:56,550
this final target.
This is what we've been talking about

6222
02:40:56,550 --> 02:40:56,560
This is what we've been talking about
 

6223
02:40:56,560 --> 02:41:00,230
This is what we've been talking about
all day long.

6224
02:41:00,230 --> 02:41:00,240

 

6225
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:02,630

Do I ever trade the afternoon blocks? Uh

6226
02:41:02,630 --> 02:41:02,640
Do I ever trade the afternoon blocks? Uh
 

6227
02:41:02,640 --> 02:41:03,910
Do I ever trade the afternoon blocks? Uh
sometimes if there's a really good

6228
02:41:03,910 --> 02:41:03,920
sometimes if there's a really good
 

6229
02:41:03,920 --> 02:41:05,750
sometimes if there's a really good
setup, if I feel like the morning's been

6230
02:41:05,750 --> 02:41:05,760
setup, if I feel like the morning's been
 

6231
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:07,830
setup, if I feel like the morning's been
selling up for an afternoon, so like if

6232
02:41:07,830 --> 02:41:07,840
selling up for an afternoon, so like if
 

6233
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:09,830
selling up for an afternoon, so like if
we've gone sideways all morning long

6234
02:41:09,830 --> 02:41:09,840
we've gone sideways all morning long
 

6235
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:11,830
we've gone sideways all morning long
without expansion, I'll consider the

6236
02:41:11,830 --> 02:41:11,840
without expansion, I'll consider the
 

6237
02:41:11,840 --> 02:41:13,510
without expansion, I'll consider the
afternoon is when I'm more likely to

6238
02:41:13,510 --> 02:41:13,520
afternoon is when I'm more likely to
 

6239
02:41:13,520 --> 02:41:23,270
afternoon is when I'm more likely to
trade the afternoon aggressively.

6240
02:41:23,270 --> 02:41:23,280

 

6241
02:41:23,280 --> 02:41:26,950

What about YM? I I don't watch YM.

6242

the two leg to set the trap into here to
 

6267
02:41:58,479 --> 02:42:00,630
the two leg to set the trap into here to
build the liquidity to use these stops

6268
02:42:00,630 --> 02:42:00,640
build the liquidity to use these stops
 

6269
02:42:00,640 --> 02:42:02,389
build the liquidity to use these stops
to get up into here. We literally talked

6270
02:42:02,389 --> 02:42:02,399
to get up into here. We literally talked
 

6271
02:42:02,399 --> 02:42:03,590
to get up into here. We literally talked
about it even when we're here. I was

6272
02:42:03,590 --> 02:42:03,600
about it even when we're here. I was
 

6273
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:05,349
about it even when we're here. I was
telling you we probably needed two if

6274
02:42:05,349 --> 02:42:05,359
telling you we probably needed two if
 

6275
02:42:05,359 --> 02:42:08,710
telling you we probably needed two if
you rewind the stream to around 11:00

6276

you rewind the stream to around 11:00
 

6277
02:42:08,720 --> 02:42:10,950
you rewind the stream to around 11:00
a.m. You would before any of this

6278
02:42:10,950 --> 02:42:10,960
a.m. You would before any of this
 

6279
02:42:10,960 --> 02:42:12,550
a.m. You would before any of this
happened would have seen me talk about

6280
02:42:12,550 --> 02:42:12,560
happened would have seen me talk about
 

6281
02:42:12,560 --> 02:42:17,510
happened would have seen me talk about
this exact setup.

6282
02:42:17,510 --> 02:42:17,520

 

6283
02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:19,270

Right? I talked about this exact setup

6284
02:42:19,270 --> 02:42:19,280
Right? I talked about this exact setup
 

6285
02:42:19,280 --> 02:42:21,190
Right? I talked about this exact setup
because this is how we get shorts

6286
02:42:21,190 --> 02:42:21,200
because this is how we get shorts
 

6287
02:42:21,200 --> 02:42:23,190
because this is how we get shorts
induced into the market so that we can

02:42:23,190 --> 02:42:23,200
induced into the market so that we can
 

6289
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:25,590
induced into the market so that we can
come up here. It's exactly how they do

6290
02:42:25,590 --> 02:42:25,600
come up here. It's exactly how they do
 

6291
02:42:25,600 --> 02:42:34,230
come up here. It's exactly how they do
it.

6292
02:42:34,230 --> 02:42:34,240

 

6293
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:36,870

But worth going back like an hour so you

6294

But worth going back like an hour so you
 

6295
02:42:36,880 --> 02:42:40,550
But worth going back like an hour so you
can see why why I said this is likely to

02:42:40,550 --> 02:42:40,560
can see why why I said this is likely to
 

6297
02:42:40,560 --> 02:42:42,230
can see why why I said this is likely to
happen. Why? Because it's a giant

02:46:21,030 --> 02:46:21,040
they managed to get the breakout and
 

6367
02:46:21,040 --> 02:46:22,630
they managed to get the breakout and
force all those passive sellers to

6368
02:46:22,630 --> 02:46:22,640
force all those passive sellers to
 

6369
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:30,150
force all those passive sellers to
become buyers. So, but I do look at it.

6370
02:46:30,150 --> 02:46:30,160

 

6371
02:46:30,160 --> 02:46:31,910

It's funny some some of you asking funny

6372
02:46:31,910 --> 02:46:31,920
It's funny some some of you asking funny
 

6373
02:46:31,920 --> 02:46:34,550
It's funny some some of you asking funny
questions like, do I use the dom?

6374
02:46:34,550 --> 02:46:34,560
questions like, do I use the dom?
 

6375
02:46:34,560 --> 02:46:38,950
questions like, do I use the dom?
What's above me?

6376
02:46:38,950 --> 02:46:38,960

 

6377
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:44,710

definitely use a DOM.

6378
02:46:44,710 --> 02:46:44,720

 

6379
02:46:44,720 --> 02:46:47,269

Would I consider buyers on GLL at all

6380
02:46:47,269 --> 02:46:47,279
Would I consider buyers on GLL at all
 

6381
02:46:47,279 --> 02:46:49,190
Would I consider buyers on GLL at all
following the massive squeeze on metals?

6382
02:46:49,190 --> 02:46:49,200
following the massive squeeze on metals?
 

6383
02:46:49,200 --> 02:46:59,269
following the massive squeeze on metals?
Do you mean a a swing position?

6384
02:46:59,269 --> 02:46:59,279

 

6385
02:46:59,279 --> 02:47:11,830

It's almost that target.

6386
02:47:11,830 --> 02:47:11,840

 

6387
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:14,790

It's almost there. It's got room.

6388
02:47:14,790 --> 02:47:14,800
It's almost there. It's got room.
 

6389
02:47:14,800 --> 02:47:16,469
It's almost there. It's got room.
It can It can afford a pull back and a

6390
02:47:16,469 --> 02:47:16,479
It can It can afford a pull back and a
 

6391
02:47:16,479 --> 02:47:18,469
It can It can afford a pull back and a
reload, but it's got room. Silver

6392
02:47:18,469 --> 02:47:18,479
reload, but it's got room. Silver
 

6393
02:47:18,479 --> 02:47:21,590
reload, but it's got room. Silver
probably going to go to uh the 100 or

6394
02:47:21,590 --> 02:47:21,600
probably going to go to uh the 100 or
 

6395
02:47:21,600 --> 02:47:28,230
probably going to go to uh the 100 or
it's already done it. Amazing.

6396
02:47:28,230 --> 02:47:28,240

 

6397
02:47:28,240 --> 02:47:30,389

I mean, this is a wild breakout from

6398
02:47:30,389 --> 02:47:30,399
I mean, this is a wild breakout from
 

6399
02:47:30,399 --> 02:47:36,950
I mean, this is a wild breakout from
base.

6400
02:47:36,950 --> 02:47:36,960

 

6401
02:47:36,960 --> 02:47:39,670

How many sigas? Hang on. Let me have a

6402
02:47:39,670 --> 02:47:39,680
How many sigas? Hang on. Let me have a
 

6403
02:47:39,680 --> 02:48:06,150
How many sigas? Hang on. Let me have a
look at this on

6404
02:48:06,150 --> 02:48:06,160

 

6405
02:48:06,160 --> 02:48:08,309

[\h__\h] me.

[\h__\h] me.
Yeah, it's running out of room. I mean,

6408
02:48:09,830 --> 02:48:09,840
Yeah, it's running out of room. I mean,
 

6409
02:48:09,840 --> 02:48:11,510
Yeah, it's running out of room. I mean,
it's hugging five. This is like a really

6410
02:48:11,510 --> 02:48:11,520
it's hugging five. This is like a really
 

6411
02:48:11,520 --> 02:48:14,630
it's hugging five. This is like a really
healthy trend

6412
02:48:14,630 --> 02:48:14,640
healthy trend
 

6413
02:48:14,640 --> 02:48:17,510
healthy trend

5day top bowl. I mean, it's going to be
 

6421
02:48:25,200 --> 02:48:27,510
5day top bowl. I mean, it's going to be
due a pullback. You might see like a

6422
02:48:27,510 --> 02:48:27,520
due a pullback. You might see like a
 

6423
02:48:27,520 --> 02:48:34,950
due a pullback. You might see like a
blowoff top coming soon.

6424
02:48:34,950 --> 02:48:34,960

 

6425
02:48:34,960 --> 02:48:37,670

But it's running out of room.

6426
02:48:37,670 --> 02:48:37,680
But it's running out of room.
 

6427
02:48:37,680 --> 02:48:39,670
But it's running out of room.
Definitely running out of room. Probably

6428
02:48:39,670 --> 02:48:39,680
Definitely running out of room. Probably
 

6429
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:41,590
Definitely running out of room. Probably
gold might have. Yeah, gold's way

6430
02:48:41,590 --> 02:48:41,600
gold might have. Yeah, gold's way
 

6431
02:48:41,600 --> 02:48:43,429
gold might have. Yeah, gold's way
extended through the [snorts] top

6432
02:48:43,429 --> 02:48:43,439
extended through the [snorts] top

Ballinger on a daily. We move to weekly.

6434
02:48:45,510 --> 02:48:45,520
Ballinger on a daily. We move to weekly.
 

6435
02:48:45,520 --> 02:48:47,269
Ballinger on a daily. We move to weekly.
Has it got room? Through it on a weekly.

6436
02:48:47,269 --> 02:48:47,279
Has it got room? Through it on a weekly.
 

6437
02:48:47,279 --> 02:48:51,670
Has it got room? Through it on a weekly.
Let's check the weekly on silver.

6438
02:48:51,670 --> 02:48:51,680

 

6439
02:48:51,680 --> 02:48:53,349

Yeah, well over it. Yeah, these are

6440
02:48:53,349 --> 02:48:53,359
Yeah, well over it. Yeah, these are
 

6441
02:48:53,359 --> 02:48:54,870
Yeah, well over it. Yeah, these are
extended.

6442
02:48:54,870 --> 02:48:54,880
extended.
 

6443
02:48:54,880 --> 02:48:57,830
extended.
I wouldn't be buying these. No way. But

6444
02:48:57,830 --> 02:48:57,840
I wouldn't be buying these. No way. But
 

6445
02:48:57,840 --> 02:48:58,870
I wouldn't be buying these. No way. But
you would need you'd need to see

6446
02:48:58,870 --> 02:48:58,880
you would need you'd need to see
 

6447
02:48:58,880 --> 02:49:02,070
you would need you'd need to see
backside before you fade it,

6448
02:49:02,070 --> 02:49:02,080
backside before you fade it,
 

6449
02:49:02,080 --> 02:49:03,349
backside before you fade it,
right? So what you what would you need

6450
02:49:03,349 --> 02:49:03,359
right? So what you what would you need
 

6451
02:49:03,359 --> 02:49:05,110
right? So what you what would you need
on silver? You'd need a reason to be

6452
02:49:05,110 --> 02:49:05,120
on silver? You'd need a reason to be
 

6453
02:49:05,120 --> 02:49:07,990
on silver? You'd need a reason to be
able to fade it. You'd need volume trap.

6454
02:49:07,990 --> 02:49:08,000
able to fade it. You'd need volume trap.
 

6455
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:09,190
able to fade it. You'd need volume trap.
Same [snorts] as we always talk about.

6456
02:49:09,190 --> 02:49:09,200
Same [snorts] as we always talk about.
 

6457
02:49:09,200 --> 02:49:11,590
Same [snorts] as we always talk about.
So probably it's more likely like the

6458
02:49:11,590 --> 02:49:11,600
So probably it's more likely like the
 

6459
02:49:11,600 --> 02:49:13,030
So probably it's more likely like the
first start is more likely to be under

6460
02:49:13,030 --> 02:49:13,040
first start is more likely to be under
 

6461
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:15,590
first start is more likely to be under
here, right? So if you see a rejection

6462
02:49:15,590 --> 02:49:15,600
here, right? So if you see a rejection
 

6463
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:18,870
here, right? So if you see a rejection
of like 98s, we come under 98 and you

6464
02:49:18,870 --> 02:49:18,880
of like 98s, we come under 98 and you
 

6465
02:49:18,880 --> 02:49:20,870
of like 98s, we come under 98 and you
see a rejection of 98s, then there's a

6466
02:49:20,870 --> 02:49:20,880
see a rejection of 98s, then there's a
 

6467
02:49:20,880 --> 02:49:22,950
see a rejection of 98s, then there's a
trade back down into this cluster. If

6468
02:49:22,950 --> 02:49:22,960
trade back down into this cluster. If
 

6469
02:49:22,960 --> 02:49:25,349
trade back down into this cluster. If
you start to see it then let go of 90s

6470
02:49:25,349 --> 02:49:25,359
you start to see it then let go of 90s
 

6471
02:49:25,359 --> 02:49:27,110
you start to see it then let go of 90s
then we can start attacking lower

6472
02:49:27,110 --> 02:49:27,120
then we can start attacking lower
 

6473
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:29,510
then we can start attacking lower
prices. You got a huge amount of volume.

6474
02:49:29,510 --> 02:49:29,520
prices. You got a huge amount of volume.
 

6475
02:49:29,520 --> 02:49:33,030
prices. You got a huge amount of volume.
The real energy comes into market sub 85

6476
02:49:33,030 --> 02:49:33,040
The real energy comes into market sub 85
 

6477
02:49:33,040 --> 02:49:34,950
The real energy comes into market sub 85
86 right because you got this

6478
02:49:34,950 --> 02:49:34,960
86 right because you got this
 

6479
02:49:34,960 --> 02:49:37,590
86 right because you got this
consolidation here right? So, there's

6480
02:49:37,590 --> 02:49:37,600
consolidation here right? So, there's
 

6481
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:39,750
consolidation here right? So, there's
probably a snapshot down into here to

6482
02:49:39,750 --> 02:49:39,760
probably a snapshot down into here to
 

6483
02:49:39,760 --> 02:49:41,910
probably a snapshot down into here to
the top of it. And then under that will

6484
02:49:41,910 --> 02:49:41,920
the top of it. And then under that will
 

6485
02:49:41,920 --> 02:49:54,630
the top of it. And then under that will
be more weakness.

6486
02:49:54,630 --> 02:49:54,640

 

6487
02:49:54,640 --> 02:49:56,950

All right, folks. I think I'm done. We

6488
02:49:56,950 --> 02:49:56,960
All right, folks. I think I'm done. We
 

6489
02:49:56,960 --> 02:50:00,150
All right, folks. I think I'm done. We
are done into lunch. Decent session.

6490
02:50:00,150 --> 02:50:00,160
are done into lunch. Decent session.
 

6491
02:50:00,160 --> 02:50:01,590
are done into lunch. Decent session.
Glad we took our profits when we did.

6492
02:50:01,590 --> 02:50:01,600
Glad we took our profits when we did.
 

6493
02:50:01,600 --> 02:50:03,110
Glad we took our profits when we did.
It's just chopping around now. Might do

6494
02:50:03,110 --> 02:50:03,120
It's just chopping around now. Might do
 

6495
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:04,950
It's just chopping around now. Might do
this for a while. It might honestly

6496
02:50:04,950 --> 02:50:04,960
this for a while. It might honestly
 

6497
02:50:04,960 --> 02:50:06,790
this for a while. It might honestly
build out here for a while. They've just

6498
02:50:06,790 --> 02:50:06,800
build out here for a while. They've just
 

6499
02:50:06,800 --> 02:50:08,230
build out here for a while. They've just
had one go at trying to do it. They

6500
02:50:08,230 --> 02:50:08,240
had one go at trying to do it. They
 

6501
02:50:08,240 --> 02:50:11,190
had one go at trying to do it. They
failed. Still bullish and it can build

6502
02:50:11,190 --> 02:50:11,200
failed. Still bullish and it can build
 

6503
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:13,349
failed. Still bullish and it can build
out liquidity here for a long long long

6504
02:50:13,349 --> 02:50:13,359
out liquidity here for a long long long
 

6505
02:50:13,359 --> 02:50:15,590
out liquidity here for a long long long
long long time. And then if it's ready

6506
02:50:15,590 --> 02:50:15,600
long long time. And then if it's ready
 

6507
02:50:15,600 --> 02:50:17,429
long long time. And then if it's ready
later on the day to have another go, it

6508
02:50:17,429 --> 02:50:17,439
later on the day to have another go, it
 

6509
02:50:17,439 --> 02:50:19,510
later on the day to have another go, it
can. If you start losing this look, VW,

6510
02:50:19,510 --> 02:50:19,520
can. If you start losing this look, VW,
 

6511
02:50:19,520 --> 02:50:20,870
can. If you start losing this look, VW,
everything's still coming up. You might

6512
02:50:20,870 --> 02:50:20,880
everything's still coming up. You might
 

6513
02:50:20,880 --> 02:50:22,870
everything's still coming up. You might
get a catch-up trade here and still have

6514
02:50:22,870 --> 02:50:22,880
get a catch-up trade here and still have
 

6515
02:50:22,880 --> 02:50:26,150
get a catch-up trade here and still have
that ability. Um, yeah, don't be giving

6516
02:50:26,150 --> 02:50:26,160
that ability. Um, yeah, don't be giving
 

6517
02:50:26,160 --> 02:50:41,030
that ability. Um, yeah, don't be giving
away your weekly profits on a Friday.

6518
02:50:41,030 --> 02:50:41,040

 

6519
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:42,950

Do I cover bookmap in the course? Yeah,

6520
02:50:42,950 --> 02:50:42,960
