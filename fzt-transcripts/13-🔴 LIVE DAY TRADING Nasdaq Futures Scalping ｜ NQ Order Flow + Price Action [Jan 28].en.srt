talking about more rate cuts than they
 

21
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,270
talking about more rate cuts than they
had previously anticipated? Very very

If they start talking about that market
 

27
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,150
If they start talking about that market
might like that news, maybe we go risk

28
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
might like that news, maybe we go risk
 

29
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,510
might like that news, maybe we go risk
on. If they're unwilling to pivot on

30
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
on. If they're unwilling to pivot on
 

31
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,670
on. If they're unwilling to pivot on
anything, then you know it's possible

32
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680
anything, then you know it's possible
 

33
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,070

the top side of the Ballinger band,
 

53
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,189
the top side of the Ballinger band,
filling in the gap on the QQQ. We can go

54
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
filling in the gap on the QQQ. We can go
 

55
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,350
filling in the gap on the QQQ. We can go
over that shortly. Only thing left right

over that shortly. Only thing left right
 

57
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,270
over that shortly. Only thing left right
now is for a drive higher. We're

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
now is for a drive higher. We're
 

59
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,990
now is for a drive higher. We're
actually a lot closer to that than uh it

60
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
actually a lot closer to that than uh it
 

61
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,390
actually a lot closer to that than uh it

The safest place to buy is very simply

78
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
The safest place to buy is very simply
 

79
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,110
The safest place to buy is very simply
going to be a retest of this sort of

80
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
going to be a retest of this sort of
 

81
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,550
going to be a retest of this sort of
area down here where we've built out

82
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
area down here where we've built out
 

83
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,270
area down here where we've built out
liquidity this week. All right, if this

84
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
liquidity this week. All right, if this
 

85
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,749
liquidity this week. All right, if this
is your breakout, we need a pullback to

86
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
is your breakout, we need a pullback to
 

87
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,070
is your breakout, we need a pullback to
hold to go higher. Now, there's no

88
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
hold to go higher. Now, there's no
 

89
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,749
hold to go higher. Now, there's no
saying that the pullback happens right

90
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
saying that the pullback happens right
 

91
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,469
saying that the pullback happens right
here today. All right, it is possible if

92
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
here today. All right, it is possible if
 

93
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,230
here today. All right, it is possible if
they're net long, net long, net long,

94
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,240
they're net long, net long, net long,
 

95
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,589
they're net long, net long, net long,
unless they take profits and allow this

96
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
unless they take profits and allow this
 

97
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,110
unless they take profits and allow this
to happen, it's possible we go on some

98
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,120
to happen, it's possible we go on some
 

99
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,189
to happen, it's possible we go on some
horrible squeeze. The Ballinger bands

100
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:27,199
horrible squeeze. The Ballinger bands
 

101
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,430
horrible squeeze. The Ballinger bands
not giving us much room. But we just

102
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
not giving us much room. But we just
 

103
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,790
not giving us much room. But we just
need to be aware if it's going to go

104
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
need to be aware if it's going to go
 

105
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,390
need to be aware if it's going to go
without us, it goes without us. We don't

106
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
without us, it goes without us. We don't
 

107
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,390
without us, it goes without us. We don't
fight the tape. We have to play momentum

108
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
fight the tape. We have to play momentum
 

109
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,270
fight the tape. We have to play momentum
and location. Right now, uh, momentum's

110
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
and location. Right now, uh, momentum's
 

111
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,070
and location. Right now, uh, momentum's
fantastic. Location's not so good. If we

112
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
fantastic. Location's not so good. If we
 

113
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,070
fantastic. Location's not so good. If we
move over to the hourlys, you can see

114
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
move over to the hourlys, you can see
 

115
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,150
move over to the hourlys, you can see
right in here overnight, we got that

116
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
right in here overnight, we got that
 

117
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,909
right in here overnight, we got that
extension through. Remember the key

118
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
extension through. Remember the key
 

119
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,749
extension through. Remember the key
levels yesterday? I think it was 26,045.

120
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
levels yesterday? I think it was 26,045.
 

121
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,830
levels yesterday? I think it was 26,045.
Right. So once we came into the new

122
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
Right. So once we came into the new
 

123
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,350
Right. So once we came into the new
session,

124
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,360
session,
 

125
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,110
session,
where are we now? Down here.

126
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
where are we now? Down here.
 

127
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,830
where are we now? Down here.
Once we came into that new session

128
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840

 

129
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,070

overnight, we built liquidity and then

130
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
overnight, we built liquidity and then
 

131
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,990
overnight, we built liquidity and then
we went for that breakout through all

132
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
we went for that breakout through all
 

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,309
we went for that breakout through all
that liquidity driving higher. So

134
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
that liquidity driving higher. So
 

135
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,230
that liquidity driving higher. So
watching for a retest of this kind of

136
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,240
watching for a retest of this kind of
 

137
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,869
watching for a retest of this kind of
area here. All right. Previous day value

138
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
area here. All right. Previous day value
 

139
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,390
area here. All right. Previous day value
area high, previous day point of

140
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
area high, previous day point of
 

141
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,070
area high, previous day point of
control. It's also where we had all

142
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
control. It's also where we had all
 

143
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,510
control. It's also where we had all
those stops built out on the daily.

144
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
those stops built out on the daily.
 

145
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,869
those stops built out on the daily.
Remember the daily we just went over all

146
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
Remember the daily we just went over all
 

147
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,070
Remember the daily we just went over all
that liquidity was basically all in

148
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
that liquidity was basically all in
 

149
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,749
that liquidity was basically all in
here. All right, all those stops. Think

150
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
here. All right, all those stops. Think
 

151
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,270
here. All right, all those stops. Think
about the daily wicks that we had up

152
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
about the daily wicks that we had up
 

153
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,749
about the daily wicks that we had up
here like this. Okay, can we come back

154
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759
here like this. Okay, can we come back
 

155
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,990
here like this. Okay, can we come back
and retest that? Do we hold it for a

156
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
and retest that? Do we hold it for a
 

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,830
and retest that? Do we hold it for a
buy? Very much like yesterday. If you're

158
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
buy? Very much like yesterday. If you're
 

159
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,430
buy? Very much like yesterday. If you're
interested in the sell

160
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
interested in the sell
 

161
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,949
interested in the sell
might not be too late, but we can have a

162
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
might not be too late, but we can have a
 

163
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,389
might not be too late, but we can have a
look. There might be that counter trend

164
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399
look. There might be that counter trend
 

165
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,469
look. There might be that counter trend
move down to here. All right. And then

166
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
move down to here. All right. And then
 

167
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,310
move down to here. All right. And then
they have to make a new high. failure to

168
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
they have to make a new high. failure to
 

169
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,909
they have to make a new high. failure to
make a new highs will they start to get

170
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
make a new highs will they start to get
 

171
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,310
make a new highs will they start to get
stuck. If we start to lose this there is

172
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
stuck. If we start to lose this there is
 

173
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,829
stuck. If we start to lose this there is
a rotation that can happen in here but

174
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:47,839
a rotation that can happen in here but
 

175
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,070
a rotation that can happen in here but
if we start to lose this then this

176
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
if we start to lose this then this
 

177
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,310
if we start to lose this then this
becomes possible uh today tomorrow

178
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
becomes possible uh today tomorrow
 

179
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,550
becomes possible uh today tomorrow
Friday all right so if we start to lose

180
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
Friday all right so if we start to lose
 

181
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,389
Friday all right so if we start to lose
these areas if this becomes a failed

182
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
these areas if this becomes a failed
 

183
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,790
these areas if this becomes a failed
breakout of lots of buyers chasing here

184
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
breakout of lots of buyers chasing here
 

185
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,590
breakout of lots of buyers chasing here
and we lose this area that rotation down

186
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600
and we lose this area that rotation down
 

187
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,269
and we lose this area that rotation down
to here can still happen that's still a

188
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
to here can still happen that's still a
 

189
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,110
to here can still happen that's still a
very normal pullback and healthy

190
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
very normal pullback and healthy
 

191
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,150
very normal pullback and healthy
pullback so just be aware of that okay

192
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
pullback so just be aware of that okay
 

193
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,750
pullback so just be aware of that okay
as we move into the fivem minute you can

194
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
as we move into the fivem minute you can
 

195
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,630
as we move into the fivem minute you can
see above what we had

196
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
see above what we had
 

197
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,350
see above what we had
a big shove up

198
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
a big shove up
 

199
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,150
a big shove up
early in the session. Big shove up here.

200
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
early in the session. Big shove up here.
 

201
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,790
early in the session. Big shove up here.
Early in the session, we go sideways. We

202
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
Early in the session, we go sideways. We
 

203
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,070
Early in the session, we go sideways. We
get another shove up. Here's your retest

204
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
get another shove up. Here's your retest
 

205
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,710
get another shove up. Here's your retest
of this core level here. Failing to make

206
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
of this core level here. Failing to make
 

207
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,470
of this core level here. Failing to make
a new high back to here. This is the

208
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
a new high back to here. This is the
 

209
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,630
a new high back to here. This is the
current range. All right. If we fail

210
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
current range. All right. If we fail
 

211
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,070
current range. All right. If we fail
underneath uh Asia, then probably that

212
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
underneath uh Asia, then probably that
 

213
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,910
underneath uh Asia, then probably that
rotation back down to previous day value

214
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:35,920
rotation back down to previous day value
 

215
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,110
rotation back down to previous day value
area high and point of control is

216
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,120
area high and point of control is
 

217
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,230
area high and point of control is
possible. We built out lots of

218
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
possible. We built out lots of
 

219
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,990
possible. We built out lots of
liquidity. Remember this, all of this

220
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
liquidity. Remember this, all of this
 

221
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,630
liquidity. Remember this, all of this
from 4:00 and then we had earnings. All

222
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
from 4:00 and then we had earnings. All
 

223
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,470
from 4:00 and then we had earnings. All
of this is very thin and light on

224
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
of this is very thin and light on
 

225
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,750
of this is very thin and light on
volume. All right, so it won't take a

226
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
volume. All right, so it won't take a
 

227
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,829
volume. All right, so it won't take a
lot to repric that if it really wants to

228
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
lot to repric that if it really wants to
 

229
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,230
lot to repric that if it really wants to
in a New York session. I' got to get a

230
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,240
in a New York session. I' got to get a
 

231
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,829
in a New York session. I' got to get a
bit of a move on here. Lots to go

232
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
bit of a move on here. Lots to go
 

233
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,590
bit of a move on here. Lots to go
through.

234
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
through.
 

235
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,030
through.
Okay, let's just have a look and pull

236
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040
Okay, let's just have a look and pull
 

237
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,269
Okay, let's just have a look and pull
you out so you can see the ES exactly

238
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
you out so you can see the ES exactly
 

239
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,070
you out so you can see the ES exactly
the same where alltime highs on the ES.

240
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,080
the same where alltime highs on the ES.
 

241
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,150
the same where alltime highs on the ES.
There you go. New alltime highs were

242
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
There you go. New alltime highs were
 

243
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,430
There you go. New alltime highs were
made. All that squeezed through. Ducking

244
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
made. All that squeezed through. Ducking
 

245
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,190
made. All that squeezed through. Ducking
down back inside currently. See if it

246
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
down back inside currently. See if it
 

247
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,829
down back inside currently. See if it
can hold against previous pivots. very

248
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
can hold against previous pivots. very
 

249
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,870
can hold against previous pivots. very
much the same thing. What's really

250
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
much the same thing. What's really
 

251
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,310
much the same thing. What's really
interesting is this though, right? The

252
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
interesting is this though, right? The
 

253
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,470
interesting is this though, right? The
Q's. This is what you want to keep an

254
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
Q's. This is what you want to keep an
 

255
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,470
Q's. This is what you want to keep an
eye on, right? So, we can set a price

256
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
eye on, right? So, we can set a price
 

257
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,790
eye on, right? So, we can set a price
alert right here

258
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
alert right here
 

259
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,190
alert right here
for alltime high on the QQQ. You can see

260
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
for alltime high on the QQQ. You can see
 

261
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,710
for alltime high on the QQQ. You can see
we're not quite there yet. So, we filled

262
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
we're not quite there yet. So, we filled
 

263
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,150
we're not quite there yet. So, we filled
this gap. Remember yesterday I said the

264
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160
this gap. Remember yesterday I said the
 

265
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,310
this gap. Remember yesterday I said the
efficient market will fill this gap on

266
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
efficient market will fill this gap on
 

267
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,389
efficient market will fill this gap on
QQQ. Well, guess where we got stuck. All

268
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:30,399
QQQ. Well, guess where we got stuck. All
 

269
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,750
QQQ. Well, guess where we got stuck. All
right. So, anyone that joined me on

270
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
right. So, anyone that joined me on
 

271
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,829
right. So, anyone that joined me on
stream yesterday, what did we say? The

272
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
stream yesterday, what did we say? The
 

273
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,829
stream yesterday, what did we say? The
32s, right? See this gap here on the

274
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
32s, right? See this gap here on the
 

275
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,829
32s, right? See this gap here on the
ETFs? We talked about this gap being

276
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
ETFs? We talked about this gap being
 

277
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,509
ETFs? We talked about this gap being
filled. All right. The obligation's been

278
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
filled. All right. The obligation's been
 

279
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,509
filled. All right. The obligation's been
done literally to the tick. It's been

280
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:41,519
done literally to the tick. It's been
 

281
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,750
done literally to the tick. It's been
done in pre-market. Look at that. 32s

282
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
done in pre-market. Look at that. 32s
 

283
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,590
done in pre-market. Look at that. 32s
pretty much to the tick. So, if you

284
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
pretty much to the tick. So, if you
 

285
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,590
pretty much to the tick. So, if you
joined me yesterday, you understand why

286
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
joined me yesterday, you understand why
 

287
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,350
joined me yesterday, you understand why
I said this will probably get filled in.

288
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
I said this will probably get filled in.
 

289
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,110
I said this will probably get filled in.
That is an efficient market. There is no

290
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
That is an efficient market. There is no
 

291
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,870
That is an efficient market. There is no
obligation for it to go higher. Now, if

292
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:52,880
obligation for it to go higher. Now, if
 

293
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,389
obligation for it to go higher. Now, if
this is going to be a failed breakout, a

294
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
this is going to be a failed breakout, a
 

295
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,350
this is going to be a failed breakout, a
gap fill come inside. It's possible. I'm

296
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,360
gap fill come inside. It's possible. I'm
 

297
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,710
gap fill come inside. It's possible. I'm
not saying it's probable. I'm saying

298
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
not saying it's probable. I'm saying
 

299
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,990
not saying it's probable. I'm saying
it's possible. So, you need to

300
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
it's possible. So, you need to
 

301
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,310
it's possible. So, you need to
understand location to buy here is not

302
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
understand location to buy here is not
 

303
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,750
understand location to buy here is not
good because we've just filled in a big

304
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
good because we've just filled in a big
 

305
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,389
good because we've just filled in a big
lowhanging fruit on a daily time frame.

306
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
lowhanging fruit on a daily time frame.
 

307
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,269
lowhanging fruit on a daily time frame.
All right. So worth understanding this

308
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
All right. So worth understanding this
 

309
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,190
All right. So worth understanding this
on the cues of where we are. We've

310
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
on the cues of where we are. We've
 

311
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,269
on the cues of where we are. We've
filled this in, right? We're opening up

312
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
filled this in, right? We're opening up
 

313
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,190
filled this in, right? We're opening up
up here. It will need to now hold this

314
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,200
up here. It will need to now hold this
 

315
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,110
up here. It will need to now hold this
gap. It needs to hold this gap for

316
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,120
gap. It needs to hold this gap for
 

317
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,870
gap. It needs to hold this gap for
continuation. If it cannot hold this

318
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:18,880
continuation. If it cannot hold this
 

319
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,710
continuation. If it cannot hold this
gap, doesn't have to be today, then it's

320
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720
gap, doesn't have to be today, then it's
 

321
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,829
gap, doesn't have to be today, then it's
going to be a problem. So we're looking

322
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
going to be a problem. So we're looking
 

323
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,230
going to be a problem. So we're looking
for pullbacks to hold really unless you

324
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
for pullbacks to hold really unless you
 

325
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,470
for pullbacks to hold really unless you
want to fade it and be the counter trend

326
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:26,480
want to fade it and be the counter trend
 

327
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,630
want to fade it and be the counter trend
play for the pullback also possible.

328
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,640
play for the pullback also possible.
 

329
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,870
play for the pullback also possible.
Spiders, same thing. Breaking out

330
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
Spiders, same thing. Breaking out
 

331
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,710
Spiders, same thing. Breaking out
alltime highs. You can see they are

332
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
alltime highs. You can see they are
 

333
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,310
alltime highs. You can see they are
above alltime high. So Q's have got a

334
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,320
above alltime high. So Q's have got a
 

335
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,829
above alltime high. So Q's have got a
little catch up to do but not too far

336
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
little catch up to do but not too far
 

337
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,150
little catch up to do but not too far
away and uh they look pretty good. All

338
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
away and uh they look pretty good. All
 

339
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,069
away and uh they look pretty good. All
right, Dixie continuing to get

340
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
right, Dixie continuing to get
 

341
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,509
right, Dixie continuing to get
absolutely smacked. All right, big drive

342
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
absolutely smacked. All right, big drive
 

343
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,470
absolutely smacked. All right, big drive
down lower. Jeez, it's not a good time

344
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
down lower. Jeez, it's not a good time
 

345
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,470
down lower. Jeez, it's not a good time
to hold the dollar right now. Honestly,

346
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
to hold the dollar right now. Honestly,
 

347
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,470
to hold the dollar right now. Honestly,
not a good look. VIX um is starting to

348
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
not a good look. VIX um is starting to
 

349
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,150
not a good look. VIX um is starting to
find a bit of a bid. All right, you've

350
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160
find a bit of a bid. All right, you've
 

351
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,310
find a bit of a bid. All right, you've
seen it's starting to try and find a bit

352
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
seen it's starting to try and find a bit
 

353
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,230
seen it's starting to try and find a bit
of a bid here. All right, so this is the

354
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
of a bid here. All right, so this is the
 

355
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,150
of a bid here. All right, so this is the
same pivot we're going to be looking at

356
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
same pivot we're going to be looking at
 

357
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,389
same pivot we're going to be looking at
as yesterday. Can it bid and hold over

358
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
as yesterday. Can it bid and hold over
 

359
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,710
as yesterday. Can it bid and hold over
sort of these 1625s? If so, we're

360
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
sort of these 1625s? If so, we're
 

361
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,990
sort of these 1625s? If so, we're
looking for this move up here. I don't

362
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
looking for this move up here. I don't
 

363
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,750
looking for this move up here. I don't
know why it keeps not putting my

364
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
know why it keeps not putting my
 

365
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,150
know why it keeps not putting my
drawings on from another chart. But this

366
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
drawings on from another chart. But this
 

367
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,990
drawings on from another chart. But this
move here on the VIX will allow

368
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
move here on the VIX will allow
 

369
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,670
move here on the VIX will allow
weakness. Any dunk under here,

370
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
weakness. Any dunk under here,
 

371
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,269
weakness. Any dunk under here,
obviously, then we're going to see some

372
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:13,279
obviously, then we're going to see some
 

373
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,110
obviously, then we're going to see some
strength come back into the charts.

374
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
strength come back into the charts.
 

375
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,310
strength come back into the charts.

Let's have a look at the mag.
All right, Apple pulling back into that

378
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
All right, Apple pulling back into that
 

379
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,350
All right, Apple pulling back into that
area. All right, remember it's got

380
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,360
area. All right, remember it's got
 

381
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,509
area. All right, remember it's got
earnings tomorrow. It's a big drive up.

382
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:23,519
earnings tomorrow. It's a big drive up.
 

383

We're coming right back into this key

384
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
We're coming right back into this key
 

385
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,590
We're coming right back into this key
level here. If we let go of that, then

386
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,600
level here. If we let go of that, then
 

387
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,509
level here. If we let go of that, then
next one's all the way down here. These

388
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
next one's all the way down here. These
 

389
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,870
next one's all the way down here. These
can still be back tested. It's a bit

390
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880
can still be back tested. It's a bit
 

391
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,590
can still be back tested. It's a bit
like QQQ. This can still be back test

392
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
like QQQ. This can still be back test
 

393
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,269
like QQQ. This can still be back test
down to here if they're taking profit.

394
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:35,279
down to here if they're taking profit.
 

395
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,030
down to here if they're taking profit.
And this is a run up into earnings if

396
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
And this is a run up into earnings if
 

397
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,069
And this is a run up into earnings if
they were starting to lock in some

398
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
they were starting to lock in some
 

399
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,310
they were starting to lock in some
profit before it.

400
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
profit before it.
 

401
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,190
profit before it.
Same kind of story here on Amazon. Big

402
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
Same kind of story here on Amazon. Big
 

403
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,150
Same kind of story here on Amazon. Big
drive up. All right. Huge breakout. It

404
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,160
drive up. All right. Huge breakout. It
 

405
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,230
drive up. All right. Huge breakout. It
can afford a pullback to hold. Can

406
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
can afford a pullback to hold. Can
 

407
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,590
can afford a pullback to hold. Can
afford to come all the way back down

408
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
afford to come all the way back down
 

409
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,190
afford to come all the way back down
here. But it's gapping up again this

410
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
here. But it's gapping up again this
 

411
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,910
here. But it's gapping up again this
morning. Google gapping up again. Same

412
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
morning. Google gapping up again. Same
 

413
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,829
morning. Google gapping up again. Same
kind of story. Has a bit more structure

414
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
kind of story. Has a bit more structure
 

415
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,230
kind of story. Has a bit more structure
here on Google to hold and otherwise

416
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
here on Google to hold and otherwise
 

417
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,069
here on Google to hold and otherwise
failures back down into here. So we just

418
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,079
failures back down into here. So we just
 

419
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,829
failures back down into here. So we just
see if it can hold this three drives. We

420
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
see if it can hold this three drives. We
 

421
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,150
see if it can hold this three drives. We
talk about three drives, right? One,

422
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
talk about three drives, right? One,
 

423
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,750
talk about three drives, right? One,
two, three. It needs to hold this kind

424
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
two, three. It needs to hold this kind
 

425
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,910
two, three. It needs to hold this kind
of area or fade and then reclaim it.

426
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:07,920
of area or fade and then reclaim it.
 

427
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,829
of area or fade and then reclaim it.
Getting stuck under here will allow this

428
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:09,839
Getting stuck under here will allow this
 

429
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,350
Getting stuck under here will allow this
move into here. This is very thin

430
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,360
move into here. This is very thin
 

431
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,829
move into here. This is very thin
but still holding okay for now. Tech has

432
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
but still holding okay for now. Tech has
 

433
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,310
but still holding okay for now. Tech has
been strong again. Meta gapping up

434
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
been strong again. Meta gapping up
 

435
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,910
been strong again. Meta gapping up
again.

436
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:19,920

See if it can hold its base. Starting to

438
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
See if it can hold its base. Starting to
 

439
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,670
See if it can hold its base. Starting to
base out versus this old pivot now. So

440
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
base out versus this old pivot now. So
 

441
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,069
base out versus this old pivot now. So
can it get going? Microsoft looks good.

442
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
can it get going? Microsoft looks good.
 

443
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,230
can it get going? Microsoft looks good.
That's very very strong again. Thin

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,910
That's very very strong again. Thin
under here. This is the problem with all

446
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
under here. This is the problem with all
 

447
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,670
under here. This is the problem with all
these stocks at the moment. If you're a

start a new long position here. You're
 

459
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,230

strong. Let's just zoom that out for a
 

465
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,310
strong. Let's just zoom that out for a
minute. I need to remember where we're

466
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,320
minute. I need to remember where we're
 

467
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,150
minute. I need to remember where we're
at on that. All right. So, it's looking

468
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160
at on that. All right. So, it's looking
 

469
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,470
at on that. All right. So, it's looking
to get above 93s and 96s. Really 93s. 96

470
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
to get above 93s and 96s. Really 93s. 96
 

471
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,069
to get above 93s and 96s. Really 93s. 96
is a big level. You can see both sides

472
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
is a big level. You can see both sides
 

473
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,750
is a big level. You can see both sides
of this on the way up. That's your

474
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
of this on the way up. That's your
 

475
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,990
of this on the way up. That's your
level. Reclaim that. We'll leave sellers

476
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
level. Reclaim that. We'll leave sellers
 

477
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,750
level. Reclaim that. We'll leave sellers
trapped and then we will go for new high

478
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
trapped and then we will go for new high
 

479
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,150
trapped and then we will go for new high
alltime highs if we can reclaim that.

480
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,160
alltime highs if we can reclaim that.
 

481
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,910
alltime highs if we can reclaim that.
Gapping up again on Nvidia. It's a

482
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
Gapping up again on Nvidia. It's a
 

483
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,110
Gapping up again on Nvidia. It's a
strong gap. And Tesla starting to try

484
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
strong gap. And Tesla starting to try
 

485
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,710
strong gap. And Tesla starting to try
and find a bid down here. All right. So,

486
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
and find a bid down here. All right. So,
 

487
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,150
and find a bid down here. All right. So,
it's been washing down the last few days

488
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,160
it's been washing down the last few days
 

489
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,590
it's been washing down the last few days
in a range. There you go. Washing down

490
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,600
in a range. There you go. Washing down
 

491
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,189
in a range. There you go. Washing down
in the range, but coming to back test

492
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199
in the range, but coming to back test
 

493
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,829
in the range, but coming to back test
this level where we first found bids.

494
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:19,839
this level where we first found bids.
 

495
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,670
this level where we first found bids.
All right. Coming back to it. Can we

496
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:21,680
All right. Coming back to it. Can we
 

497
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,990
All right. Coming back to it. Can we
hold it and start getting going? Equally

498
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,000
hold it and start getting going? Equally

weighted mag gapping up. We do look a

00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:31,440
weighted mag gapping up. We do look a
 

505
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,269
weighted mag gapping up. We do look a
bit steep here. All right. This is my

506
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
bit steep here. All right. This is my
 

507
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,110
bit steep here. All right. This is my
worry right now. My concern in this

508
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120
worry right now. My concern in this
 

509
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,030
worry right now. My concern in this
market. Here's the base. The failure to

510
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
market. Here's the base. The failure to
 

511
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,750
market. Here's the base. The failure to
break. But this is a big drive. We can

512
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760
break. But this is a big drive. We can
 

513
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,269
break. But this is a big drive. We can
actually, you know, we could do with

514
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:41,279
actually, you know, we could do with
 

515
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,430
actually, you know, we could do with
this setting up here. Unless they're

516
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:43,440
this setting up here. Unless they're
 

517
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,710
this setting up here. Unless they're
going to do it up here. We could do with

518
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720
going to do it up here. We could do with
 

519
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,030
going to do it up here. We could do with
something like this,

520
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
something like this,
 

521
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,629
something like this,
which would work nicely in the cues.

starting to try and claw back. So, if we

536
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:00,399
starting to try and claw back. So, if we
 

537
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,069
starting to try and claw back. So, if we
can get a new base here on AMD, it's the

538
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:02,079
can get a new base here on AMD, it's the
 

539

can get a new base here on AMD, it's the
same story for chips. If it can base, we

540
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
same story for chips. If it can base, we
 

541
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,829
same story for chips. If it can base, we
can make new alltime highs. And ABGO

00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:08,559
get.
 

625
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,669
get.
Right. So, you'd be watching these

626
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
Right. So, you'd be watching these
 

627
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,630
Right. So, you'd be watching these
pivots here. down here is the the real

628
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:12,640
pivots here. down here is the the real
 

629
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,470
pivots here. down here is the the real
interest level. All right. So, we have

630
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
interest level. All right. So, we have
 

631
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,789
interest level. All right. So, we have
the GlobeEx pivot right here, but other

632
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:16,799
the GlobeEx pivot right here, but other
 

633
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,270
the GlobeEx pivot right here, but other
than that, you're looking for there's

634
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,280
than that, you're looking for there's
 

635
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,949
than that, you're looking for there's
your range. It's quite a big range as

636
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
your range. It's quite a big range as
 

637
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,350
your range. It's quite a big range as
well. In fact, we can Let's have a look

638
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
well. In fact, we can Let's have a look
 

639
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,150
well. In fact, we can Let's have a look
at what we did overnight

640
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
at what we did overnight
 

641
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,990
at what we did overnight
on the new print. Very rarely do this,

642
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
on the new print. Very rarely do this,
 

643
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,909
on the new print. Very rarely do this,
but because the range is so big, it will

644
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:29,919
but because the range is so big, it will
 

645
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,750
but because the range is so big, it will
be worth it.

646
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760

 

647
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,590

Okay, that's your cluster.

648
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:37,600
Okay, that's your cluster.
 

649
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:45,430
Okay, that's your cluster.
So this level, this guy here is key

650
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440

 

651
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,950

to lose this edge. There is a bit of a

652
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
to lose this edge. There is a bit of a
 

653
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,990
to lose this edge. There is a bit of a
dip I might hold in here. 218s.

654
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,000
dip I might hold in here. 218s.
 

655
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,310
dip I might hold in here. 218s.
I'd say this gu is pivotal.

656
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320

 

657
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,750

We'll leave that on just for the start.

658
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:55,760
We'll leave that on just for the start.
 

659
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,870
We'll leave that on just for the start.
So we can see the overnight range

660
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:56,880
So we can see the overnight range
 

661
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,310
So we can see the overnight range
because the gap's quite big from

662
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,320
because the gap's quite big from
 

663
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,310
because the gap's quite big from
previous days.

664
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,320
previous days.
 

665
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,990
previous days.
Why is previous day point of control

666
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,000
Why is previous day point of control
 

667
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,390
Why is previous day point of control
showing above?

668
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,400
showing above?
 

669
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,310
showing above?
91s. No, you should be down here, mate.

670
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,320
91s. No, you should be down here, mate.
 

671
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,070
91s. No, you should be down here, mate.
There you go.

672
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,080

 

673
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,350

All right. Yeah. So, we've got like a

674
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
All right. Yeah. So, we've got like a
 

675
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,750
All right. Yeah. So, we've got like a
200 point gap

676
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:15,760
200 point gap
 

677
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,669
200 point gap
from the previous day value to overnight

678
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
from the previous day value to overnight
 

679
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,630
from the previous day value to overnight
value. All right. So, this this is a is

680
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
value. All right. So, this this is a is
 

681
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,190
value. All right. So, this this is a is
a huge imbalance here. Right. So, if

682
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200
a huge imbalance here. Right. So, if
 

683
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,430
a huge imbalance here. Right. So, if
they let go of value

684
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
they let go of value
 

685
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,669
they let go of value
and they stay heavy, this rotation here

686
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
and they stay heavy, this rotation here
 

687
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:34,310
and they stay heavy, this rotation here
is very possible.

688
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320

 

689
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,909

Well, don't worry guys, if it's a if

690
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:35,919
Well, don't worry guys, if it's a if
 

691
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,950
Well, don't worry guys, if it's a if
it's a outage everywhere, um it won't

692
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:38,960
it's a outage everywhere, um it won't
 

693
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,470
it's a outage everywhere, um it won't
they will refund you. They will have to

694
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
they will refund you. They will have to
 

695

697
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,830
refund you because if it's a trade of
eight issue, they can't have you in a

698
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
eight issue, they can't have you in a
 

699
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,430
eight issue, they can't have you in a
prop and not do anything. So, you don't

700
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
prop and not do anything. So, you don't
 

701
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,909

00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
you any any problems because if it's if
 

705
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,150
you any any problems because if it's if
it's not a singular issue, which it

706
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,160
it's not a singular issue, which it
 

707
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,590
it's not a singular issue, which it
clearly isn't. Everyone's experiencing

708
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:53,600
clearly isn't. Everyone's experiencing
 

709
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,310
clearly isn't. Everyone's experiencing
it. They will have no choice but to give

710
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:56,320
it. They will have no choice but to give
 

711
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,669
it. They will have no choice but to give
everyone their money back. So, don't

712
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
everyone their money back. So, don't
 

713
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,789
everyone their money back. So, don't
stress. Don't stress.

714
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:02,799

 

715
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,190

What's the plan today? I would say

716
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,200
What's the plan today? I would say
 

717
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,870
What's the plan today? I would say
potentially being a buyer down here.

718
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:06,880
potentially being a buyer down here.
 

719
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,029
potentially being a buyer down here.
Potentially fading this here to TP1, TP2

720
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
Potentially fading this here to TP1, TP2
 

721
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,350
Potentially fading this here to TP1, TP2
or this here down here. I don't really

722
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,360
or this here down here. I don't really
 

723
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,430
or this here down here. I don't really
want to be a buyer up here and then down

724
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,440
want to be a buyer up here and then down
 

725
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,070
want to be a buyer up here and then down
here. I'd like to be a buyer.

726
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
here. I'd like to be a buyer.
 

727
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,070
here. I'd like to be a buyer.
Um, but obviously right now my plan is

728
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,080
Um, but obviously right now my plan is
 

729
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,590
Um, but obviously right now my plan is
to do nothing because I don't have any

730
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:21,600
to do nothing because I don't have any
 

731
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,630
to do nothing because I don't have any
data for uh Ninja unfortunately.

732
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
data for uh Ninja unfortunately.
 

733
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:40,950
data for uh Ninja unfortunately.
Same as everyone else.

734
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:40,960

 

735
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,789

Yeah. Nothing. I got I got another

736
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:44,799
Yeah. Nothing. I got I got another
 

737
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,390
Yeah. Nothing. I got I got another
I got nothing. Can't do anything. So,

738
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:46,400
I got nothing. Can't do anything. So,
 

739
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,750
I got nothing. Can't do anything. So,
I'll just read out and call you what I

740
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
I'll just read out and call you what I
 

741
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:54,950
I'll just read out and call you what I
can see.

742
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960

 

743
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,150

Don't worry. I know you're calling

744
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,160
Don't worry. I know you're calling
 

745
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,270
Don't worry. I know you're calling
trading vote, but you got to understand

746
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,280
trading vote, but you got to understand
 

747
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,870
trading vote, but you got to understand
they'll be they'll be under the caution

748
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:58,880
they'll be they'll be under the caution
 

749
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,549
they'll be they'll be under the caution
everyone. If you're trading prop, they

750
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
everyone. If you're trading prop, they
 

751
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,909
everyone. If you're trading prop, they
will fix it. All right? You'll get your

752
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
will fix it. All right? You'll get your
 

753
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,430
will fix it. All right? You'll get your
money back. Don't it's not worth

754
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
money back. Don't it's not worth
 

755
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,789
money back. Don't it's not worth
stressing about. Don't get yourself

756
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:04,799
stressing about. Don't get yourself
 

757
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,630
stressing about. Don't get yourself
wound up about it. Honestly, I'm talking

758
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:06,640
wound up about it. Honestly, I'm talking
 

759
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,350
wound up about it. Honestly, I'm talking
from experience here. Okay? So, current

760
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360
from experience here. Okay? So, current
 

761
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,710
from experience here. Okay? So, current
overnight value is right here. This is

762
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720
overnight value is right here. This is
 

763
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,150
overnight value is right here. This is
your key level. If they hold this,

764
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,160
your key level. If they hold this,
 

765
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,430
your key level. If they hold this,
they're going to look for the rotation

766
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,440
they're going to look for the rotation
 

767
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,669
they're going to look for the rotation
all the way if they can get back through

768
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679
all the way if they can get back through
 

769
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,750
all the way if they can get back through
uh 62s all the way up to these 300s.

770
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:19,760
uh 62s all the way up to these 300s.
 

771
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,430
uh 62s all the way up to these 300s.
And if they fade 300s, that's your

772
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,440
And if they fade 300s, that's your
 

773
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,830
And if they fade 300s, that's your
overnight point of control.

774
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
overnight point of control.
 

775
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,510
overnight point of control.
And then we can see what we get develop

776
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:25,520
And then we can see what we get develop
 

777
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,230
And then we can see what we get develop
after that. Let's put this on here.

778
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,240
after that. Let's put this on here.
 

779
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,870
after that. Let's put this on here.
There we go. No, it's not what I want.

780
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:34,880

 

781

Yeah, lower your expectations today,

782
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:36,960
Yeah, lower your expectations today,
 

783
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,390
Yeah, lower your expectations today,
folks. And FOMC day after such a big run

784
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,400
folks. And FOMC day after such a big run
 

785
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,310
folks. And FOMC day after such a big run
up as well.

786
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,320
up as well.
 

787
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,350
up as well.
Lower those expectations. Uh, smash that

788
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,360
Lower those expectations. Uh, smash that
 

789
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,909
Lower those expectations. Uh, smash that
like button for me nice and early. Would

790
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:47,919
like button for me nice and early. Would
 

791
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,510
like button for me nice and early. Would
like to do some giveaways on stream as

792
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:49,520
like to do some giveaways on stream as
 

793
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,590
like to do some giveaways on stream as
always.

794
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:53,600

 

795
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,110

ES looking strong. I'd say look at the

796
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120
ES looking strong. I'd say look at the
 

797
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,110
ES looking strong. I'd say look at the
spy pre-market came down held previous

798
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
spy pre-market came down held previous
 

799
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,270
spy pre-market came down held previous
day high held that pivot looks very

800
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
day high held that pivot looks very
 

801
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,710
day high held that pivot looks very
strong. The spiders right now they

802
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:00,720
strong. The spiders right now they
 

803
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,270
strong. The spiders right now they
probably want the 700s on the spy.

804
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,280
probably want the 700s on the spy.
 

805
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,830
probably want the 700s on the spy.
Right. So relative weakness in NQ today

806
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:05,840
Right. So relative weakness in NQ today
 

807
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,789
Right. So relative weakness in NQ today
versus SPY uh in the morning open. Not

808
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:08,799
versus SPY uh in the morning open. Not
 

809
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,310
versus SPY uh in the morning open. Not
in the gap up, but just in the morning

810
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,320
in the gap up, but just in the morning
 

811
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:21,029
in the gap up, but just in the morning
open.

812
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,039

 

813
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,830

Could be a dad day anyway. Could be very

814
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:23,840
Could be a dad day anyway. Could be very
 

815
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,950
Could be a dad day anyway. Could be very
easily be a dud day or a dud morning I

816
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:26,960
easily be a dud day or a dud morning I
 

817
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:35,830
easily be a dud day or a dud morning I
should say.

818
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:35,840

 

819
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,789

They're

820
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:40,799

 

821
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,630

trying to find that bid to VWAP. If they

822
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:42,640
trying to find that bid to VWAP. If they
 

823
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,310
trying to find that bid to VWAP. If they
get acceptance through VWAP, they will

824
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,320
get acceptance through VWAP, they will
 

825
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,510
get acceptance through VWAP, they will
look for all the way up here.

826
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,520
look for all the way up here.
 

827
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,789
look for all the way up here.
That's what they will attempt to do is

828
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:48,799
That's what they will attempt to do is
 

829
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,230
That's what they will attempt to do is
to get up to there for the retest.

830
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,240
to get up to there for the retest.
 

831
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,750
to get up to there for the retest.
There's quite a few nodes on the way up,

832
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:51,760
There's quite a few nodes on the way up,
 

833
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,470
There's quite a few nodes on the way up,
but they will attempt if it's a big if.

834
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:54,480
but they will attempt if it's a big if.
 

835
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,470
but they will attempt if it's a big if.
If they can't break down o underneath

836
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:56,480
If they can't break down o underneath
 

837
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,029
If they can't break down o underneath
under overnight value, right, and they

838
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
under overnight value, right, and they
 

839
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,789
under overnight value, right, and they
hold current PC, they will try and force

840
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:00,799
hold current PC, they will try and force
 

841
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,310
hold current PC, they will try and force
this rotation. They will need acceptance

842
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,320
this rotation. They will need acceptance
 

843
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,669
this rotation. They will need acceptance
through here. If they lose this, then

844
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:05,679
through here. If they lose this, then
 

845
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,430
through here. If they lose this, then
GlobeEx

846
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:07,440
GlobeEx
 

847
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,029
GlobeEx
and down to here is possible. All right.

848
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
and down to here is possible. All right.
 

849
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,310
and down to here is possible. All right.
So, you're at a battleground right now.

850
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
So, you're at a battleground right now.
 

851
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,909
So, you're at a battleground right now.
So, you need to wait to find if if we're

852
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:11,919
So, you need to wait to find if if we're
 

853
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,830
So, you need to wait to find if if we're
going to have acceptance or not of

854
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:13,840
going to have acceptance or not of
 

855
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,149
going to have acceptance or not of
holding this gap. And if so, this is the

856
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:16,159
holding this gap. And if so, this is the
 

857
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,510
holding this gap. And if so, this is the
target, which they're trying to do right

858
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
target, which they're trying to do right
 

859
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,789
target, which they're trying to do right
now. All right. They can't get under

860
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:18,799
now. All right. They can't get under
 

861
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,590
now. All right. They can't get under
here. That morning dip so far is held.

862
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:21,600
here. That morning dip so far is held.
 

863
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,950
here. That morning dip so far is held.
They'll break underneath value and

864
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:22,960
They'll break underneath value and
 

865
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,070
They'll break underneath value and
they're going to try and come up for

866
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,080
they're going to try and come up for
 

867
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,390
they're going to try and come up for
this. There you go. Starting to get

868
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
this. There you go. Starting to get
 

869
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,909
this. There you go. Starting to get
going. So, if you are able to get long

870
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:27,919
going. So, if you are able to get long
 

871
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,230
going. So, if you are able to get long
in that, this is now your target up into

872
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,240
in that, this is now your target up into
 

873
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,750
in that, this is now your target up into
310.

874
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:33,760

 

875
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,110

It's a shame. It's quite a nice setup,

876
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,120
It's a shame. It's quite a nice setup,
 

877
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,470
It's a shame. It's quite a nice setup,
but what can you do when the network and

878
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:38,480
but what can you do when the network and
 

879
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,870
but what can you do when the network and
everything's down?

880
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:44,880

 

881
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,990

Morning, Scott.

882
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000

 

883
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,230

So, if they hold VW up now, 310 is where

884
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
So, if they hold VW up now, 310 is where
 

885
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,230
So, if they hold VW up now, 310 is where
they're looking for.

886
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
they're looking for.
 

887
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,830
they're looking for.
And if they let go of point of control

888
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
And if they let go of point of control
 

889
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,510
And if they let go of point of control
and let go of here, then the rotation

890
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
and let go of here, then the rotation
 

891
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,470
and let go of here, then the rotation
all the way uh 91s and then down here is

892
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,480
all the way uh 91s and then down here is
 

893
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,470
all the way uh 91s and then down here is
possible. Both are possible. Uh for me

894
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:02,480
possible. Both are possible. Uh for me
 

895
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,149
possible. Both are possible. Uh for me
personally, I wouldn't like to be net

896
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:04,159
personally, I wouldn't like to be net
 

897
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,990
personally, I wouldn't like to be net
long today unless we come down into

898
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,000
long today unless we come down into
 

899
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,630
long today unless we come down into
these areas. For me personally, we're a

900
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:08,640
these areas. For me personally, we're a
 

901
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,310
these areas. For me personally, we're a
little bit frothy up here, especially

902
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,320
little bit frothy up here, especially
 

903
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,750
little bit frothy up here, especially
after we talked about those cues,

904
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:11,760
after we talked about those cues,
 

905
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,190
after we talked about those cues,
closing that gap.

906
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,200
closing that gap.
 

907
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,789
closing that gap.
And we've left that gap open actually

908
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:16,799
And we've left that gap open actually
 

909
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,789
And we've left that gap open actually
because we've we closed yesterday, the

910
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:18,799
because we've we closed yesterday, the
 

911
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,029
because we've we closed yesterday, the
high of yesterday was basically right

912
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
high of yesterday was basically right
 

913
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,350
high of yesterday was basically right
into those 32s, right? And then we

914
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,360
into those 32s, right? And then we
 

915
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,549
into those 32s, right? And then we
pulled back and then we've gapped up

916
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:24,559
pulled back and then we've gapped up
 

917
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,950
pulled back and then we've gapped up
above it. So, we have a gap back down to

918
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:26,960
above it. So, we have a gap back down to
 

919
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,029
above it. So, we have a gap back down to
that old gap fill level. It's just

920
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:29,039
that old gap fill level. It's just
 

921
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:46,950
that old gap fill level. It's just
nasty. Nasty.

922
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960

 

923
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,390

Yeah, I can't do anything here, folks.

924
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:48,400
Yeah, I can't do anything here, folks.
 

925
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,950
Yeah, I can't do anything here, folks.
I'm really sorry.

926
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:52,960

 

927
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,110

Yeah, I won't be touching mobile app

928
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,120
Yeah, I won't be touching mobile app
 

929
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,029
Yeah, I won't be touching mobile app
either. Okay, back down to value. If

930
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:57,039
either. Okay, back down to value. If
 

931
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,390
either. Okay, back down to value. If
they lose this, then we'll come right

932
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,400
they lose this, then we'll come right
 

933
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,950
they lose this, then we'll come right
back down for this GlobeEx level. So, if

934
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
back down for this GlobeEx level. So, if
 

935
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,669
back down for this GlobeEx level. So, if
they stay heavy under here, right, we

936
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:03,679
they stay heavy under here, right, we
 

937
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,430
they stay heavy under here, right, we
built up a node here. There's a node

938
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,440
built up a node here. There's a node
 

939
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,110
built up a node here. There's a node
down into this. There's a little node

940
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,120
down into this. There's a little node
 

941
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,750
down into this. There's a little node
here. If we lose 20s, you're into

942
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760
here. If we lose 20s, you're into
 

943
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,830
here. If we lose 20s, you're into
GlobeEx. And if you lose that, you're

944
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:11,840
GlobeEx. And if you lose that, you're
 

945
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,350
GlobeEx. And if you lose that, you're
right down into here. This is a very

946
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,360
right down into here. This is a very
 

947
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,029
right down into here. This is a very
possible trade today. That would be your

948
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:15,039
possible trade today. That would be your
 

949
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,710
possible trade today. That would be your
your counter trend long pullback. Think

950
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:16,720
your counter trend long pullback. Think
 

951
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,029
your counter trend long pullback. Think
about what we've been doing. Think about

952
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:19,039
about what we've been doing. Think about
 

953
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,510
about what we've been doing. Think about
this just pulling back to here, right?

954
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:21,520
this just pulling back to here, right?
 

955
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,190
this just pulling back to here, right?
This fade here is possible that they

956
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,200
This fade here is possible that they
 

957
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,350
This fade here is possible that they
scoop it back up. I would be interested

958
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,360
scoop it back up. I would be interested
 

959
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,710
scoop it back up. I would be interested
in being a buyer down there if we come

960
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:26,720
in being a buyer down there if we come
 

961
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,630
in being a buyer down there if we come
there. That's very much like yesterday.

962
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:28,640
there. That's very much like yesterday.
 

963
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,669
there. That's very much like yesterday.
I don't know that they're going to have

964
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:29,679
I don't know that they're going to have
 

965
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,750
I don't know that they're going to have
the juice to do it, but if they did,

966
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:31,760
the juice to do it, but if they did,
 

967
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,190
the juice to do it, but if they did,
that's an area I'd be interested in

968
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,200
that's an area I'd be interested in
 

969
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:42,070
that's an area I'd be interested in
being a buyer in today.

970
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080

Um if we think about what we've had this

986
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:00,320
Um if we think about what we've had this
 

987
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,149
Um if we think about what we've had this
week, why why I don't really care too

988
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:02,159
week, why why I don't really care too
 

989
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,510
week, why why I don't really care too
much, right? Let's just look at this

990
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:03,520
much, right? Let's just look at this
 

991
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,470
much, right? Let's just look at this
five minute chart, right?

992
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:06,480
five minute chart, right?
 

993
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,070
five minute chart, right?
Let's think about what we've had this

994
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,080
Let's think about what we've had this
 

995
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,750
Let's think about what we've had this
week. We have been long on dips all week

996
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:11,760
week. We have been long on dips all week
 

997
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,549
week. We have been long on dips all week
long. All right, from the Sunday open

998
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:16,559
long. All right, from the Sunday open
 

999
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,390
long. All right, from the Sunday open
was the flush down into the key level to

1000
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400
was the flush down into the key level to
 

1001
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,789
was the flush down into the key level to
hold. All right, Monday off offered the

1002
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:20,799
hold. All right, Monday off offered the
 

1003
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,269
hold. All right, Monday off offered the
long opportunity back up. Then we got

1004
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:23,279
long opportunity back up. Then we got
 

1005
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,750
long opportunity back up. Then we got
long again Tuesday for this opportunity

1006
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:25,760
long again Tuesday for this opportunity
 

1007
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,990
long again Tuesday for this opportunity
back up and then overnight

1008
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,000
back up and then overnight
 

1009
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,990
back up and then overnight
they have ripped it higher. All right,

1010
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,000
they have ripped it higher. All right,
 

1011
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,909
they have ripped it higher. All right,
because we're in breakout. If we zoom

1012
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:33,919
because we're in breakout. If we zoom
 

1013
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,549
because we're in breakout. If we zoom
out or if you just look down here on

1014
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:36,559
out or if you just look down here on
 

1015
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,149
out or if you just look down here on
this chart can just do it here. We're in

1016
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:38,159
this chart can just do it here. We're in
 

1017
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,430
this chart can just do it here. We're in
breakout, aren't we? These were the

1018
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:39,440
breakout, aren't we? These were the
 

1019
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,430

1021
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,710

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:42,720
in the last few days, these were the
 

1023
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,870
in the last few days, these were the
targets. We're in breakout. Do I want to

when we look at the charts, we're

1028
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,080
when we look at the charts, we're
 

1029
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,590
when we look at the charts, we're
thinking, what is the location? What is

1030
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:49,600
thinking, what is the location? What is
 

1031
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,830
thinking, what is the location? What is
the momentum? Momentum is fantastic.

1032
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
the momentum? Momentum is fantastic.
 

1033
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,110
the momentum? Momentum is fantastic.
Where's the best location? It's going to

1034
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,120
Where's the best location? It's going to
 

1035
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,950
Where's the best location? It's going to
be a pullback, isn't it? Pull back into

1036
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:54,960
be a pullback, isn't it? Pull back into
 

1037
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,710
be a pullback, isn't it? Pull back into
here is going to be the best location to

1038
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
here is going to be the best location to
 

1039
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,950
here is going to be the best location to
be buying or where we're buying early

1040
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:58,960
be buying or where we're buying early
 

1041
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,110
be buying or where we're buying early
early week. One, two, three. Those three

1042
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,120
early week. One, two, three. Those three
 

1043
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,630
early week. One, two, three. Those three
buy opportunities we had, right?

1044
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
buy opportunities we had, right?
 

1045
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,990
buy opportunities we had, right?
Unfortunately, we're day traders, not

1046
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,000
Unfortunately, we're day traders, not
 

1047
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,830
Unfortunately, we're day traders, not
swing traders, right? So, I don't want

1048
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:05,840
swing traders, right? So, I don't want
 

1049
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,350
swing traders, right? So, I don't want
to be adding that long up here. Very,

1050
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,360
to be adding that long up here. Very,
 

1051
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,789
to be adding that long up here. Very,
very dangerous. I want to be adding that

1052
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:08,799
very dangerous. I want to be adding that
 

1053
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,789
very dangerous. I want to be adding that
long down here on a pullback. So, today

1054
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:10,799
long down here on a pullback. So, today
 

1055
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,029
long down here on a pullback. So, today
might be the counter trend move this

1056
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:13,039
might be the counter trend move this
 

1057
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,190
might be the counter trend move this
morning down into some of these regions.

1058
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:15,200
morning down into some of these regions.
 

1059
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,789
morning down into some of these regions.
I don't know how far they come down. Do

1060
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:16,799
I don't know how far they come down. Do
 

1061
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,990
I don't know how far they come down. Do
they get to the 26, 150, 120s? Do they

1062
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,000
they get to the 26, 150, 120s? Do they
 

1063
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,190
they get to the 26, 150, 120s? Do they
come below? I don't know. Um, but it's

1064
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,200
come below? I don't know. Um, but it's
 

1065
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,870
come below? I don't know. Um, but it's
why I'm not too bothered because I'm I'm

1066
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:24,880
why I'm not too bothered because I'm I'm
 

1067
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,190
why I'm not too bothered because I'm I'm
not missing a protrend trade. Pro trend

1068
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:27,200
not missing a protrend trade. Pro trend
 

1069
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,269
not missing a protrend trade. Pro trend
trade will be if we come in here and we

1070
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:29,279
trade will be if we come in here and we
 

1071
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,789
trade will be if we come in here and we
do something like that, right?

1072
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:32,799
do something like that, right?
 

1073
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,149
do something like that, right?
Hopefully that makes sense. So, I'm not

1074
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:34,159
Hopefully that makes sense. So, I'm not
 

1075
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,789
Hopefully that makes sense. So, I'm not
it's not a it's not a huge miss today.

1076
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:36,799
it's not a it's not a huge miss today.
 

1077
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,029
it's not a it's not a huge miss today.
If the if if the networks were down and

1078
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:39,039
If the if if the networks were down and
 

1079
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,350
If the if if the networks were down and
we were missing yesterday, I'd be very

1080
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,360
we were missing yesterday, I'd be very
 

1081
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,190
we were missing yesterday, I'd be very
upset, right? If we were going into

1082
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,200
upset, right? If we were going into
 

1083
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,789
upset, right? If we were going into
breakout with a squeeze on, I'd be very

1084
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:44,799
breakout with a squeeze on, I'd be very
 

1085
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,430
breakout with a squeeze on, I'd be very
upset. So, if you are net shorting this

1086
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:47,440
upset. So, if you are net shorting this
 

1087
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,190
upset. So, if you are net shorting this
now though underneath here, if you're

1088
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:49,200
now though underneath here, if you're
 

1089
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,029
now though underneath here, if you're
net short versus 40s now, you'll be

1090
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:51,039
net short versus 40s now, you'll be
 

1091
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,470
net short versus 40s now, you'll be
looking, remember I said 20s is your

1092
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:52,480
looking, remember I said 20s is your
 

1093
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,470
looking, remember I said 20s is your
first target just based on a node. Then

1094
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:54,480
first target just based on a node. Then
 

1095
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,990
first target just based on a node. Then
you're looking for this level here into

1096
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,000
you're looking for this level here into
 

1097
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,070
you're looking for this level here into
192s.

1098
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,080
192s.
 

1099
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,909
192s.
Uh let me just measure this out.

1100
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:01,919
Uh let me just measure this out.
 

1101
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,909
Uh let me just measure this out.
Yeah, where we are here. And then yeah,

1102
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:03,919
Yeah, where we are here. And then yeah,
 

1103
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,070
Yeah, where we are here. And then yeah,
under 192s, we get very thin under 192s

1104
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,080
under 192s, we get very thin under 192s
 

1105
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,029
under 192s, we get very thin under 192s
all the way down into uh these areas

1106
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:11,039
all the way down into uh these areas
 

1107
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,549
all the way down into uh these areas
down here where I'd be interested in

1108
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:12,559
down here where I'd be interested in
 

1109
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,510
down here where I'd be interested in
being long around here. Right. So I

1110
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:15,520
being long around here. Right. So I
 

1111
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,990
being long around here. Right. So I
would say TP1 we've already hit right

1112
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,000
would say TP1 we've already hit right
 

1113
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,710
would say TP1 we've already hit right
now. If I move you to higher time frame,

1114
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:20,720
now. If I move you to higher time frame,
 

1115
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,390
now. If I move you to higher time frame,
you will see why. Right? We have this

1116
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:22,400
you will see why. Right? We have this
 

1117
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,909
you will see why. Right? We have this
node here that we developed in Asia.

1118
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:25,919
node here that we developed in Asia.
 

1119
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,510
node here that we developed in Asia.
There you go. All right. So that's your

1120
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:27,520
There you go. All right. So that's your
 

1121
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,669
There you go. All right. So that's your
TP1. If you get acceptance under that,

1122
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679
TP1. If you get acceptance under that,
 

1123
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,470
TP1. If you get acceptance under that,
look how thin we get underneath 192s.

1124
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,480
look how thin we get underneath 192s.
 

1125
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,310
look how thin we get underneath 192s.
Look at this volume. Non-existent

1126
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,320
Look at this volume. Non-existent
 

1127
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,310
Look at this volume. Non-existent
volume. All right. So, unless they do

1128
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:36,320
volume. All right. So, unless they do
 

1129
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,310
volume. All right. So, unless they do
one of these, if they close that gap,

1130
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,320
one of these, if they close that gap,
 

1131
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,230
one of these, if they close that gap,
we're going to come all the way down.

1132
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,240
we're going to come all the way down.
 

1133
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,230
we're going to come all the way down.
All right. So, 192 is big, big level.

1134
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:42,240
All right. So, 192 is big, big level.
 

1135
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,990
All right. So, 192 is big, big level.
All right. Either they will fake it and

1136
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,000
All right. Either they will fake it and
 

1137
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,669
All right. Either they will fake it and
bid it back up or you will get a

1138
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:45,679
bid it back up or you will get a
 

1139
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,789
bid it back up or you will get a
complete snap from 192s probably all the

1140
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:48,799
complete snap from 192s probably all the
 

1141
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,870
complete snap from 192s probably all the
way back down to 26,100.

1142
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:52,880
way back down to 26,100.
 

1143
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,269
way back down to 26,100.
There's a 100 point snap under 92s if

1144
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:55,279
There's a 100 point snap under 92s if
 

1145
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:02,310
There's a 100 point snap under 92s if
they let it go.

1146
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:02,320

 

1147
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,070

a close trade and relaunch with an

1148
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,080
a close trade and relaunch with an
 

1149
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,669
a close trade and relaunch with an
update and it's working. That's good.

1150
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:05,679
update and it's working. That's good.
 

1151
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,510
update and it's working. That's good.
Well, I've tried a few times on uh

1152
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:09,520
Well, I've tried a few times on uh
 

1153
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,070
Well, I've tried a few times on uh
Ninja Trader. Got nothing. I'll try can

1154
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,080
Ninja Trader. Got nothing. I'll try can
 

1155
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,230
Ninja Trader. Got nothing. I'll try can
try again.

1156
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:14,240
try again.
 

1157
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,710
try again.
I can try again.

1158
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:20,720

 

1159
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,230

So, back to back test this level.

1160
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,240
So, back to back test this level.
 

1161
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,870
So, back to back test this level.
Sellers need to sell versus New York and

1162
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:24,880
Sellers need to sell versus New York and

Sellers need to sell versus New York and
point of control. And if they don't,

1164
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:26,159
point of control. And if they don't,
 

1165
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,669
point of control. And if they don't,
we'll go back into range. Like I said,

1166
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:27,679
we'll go back into range. Like I said,
 

1167
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,470
we'll go back into range. Like I said,
I'm not too worried about missing today.

1168
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:30,480
I'm not too worried about missing today.
 

1169
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,950
I'm not too worried about missing today.
If I'm going to miss a day, this is the

1170
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:32,960
If I'm going to miss a day, this is the
 

1171
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,110
If I'm going to miss a day, this is the
day to miss. You might all say, "Well,

1172
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,120
day to miss. You might all say, "Well,
 

1173
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,830
day to miss. You might all say, "Well,
there's going to be loads of

there's going to be loads of
 

1175
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,909
there's going to be loads of
opportunities later in FOMC." I wouldn't

1176
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:37,919
opportunities later in FOMC." I wouldn't
 

1177
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,710
opportunities later in FOMC." I wouldn't
be surprised if FOMC was a bit of a dud.

1178
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:40,720
be surprised if FOMC was a bit of a dud.
 

1179
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,909
be surprised if FOMC was a bit of a dud.
Earnings are what going to really

1180
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:41,919
Earnings are what going to really
 

1181
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:55,350
Earnings are what going to really
matter.

1182

1183
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:13,350

Just reboot. Get the data.

1184
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,360

 

1185
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,590

H. I have got some data. Is this live

1186

H. I have got some data. Is this live
 

1187
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,470
H. I have got some data. Is this live
though? 40.

1188
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
though? 40.
 

1189
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,149

Yes.
 

1191
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,389
Yes.
Frozen again.

Frozen again.
 

1193

Frozen again.
So, it's showing me what happened, but

1194
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:23,760
So, it's showing me what happened, but
 

1195
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,389
So, it's showing me what happened, but
I've got no chart moving. Yeah, it's not

1196
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:26,399
I've got no chart moving. Yeah, it's not
 

1197
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,750
I've got no chart moving. Yeah, it's not
worth the risk right now until it's

1198
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:27,760
worth the risk right now until it's
 

1199
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:37,830
worth the risk right now until it's
smooth.

1200

1201
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,149

Yeah, I've got I've got I can see. So,

1202
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:40,159
Yeah, I've got I've got I can see. So,
 

1203
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,149
Yeah, I've got I've got I can see. So,
I've got historical prints, but I've not

1204
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:42,159
I've got historical prints, but I've not
 

1205

I've got historical prints, but I've not
got anything moving. My charts are just

1209
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,149

Wish they were so I could help a little

1210
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:54,159
Wish they were so I could help a little
 

1211
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,909
Wish they were so I could help a little
bit more.

1212
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:55,919
bit more.
 

1213
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,590
bit more.
Try that one more time. Maybe.

1214
00:29:59,590 --> 00:29:59,600
Try that one more time. Maybe.
 

1215
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,549
Try that one more time. Maybe.
Okay. Reclaim value. So, same story

1216
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:02,559
Okay. Reclaim value. So, same story
 

1217
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,630
Okay. Reclaim value. So, same story
again. If they hold this, so we hit that

1218
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:04,640
again. If they hold this, so we hit that
 

1219
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,630
again. If they hold this, so we hit that
first node. If they hold this now, if

1220
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:06,640
first node. If they hold this now, if
 

1221
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,310
first node. If they hold this now, if
they are able to hold this and get

1222
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,320
they are able to hold this and get
 

1223
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,389
they are able to hold this and get
acceptance over here, back to this. All

1224
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:10,399
acceptance over here, back to this. All
 

1225
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,230
acceptance over here, back to this. All
right. This is the rotation. This is why

1226
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,240
right. This is the rotation. This is why
 

1227
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,990
right. This is the rotation. This is why
I'm like less fussed. We need to build

1228
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm like less fussed. We need to build
 

1229
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,470
I'm like less fussed. We need to build
out liquidity one way or another.

1230
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:18,480

 

1231
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,389

They gave a fade into that first level.

1232
00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:20,399
They gave a fade into that first level.
 

1233
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,870
They gave a fade into that first level.
TP1 hit and it did it straight back up.

Fun and games.

1246
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:47,919

 

1247
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,710

fun and games.

1248
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:52,720

 

1249
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,350

VIX stuck in a range as well. So, it

1250
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,360
VIX stuck in a range as well. So, it
 

1251
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,310
VIX stuck in a range as well. So, it
keeps finding bids down into those uh

1252
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,320
keeps finding bids down into those uh
 

1253
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,029
keeps finding bids down into those uh
1637s. That uh pivot really is down

1254
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:01,039
1637s. That uh pivot really is down
 

1255
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,950
1637s. That uh pivot really is down
towards 25s if it wants to come down

1256
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:02,960
towards 25s if it wants to come down
 

1257
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,470
towards 25s if it wants to come down
there. Same one yesterday, right? We

1258
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:04,480
there. Same one yesterday, right? We
 

1259
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,830
there. Same one yesterday, right? We
couldn't get above it yesterday. It had

1260
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:05,840
couldn't get above it yesterday. It had
 

1261
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:18,470
couldn't get above it yesterday. It had
numerous attempts. Same pivot.

1262
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:18,480

00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:26,880

 

1267
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,789

You've never seen candlesticks like like

1268
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:28,799
You've never seen candlesticks like like
 

1269
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:34,470
You've never seen candlesticks like like
that. Like what?

1270
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:34,480

 

1271
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,149

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We know, Mr. Slim.

1272
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:36,159
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We know, Mr. Slim.
 

1273
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,430
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We know, Mr. Slim.
Yeah. They're all down. We're just

1274
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:37,440
Yeah. They're all down. We're just
 

1275
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,509
Yeah. They're all down. We're just
testing to see if uh they're coming back

1276
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:39,519
testing to see if uh they're coming back
 

1277
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,029
testing to see if uh they're coming back
on. Some people saying they're able to

1278
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:41,039
on. Some people saying they're able to
 

1279
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,710
on. Some people saying they're able to
trade. I'm not able to trade. Can't I've

1280
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:42,720
trade. I'm not able to trade. Can't I've
 

1281
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,070
trade. I'm not able to trade. Can't I've
got no nothing. I got another nutter.

1282
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,080
got no nothing. I got another nutter.
 

1283
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,590
got no nothing. I got another nutter.
So, my footprint's stuck. So, I can't

1284
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:47,600
So, my footprint's stuck. So, I can't
 

1285
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,990
So, my footprint's stuck. So, I can't
really help too much. Okay, squeeze is

1286
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,000
really help too much. Okay, squeeze is
 

1287
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,230
really help too much. Okay, squeeze is
on now. Back to 310s. Then, if they're

1288
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:52,240
on now. Back to 310s. Then, if they're
 

1289
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,070
on now. Back to 310s. Then, if they're
going to test overnight of control,

1290
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,080
going to test overnight of control,
 

1291
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,669
going to test overnight of control,
right, so they dipped and held uh the uh

1292
00:31:59,669 --> 00:31:59,679
right, so they dipped and held uh the uh
 

1293
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,750
right, so they dipped and held uh the uh
Asia session, that node that we talked

1294
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
Asia session, that node that we talked
 

1295
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,950
Asia session, that node that we talked
about into the 220s, right? They held

1296
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:04,960
about into the 220s, right? They held
 

1297
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,870
about into the 220s, right? They held
220s and now they're trying to get

1298
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:06,880
220s and now they're trying to get
 

1299
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,950
220s and now they're trying to get
acceptance back up.

1300
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:08,960
acceptance back up.
 

1301
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,630
acceptance back up.
So if we just think about this zoomed

1302
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:10,640
So if we just think about this zoomed
 

1303
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,149
So if we just think about this zoomed
out, right? They held this 220. This

1304
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:14,159
out, right? They held this 220. This
 

1305
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,310
out, right? They held this 220. This
here is what we were looking at. That's

1306
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:16,320
here is what we were looking at. That's
 

1307
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,389
here is what we were looking at. That's
why it was TP1. If you took the short,

1308
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:18,399
why it was TP1. If you took the short,
 

1309
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,870
why it was TP1. If you took the short,
no acceptance reclaim. They're now

1310
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:20,880
no acceptance reclaim. They're now
 

1311
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,950
no acceptance reclaim. They're now
trying to get acceptance over current

1312
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:22,960
trying to get acceptance over current
 

1313
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,110
trying to get acceptance over current
point control back to overnight point

1314
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,120
point control back to overnight point
 

1315
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,430
point control back to overnight point
control. And this is the danger, right?

1316
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:27,440
control. And this is the danger, right?
 

1317
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,509
control. And this is the danger, right?
This is the danger to go higher. I would

1318
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:29,519
This is the danger to go higher. I would
 

1319
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,190
This is the danger to go higher. I would
rather they built this out down here.

1320
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:31,200
rather they built this out down here.
 

1321
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,509
rather they built this out down here.
Right? I would rather they offer this.

1322
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:33,519
Right? I would rather they offer this.
 

1323
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,669
Right? I would rather they offer this.
This is a much safer trade where I'm

1324
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:35,679
This is a much safer trade where I'm
 

1325
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,470
This is a much safer trade where I'm
buying closer towards fair value rather

1326
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:38,480
buying closer towards fair value rather
 

1327
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,669
buying closer towards fair value rather
than deep into premium.

1328
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:41,679
than deep into premium.
 

1329
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,630
than deep into premium.
Deep into premium right now. We're right

1330
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:44,640
Deep into premium right now. We're right
 

1331
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,470
Deep into premium right now. We're right
at that top daily ballinger band as

at that top daily ballinger band as
 

1333

at that top daily ballinger band as
well. We are running out of room to do

00:32:47,919 --> 00:33:02,470
well. We are running out of room to do
anything.

1359
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,110

All right. So, the question is, can they

1360
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,120
All right. So, the question is, can they
 

1361
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,230
All right. So, the question is, can they
get up into these 310s?

1362
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:30,240
get up into these 310s?
 

1363
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,350
get up into these 310s?
V-shaped recovery. No, no dip back down

1364
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:33,360
V-shaped recovery. No, no dip back down
 

1365
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,509
V-shaped recovery. No, no dip back down
to uh confirm it's going to hold 60s

1366
00:33:35,509 --> 00:33:35,519
to uh confirm it's going to hold 60s
 

1367
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,750
to uh confirm it's going to hold 60s
yet. So,

1368
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:37,760
yet. So,
 

1369
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,830
yet. So,
you'd want to really see something like

1370
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:39,840
you'd want to really see something like
 

1371
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,509
you'd want to really see something like
this if it's really going to get going.

1372
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:41,519
this if it's really going to get going.
 

1373

we're going to come up for this now

1400
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:16,879
we're going to come up for this now
 

1401
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,310
we're going to come up for this now
right which is why I keep saying if

1402
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:18,320
right which is why I keep saying if
 

1403
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,470
right which is why I keep saying if
you're long your first TP is 310 Then

1404
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:24,480

 

1405
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,069

not too far away. Where did we get to

1406
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:26,079
not too far away. Where did we get to
 

1407
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:31,510
not too far away. Where did we get to
there? Coming up towards the 300s.

1408
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:31,520

 

1409
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,510

Unrecognizable trade. Yeah, I've g I've

1410
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:33,520
Unrecognizable trade. Yeah, I've g I've
 

1411
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,950
Unrecognizable trade. Yeah, I've g I've
literally given up. I'm not even looking

1412
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:34,960
literally given up. I'm not even looking
 

1413
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,230
literally given up. I'm not even looking
I'm not even looking at it. It's

1414
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,240
I'm not even looking at it. It's
 

1415
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,149
I'm not even looking at it. It's
completely pointless at this point. All

1416
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:38,159
completely pointless at this point. All
 

1417
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,710
completely pointless at this point. All
right, so you're coming towards this TP.

1418
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:40,720
right, so you're coming towards this TP.
 

1419
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,069
right, so you're coming towards this TP.
Let's have a look at liquidity on the

1420
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:42,079
Let's have a look at liquidity on the
 

1421
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,750
Let's have a look at liquidity on the
book.

1422
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:43,760
book.
 

1423
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,069
book.
Yeah, you've got some guys here. 300

1424
00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:46,079
Yeah, you've got some guys here. 300
 

1425
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,869
Yeah, you've got some guys here. 300
310s, 325s, 350. It's all possible. So

1426
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:48,879
310s, 325s, 350. It's all possible. So
 

1427
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,310
310s, 325s, 350. It's all possible. So
once you get acceptance through this,

1428
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:50,320
once you get acceptance through this,
 

1429
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,149
once you get acceptance through this,
this is a big level to take some profit.

1430
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:52,159
this is a big level to take some profit.
 

1431
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,750
this is a big level to take some profit.
If you did get long, this is a big level

1432
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:53,760
If you did get long, this is a big level
 

1433
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,149
If you did get long, this is a big level
to be taken some profit off. Once we get

1434
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:56,159
to be taken some profit off. Once we get
 

1435
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,630
to be taken some profit off. Once we get
through that, you're looking for 325s,

1436
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:58,640
through that, you're looking for 325s,
 

1437
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,190
through that, you're looking for 325s,
which is overnight value area high, and

1438
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,200
which is overnight value area high, and
 

1439
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,790
which is overnight value area high, and
then uh 350s, which is the overnight

1440
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:04,800
then uh 350s, which is the overnight
 

1441
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,109
then uh 350s, which is the overnight
high. Those are the levels to the

1442
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:07,119
high. Those are the levels to the
 

1443
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,190
high. Those are the levels to the
upside.

1444
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:09,200
upside.
 

1445
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,030
upside.
Hopefully that helps, folks. I'm sorry

1446
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,040
Hopefully that helps, folks. I'm sorry
 

1447
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,109
Hopefully that helps, folks. I'm sorry
I'm not trading live with you today.

1448
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:13,119
I'm not trading live with you today.
 

1449
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,990
I'm not trading live with you today.
There is nothing I can do about it.

1450
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,000
There is nothing I can do about it.
 

1451
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,270
There is nothing I can do about it.
What is the range volume on the left? On

1452
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:19,280
What is the range volume on the left? On
 

1453
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,750
What is the range volume on the left? On
the left, it's uh the overnight. It's

1454
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:21,760
the left, it's uh the overnight. It's
 

1455
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,790
the left, it's uh the overnight. It's
the volume from overnight.

1456
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:26,800

 

1457
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,030

I very rarely put that on, but uh we had

1458
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,040
I very rarely put that on, but uh we had
 

1459
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,030
I very rarely put that on, but uh we had
a very big gap up today. So, it became

1460
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,040
a very big gap up today. So, it became
 

1461
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,950
a very big gap up today. So, it became
important to know where people were

1462
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:32,960
important to know where people were
 

1463
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,310
important to know where people were
trading, where they were positioned

1464
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:34,320
trading, where they were positioned
 

1465
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,990
trading, where they were positioned
overnight.

1466
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:40,000

 

1467
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,190

S&P. Yeah. 70,000 right now. I see it.

1468
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,200
S&P. Yeah. 70,000 right now. I see it.
 

1469
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,670
S&P. Yeah. 70,000 right now. I see it.
I see it.

1470
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:47,680
I see it.
 

1471
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,510
I see it.
Spy trying to break out to get up

1472
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:49,520
Spy trying to break out to get up
 

1473
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,470
Spy trying to break out to get up
towards that 700 probably.

1474
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:54,480

 

1475
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,069

But the best I can do is call the trades

1476
00:35:56,069 --> 00:35:56,079
But the best I can do is call the trades
 

1477
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,510
But the best I can do is call the trades
for you today and try and teach you. I

1478
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:57,520
for you today and try and teach you. I
 

1479
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,270
for you today and try and teach you. I
will do my best to make sure you guys

1480
00:35:59,270 --> 00:35:59,280
will do my best to make sure you guys
 

1481
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,390
will do my best to make sure you guys
who can trade make some money today even

1482
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:02,400
who can trade make some money today even
 

1483
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,310
who can trade make some money today even
without me. So I'll sit here even

1484
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:04,320
without me. So I'll sit here even
 

1485
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,829
without me. So I'll sit here even
without me. I'll try my best to help

1486
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:05,839
without me. I'll try my best to help
 

1487
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,910
without me. I'll try my best to help
you. Right. So developing a little bit

1488
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:07,920
you. Right. So developing a little bit
 

1489
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,910
you. Right. So developing a little bit
of a node here now. See bulls will want

1490
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:09,920
of a node here now. See bulls will want
 

1491
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,190
of a node here now. See bulls will want
to hold this here into 80s.

1492
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,200
to hold this here into 80s.
 

1493
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,990
to hold this here into 80s.
Right. this right here,

1494
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,000

 

1495
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,589

edge of current value. Balls will want

1496
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:19,599
edge of current value. Balls will want
 

1497
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,349
edge of current value. Balls will want
dips to hold versus that. If they lose

1498
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:21,359
dips to hold versus that. If they lose
 

1499
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,310
dips to hold versus that. If they lose
that, they're going to come straight

1500
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:22,320
that, they're going to come straight
 

1501
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,150
that, they're going to come straight
back down to the midpoint, which will

1502
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,160
back down to the midpoint, which will
 

1503
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,829
back down to the midpoint, which will
not be ideal. So, if balls are going to

1504
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:25,839
not be ideal. So, if balls are going to
 

1505
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,390
not be ideal. So, if balls are going to
complete rotation, they would want this

1506
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:28,400
complete rotation, they would want this
 

1507
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,349
complete rotation, they would want this
to hold and to rip this, right? Or like

1508
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:31,359
to hold and to rip this, right? Or like
 

1509
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,109
to hold and to rip this, right? Or like
something like this. Otherwise, they're

1510
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:33,119
something like this. Otherwise, they're
 

1511
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,710
something like this. Otherwise, they're
coming down into this point of control,

1512
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:34,720
coming down into this point of control,
 

1513
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,310
coming down into this point of control,
which would not be very nice. It's

1514
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:36,320
which would not be very nice. It's
 

1515
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,910
which would not be very nice. It's
probably near the midpoint. If you think

1516
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:37,920
probably near the midpoint. If you think
 

1517
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,190
probably near the midpoint. If you think
of one R one R, it's not a very not a

1518
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:41,200
of one R one R, it's not a very not a
 

1519
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,829
of one R one R, it's not a very not a
very nice session.

1520
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:43,839
very nice session.
 

1521
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,589
very nice session.
So back to mid, back to point of

1522
00:36:45,589 --> 00:36:45,599
So back to mid, back to point of
 

1523
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,470
So back to mid, back to point of
control. Same thing can work here. The

1524
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:48,480
control. Same thing can work here. The
 

1525
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,990
control. Same thing can work here. The
moment we haven't finished a rotation

1526
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:50,000
moment we haven't finished a rotation
 

1527
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,750
moment we haven't finished a rotation
either side. So we haven't completed

1528
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:51,760
either side. So we haven't completed
 

1529
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,829
either side. So we haven't completed
this rotation to back test. Oh gosh. To

1530
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:55,839
this rotation to back test. Oh gosh. To
 

1531
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,790
this rotation to back test. Oh gosh. To
back test and we haven't completed this

1532
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:58,800
back test and we haven't completed this
 

1533
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,710
back test and we haven't completed this
rotation to back test this. So we're

1534
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:00,720
rotation to back test this. So we're
 

1535
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,510
rotation to back test this. So we're
just building out, which is what we've

1536
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:03,520
just building out, which is what we've
 

1537
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,430
just building out, which is what we've
pretty much done all night long, right?

1538
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:05,440
pretty much done all night long, right?
 

1539
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,870
pretty much done all night long, right?
We're building out versus here.

1540
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:10,880

 

1541
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,150

So, I'm saying if you're going to miss a

1542
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:12,160
So, I'm saying if you're going to miss a
 

1543
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,910
So, I'm saying if you're going to miss a
day's trading, today is not a bad day to

1544
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:13,920
day's trading, today is not a bad day to
 

1545
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:21,430
day's trading, today is not a bad day to
miss, folks.

1546
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:21,440

 

1547
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,510

Trade event users can actually trade on

1548
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:23,520
Trade event users can actually trade on

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,990
Trade event users can actually trade on
Trading View. How? If there's no data,

1550
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,000
Trading View. How? If there's no data,
 

1551
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,430
Trading View. How? If there's no data,
how how can they do that?

1552
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:29,440
how how can they do that?
 

1553
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,510
how how can they do that?
There's there's no data, I don't think.

1554
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:31,520
There's there's no data, I don't think.
 

1555
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:39,349
There's there's no data, I don't think.
I don't think they'd be able to execute

1556
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:39,359

 

1557
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,109

the point control from alltime high is

1558
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:41,119
the point control from alltime high is
 

1559
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,030
the point control from alltime high is
299. Is that relevant from the week of

1560
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,040
299. Is that relevant from the week of
 

1561
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,870
299. Is that relevant from the week of
alltime high or from alltime high to

1562
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:44,880
alltime high or from alltime high to
 

1563
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,790
alltime high or from alltime high to
current price? I mean it's all relevant.

1564
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:46,800
current price? I mean it's all relevant.
 

1565
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,550
current price? I mean it's all relevant.
Yes, absolutely Indie. Absolutely. It's

1566
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:50,560
Yes, absolutely Indie. Absolutely. It's
 

1567
00:37:50,560 --> 00:38:01,270
Yes, absolutely Indie. Absolutely. It's
all relevant.

1568
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:01,280

 

1569
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,790

If you pay for data on trading view,

1570
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:02,800
If you pay for data on trading view,
 

1571
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,310
If you pay for data on trading view,
well, I pay for data on trading view,

1572
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,320
well, I pay for data on trading view,
 

1573
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,150
well, I pay for data on trading view,
but I still don't understand how you

1574
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:06,160
but I still don't understand how you
 

1575
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,470
but I still don't understand how you
could how you could do that because you

1576
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:08,480
could how you could do that because you
 

1577
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,550
could how you could do that because you
would need to execute

1578
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:10,560
would need to execute
 

1579
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,150
would need to execute
uh via logging into trade of eight and

1580
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:12,160
uh via logging into trade of eight and
 

1581
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,750
uh via logging into trade of eight and
trade of eight data is down and it will

1582
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:13,760
trade of eight data is down and it will
 

1583
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,390
trade of eight data is down and it will
be pulling its own data. I don't know.

1584
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:16,400
be pulling its own data. I don't know.
 

1585
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,910
be pulling its own data. I don't know.
You guys do what you want. I would not

1586
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:17,920
You guys do what you want. I would not
 

1587
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,950
You guys do what you want. I would not
be touching it. If if look, if my

1588
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:20,960
be touching it. If if look, if my
 

1589
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,030
be touching it. If if look, if my
broker's down, I don't trade. If a data

1590
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,040
broker's down, I don't trade. If a data
 

1591
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,870
broker's down, I don't trade. If a data
provider is down, I don't trade. Right?

1592
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:24,880
provider is down, I don't trade. Right?
 

1593
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,349
provider is down, I don't trade. Right?
This is a job. This isn't a joke. Don't

1594
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:27,359
This is a job. This isn't a joke. Don't

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,910
This is a job. This isn't a joke. Don't
be like doing something and hoping,

1596
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:29,920
be like doing something and hoping,
 

1597
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,310
be like doing something and hoping,
right? Just don't do it. It's It's

1598
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:32,320
right? Just don't do it. It's It's
 

1599
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,829
right? Just don't do it. It's It's
seriously It's not worth it. It's one

1600
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:33,839
seriously It's not worth it. It's one
 

1601
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,109
seriously It's not worth it. It's one
day of your whole trading career.

1602
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:37,119
day of your whole trading career.
 

1603
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,109
day of your whole trading career.
It's just not worth it. In my opinion,

1604
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:39,119
It's just not worth it. In my opinion,
 

1605
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,150
It's just not worth it. In my opinion,
you guys do what you want. In my

1606
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,160
you guys do what you want. In my
 

1607
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,190
you guys do what you want. In my
opinion, I wouldn't be doing it. I won't

1608
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:43,200
opinion, I wouldn't be doing it. I won't
 

1609
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,790
opinion, I wouldn't be doing it. I won't
play I wouldn't be playing, you know,

1610
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:44,800
play I wouldn't be playing, you know,
 

1611
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,069
play I wouldn't be playing, you know,
American football without putting my

1612
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:46,079
American football without putting my
 

1613
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:52,150
American football without putting my
pads on. It's the same thing.

1614
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,160

 

1615
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,910

All right. We need everything working.

1616
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:55,920
All right. We need everything working.
 

1617
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,430
All right. We need everything working.
All right, VIX starting to spike here,

1618
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:57,440
All right, VIX starting to spike here,
 

1619
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,790
All right, VIX starting to spike here,
folks. Just be careful. Starting to

1620
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:58,800
folks. Just be careful. Starting to
 

1621
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,349
folks. Just be careful. Starting to
break out here on VIX.

1622
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:01,359
break out here on VIX.
 

1623
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,150
break out here on VIX.
So, next pivot for VIX is going to be up

1624
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,160
So, next pivot for VIX is going to be up
 

1625
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,470
So, next pivot for VIX is going to be up
towards 1670s. So, it's getting going.

1626
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:06,480
towards 1670s. So, it's getting going.
 

1627
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,150
towards 1670s. So, it's getting going.
So, it might add weakness into this

1628
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,160
So, it might add weakness into this
 

1629
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,750
So, it might add weakness into this
market if it can really drive. If it

1630
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:09,760
market if it can really drive. If it
 

1631
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,390
market if it can really drive. If it
finds acceptance through that, then uh

1632
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:12,400
finds acceptance through that, then uh
 

1633
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,109
finds acceptance through that, then uh
maybe. But again, here's your orb. We're

1634
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:15,119
maybe. But again, here's your orb. We're
 

1635
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,150
maybe. But again, here's your orb. We're
just boxed in.

1636
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,160

 

1637
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,910

Almost completed the rotation. Didn't

1638
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:21,920
Almost completed the rotation. Didn't
 

1639
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,670
Almost completed the rotation. Didn't
quite make it. We're just boxed in right

1640
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:23,680
quite make it. We're just boxed in right
 

1641
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,550
quite make it. We're just boxed in right
now doing nothing.

1642
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:26,560
now doing nothing.
 

1643
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,710
now doing nothing.
It's very possible that we do this for a

1644
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:28,720
It's very possible that we do this for a
 

1645
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,950
It's very possible that we do this for a
long time and there something shifts

1646
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:30,960
long time and there something shifts
 

1647
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,270
long time and there something shifts
before we get to FMC.

1648
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:37,280

 

1649
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,950

Why do my candles look different? Um,

1650
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:38,960
Why do my candles look different? Um,
 

1651
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,190
Why do my candles look different? Um,
they're based on momentum. At the

1652
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:41,200
they're based on momentum. At the
 

1653
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,430
they're based on momentum. At the
moment, this is not a momentum setup,

1654
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:43,440
moment, this is not a momentum setup,
 

1655
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,829
moment, this is not a momentum setup,
right? Everything's flat.

1656
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:45,839
right? Everything's flat.
 

1657
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,430
right? Everything's flat.
So, you got print prints above and

1658
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:47,440
So, you got print prints above and
 

1659
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,150
So, you got print prints above and
prints below, right?

1660
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,160
prints below, right?
 

1661
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,310
prints below, right?
What these are great for are when we're

1662
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:52,320
What these are great for are when we're
 

1663
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,030
What these are great for are when we're
in breakout trends

1664
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,040
in breakout trends
 

1665
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,870
in breakout trends
like here,

1666
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:56,880
like here,
 

1667
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,430
like here,
right? All the time with blue. White is

1668
00:39:59,430 --> 00:39:59,440
right? All the time with blue. White is
 

1669
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,950
right? All the time with blue. White is
an inside bar. So all the time we're

1670
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:00,960
an inside bar. So all the time we're
 

1671
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,550
an inside bar. So all the time we're
blue or white, we're just building

1672
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:02,560
blue or white, we're just building
 

1673
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,710
blue or white, we're just building
upside. It's it's telling you not to

1674
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:04,720
upside. It's it's telling you not to
 

1675
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,270
upside. It's it's telling you not to
fade it, right? So it's built to stop

1676
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:07,280
fade it, right? So it's built to stop
 

1677
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,030
fade it, right? So it's built to stop
you fading it. Again, the day before

1678
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,040
you fading it. Again, the day before
 

1679
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,710
you fading it. Again, the day before
don't try and short when we're just

1680
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:10,720
don't try and short when we're just
 

1681
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,510
don't try and short when we're just
constantly green, right? But when we go

1682
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:13,520
constantly green, right? But when we go
 

1683
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,430
constantly green, right? But when we go
red,

1684
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:15,440
red,
 

1685
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,670
red,
right, there's chances of fades, right?

1686
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:17,680
right, there's chances of fades, right?
 

1687
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:25,030
right, there's chances of fades, right?
So they're just based on the momentum

1688
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,040

 

1689
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,710

basically to stop you picking tops and

1690
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:26,720
basically to stop you picking tops and
 

1691
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,030
basically to stop you picking tops and
bottoms. Bet everything that I built in

1692
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,040
bottoms. Bet everything that I built in
 

1693
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,790
bottoms. Bet everything that I built in
the system is basically to stop you

1694
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:30,800
the system is basically to stop you
 

1695
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,990
the system is basically to stop you
trying to pick a top and bottom

1696
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,000
trying to pick a top and bottom
 

1697
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,069
trying to pick a top and bottom
on a trend day.

1698
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:38,079

 

1699
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,069

Okay, my Ninja Trader has just woken up.

1700
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:42,079
Okay, my Ninja Trader has just woken up.

growing fast. It's cuz people are
 

1755
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,150
growing fast. It's cuz people are
starting to realize that you actually

1756
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:24,160
starting to realize that you actually
 

1757
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,550
starting to realize that you actually
learn on this stream.

1765
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,790
they find acceptance through this? If
so, 310 is the target and then

1766
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:36,800
so, 310 is the target and then
 

1767

so, 310 is the target and then
acceptance over that. You're looking for

acceptance over that. You're looking for
 

1769
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,550
acceptance over that. You're looking for
25s and 50s. Basically,

1770
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:42,560
25s and 50s. Basically,

we're still in that breakout, but uh it
gets more and more risky the higher and

1856
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:41,680
gets more and more risky the higher and
 

1857
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,829
gets more and more risky the higher and
higher we go because we're not pulling

1858
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:43,839
higher we go because we're not pulling
 

1859
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,670
higher we go because we're not pulling
back. We need to be buying around the

1860
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:45,680
back. We need to be buying around the
 

1861
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,270
back. We need to be buying around the
26,100. Somewhere around there, even

1862
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:49,280
26,100. Somewhere around there, even
 

1863
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,470
26,100. Somewhere around there, even
26,000 is a reasonable area to buy off

1864
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:52,480
26,000 is a reasonable area to buy off
 

1865
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,710
26,000 is a reasonable area to buy off
up here. We're about 300 points too high

1866
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:54,720
up here. We're about 300 points too high

We've broken out from here, right? We

1906
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:25,440
We've broken out from here, right? We
 

1907
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,670
We've broken out from here, right? We
haven't pulled back to make sure that

1908
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:27,680
haven't pulled back to make sure that
 

1909
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,430
haven't pulled back to make sure that
this base is firm. All right. Once we

1910
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:29,440
this base is firm. All right. Once we
 

1911
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,430
this base is firm. All right. Once we
pull back and hold this, this would be a

1912
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:31,440
pull back and hold this, this would be a
 

1913
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,510
pull back and hold this, this would be a
breakout retest. Then we can think about

1914
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:33,520
breakout retest. Then we can think about
 

1915
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,150
breakout retest. Then we can think about
the drive. Remember this week we were

1916
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:36,160
the drive. Remember this week we were
 

1917

00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,390
the dip, right? Think about where we
were buying this week. We were buying

1924
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:44,400

1925

That's what I want to do. That's how I

2008
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:10,160
That's what I want to do. That's how I
 

2009
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,390
That's what I want to do. That's how I
can manage my risk. Right? Because

2010
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:12,400
can manage my risk. Right? Because
 

2011
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,790
can manage my risk. Right? Because
that's our job. Right? So this up here,

2012
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:14,800
that's our job. Right? So this up here,
 

2013
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,670
that's our job. Right? So this up here,
very risky trade. This down here, much

2014
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:17,680
very risky trade. This down here, much
 

2015
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,349
very risky trade. This down here, much
better. We've got a base, right? So

2016
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:19,359
better. We've got a base, right? So
 

2017
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,030
better. We've got a base, right? So
anyone who didn't stop out, anyone who

2018
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:21,040
anyone who didn't stop out, anyone who
 

2019
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,710
anyone who didn't stop out, anyone who
was a belligerent short and didn't stop

2020
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:22,720
was a belligerent short and didn't stop
 

2021
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,950
was a belligerent short and didn't stop
out when we return in you best believe

2022
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:24,960
out when we return in you best believe
 

2023
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,309
out when we return in you best believe
they will stop out and they will become

2024
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:26,319
they will stop out and they will become
 

2025
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,549
they will stop out and they will become
market buyers. And that can happen. If

2026
00:48:28,549 --> 00:48:28,559
market buyers. And that can happen. If
 

2027
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,630
market buyers. And that can happen. If
we fail this, all right, if we fail to

2028
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:30,640
we fail this, all right, if we fail to
 

2029
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,790
we fail this, all right, if we fail to
hold this and we do this, we want to be

2030
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:32,800
hold this and we do this, we want to be
 

2031
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,630
hold this and we do this, we want to be
very careful, right? If this is a look

2032
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:34,640
very careful, right? If this is a look
 

2033
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,270
very careful, right? If this is a look
above and fail with the QQQs and ES

2034
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:37,280
above and fail with the QQQs and ES
 

2035
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,870
above and fail with the QQQs and ES
taking out alltime highs, look above and

2036
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:38,880
taking out alltime highs, look above and
 

2037
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,430
taking out alltime highs, look above and
fail. We want to be very careful for

2038
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:41,440
fail. We want to be very careful for
 

2039
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,430
fail. We want to be very careful for
this move here, right? So this is why

2040
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:43,440
this move here, right? So this is why
 

2041
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,150
this move here, right? So this is why
I'm waiting. I'm waiting.

2042
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:46,160
I'm waiting. I'm waiting.
 

2043
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,309
I'm waiting. I'm waiting.
I don't mind missing, you know, a little

2044
00:48:48,309 --> 00:48:48,319
I don't mind missing, you know, a little
 

2045
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:49,750
I don't mind missing, you know, a little
bit of action every now and again. Even

2046
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:49,760
bit of action every now and again. Even
 

2047
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,870
bit of action every now and again. Even
if we look at the hourlies,

2048
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:52,880
if we look at the hourlies,
 

2049
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,790
if we look at the hourlies,
where's my houries? Right? If we think

2050
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:54,800
where's my houries? Right? If we think
 

2051
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,750
where's my houries? Right? If we think
about this week, this was the Sunday

2052
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:57,760
about this week, this was the Sunday
 

2053
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,910
about this week, this was the Sunday
open. All right, think about this from

2054
00:48:59,910 --> 00:48:59,920
open. All right, think about this from
 

2055
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,549
open. All right, think about this from
Sunday open. Right, we are

2056
00:49:04,549 --> 00:49:04,559
Sunday open. Right, we are
 

2057
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,549
Sunday open. Right, we are
almost 4% up and a,000 points up. And

2058
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:08,559
almost 4% up and a,000 points up. And
 

2059
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,870
almost 4% up and a,000 points up. And
this trend is, I would say, pretty

2060
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:10,880
this trend is, I would say, pretty
 

2061
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,870
this trend is, I would say, pretty
bloody steep. All right, that's pretty

2062
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:12,880
bloody steep. All right, that's pretty
 

2063
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,109
bloody steep. All right, that's pretty
steep, isn't it? Right? This is not

2064
00:49:15,109 --> 00:49:15,119
steep, isn't it? Right? This is not
 

2065
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,750
steep, isn't it? Right? This is not
pulled back. Right? A healthy trend will

2066
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:17,760
pulled back. Right? A healthy trend will
 

2067
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,309
pulled back. Right? A healthy trend will
offer this move here which might come

2068
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:20,319
offer this move here which might come
 

2069
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,349
offer this move here which might come
today would would offer this move here

2070
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:23,359
today would would offer this move here
 

2071
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,430
today would would offer this move here
back into the developing profile and

2072
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:25,440
back into the developing profile and
 

2073
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,190
back into the developing profile and
then we can move this somewhere like

2074
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:27,200
then we can move this somewhere like
 

2075
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,910
then we can move this somewhere like
this. Build out some liquidity reclaim

2076
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:29,920
this. Build out some liquidity reclaim
 

2077
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,750
this. Build out some liquidity reclaim
this and that offers a nice squeeze to

2078
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:31,760
this and that offers a nice squeeze to
 

2079
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,349
this and that offers a nice squeeze to
alltime highs at that point. Right? So

2080
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:33,359
alltime highs at that point. Right? So
 

2081
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,589
alltime highs at that point. Right? So
that's why hopefully that makes sense.

2082
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:35,599
that's why hopefully that makes sense.
 

2083
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,349
that's why hopefully that makes sense.
Right? Always ask yourself when you come

2084
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:37,359
Right? Always ask yourself when you come
 

2085
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,270
Right? Always ask yourself when you come
into the chart, what's the location?

2086
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:39,280
into the chart, what's the location?
 

2087
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,109
into the chart, what's the location?
What's the momentum? What am I looking

2088
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:41,119
What's the momentum? What am I looking
 

2089
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,270
What's the momentum? What am I looking
for? Where do I want to enter? Where is

2090
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:43,280
for? Where do I want to enter? Where is
 

2091
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:50,150
for? Where do I want to enter? Where is
an interesting location to enter?

2092
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:50,160

 

2093
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,589

Yeah, I'm having the same by the way,

2094
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:51,599
Yeah, I'm having the same by the way,
 

2095
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,910
Yeah, I'm having the same by the way,
folks. So, I'm my my Ninja Trader is now

2096
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:53,920
folks. So, I'm my my Ninja Trader is now
 

2097
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,430
folks. So, I'm my my Ninja Trader is now
down again. All right, so I can show

2098
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:55,440
down again. All right, so I can show
 

2099
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,230
down again. All right, so I can show
you. So, I will not be trading this.

2100
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:58,240
you. So, I will not be trading this.
 

2101
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,670
you. So, I will not be trading this.
I've made the decision. That's why I

2102
00:49:59,670 --> 00:49:59,680
I've made the decision. That's why I
 

2103
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,870
I've made the decision. That's why I
said I'm going to wait to see if it

2104
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:00,880
said I'm going to wait to see if it
 

2105
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,069
said I'm going to wait to see if it
matches up. You would have heard me say

2106
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:02,079
matches up. You would have heard me say
 

2107
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,309
matches up. You would have heard me say
that like five minutes ago. It is just

2108
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:04,319
that like five minutes ago. It is just
 

2109
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,150
that like five minutes ago. It is just
not worth it. And I am not going to blow

2110
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:06,160
not worth it. And I am not going to blow
 

2111
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,750
not worth it. And I am not going to blow
all my work because people uh can't sort

2112
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:09,760
all my work because people uh can't sort
 

2113
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,109
all my work because people uh can't sort
out their data centers properly or

2114
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:11,119
out their data centers properly or
 

2115
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,510
out their data centers properly or
whatever it is.

2116
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:13,520
whatever it is.
 

2117
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,030
whatever it is.
So, we can just keep those of you

2118
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:15,040
So, we can just keep those of you
 

2119
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,790
So, we can just keep those of you
trading, you guys can trade. I'll keep

2120
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:16,800
trading, you guys can trade. I'll keep
 

2121
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,309
trading, you guys can trade. I'll keep
calling levels and I'll keep teaching

2122
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:18,319
calling levels and I'll keep teaching
 

2123
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,390
calling levels and I'll keep teaching
you what I'm looking at. You can try and

2124
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:20,400
you what I'm looking at. You can try and
 

2125
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,430
you what I'm looking at. You can try and
understand.

2126
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:25,440

 

2127
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,270

Yes, two sigma is the two standard

2128
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:27,280
Yes, two sigma is the two standard
 

2129
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,950
Yes, two sigma is the two standard
deviation. So, a standard Ballinger band

2130
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:28,960
deviation. So, a standard Ballinger band
 

2131
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,710
deviation. So, a standard Ballinger band
on a daily, if you understand how

2132
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:30,720
on a daily, if you understand how
 

2133
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,109
on a daily, if you understand how
Ballinger bands work, your middle line,

2134
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:33,119
Ballinger bands work, your middle line,
 

2135
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,230
Ballinger bands work, your middle line,
a lot of people don't understand this,

2136
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:34,240
a lot of people don't understand this,
 

2137
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,230
a lot of people don't understand this,
your middle line, your middle line, your

2138
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:36,240
your middle line, your middle line, your
 

2139
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,589
your middle line, your middle line, your
mean on a Ballinger band is your 20day

2140
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:39,599
mean on a Ballinger band is your 20day
 

2141
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,470
mean on a Ballinger band is your 20day
SMA, right? Two standard deviations

2142
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:42,480
SMA, right? Two standard deviations
 

2143
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,390
SMA, right? Two standard deviations
above that is your top B ballinger band.

2144
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:44,400
above that is your top B ballinger band.
 

2145
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,390
above that is your top B ballinger band.
Two standard deviations below that is

2146
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:46,400
Two standard deviations below that is
 

2147
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,990
Two standard deviations below that is
your bottom Ballinger band. Why do I use

2148
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:48,000
your bottom Ballinger band. Why do I use
 

2149
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,589
your bottom Ballinger band. Why do I use
a five-day? How many trading days are

2150
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:49,599
a five-day? How many trading days are
 

2151
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,589
a five-day? How many trading days are
there in a week? Five. How many trading

2152
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:51,599
there in a week? Five. How many trading
 

2153
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,829
there in a week? Five. How many trading
days are there in a month? 20. So, I'm

2154
00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:53,839
days are there in a month? 20. So, I'm
 

2155
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:56,230
days are there in a month? 20. So, I'm
looking for what's my weekly bias versus

2156
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:56,240
looking for what's my weekly bias versus
 

2157
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,030
looking for what's my weekly bias versus
my monthly bias on a rolling time scale.

2158
00:50:59,030 --> 00:50:59,040
my monthly bias on a rolling time scale.
 

2159
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,910
my monthly bias on a rolling time scale.
That's why I use the five and the 20.

2160
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:01,920
That's why I use the five and the 20.
 

2161
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,109
That's why I use the five and the 20.
All right. So, hopefully that makes

2162
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:03,119
All right. So, hopefully that makes
 

2163
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,190
All right. So, hopefully that makes
sense. They like they're just they stop

2164
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:05,200
sense. They like they're just they stop
 

2165
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,270
sense. They like they're just they stop
you buying in bad locations. That's the

2166
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:07,280
you buying in bad locations. That's the
 

2167
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,630
you buying in bad locations. That's the
best way of me putting it. If we're up

2168
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:08,640
best way of me putting it. If we're up
 

2169
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,710
best way of me putting it. If we're up
at the top Ballinger band, you really

2170
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:10,720
at the top Ballinger band, you really
 

2171
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,470
at the top Ballinger band, you really
need to ask yourself, should I be buying

2172
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:12,480
need to ask yourself, should I be buying
 

2173
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,950
need to ask yourself, should I be buying
here? Answer is probably no.

2174
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:16,960
here? Answer is probably no.
 

2175
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,710
here? Answer is probably no.
Hey, Alex, I'm new here. Welcome. Thanks

2176
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:18,720
Hey, Alex, I'm new here. Welcome. Thanks
 

2177

Hey, Alex, I'm new here. Welcome. Thanks
for joining. Thanks for joining.

2178
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:30,160

 

2179
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,790

Is the uh Ballinger band equivalent to a

2180
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:32,800
Is the uh Ballinger band equivalent to a
 

2181
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,589
Is the uh Ballinger band equivalent to a
standard deviation? Yes. only versus the

2182
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:35,599
standard deviation? Yes. only versus the
 

2183
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,710
standard deviation? Yes. only versus the
20-day only not like a rolling

2184
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:38,720
20-day only not like a rolling
 

2185
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,470
20-day only not like a rolling
regression trend or standard deviation

2186
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:40,480
regression trend or standard deviation
 

2187
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,910
regression trend or standard deviation
that way which is how I used to trade

2188
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:41,920
that way which is how I used to trade
 

2189
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,829
that way which is how I used to trade
that was the first way I traded but

2190
00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:43,839
that was the first way I traded but
 

2191
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,510
that was the first way I traded but
those who have been with me since day

those who have been with me since day
 

2193
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,990
those who have been with me since day
dot will know that it's the first way I

2194
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:48,000
dot will know that it's the first way I
 

2195
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,910
dot will know that it's the first way I
used to trade back in uh 2019 and beyond

yeah not not based on uh like a

yeah not not based on uh like a

regression channel standard deviation
 

2201
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:02,710

but yes based on your 20-day SMA

I was in here the other day asking about

00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,510
I was in here the other day asking about
funded accounts, but I recently seen you

2220
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:29,520
funded accounts, but I recently seen you
 

2221
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,549
funded accounts, but I recently seen you
had Apex Coupon and I popped some evals

00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:32,559
had Apex Coupon and I popped some evals
 

2223
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,470
had Apex Coupon and I popped some evals
and appreciate you have been teaching me

2224
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:34,480
and appreciate you have been teaching me
 

2225

so much. You're welcome.
Yes, I for me personally, I only look at

2228
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:40,480
Yes, I for me personally, I only look at
 

2229
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,630
Yes, I for me personally, I only look at
Ballinger bands on the daily. I'm not

2230
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:42,640
Ballinger bands on the daily. I'm not
 

2231
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,510
Ballinger bands on the daily. I'm not
interested in them uh on lower time

2232
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:45,520
interested in them uh on lower time
 

2233
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,510
interested in them uh on lower time
frame charts. That's not again that is

2234
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:47,520
frame charts. That's not again that is
 

2235
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,270
frame charts. That's not again that is
not to say you can't use them, right?

2236
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:49,280
not to say you can't use them, right?
 

2237
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,670
not to say you can't use them, right?
Lots of people use them on like 15

2238
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:51,680
Lots of people use them on like 15
 

2239
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,910
Lots of people use them on like 15
minutes or hourly charts. For me, I

2240
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:53,920
minutes or hourly charts. For me, I
 

2241
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,349
minutes or hourly charts. For me, I
don't use them. I like them on the

2242
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:55,359
don't use them. I like them on the
 

2243
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,270
don't use them. I like them on the
daily. I like using them on the daily.

2244
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:57,280
daily. I like using them on the daily.
 

2245
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,270
daily. I like using them on the daily.
That's that's how I get my bias on the

2246
00:52:59,270 --> 00:52:59,280
That's that's how I get my bias on the
 

2247
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,589
That's that's how I get my bias on the
daily of like where I think what we need

2248
00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:01,599
daily of like where I think what we need
 

2249
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:07,990
daily of like where I think what we need
to do and what's possible.

2250
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:08,000

 

2251
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,109

I'm not I'm not Eba's brother. He's a

2252
00:53:11,109 --> 00:53:11,119
I'm not I'm not Eba's brother. He's a
 

2253
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:15,430
I'm not I'm not Eba's brother. He's a
bit of a legend though.

2254
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:15,440

 

2255
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,950

Good morning. Good morning. Good

2256
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:16,960
Good morning. Good morning. Good
 

2257
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,630
Good morning. Good morning. Good
morning.

2258
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:18,640
morning.
 

2259
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,349
morning.
How do you frame your trades? Uh top

2260
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:21,359
How do you frame your trades? Uh top
 

2261
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:25,510
How do you frame your trades? Uh top
down analysis. So daily daily down into

2262
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:25,520
down analysis. So daily daily down into
 

2263
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,950
down analysis. So daily daily down into
like hourlies into five and and one

2264
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:28,960
like hourlies into five and and one
 

2265
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,430
like hourlies into five and and one
minutes. And all I'm looking at is what

2266
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:31,440
minutes. And all I'm looking at is what
 

2267
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,950
minutes. And all I'm looking at is what
kind of condition. Remember the market

2268
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:32,960
kind of condition. Remember the market
 

2269
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,630
kind of condition. Remember the market
is only ever doing two things, right?

2270
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:34,640
is only ever doing two things, right?
 

2271
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,630
is only ever doing two things, right?
We're either building liquidity or we're

2272
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:36,640
We're either building liquidity or we're
 

2273
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,549
We're either building liquidity or we're
searching for liquidity. We're either in

2274
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:38,559
searching for liquidity. We're either in
 

2275
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,470
searching for liquidity. We're either in
fair value or we're searching for new

2276
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:40,480
fair value or we're searching for new
 

2277
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,150
fair value or we're searching for new
fair value. So we're either auctioning

2278
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,160
fair value. So we're either auctioning
 

2279
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,630
fair value. So we're either auctioning
up or we're in a range, right? So if we

2280
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:44,640
up or we're in a range, right? So if we
 

2281
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,510
up or we're in a range, right? So if we
think about the conditions of the market

2282
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:47,520
think about the conditions of the market
 

2283
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,270
think about the conditions of the market
and the market and normal market will

2284
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:49,280
and the market and normal market will
 

2285
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:55,589
and the market and normal market will
look something like this.

2286
00:53:55,589 --> 00:53:55,599

 

2287
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,750

Maybe we build some value out. We search

2288
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:57,760
Maybe we build some value out. We search
 

2289
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,109
Maybe we build some value out. We search
higher. We have one more search higher.

2290
00:53:59,109 --> 00:53:59,119
higher. We have one more search higher.
 

2291
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:00,470
higher. We have one more search higher.
And then they go nope. There's no value

2292
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:00,480
And then they go nope. There's no value
 

2293
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,910
And then they go nope. There's no value
there. Maybe we build out. We search

2294
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:01,920
there. Maybe we build out. We search
 

2295
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,349
there. Maybe we build out. We search
higher and they go no. Okay. That is a

2296
00:54:05,349 --> 00:54:05,359
higher and they go no. Okay. That is a
 

2297
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,270
higher and they go no. Okay. That is a
pretty standard looking market. All

2298
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:07,280
pretty standard looking market. All
 

2299
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,030
pretty standard looking market. All
right. So we need to understand what

2300
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:09,040
right. So we need to understand what
 

2301
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,109
right. So we need to understand what
condition we're in. If we are in a

2302
00:54:11,109 --> 00:54:11,119
condition we're in. If we are in a
 

2303
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,510
condition we're in. If we are in a
breakout at this point, right, then I'll

2304
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:13,520
breakout at this point, right, then I'll
 

2305
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,270
breakout at this point, right, then I'll
be looking for longs. The protrend at

2306
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:15,280
be looking for longs. The protrend at
 

2307
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,589
be looking for longs. The protrend at
this point is up,

2308
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:17,599
this point is up,
 

2309
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,190
this point is up,
right? This is how I decide what I'm

2310
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:19,200
right? This is how I decide what I'm
 

2311
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,109
right? This is how I decide what I'm
looking at. This is up, right? And if

2312
00:54:21,109 --> 00:54:21,119
looking at. This is up, right? And if
 

2313
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,109
looking at. This is up, right? And if
we're moving point control and value

2314
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:23,119
we're moving point control and value
 

2315
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,349
we're moving point control and value
higher, that's confirming that I'm

2316
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:25,359
higher, that's confirming that I'm
 

2317
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:26,710
higher, that's confirming that I'm
trying to trade upside. What else could

2318
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:26,720
trying to trade upside. What else could
 

2319
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,309
trying to trade upside. What else could
we think about? Like a P-shaped profile.

2320
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:28,319
we think about? Like a P-shaped profile.
 

2321
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,710
we think about? Like a P-shaped profile.
If we have a Pshaped profile in this

2322
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:30,720
If we have a Pshaped profile in this
 

2323
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,710
If we have a Pshaped profile in this
day, and it gives me the opportunity to

2324
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:32,720
day, and it gives me the opportunity to
 

2325
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,710
day, and it gives me the opportunity to
get long at like a value area low on

2326
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:34,720
get long at like a value area low on
 

2327
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,950
get long at like a value area low on
this pullback in here, right? If this is

2328
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:36,960
this pullback in here, right? If this is
 

2329
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,470
this pullback in here, right? If this is
a daily chart, then lower time frame,

2330
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:38,480
a daily chart, then lower time frame,
 

2331
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,750
a daily chart, then lower time frame,
what am I looking for? I'm going to look

2332
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:39,760
what am I looking for? I'm going to look
 

2333
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,030
what am I looking for? I'm going to look
for something that looks a little

2334
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:41,040
for something that looks a little
 

2335
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,030
for something that looks a little
something like this. All right, some

2336
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:43,040
something like this. All right, some
 

2337
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,030
something like this. All right, some
kind of trap down here to get long and

2338
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:45,040
kind of trap down here to get long and
 

2339
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,349
kind of trap down here to get long and
then I'm TP1 and see how far we can get

2340
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:47,359
then I'm TP1 and see how far we can get
 

2341
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:48,950
then I'm TP1 and see how far we can get
up. Right. And then we do the same thing

2342
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:48,960
up. Right. And then we do the same thing
 

2343
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,549
up. Right. And then we do the same thing
the next day. We're going to assume

2344
00:54:50,549 --> 00:54:50,559
the next day. We're going to assume
 

2345
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,470
the next day. We're going to assume
pullbacks hold. And when we fail to

2346
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:52,480
pullbacks hold. And when we fail to
 

2347
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,230
pullbacks hold. And when we fail to
break out and we do this, we are now in

2348
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:54,240
break out and we do this, we are now in
 

2349
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,150
break out and we do this, we are now in
a range. So in a range, I'm trading the

2350
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:56,160
a range. So in a range, I'm trading the
 

2351
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,870
a range. So in a range, I'm trading the
edges. So I'm fading this back inside.

2352
00:54:58,870 --> 00:54:58,880
edges. So I'm fading this back inside.
 

2353
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,910
edges. So I'm fading this back inside.
I'm buying dips back inside. Or if I'm

2354
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:01,920
I'm buying dips back inside. Or if I'm
 

2355
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,150
I'm buying dips back inside. Or if I'm
really honest with myself, I'm leaving

2356
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:04,160
really honest with myself, I'm leaving
 

2357
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,990
really honest with myself, I'm leaving
that alone, right? Because I hate

2358
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:06,000
that alone, right? Because I hate
 

2359
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,710
that alone, right? Because I hate
ranges. So, or I'm at least using small

2360
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:08,720
ranges. So, or I'm at least using small
 

2361
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,630
ranges. So, or I'm at least using small
size. And then once we break out of the

2362
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:10,640
size. And then once we break out of the
 

2363
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,150
size. And then once we break out of the
range and we hold, then I'm looking for

2364
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:12,160
range and we hold, then I'm looking for
 

2365
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,069
range and we hold, then I'm looking for
upside until we come to targets. Now,

2366
00:55:14,069 --> 00:55:14,079
upside until we come to targets. Now,
 

2367
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,150
upside until we come to targets. Now,
let's say this is a top ballinger band.

2368
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:16,160
let's say this is a top ballinger band.
 

2369
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,349
let's say this is a top ballinger band.
This is very similar to what we've had

2370
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:17,359
This is very similar to what we've had
 

2371
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:18,870
This is very similar to what we've had
recently. All right, we've broken out of

2372
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:18,880
recently. All right, we've broken out of
 

2373
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,630
recently. All right, we've broken out of
a range this week. We've come up to the

2374
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:20,640
a range this week. We've come up to the
 

2375
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,710
a range this week. We've come up to the
top Ballinger band. It might be that we

2376
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:22,720
top Ballinger band. It might be that we
 

2377
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,390
top Ballinger band. It might be that we
need to retest this level. Now, what I'd

2378
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:24,400
need to retest this level. Now, what I'd
 

2379
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,910
need to retest this level. Now, what I'd
be hoping for this week is actually the

2380
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:25,920
be hoping for this week is actually the
 

2381
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,430
be hoping for this week is actually the
continuation higher. If we don't get

2382
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:27,440
continuation higher. If we don't get
 

2383
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,349
continuation higher. If we don't get
that, this collapse is possible. So,

2384
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:29,359
that, this collapse is possible. So,
 

2385
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,549
that, this collapse is possible. So,
it's all about understanding what is the

2386
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:32,559
it's all about understanding what is the
 

2387
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,630
it's all about understanding what is the
higher time frame doing, right? what are

2388
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:34,640
higher time frame doing, right? what are
 

2389
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,190
higher time frame doing, right? what are
we doing higher time frame and then

2390
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:37,200
we doing higher time frame and then
 

2391
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,510
we doing higher time frame and then
moving down. That's why it's important

2392
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:39,520
moving down. That's why it's important
 

2393
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,990
moving down. That's why it's important
you guys join me from 9:15 Eastern time

2394
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:42,000
you guys join me from 9:15 Eastern time
 

2395
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,150
you guys join me from 9:15 Eastern time
because every day you will notice my

2396
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:44,160
because every day you will notice my
 

2397
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,109
because every day you will notice my
process is exactly the same. Every day

2398
00:55:47,109 --> 00:55:47,119
process is exactly the same. Every day
 

2399
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,270
process is exactly the same. Every day
we start on the daily and we move down

2400
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:49,280
we start on the daily and we move down
 

2401
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,510
we start on the daily and we move down
the time frames. We look if value has

2402
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:51,520
the time frames. We look if value has
 

2403
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,270
the time frames. We look if value has
been moved up, what type of shape we

2404
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:53,280
been moved up, what type of shape we
 

2405
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,430
been moved up, what type of shape we
have. Is there a big gap? Are we likely

2406
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:55,440
have. Is there a big gap? Are we likely
 

2407
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,109
have. Is there a big gap? Are we likely
to see a fill on that gap? Are we

2408
00:55:57,109 --> 00:55:57,119
to see a fill on that gap? Are we
 

2409
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:08,950
to see a fill on that gap? Are we
holding value?

2410
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:08,960

 

2411
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,789

The source boss, I don't know, maybe I

2412
00:56:10,789 --> 00:56:10,799
The source boss, I don't know, maybe I
 

2413
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:11,910
The source boss, I don't know, maybe I
don't know if you've been joining me

2414
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:11,920
don't know if you've been joining me
 

2415
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,230
don't know if you've been joining me
with with me this week. You you mustn't

2416
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:16,240
with with me this week. You you mustn't
 

2417
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,309
with with me this week. You you mustn't
what you've done. All right, so source

2418
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:18,319
what you've done. All right, so source
 

2419
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:20,230
what you've done. All right, so source
boss says, uh, I've nearly blown my

2420
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:20,240
boss says, uh, I've nearly blown my
 

2421
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,910
boss says, uh, I've nearly blown my
funded on this bullish move up. I keep

2422
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:21,920
funded on this bullish move up. I keep
 

2423
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,349
funded on this bullish move up. I keep
thinking it's going to go back down, but

2424
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:23,359
thinking it's going to go back down, but
 

2425
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,750
thinking it's going to go back down, but
it hasn't. What you've done is what a

2426
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:25,760
it hasn't. What you've done is what a
 

2427
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,190
it hasn't. What you've done is what a
lot of people will do is they just go,

2428
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:27,200
lot of people will do is they just go,
 

2429
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,549
lot of people will do is they just go,
it's too expensive. It shouldn't do

2430
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:28,559
it's too expensive. It shouldn't do
 

2431
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,230
it's too expensive. It shouldn't do
this. It's got to come down. It's got to

2432
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:30,240
this. It's got to come down. It's got to
 

2433
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,069
this. It's got to come down. It's got to
it doesn't have to do a thing, right? It

2434
00:56:32,069 --> 00:56:32,079
it doesn't have to do a thing, right? It
 

2435
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,910
it doesn't have to do a thing, right? It
doesn't have to do a thing. It will come

2436
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:33,920
doesn't have to do a thing. It will come
 

2437
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,390
doesn't have to do a thing. It will come
down when too many bulls are caught and

2438
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:36,400
down when too many bulls are caught and
 

2439
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,390
down when too many bulls are caught and
not the fallout. And right now, all that

2440
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:38,400
not the fallout. And right now, all that
 

2441
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,470
not the fallout. And right now, all that
we've had is shorts caught in it every

2442
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:40,480
we've had is shorts caught in it every
 

2443
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,950
we've had is shorts caught in it every
single day and and we're now breaking

2444
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:42,960
single day and and we're now breaking
 

2445
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,510
single day and and we're now breaking
out on the daily, right? So, unless we

2446
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:45,520
out on the daily, right? So, unless we
 

2447
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,349
out on the daily, right? So, unless we
start collapsing, there's no reason. So,

2448
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:47,359
start collapsing, there's no reason. So,
 

2449
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,270
start collapsing, there's no reason. So,
there might be a counter trend. This

2450
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:49,280
there might be a counter trend. This
 

2451
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,030
there might be a counter trend. This
would be the counter trend. If we let go

2452
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:51,040
would be the counter trend. If we let go
 

2453
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,710
would be the counter trend. If we let go
of this, there might be this move to

2454
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:52,720
of this, there might be this move to
 

2455
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,349
of this, there might be this move to
here or here today, right? But if we

2456
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:55,359
here or here today, right? But if we
 

2457
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,750
here or here today, right? But if we
think about if we zoom out, right,

2458
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:57,760
think about if we zoom out, right,
 

2459
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,710
think about if we zoom out, right,
that's just a pullback, right? You will

2460
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:00,720
that's just a pullback, right? You will
 

2461
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,950
that's just a pullback, right? You will
only want to play that pullback when all

2462
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:02,960
only want to play that pullback when all
 

2463
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,349
only want to play that pullback when all
these bulls are caught. So if you keep

2464
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:05,359
these bulls are caught. So if you keep
 

2465
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:08,390
these bulls are caught. So if you keep
guessing tops, right, and hoping, right?

2466
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:08,400
guessing tops, right, and hoping, right?
 

2467
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,510
guessing tops, right, and hoping, right?
All you're getting is these micro

2468
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:09,520
All you're getting is these micro
 

2469
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,270
All you're getting is these micro
pullbacks and breakout. Micro pullbacks

2470
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:11,280
pullbacks and breakout. Micro pullbacks
 

2471
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,950
pullbacks and breakout. Micro pullbacks
and breakout. You if you're going to

2472
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:12,960
and breakout. You if you're going to
 

2473
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,510
and breakout. You if you're going to
fade, the best fades come when bulls are

2474
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:15,520
fade, the best fades come when bulls are
 

2475
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,430
fade, the best fades come when bulls are
stuck and we start going through key

2476
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:17,440
stuck and we start going through key
 

2477
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,670
stuck and we start going through key
levels, right? And not before then. So

2478
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:19,680
levels, right? And not before then. So
 

2479
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,190
levels, right? And not before then. So
even those who joined me yesterday I

2480
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:21,200
even those who joined me yesterday I
 

2481
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,870
even those who joined me yesterday I
gave you one short yesterday which I

2482
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:22,880
gave you one short yesterday which I
 

2483
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,270
gave you one short yesterday which I
even didn't take myself

2484
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:25,280
even didn't take myself
 

2485
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,829
even didn't take myself
which was right here and you can see it

2486
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:27,839
which was right here and you can see it
 

2487
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,670
which was right here and you can see it
hit the target

2488
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:29,680
hit the target
 

2489
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,750
hit the target
right so yesterday I gave you we were

2490
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:31,760
right so yesterday I gave you we were
 

2491
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,109
right so yesterday I gave you we were
long yesterday and we were long on this

2492
00:57:35,109 --> 00:57:35,119
long yesterday and we were long on this
 

2493
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,750
long yesterday and we were long on this
move here we played

2494
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:37,760
move here we played
 

2495
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,630
move here we played
this long to here and you had the chance

2496
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:40,640
this long to here and you had the chance
 

2497
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,750
this long to here and you had the chance
to play this long to here and this was

2498
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:43,760
to play this long to here and this was
 

2499
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,150
to play this long to here and this was
the short into lunch just before lunch

2500
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:46,160
the short into lunch just before lunch
 

2501
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,750
the short into lunch just before lunch
wasn't it? Yep. short here down to this

2502
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:47,760
wasn't it? Yep. short here down to this
 

2503
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,670
wasn't it? Yep. short here down to this
gray box. That was the opportunity you

2504
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:49,680
gray box. That was the opportunity you
 

2505
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,750
gray box. That was the opportunity you
could have actually had it again, right?

2506
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:51,760
could have actually had it again, right?
 

2507
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,030
could have actually had it again, right?
Because this was the first time we had

2508
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:53,040
Because this was the first time we had
 

2509
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,710
Because this was the first time we had
bulls trapped. You do not want to get

2510
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:54,720
bulls trapped. You do not want to get
 

2511
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,789
bulls trapped. You do not want to get
short before you have a significant

2512
00:57:56,789 --> 00:57:56,799
short before you have a significant
 

2513
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:59,430
short before you have a significant
amount of volume trapped

2514
00:57:59,430 --> 00:57:59,440
amount of volume trapped
 

2515
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:04,150
amount of volume trapped
above you. That is overhead.

2516
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:04,160

 

2517
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,510

You're just doing a dance here this

2518
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:05,520
You're just doing a dance here this
 

2519
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:15,910
You're just doing a dance here this
morning. Nothing to do here, folks.

2520
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:15,920

 

2521
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,430

How much does bookmap come into my

2522
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:17,440
How much does bookmap come into my
 

2523
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,910
How much does bookmap come into my
trading? Uh, yeah, it does. Especially

2524
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:19,920
trading? Uh, yeah, it does. Especially
 

2525
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,270
trading? Uh, yeah, it does. Especially
when we're coming into a level I'm

2526
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:21,280
when we're coming into a level I'm
 

2527
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,030
when we're coming into a level I'm
interested in. All right. So, definitely

2528
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:23,040
interested in. All right. So, definitely
 

2529
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,390
interested in. All right. So, definitely
if I if I'm looking for track

2530
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:24,400
if I if I'm looking for track
 

2531
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,230
if I if I'm looking for track
participants, bookmap and footprint. So,

2532
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:26,240
participants, bookmap and footprint. So,
 

2533
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,950
participants, bookmap and footprint. So,
between that and here, but I actually

2534
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:28,960
between that and here, but I actually
 

2535
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,230
between that and here, but I actually
have this on ninja, but obviously it's

2536
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:30,240
have this on ninja, but obviously it's
 

2537
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,230
have this on ninja, but obviously it's
not working right now. Between these two

2538
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:32,240
not working right now. Between these two
 

2539
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,510
not working right now. Between these two
things, right, quite a lot. Quite a lot.

2540
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:35,520
things, right, quite a lot. Quite a lot.
 

2541
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,109
things, right, quite a lot. Quite a lot.
So, take that last push. You can

2542
00:58:37,109 --> 00:58:37,119
So, take that last push. You can
 

2543
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,470
So, take that last push. You can
starting to see buyers are starting to

2544
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:38,480
starting to see buyers are starting to
 

2545
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,950
starting to see buyers are starting to
get caught here. Buyers are starting to

2546
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:40,960
get caught here. Buyers are starting to
 

2547
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,630
get caught here. Buyers are starting to
get caught here. So if we start closing

2548
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:42,640
get caught here. So if we start closing
 

2549
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,990
get caught here. So if we start closing
under this, I think you're going to see

2550
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:44,000
under this, I think you're going to see
 

2551
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,990
under this, I think you're going to see
weakness for an imbalance fill down into

2552
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:46,000
weakness for an imbalance fill down into
 

2553
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,910
weakness for an imbalance fill down into
this. And if we get under that, this is

2554
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:47,920
this. And if we get under that, this is
 

2555
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,510
this. And if we get under that, this is
your target. And if we get under that

2556
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:49,520
your target. And if we get under that
 

2557
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,190
your target. And if we get under that
gap fill is possible.

2558
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:53,200
gap fill is possible.
 

2559
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,870
gap fill is possible.
You can see buyers are starting to get

2560
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:54,880
You can see buyers are starting to get
 

2561
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,549
You can see buyers are starting to get
caught over that New York open in the

2562
00:58:56,549 --> 00:58:56,559
caught over that New York open in the
 

2563
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,150
caught over that New York open in the
last, I don't know, 5 10 minutes. So if

2564
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:58,160
last, I don't know, 5 10 minutes. So if
 

2565
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,430
last, I don't know, 5 10 minutes. So if
they keep rejecting that, there's

2566
00:58:59,430 --> 00:58:59,440
they keep rejecting that, there's
 

2567
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,150
they keep rejecting that, there's
potential for a wash here.

2568
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:04,160

 

2569
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,510

I just have to see if we can get

2570
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:05,520
I just have to see if we can get
 

2571
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,190
I just have to see if we can get
acceptance underneath this little ledge

2572
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:07,200
acceptance underneath this little ledge
 

2573
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,870
acceptance underneath this little ledge
here at 37. And if we can, you're

2574
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:08,880
here at 37. And if we can, you're
 

2575
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,390
here at 37. And if we can, you're
probably going to get a revisit of low

2576
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:10,400
probably going to get a revisit of low
 

2577
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,910
probably going to get a revisit of low
day. What was the auction like a lower

2578
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:11,920
day. What was the auction like a lower
 

2579
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,829
day. What was the auction like a lower
day?

2580
00:59:17,829 --> 00:59:17,839

 

2581
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:18,950

Yeah, I think there's a chance to

2582
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:18,960
Yeah, I think there's a chance to
 

2583
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,190
Yeah, I think there's a chance to
revisit that. Here we go. So, it's doing

2584
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:21,200
revisit that. Here we go. So, it's doing
 

2585
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,390
revisit that. Here we go. So, it's doing
it already. There you go. So, we just

2586
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:22,400
it already. There you go. So, we just
 

2587
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,910
it already. There you go. So, we just
saw those buyers caught. So, there you

2588
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:23,920
saw those buyers caught. So, there you
 

2589
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,069
saw those buyers caught. So, there you
go. That's bookmapping footprint.

2590
00:59:28,069 --> 00:59:28,079

 

2591
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:29,589

So, it all depends now. Can we get

2592
00:59:29,589 --> 00:59:29,599
So, it all depends now. Can we get
 

2593
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:33,109
So, it all depends now. Can we get
acceptance under 37s? This edge right

2594
00:59:33,109 --> 00:59:33,119
acceptance under 37s? This edge right
 

2595
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,270
acceptance under 37s? This edge right
here. Sellers need to find acceptance

2596
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:35,280
here. Sellers need to find acceptance
 

2597
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,789
here. Sellers need to find acceptance
under that. If they find accept this

2598
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:36,799
under that. If they find accept this
 

2599
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:38,230
under that. If they find accept this
move here. So, you've got buyers stuck

2600
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:38,240
move here. So, you've got buyers stuck
 

2601
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,549
move here. So, you've got buyers stuck
up here. If you get this, this is

2602
00:59:40,549 --> 00:59:40,559
up here. If you get this, this is
 

2603
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,230
up here. If you get this, this is
possible. If you get that, then the next

2604
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:42,240
possible. If you get that, then the next
 

2605
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,750
possible. If you get that, then the next
orange line is possible. Remember, this

2606
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:43,760
orange line is possible. Remember, this
 

2607
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,630
orange line is possible. Remember, this
is a huge level under here. We are very,

2608
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:46,640
is a huge level under here. We are very,
 

2609
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,789
is a huge level under here. We are very,
very, very thin. Imagine this. We've got

2610
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:48,799
very, very thin. Imagine this. We've got
 

2611
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:51,430
very, very thin. Imagine this. We've got
like a bump here and then it's just like

2612
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:51,440
like a bump here and then it's just like
 

2613
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,030
like a bump here and then it's just like
this down to here. There's nothing until

2614
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:53,040
this down to here. There's nothing until
 

2615
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,470
this down to here. There's nothing until
we get down into these.

2616

into the twelves and the 200s. Let's see
if there's a guy down at 92s or not.

2628
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:09,200
if there's a guy down at 92s or not.
 

2629

So, yeah, they want it down into there.
 

2633
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,230
So, yeah, they want it down into there.
They want to see if they can protect

2634
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:16,240
They want to see if they can protect
 

2635
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,950
They want to see if they can protect

I like the volatility. I got used to how

2642
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:29,200
I like the volatility. I got used to how
 

2643
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,270
I like the volatility. I got used to how
it moves.

2644
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:31,280
it moves.
 

2645
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,950
it moves.
Can make really good money in it once

2646
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:32,960
Can make really good money in it once
 

2647
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,230
Can make really good money in it once
you understand it. Here you go. So, here

2648
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:34,240
you understand it. Here you go. So, here
 

2649
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,349
you understand it. Here you go. So, here
comes the lower day test.

2650
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:37,359
comes the lower day test.
 

2651
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:39,670
comes the lower day test.
I wish I had

2652
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:39,680
I wish I had
 

2653
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,109
I wish I had
better uh availability to look at this

2654
01:00:43,109 --> 01:00:43,119
better uh availability to look at this
 

2655

Okay, so lower day test coming up. So

2660
01:00:49,829 --> 01:00:49,839
Okay, so lower day test coming up. So
 

2661
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:52,549
Okay, so lower day test coming up. So
I'd be like taking a partial into that

2662
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:52,559
I'd be like taking a partial into that
 

2663
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,109
I'd be like taking a partial into that
and then see if you get uh into 92s and

2664
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:55,119
and then see if you get uh into 92s and
 

2665
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,270
and then see if you get uh into 92s and
then if you get acceptance under 92s

2666
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:57,280
then if you get acceptance under 92s
 

2667
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,710
then if you get acceptance under 92s
then you can probably see a wash in this

2668
01:00:58,710 --> 01:00:58,720
then you can probably see a wash in this
 

2669
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,230
then you can probably see a wash in this
back down to those levels that we said

2670
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:00,240
back down to those levels that we said
 

2671
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,589
back down to those levels that we said
we could be interested in buying off

2672
01:01:01,589 --> 01:01:01,599
we could be interested in buying off
 

2673
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:07,430
we could be interested in buying off
today.

2674

2675
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,190

What other volume on side candles called

2676
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:09,200
What other volume on side candles called
 

2677
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,990

is footprint footprint? There's a video

2678
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:12,000
is footprint footprint? There's a video
 

2679
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,990
is footprint footprint? There's a video
on my YouTube for it and show you how to

2680
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:14,000
on my YouTube for it and show you how to
 

2681
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,670
on my YouTube for it and show you how to
do it.

2682
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:17,680

 

2683
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,589

So yes, under previous day high spy

2684
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:19,599
So yes, under previous day high spy
 

2685
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:21,030
So yes, under previous day high spy
under previous day high. They had gap

2686
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:21,040
under previous day high. They had gap
 

2687
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,549
under previous day high. They had gap
fill potential if they start staying

2688
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:22,559
fill potential if they start staying
 

2689
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,069
fill potential if they start staying
heavy here. They're into key levels. So

2690
01:01:24,069 --> 01:01:24,079
heavy here. They're into key levels. So
 

2691
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:26,549
heavy here. They're into key levels. So
it would be a partial kind of place

2692
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:26,559
it would be a partial kind of place
 

2693
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:29,510
it would be a partial kind of place
right now. And then if you get under

2694
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:29,520
right now. And then if you get under
 

2695
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,109
right now. And then if you get under
here,

2696
01:01:31,109 --> 01:01:31,119
here,
 

2697
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:33,109
here,
there's potential for the wash. But ES

2698
01:01:33,109 --> 01:01:33,119
there's potential for the wash. But ES
 

2699
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:35,750
there's potential for the wash. But ES
already coming on the previous day high.

2700
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:35,760
already coming on the previous day high.
 

2701
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,270
already coming on the previous day high.
Yeah, VIX doing that breakout that we

2702
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:37,280
Yeah, VIX doing that breakout that we
 

2703
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,549
Yeah, VIX doing that breakout that we
talked about. Remember we said trade

2704
01:01:38,549 --> 01:01:38,559
talked about. Remember we said trade
 

2705
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:40,789
talked about. Remember we said trade
into once it started to break through

2706
01:01:40,789 --> 01:01:40,799
into once it started to break through
 

2707
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:43,109
into once it started to break through
50s and basing above those 25s, the

2708
01:01:43,109 --> 01:01:43,119
50s and basing above those 25s, the
 

2709
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,589
50s and basing above those 25s, the
moves into 70s. We're there now. So,

2710
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:45,599
moves into 70s. We're there now. So,
 

2711
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,750
moves into 70s. We're there now. So,
next stop for VIX is probably the 83s.

2712
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:47,760
next stop for VIX is probably the 83s.
 

2713
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,230
next stop for VIX is probably the 83s.
If we break through 83s, it's 95s. If

2714
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:50,240
If we break through 83s, it's 95s. If
 

2715
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:54,710
If we break through 83s, it's 95s. If
break through 95s, it's 1712s.

2716
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:54,720

 

2717
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,150

I've still got nothing on Intrader,

2718
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:56,160
I've still got nothing on Intrader,
 

2719
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,390
I've still got nothing on Intrader,
folks. I can't I can't do anything here.

2720
01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:58,400
folks. I can't I can't do anything here.
 

2721
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,069
folks. I can't I can't do anything here.
I'm really sorry. I'll try my best to

2722
01:02:00,069 --> 01:02:00,079
I'm really sorry. I'll try my best to
 

2723
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:06,549
I'm really sorry. I'll try my best to
help you. In fact, let me

2724
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:06,559

 

2725
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:24,069

maybe I move this

2726
01:02:24,069 --> 01:02:24,079

 

2727
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:25,750

right into that buy side imbalance at

2728
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:25,760
right into that buy side imbalance at
 

2729
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,150
right into that buy side imbalance at
this low of day. I still think you're

2730
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:28,160
this low of day. I still think you're
 

2731
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,750
this low of day. I still think you're
going to get a lower day here and you're

2732
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:29,760
going to get a lower day here and you're
 

2733
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,349
going to get a lower day here and you're
going to get an auction lower. Looks

2734
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:31,359
going to get an auction lower. Looks
 

2735
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,349
going to get an auction lower. Looks
good.

2736
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:33,359
good.
 

2737
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,430
good.
It's really good.

2738
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:35,440
It's really good.
 

2739
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,950
It's really good.
Those buyers getting stuck through the

2740
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:36,960
Those buyers getting stuck through the
 

2741
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,150
Those buyers getting stuck through the
imbalance. There's your lower date.

2742
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:38,160
imbalance. There's your lower date.
 

2743
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,109
imbalance. There's your lower date.
There you go. So, that was the key was

2744
01:02:41,109 --> 01:02:41,119
There you go. So, that was the key was
 

2745
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,190
There you go. So, that was the key was
right here. Once we saw those buyers get

2746
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:43,200
right here. Once we saw those buyers get
 

2747
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,030
right here. Once we saw those buyers get
stuck, someone asked, do I use bookmark

2748
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:45,040
stuck, someone asked, do I use bookmark
 

2749
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,789
stuck, someone asked, do I use bookmark
or anything like that? Once we saw the

2750
01:02:46,789 --> 01:02:46,799
or anything like that? Once we saw the
 

2751
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:49,109
or anything like that? Once we saw the
buyers get stuck here, that was the sign

2752
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:49,119
buyers get stuck here, that was the sign
 

2753
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:51,030
buyers get stuck here, that was the sign
and there's your low of day. So, now the

2754
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:51,040
and there's your low of day. So, now the
 

2755
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,430
and there's your low of day. So, now the
next targets that's TP1 here. TP2 is

2756
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:53,440
next targets that's TP1 here. TP2 is
 

2757
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,270
next targets that's TP1 here. TP2 is
here. All right. If you get that, that

2758
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:55,280
here. All right. If you get that, that
 

2759
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,230
here. All right. If you get that, that
will be TP2. Otherwise, this is the same

2760
01:02:58,230 --> 01:02:58,240
will be TP2. Otherwise, this is the same
 

2761
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,069
will be TP2. Otherwise, this is the same
level that becomes important, right?

2762
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:00,079
level that becomes important, right?
 

2763
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:01,670
level that becomes important, right?
Point of control on the day where those

2764
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:01,680
Point of control on the day where those
 

2765
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,549
Point of control on the day where those
buyers got stuck. Remember where

2766
01:03:04,549 --> 01:03:04,559
buyers got stuck. Remember where
 

2767
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:06,230
buyers got stuck. Remember where
those buyers got stuck. That was a good

2768
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:06,240
those buyers got stuck. That was a good
 

2769
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,990
those buyers got stuck. That was a good
auction at the low. Sellers coming in

2770
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:08,000
auction at the low. Sellers coming in
 

2771
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,549
auction at the low. Sellers coming in
down there. So, sellers will kind of

2772
01:03:10,549 --> 01:03:10,559
down there. So, sellers will kind of
 

2773
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,309
down there. So, sellers will kind of
want to defend these 50s. If they can't

2774
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:12,319
want to defend these 50s. If they can't
 

2775
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:13,990
want to defend these 50s. If they can't
defend 50s, there's a squeeze back out

2776
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:14,000
defend 50s, there's a squeeze back out
 

2777
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,150
defend 50s, there's a squeeze back out
to the upside as we are in a range.

2778
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:18,160
to the upside as we are in a range.
 

2779
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,829
to the upside as we are in a range.

going through it all right now. So, if

2794
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:41,440
going through it all right now. So, if
 

2795
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,510
going through it all right now. So, if
you just go on my YouTube, I'll try and

2796

you just go on my YouTube, I'll try and
 

2797
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:50,150
you just go on my YouTube, I'll try and
find it for you. In fact, a second

2798
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:50,160

2802
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:00,400

 

2803
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,230

So you're now looking for 92s if they

2804
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:02,240
So you're now looking for 92s if they
 

2805
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,150
So you're now looking for 92s if they
can find acceptance lower. There you go,

2806
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:04,160
can find acceptance lower. There you go,
 

2807
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,950
can find acceptance lower. There you go,
my friend.

2808
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:06,960
my friend.
 

2809
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,789
my friend.
So that last link I sent,

2810
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:10,799
So that last link I sent,
 

2811
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:14,309
So that last link I sent,
what's my bias for today? Uh probably a

2812
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:14,319
what's my bias for today? Uh probably a
 

2813
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:17,510
what's my bias for today? Uh probably a
I'm probably expecting the pullback leg.

2814
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:17,520
I'm probably expecting the pullback leg.
 

2815
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,430
I'm probably expecting the pullback leg.
It's just depends where they stop it,

2816
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:19,440
It's just depends where they stop it,
 

2817
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:25,990
It's just depends where they stop it,
right? So, do they defend GlobeEx

2818
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:26,000

 

2819
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,230

or do they come down in here and then do

2820
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:28,240
or do they come down in here and then do
 

2821
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,589
or do they come down in here and then do
we bid off this into FMC?

2822
01:04:31,589 --> 01:04:31,599
we bid off this into FMC?
 

2823
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:33,190
we bid off this into FMC?
So, that's what I'd like to see for

2824
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:33,200
So, that's what I'd like to see for
 

2825
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,230
So, that's what I'd like to see for
today is that kind of move there. If we

2826
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:36,240
today is that kind of move there. If we
 

2827
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,150
today is that kind of move there. If we
fail this, all right, if we fail

2828
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:38,160
fail this, all right, if we fail
 

2829
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,990
fail this, all right, if we fail
previous day value area high, obviously

2830
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:40,000
previous day value area high, obviously
 

2831
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,510
previous day value area high, obviously
there's a rotation debt down into the

2832
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:41,520
there's a rotation debt down into the
 

2833
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,029
there's a rotation debt down into the
lows. If we fail that, we have to watch

2834
01:04:43,029 --> 01:04:43,039
lows. If we fail that, we have to watch
 

2835
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:45,109
lows. If we fail that, we have to watch
the current week developing value

2836
01:04:45,109 --> 01:04:45,119
the current week developing value
 

2837
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:48,230
the current week developing value
underneath 88s or definitely underneath

2838
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:48,240
underneath 88s or definitely underneath
 

2839
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,750
underneath 88s or definitely underneath
well yeah definitely underneath previous

2840
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:49,760
well yeah definitely underneath previous
 

2841
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,589
well yeah definitely underneath previous
day value area low I'd be very very

2842
01:04:51,589 --> 01:04:51,599
day value area low I'd be very very
 

2843
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,589
day value area low I'd be very very
concerned because from that point if we

2844
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:53,599
concerned because from that point if we
 

2845
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,829
concerned because from that point if we
start finding acceptance underneath

2846
01:04:55,829 --> 01:04:55,839
start finding acceptance underneath
 

2847
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:57,349
start finding acceptance underneath
26,044

2848
01:04:57,349 --> 01:04:57,359
26,044
 

2849
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:58,950
26,044
then I think there's very probable that

2850
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:58,960
then I think there's very probable that
 

2851
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,589
then I think there's very probable that
we move down to 25,900

2852
01:05:01,589 --> 01:05:01,599
we move down to 25,900
 

2853
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:04,309
we move down to 25,900
right but I I'm would be looking to bid

2854
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:04,319
right but I I'm would be looking to bid
 

2855
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,309
right but I I'm would be looking to bid
either around this orange line or even

2856
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:06,319
either around this orange line or even
 

2857
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:09,270
either around this orange line or even
more preferable down here. So if they

2858
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:09,280
more preferable down here. So if they
 

2859
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,789
more preferable down here. So if they
can trap sellers here, that rotation,

2860
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:12,799
can trap sellers here, that rotation,
 

2861
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:15,029
can trap sellers here, that rotation,
but ideally here is better. So on a

2862
01:05:15,029 --> 01:05:15,039
but ideally here is better. So on a
 

2863
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:17,589
but ideally here is better. So on a
lower time frame, I'd be looking for

2864
01:05:17,589 --> 01:05:17,599
lower time frame, I'd be looking for
 

2865
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:20,069
lower time frame, I'd be looking for
some kind of nonsense down into this and

2866
01:05:20,069 --> 01:05:20,079
some kind of nonsense down into this and
 

2867
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:22,390
some kind of nonsense down into this and
then base and then maybe a wick and this

2868
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:22,400
then base and then maybe a wick and this
 

2869
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,710
then base and then maybe a wick and this
move here. I think it's possible. At the

2870
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:24,720
move here. I think it's possible. At the
 

2871
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:30,950
move here. I think it's possible. At the
moment, they're protecting GlobeEx.

2872
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:30,960

 

2873
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,029

You got remember it's FOMC day. So

2874
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:33,039
You got remember it's FOMC day. So
 

2875
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:34,549
You got remember it's FOMC day. So
anything they do now is just building

2876
01:05:34,549 --> 01:05:34,559
anything they do now is just building
 

2877
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,710
anything they do now is just building
liquidity for later. Anything they do

2878
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:36,720
liquidity for later. Anything they do
 

2879
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:42,470
liquidity for later. Anything they do
now is just building liquidity.

2880
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:42,480

 

2881
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,309

Yeah, I've tried connecting. It's it's

2882
01:05:44,309 --> 01:05:44,319
Yeah, I've tried connecting. It's it's
 

2883
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:53,190
Yeah, I've tried connecting. It's it's
it opens and then it just freezes.

2884
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:53,200

 

2885
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,710

Yeah, first I think that's first time on

2886
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:54,720
Yeah, first I think that's first time on
 

2887

Yeah, first I think that's first time on

Nice. Lot lots of you getting that
 

2899

Nice. Lot lots of you getting that
short. Nice work,

2900
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:18,240

 

2901
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,990

Joe. It's definitely It's definitely not

2902
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:20,000
Joe. It's definitely It's definitely not
 

2903
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,829
Joe. It's definitely It's definitely not
like GameStop that I mean that they

2904
01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:21,839
like GameStop that I mean that they
 

2905
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:23,109
like GameStop that I mean that they
should have gone to jail for that. That

2906
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:23,119
should have gone to jail for that. That
 

2907
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,789
should have gone to jail for that. That
was dreadful what happened there. It

2908
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:24,799
was dreadful what happened there. It
 

2909
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:26,230
was dreadful what happened there. It
worked well for me. I did take that was

2910
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:26,240
worked well for me. I did take that was
 

2911
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,349
worked well for me. I did take that was
one of the biggest trades of my career.

2912
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:27,359
one of the biggest trades of my career.
 

2913
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:33,430
one of the biggest trades of my career.
I got short uh the morning after that.

2914
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:33,440

 

2915
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,990

Why am I able to pass evals heavily but

2916
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:36,000
Why am I able to pass evals heavily but
 

2917
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,190
Why am I able to pass evals heavily but
never get paid payout when funded?

2918
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:39,200
never get paid payout when funded?
 

2919
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:44,870
never get paid payout when funded?
Probably psychology by the looks of it.

2920
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:44,880

 

2921
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,789

Uh, two ticks, Fernando. Yeah, they're

2922
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:46,799
Uh, two ticks, Fernando. Yeah, they're
 

2923
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:55,029
Uh, two ticks, Fernando. Yeah, they're
tick based.

2924
01:06:55,029 --> 01:06:55,039

 

2925
01:06:55,039 --> 01:07:04,069

Take care. Take care.

2926
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:04,079

 

2927
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:05,430

We're growing. Yeah, we are growing. All

2928
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:05,440
We're growing. Yeah, we are growing. All
 

2929
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,029
We're growing. Yeah, we are growing. All
right, so come back to test that 50.

2930
01:07:07,029 --> 01:07:07,039
right, so come back to test that 50.
 

2931
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,789
right, so come back to test that 50.
Remember, we just talked about the 50.

2932
01:07:08,789 --> 01:07:08,799
Remember, we just talked about the 50.
 

2933
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:11,510
Remember, we just talked about the 50.
This is the level sellers must defend,

2934
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:11,520
This is the level sellers must defend,
 

2935
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,510
This is the level sellers must defend,
right? They must defend 50 and they must

2936
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:13,520
right? They must defend 50 and they must
 

2937
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,029
right? They must defend 50 and they must
now get follow through. If they fail to

2938
01:07:15,029 --> 01:07:15,039
now get follow through. If they fail to
 

2939
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:16,230
now get follow through. If they fail to
get follow through now, they will get

2940
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:16,240
get follow through now, they will get
 

2941
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,390
get follow through now, they will get
caught. Why must they defend 50? Well,

2942
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:18,400
caught. Why must they defend 50? Well,
 

2943
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,910
caught. Why must they defend 50? Well,
there's a shelf there. It's point of

2944
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:19,920
there's a shelf there. It's point of
 

2945
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,829
there's a shelf there. It's point of
control. But I'm going to get rid of

2946
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:21,839
control. But I'm going to get rid of
 

2947
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:24,150
control. But I'm going to get rid of
this now from here as well. We don't

2948
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:24,160
this now from here as well. We don't
 

2949
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,150
this now from here as well. We don't
need that anymore. But there also where

2950
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:26,160
need that anymore. But there also where
 

2951
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,750
need that anymore. But there also where
the buyers got stuck. Remember here we

2952
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:27,760
the buyers got stuck. Remember here we
 

2953
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,029
the buyers got stuck. Remember here we
talked about where did the buyers get

2954
01:07:29,029 --> 01:07:29,039
talked about where did the buyers get
 

2955
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,789
talked about where did the buyers get
stuck here? Their buyers got stuck. Look

2956
01:07:30,789 --> 01:07:30,799
stuck here? Their buyers got stuck. Look
 

2957
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,230
stuck here? Their buyers got stuck. Look
at all this aggressive buying.

2958
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:32,240
at all this aggressive buying.
 

2959
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,829
at all this aggressive buying.
Aggressive buying. Aggressive buying.

2960
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:33,839
Aggressive buying. Aggressive buying.
 

2961
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:35,589
Aggressive buying. Aggressive buying.
Aggressive buying. Did price move

2962
01:07:35,589 --> 01:07:35,599
Aggressive buying. Did price move
 

2963
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:37,750
Aggressive buying. Did price move
higher? No. So all the buyers in here

2964
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:37,760
higher? No. So all the buyers in here
 

2965
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,589
higher? No. So all the buyers in here
are currently caught. So we came up.

2966
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:39,599
are currently caught. So we came up.
 

2967
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,190
are currently caught. So we came up.
This gave them a chance to stop out

2968
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:41,200
This gave them a chance to stop out
 

2969
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,309
This gave them a chance to stop out
break even. Right. Sellers now need

2970
01:07:44,309 --> 01:07:44,319
break even. Right. Sellers now need
 

2971
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:47,109
break even. Right. Sellers now need
continuation lower underneath this. If

2972
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:47,119
continuation lower underneath this. If
 

2973
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:48,710
continuation lower underneath this. If
they don't get that continuation, it

2974
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:48,720
they don't get that continuation, it
 

2975
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,029
they don't get that continuation, it
would be a pullback which fails to move

2976
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:51,039
would be a pullback which fails to move
 

2977
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,870
would be a pullback which fails to move
lower with sellers caught these lows.

2978
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:52,880
lower with sellers caught these lows.
 

2979
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,069
lower with sellers caught these lows.
You can see the sellers are caught right

2980
01:07:54,069 --> 01:07:54,079
You can see the sellers are caught right
 

2981
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:56,150
You can see the sellers are caught right
now at 215. So sellers must get under

2982
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:56,160
now at 215. So sellers must get under
 

2983
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,950
now at 215. So sellers must get under
that otherwise this is your rotation

2984
01:07:58,950 --> 01:07:58,960
that otherwise this is your rotation
 

2985
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,029
that otherwise this is your rotation
between here this 30 points acceptance

2986
01:08:01,029 --> 01:08:01,039
between here this 30 points acceptance
 

2987
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:03,029
between here this 30 points acceptance
over this will be a potential squeeze

2988
01:08:03,029 --> 01:08:03,039
over this will be a potential squeeze
 

2989
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:07,029
over this will be a potential squeeze
certainly over 65s.

2990
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:07,039
certainly over 65s.
 

2991
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,670
certainly over 65s.
Hopefully that makes sense. You can play

2992
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:09,680
Hopefully that makes sense. You can play
 

2993
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,430
Hopefully that makes sense. You can play
both sides of the tape today if you're

2994
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:11,440
both sides of the tape today if you're
 

2995
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:19,430
both sides of the tape today if you're
uh quick enough on the trigger.

2996
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:19,440

 

2997
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,030

Nice. Lots of you making some good money

2998
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:21,040
Nice. Lots of you making some good money
 

2999
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:27,430
Nice. Lots of you making some good money
already.

3000
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:27,440

 

3001
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:31,829

Trade rate seems okay now.

3002
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:31,839

 

3003
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:35,910

We trading at 30s.

3004
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:35,920

 

3005
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:40,070

19 18 17 16. See I keep getting gaps

3006
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:40,080
19 18 17 16. See I keep getting gaps
 

3007
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,870
19 18 17 16. See I keep getting gaps
though. There are gaps in my chart. Let

3008
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:42,880
though. There are gaps in my chart. Let
 

3009
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,430
though. There are gaps in my chart. Let
me try one more time on trade. I'm not

3010
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:45,440
me try one more time on trade. I'm not
 

3011
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,229
me try one more time on trade. I'm not
convinced guys.

3012
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:48,239
convinced guys.
 

3013
01:08:48,239 --> 01:09:06,309
convinced guys.
Try one more time.

3014
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:06,319

 

3015
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:08,870

Still inside that lowex range. Orange.

3016
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:08,880
Still inside that lowex range. Orange.
 

3017
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:23,749
Still inside that lowex range. Orange.
Orange to orange.

3018
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:23,759

 

3019
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,829

Let's see if this opens up this time.

3020
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:25,839
Let's see if this opens up this time.
 

3021
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:30,550
Let's see if this opens up this time.
It's a good start.

3022
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:30,560

 

3023
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,630

Good start. Can it open the footprint?

3024
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:32,640
Good start. Can it open the footprint?
 

3025
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,709
Good start. Can it open the footprint?
There we go. Right. Give this a minute

3026
01:09:34,709 --> 01:09:34,719
There we go. Right. Give this a minute
 

3027
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:37,990
There we go. Right. Give this a minute
or two just to see if it's able to stay

3028
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:38,000
or two just to see if it's able to stay
 

3029
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,950
or two just to see if it's able to stay
open.

3030
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:40,960
open.
 

3031
01:09:40,960 --> 01:10:08,229
open.
So far looks good though.

3032
01:10:08,229 --> 01:10:08,239

 

3033
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:11,110

disconnect sim then live work. Okay,

3034
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:11,120
disconnect sim then live work. Okay,
 

3035
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,310
disconnect sim then live work. Okay,
I'll try. It seems to be working now. I

3036
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:14,320
I'll try. It seems to be working now. I
 

3037
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,750
I'll try. It seems to be working now. I
just want to give it a minute or two to

3038
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:15,760
just want to give it a minute or two to
 

3039
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,229
just want to give it a minute or two to
make sure it's smooth.

3040
01:10:18,229 --> 01:10:18,239
make sure it's smooth.
 

3041
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:21,350
make sure it's smooth.
It seems to be doing a bit better now.

3042
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:21,360
It seems to be doing a bit better now.
 

3043
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,189
It seems to be doing a bit better now.
All right, ES back inside previous days

3044
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:23,199
All right, ES back inside previous days
 

3045
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:26,550
All right, ES back inside previous days
high. Still no gap fill on ES.

3046
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:26,560
high. Still no gap fill on ES.
 

3047
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,149
high. Still no gap fill on ES.
Spy the same back inside previous days

3048
01:10:28,149 --> 01:10:28,159
Spy the same back inside previous days
 

3049
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:29,910
Spy the same back inside previous days
high. It's got VWAP and New York open

3050
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:29,920
high. It's got VWAP and New York open
 

3051
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,149
high. It's got VWAP and New York open
above it. Q's the same. VIX just came up

3052
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:32,159
above it. Q's the same. VIX just came up
 

3053
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:34,229
above it. Q's the same. VIX just came up
to that pivot. 17's failed in front of

3054
01:10:34,229 --> 01:10:34,239
to that pivot. 17's failed in front of
 

3055
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:38,229
to that pivot. 17's failed in front of
17 so far.

3056
01:10:38,229 --> 01:10:38,239

 

3057
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:54,310

Big block there.

3058
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:54,320

 

3059
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,990

That's the long hair. Thanks. It's

3060
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:56,000
That's the long hair. Thanks. It's
 

3061
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,830
That's the long hair. Thanks. It's
actually short. I actually just had it

3062
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:57,840
actually short. I actually just had it
 

3063
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:02,390
actually short. I actually just had it
cut. It was very long.

3064
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:02,400
cut. It was very long.
 

3065
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,350
cut. It was very long.
Okay, so back to these 50s. And you

3066
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:05,360
Okay, so back to these 50s. And you
 

3067
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,189
Okay, so back to these 50s. And you
know, if sellers can't defend this,

3068
01:11:07,189 --> 01:11:07,199
know, if sellers can't defend this,
 

3069
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:11,270
know, if sellers can't defend this,
remember sellers got caught from here.

3070
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:11,280
remember sellers got caught from here.
 

3071
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,189
remember sellers got caught from here.
16s.

3072
01:11:13,189 --> 01:11:13,199
16s.
 

3073
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:16,870
16s.
Yeah, sellers are caught from 16s here.

3074
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:16,880
Yeah, sellers are caught from 16s here.
 

3075
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,229
Yeah, sellers are caught from 16s here.
And buyers are caught in here. This is

3076
01:11:20,229 --> 01:11:20,239
And buyers are caught in here. This is
 

3077
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,709
And buyers are caught in here. This is
the rotation between these. and

3078
01:11:22,709 --> 01:11:22,719
the rotation between these. and
 

3079
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:24,470
the rotation between these. and
acceptance might allow that squeeze,

3080
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:24,480
acceptance might allow that squeeze,
 

3081
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:25,990
acceptance might allow that squeeze,
especially if we get through this 63

3082
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:26,000
especially if we get through this 63
 

3083

or trade of eight data has been down. It
 

3119
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,709

3127
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:43,270

At the moment looks okay. I'm bit

At the moment looks okay. I'm bit
dubious about taking a trade. I'll be

3130

dubious about taking a trade. I'll be
 

3131
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,750
dubious about taking a trade. I'll be
honest. Even if there was a setup.

3132
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:47,760
honest. Even if there was a setup.
 

3133

26,200. So he's kind of said, "Hey, this

3138
01:12:56,229 --> 01:12:56,239
26,200. So he's kind of said, "Hey, this
 

3139
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:57,669
26,200. So he's kind of said, "Hey, this
is where I want to absorb it." Let's see

3140
01:12:57,669 --> 01:12:57,679
is where I want to absorb it." Let's see
 

3141
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:59,110
is where I want to absorb it." Let's see
if he's a spoofer. If we come down to

3142
01:12:59,110 --> 01:12:59,120
if he's a spoofer. If we come down to
 

3143
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,630
if he's a spoofer. If we come down to
him, big coming back down into where we

him, big coming back down into where we
 

3145
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:06,709
him, big coming back down into where we
broke out from

3154
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:18,880
200. We will just have to see.
 

3155
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:24,550
200. We will just have to see.
See what he's saying.

3156
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:24,560

 

3157
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:55,910

Back to value area low on the day.

3158
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:55,920

 

3159
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,750

No, I don't think trade's working. Still

3160
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:57,760
No, I don't think trade's working. Still
 

3161
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,189
No, I don't think trade's working. Still
still keeps pausing versus what I'm

3162
01:13:59,189 --> 01:13:59,199
still keeps pausing versus what I'm
 

3163
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:03,350
still keeps pausing versus what I'm
seeing, guys. I'd be very careful.

3164
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:03,360
seeing, guys. I'd be very careful.
 

3165
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:11,189
seeing, guys. I'd be very careful.
Not worth it in my opinion.

3166
01:14:11,189 --> 01:14:11,199

 

3167
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:14,149

It's a leave alone day I would say if

3168
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:14,159
It's a leave alone day I would say if
 

3169
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:19,189
It's a leave alone day I would say if
you're on trade of eight

3170
01:14:19,189 --> 01:14:19,199

 

3171
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:21,189

silver at lows. Did it reject those tens

3172
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:21,199
silver at lows. Did it reject those tens
 

3173
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:22,630
silver at lows. Did it reject those tens
I talked about yesterday? Someone asked

3174
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:22,640
I talked about yesterday? Someone asked
 

3175
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,229
I talked about yesterday? Someone asked
about what the trade was yesterday for

3176
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:24,239
about what the trade was yesterday for
 

3177
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:29,110
about what the trade was yesterday for
it and I said the tens

3178
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:29,120

 

3179
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,990

it was tens.

3180
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:32,000
it was tens.
 

3181
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,750
it was tens.
Was it this move? Where are we? Was it

3182
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:33,760
Was it this move? Where are we? Was it
 

3183
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,630
Was it this move? Where are we? Was it

3185
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:41,990
Monday?
Remember where we were?

3186
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:42,000

 

3187
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,149

Tuesday. Yeah, it was here. So, it was

this play yesterday was this fade back
 

3191
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,910
this play yesterday was this fade back
down. We're building out a range though.

3192
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:49,920
down. We're building out a range though.
 

3193
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,910
down. We're building out a range though.
Like I said, a high time frame. Silver's

3194
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:51,920
Like I said, a high time frame. Silver's
 

3195
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,830
Like I said, a high time frame. Silver's
very bullish. All right. It can afford

3196
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:53,840
very bullish. All right. It can afford
 

3197
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,470
very bullish. All right. It can afford
to come all the way back down here and

3198
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:56,480
to come all the way back down here and
 

3199
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,990
to come all the way back down here and
be scooped back up. They can build

3200
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:58,000
be scooped back up. They can build
 

3201
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,830
be scooped back up. They can build
liquidity.

3202
01:14:59,830 --> 01:14:59,840
liquidity.
 

3203
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,390
liquidity.
One, two, three, drop down, pick it back

3204

One, two, three, drop down, pick it back
 

3205

easily do that if they want to. Would

3212
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:11,120
easily do that if they want to. Would
 

3213
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,630
easily do that if they want to. Would
not surprise me. It's just what gold did

3214

3215
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,229
not surprise me. It's just what gold did
a couple months ago. If we look at gold,

01:15:14,229 --> 01:15:14,239
a couple months ago. If we look at gold,

very, very, very possible they can do

3238
01:15:44,709 --> 01:15:44,719
very, very, very possible they can do
 

3239
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:49,189
very, very, very possible they can do
something like that if they want.

3240
01:15:49,189 --> 01:15:49,199

 

3241
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:50,870

Macro environment says we'll probably go

3242
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:50,880
Macro environment says we'll probably go
 

3243
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,149
Macro environment says we'll probably go
higher on silver. Just might need to

3244
01:15:52,149 --> 01:15:52,159
higher on silver. Just might need to
 

3245
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:55,750
higher on silver. Just might need to
cool off for a minute.

3246
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:55,760
cool off for a minute.
 

3247
01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:01,990
cool off for a minute.
Very possible.

3248
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,000

 

3249
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,910

Okay. Still think this wants to move

3250
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:03,920
Okay. Still think this wants to move
 

3251
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,470
Okay. Still think this wants to move
into that GlobeEx at the moment.

3252
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:06,480
into that GlobeEx at the moment.
 

3253
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:28,790
into that GlobeEx at the moment.
That 92 is still absolutely key.

3254
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:28,800

 

3255
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,870

He's a spoofer down there, by the way.

3256
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:30,880
He's a spoofer down there, by the way.
 

3257
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:49,910
He's a spoofer down there, by the way.
He spoofed that 800 lot. He's not legit.

3258
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:49,920

 

3259
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,750

first profitable day on my email because

3260
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:51,760
first profitable day on my email because
 

3261
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,149
first profitable day on my email because
of you. Learning more each day. Nice. Am

3262
01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:54,159

3263
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:56,070

3265
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:02,950
I from the UK or Australia? I'm from I'm
from the UK, mate.

3266
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:02,960

 

3267
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,790

Are you likely to trade follow uh

3268
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:04,800
Are you likely to trade follow uh
 

3269
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,750
Are you likely to trade follow uh
following FOMC today? Well, not if we've

3270
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:07,760
following FOMC today? Well, not if we've
 

3271
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,669
following FOMC today? Well, not if we've
got no data.

3272
01:17:09,669 --> 01:17:09,679
got no data.
 

3273
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:11,110
got no data.
Probably not anyway. I'm probably more

3274
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:11,120
Probably not anyway. I'm probably more
 

3275
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,630
Probably not anyway. I'm probably more
interested to be honest, I'm not even

3276
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:12,640
interested to be honest, I'm not even
 

3277
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,630
interested to be honest, I'm not even
too worried about FOMC. The chances are

3278
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:14,640
too worried about FOMC. The chances are
 

3279
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,790
too worried about FOMC. The chances are
that, you know, 97% chance we're not

3280
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:16,800
that, you know, 97% chance we're not
 

3281
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:17,990
that, you know, 97% chance we're not
going to do a rate cut. What's going to

3282
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:18,000
going to do a rate cut. What's going to
 

3283
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,149
going to do a rate cut. What's going to
matter is the tone, right? Is he still

3284
01:17:20,149 --> 01:17:20,159
matter is the tone, right? Is he still
 

3285
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:21,830
matter is the tone, right? Is he still
belligerent

3286
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:21,840
belligerent
 

3287
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,350
belligerent
or is he talking about more than two

3288
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:23,360
or is he talking about more than two
 

3289
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,630
or is he talking about more than two
cuts this year? If he talks about more

3290
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:24,640
cuts this year? If he talks about more
 

3291
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,149
cuts this year? If he talks about more
than two cuts this year, maybe the

3292
01:17:26,149 --> 01:17:26,159
than two cuts this year, maybe the
 

3293
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:27,750
than two cuts this year, maybe the
market likes it because we need to get

3294
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:27,760
market likes it because we need to get
 

3295
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,470
market likes it because we need to get
moving. Um, what I'm more interested in

3296
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:30,480
moving. Um, what I'm more interested in
 

3297
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,189
moving. Um, what I'm more interested in
is the reaction to earnings. That's

3298
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:33,199
is the reaction to earnings. That's
 

3299
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:35,110
is the reaction to earnings. That's
actually what I'm more interested in

3300
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:35,120
actually what I'm more interested in
 

3301
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,910
actually what I'm more interested in
because I think we have positioned early

3302
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:37,920
because I think we have positioned early
 

3303
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,550
because I think we have positioned early
or early from last week into this week

3304
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:40,560
or early from last week into this week
 

3305
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,830
or early from last week into this week
for the MAG and you have uh Microsoft,

3306
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:43,840
for the MAG and you have uh Microsoft,
 

3307
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,669
for the MAG and you have uh Microsoft,
Meta, and Tesla earnings at the bell

3308
01:17:45,669 --> 01:17:45,679
Meta, and Tesla earnings at the bell
 

3309
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:48,149
Meta, and Tesla earnings at the bell
today. So, three of the MAG 7 today and

3310
01:17:48,149 --> 01:17:48,159
today. So, three of the MAG 7 today and
 

3311
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,070
today. So, three of the MAG 7 today and
then you have Apple tomorrow. So, I'm

3312
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:50,080
then you have Apple tomorrow. So, I'm
 

3313
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,910
then you have Apple tomorrow. So, I'm
interested in first of all what the

3314
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:51,920
interested in first of all what the
 

3315
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,470
interested in first of all what the
earnings look like. Um, then I'm

3316
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:54,480
earnings look like. Um, then I'm
 

3317
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,870
earnings look like. Um, then I'm
interested in in the forecasting, the

3318
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:56,880
interested in in the forecasting, the
 

3319
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,229
interested in in the forecasting, the
earnings calls, and then I'm interested

3320
01:17:58,229 --> 01:17:58,239
earnings calls, and then I'm interested
 

3321
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:00,870
earnings calls, and then I'm interested
in what the reaction is to those. Um,

3322
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:00,880
in what the reaction is to those. Um,
 

3323
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,430
in what the reaction is to those. Um,
have we priced it in already, or is

3324
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:03,440
have we priced it in already, or is
 

3325
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:07,110
have we priced it in already, or is
there a bigger move coming for tech?

3326
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:07,120
there a bigger move coming for tech?
 

3327
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,630
there a bigger move coming for tech?
That's what I'm really interested in.

3328
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:08,640
That's what I'm really interested in.
 

3329
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,390
That's what I'm really interested in.
Once we get through, once we close this

3330
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:10,400
Once we get through, once we close this
 

3331
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,669
Once we get through, once we close this
week, I think we're going to have a

3332
01:18:11,669 --> 01:18:11,679
week, I think we're going to have a
 

3333
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:14,310
week, I think we're going to have a
really good understanding of what, you

3334
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:14,320
really good understanding of what, you
 

3335
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,750
really good understanding of what, you
know, the next two, three months are

3336
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:15,760
know, the next two, three months are
 

3337
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,630
know, the next two, three months are
going to look like. It's a big, big week

3338
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:18,640
going to look like. It's a big, big week
 

3339
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:26,310
going to look like. It's a big, big week
right now.

3340
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:26,320

 

3341
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:27,750

Still think this is the target to the

3342
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:27,760
Still think this is the target to the
 

3343
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,149
Still think this is the target to the
92s. The rotation is still remember we

3344
01:18:30,149 --> 01:18:30,159
92s. The rotation is still remember we
 

3345
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:31,990
92s. The rotation is still remember we
said that where did they say the trapped

3346
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:32,000
said that where did they say the trapped
 

3347
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,550
said that where did they say the trapped
16s still the same level right here. So

3348
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:34,560
16s still the same level right here. So
 

3349
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,310
16s still the same level right here. So
we just came right back into it. So you

3350
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:36,320
we just came right back into it. So you
 

3351
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,590
we just came right back into it. So you
can see this level right here where the

3352
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:37,600
can see this level right here where the
 

3353
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,590
can see this level right here where the
sellers got trapped. Rotation is from

3354
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:39,600
sellers got trapped. Rotation is from
 

3355
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,229
sellers got trapped. Rotation is from
here 250. I think if we come under here

3356
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:42,239
here 250. I think if we come under here
 

3357
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:44,790
here 250. I think if we come under here
the 92s is the big level. Right. So

3358
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:44,800
the 92s is the big level. Right. So
 

3359
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,070
the 92s is the big level. Right. So
we're still building out liquidity

3360
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:46,080
we're still building out liquidity
 

3361
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,310
we're still building out liquidity
between this.

3362
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:48,320
between this.
 

3363
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,229
between this.
Right. No acceptance above it. no

3364
01:18:50,229 --> 01:18:50,239
Right. No acceptance above it. no
 

3365
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:52,229
Right. No acceptance above it. no
acceptance below it. But I still think

3366
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:52,239
acceptance below it. But I still think
 

3367
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:55,830
acceptance below it. But I still think
once if this snaps, this 92 is a massive

3368
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:55,840
once if this snaps, this 92 is a massive
 

3369
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,990
once if this snaps, this 92 is a massive
level.

3370
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:00,000

 

3371
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,510

Whereas if we zoom out, I've got rid of

3372
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:01,520
Whereas if we zoom out, I've got rid of
 

3373
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,310
Whereas if we zoom out, I've got rid of
the profile. But basically under here,

3374
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:04,320
the profile. But basically under here,
 

3375
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:07,350
the profile. But basically under here,
there is no volume. This was a straight

3376
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:07,360
there is no volume. This was a straight
 

3377
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,750
there is no volume. This was a straight
squeeze up. So there's no volume. This

3378
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:09,760
squeeze up. So there's no volume. This
 

3379
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:25,910
squeeze up. So there's no volume. This
was very, very thin.

3380
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:25,920

 

3381
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,270

3447
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:57,189
cycle and your end of day balance must
reach 52,100 and then you can pay out

3448
01:20:57,189 --> 01:20:57,199
reach 52,100 and then you can pay out
 

3449
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:59,350
reach 52,100 and then you can pay out
and you can withdraw profits above the

3450
01:20:59,350 --> 01:20:59,360
and you can withdraw profits above the
 

3451
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,669

buffer.

3452
01:21:01,669 --> 01:21:01,679

Minimum payout 250, max 1,200 day daily.

3454

3455
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,350
Minimum payout 250, max 1,200 day daily.
So they're going to do daily payouts.

3456
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:07,360
So they're going to do daily payouts.
 

3457
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:22,470
So they're going to do daily payouts.
That's pretty good.

3458
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:22,480

 

3459
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,990

So they just launched that today. Looks

3460
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:24,000
So they just launched that today. Looks
 

3461
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,550
So they just launched that today. Looks
good. I will do a deep dive into that

3462
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:26,560
good. I will do a deep dive into that
 

3463
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,070
good. I will do a deep dive into that
later.

3464
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:28,080
later.
 

3465
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,590
later.
Okay. Still think they're trying to find

3466
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:29,600
Okay. Still think they're trying to find
 

3467
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,189
Okay. Still think they're trying to find
acceptance under here. So all we've got

3468
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:31,199
acceptance under here. So all we've got
 

3469
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:33,189
acceptance under here. So all we've got
is some sellers stuck in here. Once they

3470
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:33,199
is some sellers stuck in here. Once they
 

3471
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:34,630
is some sellers stuck in here. Once they
get through this, right, this is where

3472
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:34,640
get through this, right, this is where
 

3473
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,950
get through this, right, this is where
the sellers are stuck.

3474
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:36,960
the sellers are stuck.
 

3475
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,310
the sellers are stuck.
Do it as white. Once we get through

3476
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:38,320
Do it as white. Once we get through
 

3477
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:41,270
Do it as white. Once we get through
this, this 92s is the big level. I think

3478
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:41,280
this, this 92s is the big level. I think
 

3479
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:49,910
this, this 92s is the big level. I think
you should get it. You should get it.

3480
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:49,920

 

3481
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,709

There we come.

3482
01:21:52,709 --> 01:21:52,719

01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,629
in my opinion.
My humble opinion.

3488
01:22:00,629 --> 01:22:00,639

 

3489
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:02,790

And they're adding liquidity down to 95s

3490
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:02,800
And they're adding liquidity down to 95s
 

3491
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,550
And they're adding liquidity down to 95s
now. We've got lots of guys to fill down

3492
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:04,560
now. We've got lots of guys to fill down
 

3493
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,629
now. We've got lots of guys to fill down
here. One big swipe will do it. One big

3494
01:22:06,629 --> 01:22:06,639
here. One big swipe will do it. One big
 

3495
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:11,110
here. One big swipe will do it. One big
swipe will do it for you.

3496
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:11,120

 

3497
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,390

Wouldn't have minded being able to trade

3498
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:12,400
Wouldn't have minded being able to trade
 

3499
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:22,149
Wouldn't have minded being able to trade
some of this. There we go.

3500
01:22:22,149 --> 01:22:22,159

 

3501
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:27,110

Here it comes. Here comes low date

3502
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:27,120

 

3503
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,990

and swipe down to 90s is looking very

3504
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:30,000
and swipe down to 90s is looking very
 

3505
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,430
and swipe down to 90s is looking very
probable through here. They're trying to

3506
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:31,440
probable through here. They're trying to
 

3507
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,110
probable through here. They're trying to
stack fires. I think you're going to get

3508
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:33,120
stack fires. I think you're going to get
 

3509
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,950
stack fires. I think you're going to get
this move to 92. I think you're going to

3510
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:34,960
this move to 92. I think you're going to
 

3511
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,149
this move to 92. I think you're going to
get it.

3512
01:22:36,149 --> 01:22:36,159
get it.
 

3513
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:37,590
get it.
And then we just see if we find

3514
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:37,600
And then we just see if we find
 

3515
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,189
And then we just see if we find
acceptance under that or not. That's the

3516
01:22:39,189 --> 01:22:39,199
acceptance under that or not. That's the
 

3517
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:45,189
acceptance under that or not. That's the
next thing.

3518
01:22:45,189 --> 01:22:45,199

 

3519
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,590

Here we come. There's IB low. Can we get

3520
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:47,600
Here we come. There's IB low. Can we get
 

3521
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,350
Here we come. There's IB low. Can we get
acceptance under it for 92s? So if you

3522
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:49,360
acceptance under it for 92s? So if you
 

3523
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,830
acceptance under it for 92s? So if you
took the short any of these shorts TP

3524
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:51,840
took the short any of these shorts TP
 

3525
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,550
took the short any of these shorts TP
here, like just a partial here, but

3526
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:54,560
here, like just a partial here, but
 

3527
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,709
here, like just a partial here, but
you're looking for this, right? And

3528
01:22:56,709 --> 01:22:56,719
you're looking for this, right? And
 

3529
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:58,629
you're looking for this, right? And
under there, if we find acceptance under

3530
01:22:58,629 --> 01:22:58,639
under there, if we find acceptance under
 

3531
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:00,550
under there, if we find acceptance under
there, you can get a deeper move. But

3532
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:00,560
there, you can get a deeper move. But
 

3533
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,229
there, you can get a deeper move. But
it's very possible that they trap at

3534
01:23:02,229 --> 01:23:02,239
it's very possible that they trap at
 

3535
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:03,990
it's very possible that they trap at
this level down here. So just be

3536
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:04,000
this level down here. So just be
 

3537
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:12,070
this level down here. So just be
careful.

3538
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:12,080

 

3539
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,149

Why is 192 such a big level? If you look

3540
01:23:14,149 --> 01:23:14,159
Why is 192 such a big level? If you look
 

3541
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:15,990
Why is 192 such a big level? If you look
at GlobeEx, if you look at the volume

3542
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:16,000
at GlobeEx, if you look at the volume
 

3543
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,910
at GlobeEx, if you look at the volume
during GlobeEx,

3544
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:17,920
during GlobeEx,
 

3545
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:22,310
during GlobeEx,
that was basically the shelf. Um

3546
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:22,320
that was basically the shelf. Um
 

3547
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,030
that was basically the shelf. Um
yeah,

3548
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:25,040
yeah,
 

3549
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,750
yeah,
if we

3550
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:27,760
if we
 

3551

Tuesday

3558
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:42,800
Tuesday
 

3559
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:48,870
Tuesday
here

3560
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:48,880

 

3561
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,229

into 9:30 30.

3562
01:23:52,229 --> 01:23:52,239
into 9:30 30.
 

3563
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:54,229
into 9:30 30.
Make sure that's not extended. Correct.

3564
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:54,239
Make sure that's not extended. Correct.
 

3565
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:58,790
Make sure that's not extended. Correct.
Okay. Right. You see this?

3566
01:23:58,790 --> 01:23:58,800
Okay. Right. You see this?
 

3567
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,270
Okay. Right. You see this?
Sure. You guys can see this. Move this

3568
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:01,280
Sure. You guys can see this. Move this
 

3569
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,830
Sure. You guys can see this. Move this
down a bit.

3570
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:03,840
down a bit.
 

3571
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,950
down a bit.
Right. Look at this under here.

3572
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:06,960
Right. Look at this under here.
 

3573
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,990
Right. Look at this under here.
Think about this volume.

3574
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:10,000
Think about this volume.
 

3575
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,750
Think about this volume.
Right? Where do we keep finding bids?

3576
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:11,760
Right? Where do we keep finding bids?
 

3577
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,430
Right? Where do we keep finding bids?
Here. Look under here. Under this low.

3578
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:15,440
Here. Look under here. Under this low.
 

3579
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,750
Here. Look under here. Under this low.
There is nothing. Look how thin that is

3580
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:17,760
There is nothing. Look how thin that is
 

3581
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,350
There is nothing. Look how thin that is
down into this. All right. So you've got

3582
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:19,360
down into this. All right. So you've got
 

3583
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,590
down into this. All right. So you've got
this move from 148. You got 50 points

3584
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:21,600
this move from 148. You got 50 points
 

3585
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,229
this move from 148. You got 50 points
here with nothing in, right? We can if

3586
01:24:24,229 --> 01:24:24,239
here with nothing in, right? We can if
 

3587
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:26,149
here with nothing in, right? We can if
we if we fade that, if they find

3588
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:26,159
we if we fade that, if they find
 

3589
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:28,229
we if we fade that, if they find
acceptance, we can do this. They can

3590
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:28,239
acceptance, we can do this. They can
 

3591
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:30,070
acceptance, we can do this. They can
also use it as a trap, which is why I

3592
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:30,080
also use it as a trap, which is why I
 

3593
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:34,790
also use it as a trap, which is why I
think 92s is a big level.

3594
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:34,800

 

3595
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,310

Here you come. You're coming for it now.

3596
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:36,320
Here you come. You're coming for it now.
 

3597
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,310
Here you come. You're coming for it now.
You're coming for it now. So another

3598
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:38,320
You're coming for it now. So another
 

3599
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,510
You're coming for it now. So another
trade setting up really nice. Here we

3600
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:39,520
trade setting up really nice. Here we
 

3601
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,030
trade setting up really nice. Here we
go, folks. Here we go. So here's

3602
01:24:41,030 --> 01:24:41,040
go, folks. Here we go. So here's
 

3603
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,709
go, folks. Here we go. So here's
GlobeEx. So TP2 now hit.

3604
01:24:44,709 --> 01:24:44,719
GlobeEx. So TP2 now hit.
 

3605
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,070
GlobeEx. So TP2 now hit.
And let's see if you find acceptance.

3606
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:46,080
And let's see if you find acceptance.
 

3607
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,229
And let's see if you find acceptance.
they can trap here, but if not, there is

3608
01:24:48,229 --> 01:24:48,239
they can trap here, but if not, there is
 

3609
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:49,990
they can trap here, but if not, there is
a drift all the way down like we just

3610
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:50,000
a drift all the way down like we just
 

3611
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,189
a drift all the way down like we just
talked about. So, I'd be watching

3612
01:24:51,189 --> 01:24:51,199
talked about. So, I'd be watching
 

3613
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:52,950
talked about. So, I'd be watching
there's a little bump in the road at

3614
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:52,960
there's a little bump in the road at
 

3615
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,750
there's a little bump in the road at
158. So, I'll be watching60,

3616
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:55,760
158. So, I'll be watching60,
 

3617
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,510
158. So, I'll be watching60,
140s, and then lower day uh lower day,

3618
01:24:59,510 --> 01:24:59,520
140s, and then lower day uh lower day,
 

3619
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,110
140s, and then lower day uh lower day,
old day value. So, we can put some of

3620
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:01,120
old day value. So, we can put some of
 

3621
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:06,790
old day value. So, we can put some of
these in just so you can see them.

3622
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:06,800

 

3623
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,229

These would be my next levels. All

3624
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:08,239
These would be my next levels. All
 

3625
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:09,910
These would be my next levels. All
right. So, if we find acceptance,

3626
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:09,920
right. So, if we find acceptance,
 

3627
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,430
right. So, if we find acceptance,
remember, you should have taken decent

3628
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:11,440
remember, you should have taken decent
 

3629
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,350
remember, you should have taken decent
chunk off here. If we find acceptance,

3630
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:13,360
chunk off here. If we find acceptance,
 

3631
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,709
chunk off here. If we find acceptance,
we're looking for these gray levels

3632
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:14,719
we're looking for these gray levels
 

3633
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:27,030
we're looking for these gray levels
below

3634
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:27,040

 

3635
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,270

consistency is based on your profit,

3636
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:29,280
consistency is based on your profit,
 

3637
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:30,950
consistency is based on your profit,
right? It's based on profit. Sorry,

3638
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:30,960
right? It's based on profit. Sorry,
 

3639
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,189
right? It's based on profit. Sorry,
someone just asked that. What features

3640
01:25:33,189 --> 01:25:33,199
someone just asked that. What features
 

3641
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:41,189
someone just asked that. What features
is this? NQ.

3642
01:25:41,189 --> 01:25:41,199

 

3643
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:42,790

I don't know. No, I've not tried it tra

3644
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:42,800
I don't know. No, I've not tried it tra
 

3645
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,950
I don't know. No, I've not tried it tra
traded CFD props. So I couldn't tell you

3646
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:44,960
traded CFD props. So I couldn't tell you
 

3647
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:49,590
traded CFD props. So I couldn't tell you
why. Been short since 26 250 250. Yeah,

3648
01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:49,600
why. Been short since 26 250 250. Yeah,
 

3649
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,189
why. Been short since 26 250 250. Yeah,
that's that was the level to short. That

3650
01:25:51,189 --> 01:25:51,199
that's that was the level to short. That
 

3651
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:53,990
that's that was the level to short. That
was exactly it. So you should pay

3652
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:54,000
was exactly it. So you should pay
 

3653
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,629
was exactly it. So you should pay
yourself into here. That's a 60 point

3654
01:25:56,629 --> 01:25:56,639
yourself into here. That's a 60 point
 

3655
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:58,790
yourself into here. That's a 60 point
trade in case they use this as the trap

3656
01:25:58,790 --> 01:25:58,800
trade in case they use this as the trap
 

3657
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,390
trade in case they use this as the trap
level. Remember we've talked about this.

3658
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:00,400
level. Remember we've talked about this.
 

3659
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,470
level. Remember we've talked about this.
It can be the trap level. Once they come

3660
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:02,480
It can be the trap level. Once they come
 

3661
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,990
It can be the trap level. Once they come
under here, you're starting to find bids

3662
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:04,000
under here, you're starting to find bids
 

3663
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,070
under here, you're starting to find bids
like we talked about. Like I said, it

3664
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:06,080
like we talked about. Like I said, it
 

3665
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,390
like we talked about. Like I said, it
finds acceptance or they will use it for

3666
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:08,400
finds acceptance or they will use it for
 

3667
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,030
finds acceptance or they will use it for
the trap because they know under here is

3668
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:11,040
the trap because they know under here is
 

3669
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:14,149
the trap because they know under here is
very thin down to here. All right? So,

3670
01:26:14,149 --> 01:26:14,159
very thin down to here. All right? So,
 

3671
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:15,990
very thin down to here. All right? So,
you must pay yourself into that because

3672
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:16,000
you must pay yourself into that because
 

3673
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,229
you must pay yourself into that because
you do not know if it collapses or does

3674
01:26:18,229 --> 01:26:18,239
you do not know if it collapses or does
 

3675
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,149
you do not know if it collapses or does
this. So, if you've got this to here,

3676
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:20,159
this. So, if you've got this to here,
 

3677
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:21,669
this. So, if you've got this to here,
that is a good chance to pay yourself

3678
01:26:21,669 --> 01:26:21,679
that is a good chance to pay yourself
 

3679
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:33,669
that is a good chance to pay yourself
some money and then hold runners.

3680
01:26:33,669 --> 01:26:33,679

 

3681
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:36,709

I can't trade right now. No, sorry. Not

3682
01:26:36,709 --> 01:26:36,719
I can't trade right now. No, sorry. Not
 

3683
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:37,910
I can't trade right now. No, sorry. Not

cuz I don't want to. I would have loved
to be in that. I can't get any data.

3686
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:40,880
to be in that. I can't get any data.
 

3687
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:43,910
to be in that. I can't get any data.

lose a few of those accounts. It's uh

3706
01:27:07,110 --> 01:27:07,120
lose a few of those accounts. It's uh
 

3707
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,550
lose a few of those accounts. It's uh
it's a shame because they had built up

3708
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:08,560
it's a shame because they had built up
 

3709
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:11,430
it's a shame because they had built up
some nice money in them, but I had some

3710
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:11,440
some nice money in them, but I had some
 

3711
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:14,550
some nice money in them, but I had some
stuff happen which I wasn't ready for.

3712
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:14,560
stuff happen which I wasn't ready for.
 

3713
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,390
stuff happen which I wasn't ready for.
Thanks for doing this, Alex. Trading is

3714
01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:16,400
Thanks for doing this, Alex. Trading is
 

3715
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,830
Thanks for doing this, Alex. Trading is
lonely sometimes and it's nice to have

3716
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:17,840
lonely sometimes and it's nice to have
 

3717
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,189
lonely sometimes and it's nice to have
someone to listen to. I agree. That's

3718
01:27:19,189 --> 01:27:19,199
someone to listen to. I agree. That's
 

3719
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:20,870
someone to listen to. I agree. That's
why we do it. That's exactly why we do

3720
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:20,880
why we do it. That's exactly why we do
 

3721
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,550
why we do it. That's exactly why we do
it.

3722
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:24,560

 

3723
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,709

It's not a bad, it hasn't been a bad

3724
01:27:26,709 --> 01:27:26,719
It's not a bad, it hasn't been a bad
 

3725
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:28,229
It's not a bad, it hasn't been a bad
session. If we draw out what we talked

3726
01:27:28,229 --> 01:27:28,239
session. If we draw out what we talked
 

3727
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:31,189
session. If we draw out what we talked
about and the only trade that I've said

3728
01:27:31,189 --> 01:27:31,199
about and the only trade that I've said
 

3729
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:35,990
about and the only trade that I've said
is valid today is this to here.

3730
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:36,000
is valid today is this to here.
 

3731
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,310
is valid today is this to here.
Right? That's your first trade. And if

3732
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:38,320
Right? That's your first trade. And if
 

3733
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:39,910
Right? That's your first trade. And if
the runner goes for you, you're looking

3734
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:39,920
the runner goes for you, you're looking
 

3735
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,950
the runner goes for you, you're looking
for this and this and maybe if you got

3736
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:42,960
for this and this and maybe if you got
 

3737
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,030
for this and this and maybe if you got
very lucky down to here. But you should

3738
01:27:45,030 --> 01:27:45,040
very lucky down to here. But you should
 

3739
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,790
very lucky down to here. But you should
have taken TP into the orange line. So

3740
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:46,800
have taken TP into the orange line. So
 

3741
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,310
have taken TP into the orange line. So
now you can see why the 92s are

3742
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:48,320
now you can see why the 92s are
 

3743
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,310
now you can see why the 92s are
important. Why I kept saying 92s is a

3744
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:50,320
important. Why I kept saying 92s is a
 

3745
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:54,070
important. Why I kept saying 92s is a
big level. There you go. So testing edge

3746
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:54,080
big level. There you go. So testing edge
 

3747
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,910
big level. There you go. So testing edge
of value. Now do they reject this?

3748
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:55,920
of value. Now do they reject this?
 

3749
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,430
of value. Now do they reject this?
Remember 50s is still important. If we

3750
01:27:57,430 --> 01:27:57,440
Remember 50s is still important. If we
 

3751
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,030
Remember 50s is still important. If we
come back to the 50s again, I'll be very

3752
01:27:59,030 --> 01:27:59,040
come back to the 50s again, I'll be very
 

3753
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,390
come back to the 50s again, I'll be very
very careful because we've been there a

3754
01:28:00,390 --> 01:28:00,400
very careful because we've been there a
 

3755
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,470
very careful because we've been there a
few times.

3756
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:02,480
few times.
 

3757
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,910
few times.
Where am I from? I'm originally from

3758
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:03,920
Where am I from? I'm originally from
 

3759
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,510
Where am I from? I'm originally from
London, but I live in Los Angeles

3760
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:05,520
London, but I live in Los Angeles
 

3761
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:09,110

What made me say that today is sleepy

3764
01:28:11,189 --> 01:28:11,199
What made me say that today is sleepy
 

3765
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:12,790
What made me say that today is sleepy
trading day? Meaning choppy or

3766
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:12,800
trading day? Meaning choppy or
 

3767
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,470
trading day? Meaning choppy or
relatively low volume? Did I say it's

3768
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:14,480
relatively low volume? Did I say it's
 

3769
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,310
relatively low volume? Did I say it's
sleepy? probably just because we weren't

3770
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:16,320
sleepy? probably just because we weren't
 

3771
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,910
sleepy? probably just because we weren't
moving.

3772
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:17,920
moving.
 

3773
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,470
moving.
It's more that the range uh if we think

3774
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:20,480
It's more that the range uh if we think
 

3775
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,149
It's more that the range uh if we think
about that opening range and we weren't

3776
01:28:22,149 --> 01:28:22,159
about that opening range and we weren't
 

3777
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:24,390
about that opening range and we weren't
moving outside of it, right? How big is

3778
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:24,400
moving outside of it, right? How big is
 

3779
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,430
moving outside of it, right? How big is
that opening range? 81 points. Not very

3780
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:27,440
that opening range? 81 points. Not very
 

3781
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,270
that opening range? 81 points. Not very
big. Initial balance 81 points. That's

3782
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:29,280
big. Initial balance 81 points. That's
 

3783
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,070
big. Initial balance 81 points. That's
not very big, right? So sleepy because

3784
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:32,080
not very big, right? So sleepy because
 

3785
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,350
not very big, right? So sleepy because
they probably need to build liquidity

coming out? I assume it's FMC. Yeah,

in is use the current profile and I
 

3899
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,709
in is use the current profile and I
would look at the uh anchored VWAPS. I

3900

would look at the uh anchored VWAPS. I
 

3901
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:10,470
would look at the uh anchored VWAPS. I
would use anchored VWAPs for FOMOC on

01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:10,480
would use anchored VWAPs for FOMOC on
 

3903
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,629
would use anchored VWAPs for FOMOC on
the print. Okay. So, still rejecting

3904
01:31:12,629 --> 01:31:12,639
the print. Okay. So, still rejecting
 

3905
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:14,709
the print. Okay. So, still rejecting
this node here, which is a good sign for

3906
01:31:14,709 --> 01:31:14,719
this node here, which is a good sign for
 

3907
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,629
this node here, which is a good sign for
you guys in short. So, failure to get

01:31:16,629 --> 01:31:16,639
you guys in short. So, failure to get
 

3909
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:18,070

back up to the 50s. So, we're starting
 

3911
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,510
back up to the 50s. So, we're starting
to make lower highs. If we think about

3912
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:19,520
to make lower highs. If we think about
 

3913
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,510
to make lower highs. If we think about
this, we've broken down away from this

3914
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:21,520
this, we've broken down away from this
 

3915
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:24,229
this, we've broken down away from this
now. We've trapped buyers at 50s. We're

01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:24,239
now. We've trapped buyers at 50s. We're
 

3917
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:26,070
now. We've trapped buyers at 50s. We're
not letting those buyers out. We're

3918
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:26,080
not letting those buyers out. We're
 

3919
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,830
not letting those buyers out. We're
starting to see continuation. We're

3920
01:31:27,830 --> 01:31:27,840
starting to see continuation. We're
 

3921
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,669
starting to see continuation. We're
starting to reject this now. This is now

3922
01:31:29,669 --> 01:31:29,679
starting to reject this now. This is now
 

3923
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:32,470
starting to reject this now. This is now
another lower high. And 92s is coming.

3924
01:31:32,470 --> 01:31:32,480
another lower high. And 92s is coming.
 

3925

another lower high. And 92s is coming.
And the big question is, can you get

3926
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:34,080
And the big question is, can you get

And the big question is, can you get
down into any of these? These gray boxes

3928
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:36,800
down into any of these? These gray boxes
 

3929
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,709
down into any of these? These gray boxes
are some of your cover points. It looks

3930
01:31:38,709 --> 01:31:38,719
are some of your cover points. It looks
 

3931
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:40,629

01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:29,360
time frame pullback. And then down here,
 

4167
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:32,790
time frame pullback. And then down here,
we might see some absorption.

4168
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:32,800
we might see some absorption.

What is my entry method? And what do you
mean? I look for trap players. We've

4230
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:08,960
mean? I look for trap players. We've
 

4231
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:11,109
mean? I look for trap players. We've
gone over this quite a few times today.

gone over this quite a few times today.
 

4233
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:13,590

Right. So the short today, why was it

4234
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:13,600
Right. So the short today, why was it
 

4235
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,669
Right. So the short today, why was it
50s? We kept calling it a 50s. When we

4236
01:39:15,669 --> 01:39:15,679
50s? We kept calling it a 50s. When we
 

4237
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:17,910
50s? We kept calling it a 50s. When we
were here, I said if we leave 50s and

4238
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:17,920
were here, I said if we leave 50s and
 

4239
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,470
were here, I said if we leave 50s and
hold against 50s, it's a short, right?

4240
01:39:20,470 --> 01:39:20,480
hold against 50s, it's a short, right?
 

4241
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,709
hold against 50s, it's a short, right?

here and here and all we are doing is
rejecting the trap buyers right now.

This 92 is still key. Remember, if we go
 

4291
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,149

back inside 92s, I'd be somewhat
 

4293
01:40:46,159 --> 01:40:47,430
back inside 92s, I'd be somewhat
concerned, but it's still rejecting it.

4361
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:11,109
one there. All right. So, ES finding a

all the time we're outside of IB on ES

4366

4373
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,030

scenes soulless? I've been to IBA a

4784
01:52:14,709 --> 01:52:14,719
scenes soulless? I've been to IBA a
 

4785
01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:16,229
scenes soulless? I've been to IBA a
bunch of times and some people were so

4786
01:52:16,229 --> 01:52:16,239
bunch of times and some people were so
 

4787
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:18,149
bunch of times and some people were so
fake or a lot of people were very fake.

4788
01:52:18,149 --> 01:52:18,159
fake or a lot of people were very fake.
 

4789

It got worse and worse and worse. I'd

4790
01:52:19,669 --> 01:52:19,679
It got worse and worse and worse. I'd
 

4791
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:21,030
It got worse and worse and worse. I'd
imagine it's pretty poor now. I went

4792
01:52:21,030 --> 01:52:21,040
imagine it's pretty poor now. I went
 

4793
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:22,870
imagine it's pretty poor now. I went
back to IA this year. I actually quite

4794
01:52:22,870 --> 01:52:22,880
back to IA this year. I actually quite
 

4795
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:25,990
back to IA this year. I actually quite
enjoyed it. Um, but I mean I had a

01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:26,000
enjoyed it. Um, but I mean I had a
 

4797
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,750

residency there every year for 10 years
 

4799
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:29,669
residency there every year for 10 years
and I would say it definitely got worse

4800
01:52:29,669 --> 01:52:29,679
and I would say it definitely got worse
 

4801
01:52:29,679 --> 01:52:32,149
and I would say it definitely got worse
and worse and worse. The early days were

4802
01:52:32,149 --> 01:52:32,159
and worse and worse. The early days were
 

4803
01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:33,669
and worse and worse. The early days were
really good. I've been going there since

01:52:33,669 --> 01:52:33,679
really good. I've been going there since
 

4805

No way. You made so so freaking tight. I

4868
01:54:07,109 --> 01:54:07,119
No way. You made so so freaking tight. I
 

4869
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:11,589
No way. You made so so freaking tight. I
did. I did make so freaking tight. Yes.

4870
01:54:11,589 --> 01:54:11,599
did. I did make so freaking tight. Yes.
 

4871
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:21,030
did. I did make so freaking tight. Yes.
Taking you back there, eh?

4872
01:54:21,030 --> 01:54:21,040

 

4873
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:22,709

Could one suggest a level to get short

4874
01:54:22,709 --> 01:54:22,719
Could one suggest a level to get short
 

4875
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:24,550
Could one suggest a level to get short
in this or is it too late? I'd be

4876
01:54:24,550 --> 01:54:24,560
in this or is it too late? I'd be
 

4877
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:26,950
in this or is it too late? I'd be
somewhat careful now because you're

4878
01:54:26,950 --> 01:54:26,960
somewhat careful now because you're
 

4879
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:28,629
somewhat careful now because you're
coming down to target. So, you would

4880
01:54:28,629 --> 01:54:28,639
coming down to target. So, you would
 

4881
01:54:28,639 --> 01:54:32,149
coming down to target. So, you would
need to see a rejection here, right? IB

4882
01:54:32,149 --> 01:54:32,159
need to see a rejection here, right? IB
 

4883
01:54:32,159 --> 01:54:34,550
need to see a rejection here, right? IB
and here, but I'd be I'd be somewhat

4884
01:54:34,550 --> 01:54:34,560
and here, but I'd be I'd be somewhat
 

4885
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:38,229
and here, but I'd be I'd be somewhat
careful. um you'd need a push into here

4886
01:54:38,229 --> 01:54:38,239
careful. um you'd need a push into here
 

4887
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:40,390
careful. um you'd need a push into here
that is significant bias trap to know

4888
01:54:40,390 --> 01:54:40,400
that is significant bias trap to know
 

4889
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,229
that is significant bias trap to know
that we're coming lower. I would be

4890
01:54:42,229 --> 01:54:42,239
that we're coming lower. I would be
 

4891
01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:43,510
that we're coming lower. I would be
somewhat careful. The reason I'm saying

4892
01:54:43,510 --> 01:54:43,520
somewhat careful. The reason I'm saying
 

4893
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:45,669
somewhat careful. The reason I'm saying
that is if you look at the divergence to

4894
01:54:45,669 --> 01:54:45,679
that is if you look at the divergence to
 

4895
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:47,990
that is if you look at the divergence to
ES. All right, ES has already done the

4896
01:54:47,990 --> 01:54:48,000
ES. All right, ES has already done the
 

4897
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,149
ES. All right, ES has already done the
move we would look for for the gap fill.

4898
01:54:50,149 --> 01:54:50,159
move we would look for for the gap fill.
 

4899
01:54:50,159 --> 01:54:51,430
move we would look for for the gap fill.
All right, so if we think about this,

4900
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:51,440
All right, so if we think about this,
 

4901
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:53,510
All right, so if we think about this,
here's your gap fill. All right, so ES

4902
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:53,520
here's your gap fill. All right, so ES
 

4903
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,910
here's your gap fill. All right, so ES
has just filled the gap. It's trading

4904
01:54:55,910 --> 01:54:55,920
has just filled the gap. It's trading
 

4905
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:58,229
has just filled the gap. It's trading
back at IB. All right, if ES starts

4906
01:54:58,229 --> 01:54:58,239
back at IB. All right, if ES starts
 

4907
01:54:58,239 --> 01:54:59,589
back at IB. All right, if ES starts
putting in higher lows here and

4908
01:54:59,589 --> 01:54:59,599
putting in higher lows here and
 

4909
01:54:59,599 --> 01:55:01,189
putting in higher lows here and
reclaiming IB, then it's going to go

4910
01:55:01,189 --> 01:55:01,199
reclaiming IB, then it's going to go
 

4911
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:03,109
reclaiming IB, then it's going to go
back up here and that's going to be a

4912
01:55:03,109 --> 01:55:03,119
back up here and that's going to be a
 

4913
01:55:03,119 --> 01:55:04,229
back up here and that's going to be a
problem. and it's going to drag and

4914
01:55:04,229 --> 01:55:04,239
problem. and it's going to drag and
 

4915
01:55:04,239 --> 01:55:06,629
problem. and it's going to drag and
queue. I would assume SPY's now filled

4916
01:55:06,629 --> 01:55:06,639
queue. I would assume SPY's now filled
 

4917
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:08,950
queue. I would assume SPY's now filled
its gap. Well, it's a a tick or two

4918
01:55:08,950 --> 01:55:08,960
its gap. Well, it's a a tick or two
 

4919
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:11,270
its gap. Well, it's a a tick or two
short. So, SPY, the cash ETF, got very

4920
01:55:11,270 --> 01:55:11,280
short. So, SPY, the cash ETF, got very
 

4921
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,270
short. So, SPY, the cash ETF, got very
close to gap fill as well, right?

4922
01:55:13,270 --> 01:55:13,280
close to gap fill as well, right?
 

4923
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,030
close to gap fill as well, right?
Whereas the Q's, we're lagging behind.

4924
01:55:15,030 --> 01:55:15,040
Whereas the Q's, we're lagging behind.
 

4925
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:16,390
Whereas the Q's, we're lagging behind.
So, we've got relative strength in the

4926
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:16,400
So, we've got relative strength in the
 

4927
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:19,750
So, we've got relative strength in the
Q's because Gapill's way down here.

4928
01:55:19,750 --> 01:55:19,760
Q's because Gapill's way down here.
 

4929
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:21,669
Q's because Gapill's way down here.
I would be skeptical about an ad on the

01:55:21,669 --> 01:55:21,679
I would be skeptical about an ad on the
 

4931
01:55:21,679 --> 01:55:23,750
I would be skeptical about an ad on the
short now.

4932
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:23,760
short now.
 

4933
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:26,470
short now.
Not the safest bet. It would be more

4934
01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:26,480
Not the safest bet. It would be more
 

4935
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:28,229
Not the safest bet. It would be more
about holding it unless you see a spike

4936
01:55:28,229 --> 01:55:28,239
about holding it unless you see a spike
 

4937
01:55:28,239 --> 01:55:30,310
about holding it unless you see a spike
up, you know, unless you see a push up

4938
01:55:30,310 --> 01:55:30,320
up, you know, unless you see a push up
 

4939
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:31,830
up, you know, unless you see a push up
here

4940
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:31,840
here
 

4941
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:34,629
here
and we see You know, let's say these

4942
01:55:34,629 --> 01:55:34,639
and we see You know, let's say these
 

4943
01:55:34,639 --> 01:55:38,390
and we see You know, let's say these
these imbalances filled in.

4944
01:55:38,390 --> 01:55:38,400
these imbalances filled in.
 

4945
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:40,310
these imbalances filled in.
Jesus Christ. These imbalances filled

4946
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:40,320
Jesus Christ. These imbalances filled
 

4947
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:41,990
Jesus Christ. These imbalances filled
in. We see trapped buyers. Then maybe

4948
01:55:41,990 --> 01:55:42,000
in. We see trapped buyers. Then maybe
 

4949
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,430
in. We see trapped buyers. Then maybe
you could think about it. But I'd be

4950
01:55:43,430 --> 01:55:43,440
you could think about it. But I'd be
 

4951
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:45,830
you could think about it. But I'd be
somewhat skeptical about trying to get

4952
01:55:45,830 --> 01:55:45,840
somewhat skeptical about trying to get
 

4953
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:56,950
somewhat skeptical about trying to get
an ad this late in the day.

Roger Sanchez was like how I fell in

4972
01:56:25,030 --> 01:56:25,040
Roger Sanchez was like how I fell in
 

4973
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:26,629
Roger Sanchez was like how I fell in
love with house music and he became one

4974
01:56:26,629 --> 01:56:26,639
love with house music and he became one
 

4975
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:28,950
love with house music and he became one
of my mentors. So for him, for me, he's

4976
01:56:28,950 --> 01:56:28,960
of my mentors. So for him, for me, he's
 

4977
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:31,830
of my mentors. So for him, for me, he's
right up there watching this now guys to

4978
01:56:31,830 --> 01:56:31,840
right up there watching this now guys to
 

4979
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:33,109
right up there watching this now guys to
see if you see a spike in buyers

4980
01:56:33,109 --> 01:56:33,119
see if you see a spike in buyers
 

4981
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:34,709
see if you see a spike in buyers
trapped. ES starting to reclaim initial

4982
01:56:34,709 --> 01:56:34,719
trapped. ES starting to reclaim initial
 

4983
01:56:34,719 --> 01:56:36,629
trapped. ES starting to reclaim initial
balance. So you will need to see buyers

4984
01:56:36,629 --> 01:56:36,639
balance. So you will need to see buyers
 

4985
01:56:36,639 --> 01:56:37,830
balance. So you will need to see buyers
get trapped here. If they do not get

4986
01:56:37,830 --> 01:56:37,840
get trapped here. If they do not get
 

4987
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,109
get trapped here. If they do not get
trapped here, it means we're going to go

4988
01:56:39,109 --> 01:56:39,119
trapped here, it means we're going to go
 

4989
01:56:39,119 --> 01:56:41,189
trapped here, it means we're going to go
right back inside and trade back up to

4990
01:56:41,189 --> 01:56:41,199
right back inside and trade back up to
 

4991
01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:42,790
right back inside and trade back up to
these levels up here. So you want to be

4992
01:56:42,790 --> 01:56:42,800
these levels up here. So you want to be
 

4993
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:48,390
these levels up here. So you want to be
very careful. Um EZ, of course,

4994
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:48,400
very careful. Um EZ, of course,
 

4995
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:50,550
very careful. Um EZ, of course,
there's t like there's so many all the

4996
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:50,560
there's t like there's so many all the
 

4997
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,229
there's t like there's so many all the
older guys, the legends. I I don't like

4998
01:56:52,229 --> 01:56:52,239
older guys, the legends. I I don't like
 

4999
01:56:52,239 --> 01:56:54,229
older guys, the legends. I I don't like
it now how people mix between songs in

5000
01:56:54,229 --> 01:56:54,239
it now how people mix between songs in
 

5001
01:56:54,239 --> 01:57:06,629
it now how people mix between songs in
like 30 seconds. I hate all that [\h__\h]

5002
01:57:06,629 --> 01:57:06,639

 

5003
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:08,470

In your humble opinion, the reason price

5004
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:08,480
In your humble opinion, the reason price
 

5005
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:10,149
In your humble opinion, the reason price
is falling is because ES hit a major

5006
01:57:10,149 --> 01:57:10,159
is falling is because ES hit a major
 

5007
01:57:10,159 --> 01:57:12,790
is falling is because ES hit a major
resistance level and NQ following ES. Am

01:57:12,790 --> 01:57:12,800
resistance level and NQ following ES. Am

I correct? You are not correct. You're

5010
01:57:15,430 --> 01:57:15,440
I correct? You are not correct. You're
 

5011
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:17,430
I correct? You are not correct. You're
not correct. It might be why ES is

5012
01:57:17,430 --> 01:57:17,440
not correct. It might be why ES is
 

5013
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:19,510
not correct. It might be why ES is
falling. ENQ is falling because we're

5014
01:57:19,510 --> 01:57:19,520
falling. ENQ is falling because we're
 

5015
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:21,189
falling. ENQ is falling because we're
trading into thin volume. So, it's not

5016
01:57:21,189 --> 01:57:21,199
trading into thin volume. So, it's not
 

5017
01:57:21,199 --> 01:57:22,629
trading into thin volume. So, it's not
about necessarily a major resistance

5018
01:57:22,629 --> 01:57:22,639
about necessarily a major resistance
 

5019
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:24,310
about necessarily a major resistance
level, although we did hit major

5020
01:57:24,310 --> 01:57:24,320
level, although we did hit major
 

5021
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:26,950
level, although we did hit major
resistance. It's more about this, right?

5022
01:57:26,950 --> 01:57:26,960
resistance. It's more about this, right?
 

5023
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:29,189
resistance. It's more about this, right?
We've got supply and we've got buyers

5024
01:57:29,189 --> 01:57:29,199
We've got supply and we've got buyers
 

5025
01:57:29,199 --> 01:57:31,589
We've got supply and we've got buyers
stuck. So, we fall all the time. Buyers

5026
01:57:31,589 --> 01:57:31,599
stuck. So, we fall all the time. Buyers
 

5027
01:57:31,599 --> 01:57:33,830
stuck. So, we fall all the time. Buyers
remain stuck. All right. It's just a

5028
01:57:33,830 --> 01:57:33,840
remain stuck. All right. It's just a
 

5029
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,990
remain stuck. All right. It's just a
pullback. It is a pullback leg until

5030
01:57:35,990 --> 01:57:36,000
pullback. It is a pullback leg until
 

5031
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,270
pullback. It is a pullback leg until
proves otherwise. We've gone over this

5032
01:57:37,270 --> 01:57:37,280
proves otherwise. We've gone over this
 

5033
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:39,589
proves otherwise. We've gone over this
so many times. Here's the trend. Here's

5034
01:57:39,589 --> 01:57:39,599
so many times. Here's the trend. Here's
 

5035
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:41,270
so many times. Here's the trend. Here's
the pullback. It might very well

5036
01:57:41,270 --> 01:57:41,280
the pullback. It might very well
 

5037
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,830
the pullback. It might very well
continue higher.

5038
01:57:43,830 --> 01:57:43,840
continue higher.
 

5039
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:46,310
continue higher.

and vice versa. They are different. All
 

5043
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:51,910
and vice versa. They are different. All
right? It depends what the stocks within

5044
01:57:51,910 --> 01:57:51,920
right? It depends what the stocks within
 

5045
01:57:51,920 --> 01:58:04,950
right? It depends what the stocks within
each index are doing.

5047
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:06,709

Uh, chasing status. Yeah, they are

01:58:06,709 --> 01:58:06,719
Uh, chasing status. Yeah, they are
 

5049
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:11,990
Uh, chasing status. Yeah, they are
legends.

5050
01:58:11,990 --> 01:58:12,000

 

5051
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,910

20 years, man. This guy's doing it. I

5052
01:58:13,910 --> 01:58:13,920
20 years, man. This guy's doing it. I
 

5053
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:16,550
20 years, man. This guy's doing it. I
mean, I'm 40, right? I was going I was

5054
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:16,560
mean, I'm 40, right? I was going I was
 

5055
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:19,510
mean, I'm 40, right? I was going I was
going to watch Roger when I was 13, and

5056
01:58:19,510 --> 01:58:19,520
going to watch Roger when I was 13, and
 

5057
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:20,870
going to watch Roger when I was 13, and
he would have been going even longer

5058
01:58:20,870 --> 01:58:20,880
he would have been going even longer
 

5059
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:22,390
he would have been going even longer
than that. So, he's been going 30 plus

5060
01:58:22,390 --> 01:58:22,400
than that. So, he's been going 30 plus
 

5061
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:25,669
than that. So, he's been going 30 plus
years. All those guys like Todd, Roger,

5062
01:58:25,669 --> 01:58:25,679
years. All those guys like Todd, Roger,

01:59:02,229 --> 01:59:02,239
What was the channel called though? I
 

5077
01:59:02,239 --> 01:59:03,510
What was the channel called though? I
might have missed it. I want to know if

5078
01:59:03,510 --> 01:59:03,520
might have missed it. I want to know if
 

5079
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:07,589
might have missed it. I want to know if
I know the channel.

Unless your name's Nick, you're not

01:59:11,669 --> 01:59:11,679
selected. So,
 

5085
01:59:11,679 --> 01:59:15,750
selected. So,
I wonder who you are.

5102
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:47,360

 

5103
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:49,270

What gap do I speak of? Previous day

5104
01:59:49,270 --> 01:59:49,280
What gap do I speak of? Previous day
 

5105
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:52,550
What gap do I speak of? Previous day
high. No, previous day close. Cash gap.

5106
01:59:52,550 --> 01:59:52,560
high. No, previous day close. Cash gap.
 

5107
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:55,030

Four o'clock close. So, I always trade

5108
01:59:55,030 --> 01:59:55,040
Four o'clock close. So, I always trade
 

5109
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:56,790
Four o'clock close. So, I always trade
cash gaps. I'm always interested in cash

5110
01:59:56,790 --> 01:59:56,800
cash gaps. I'm always interested in cash
 

5111
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:58,790
cash gaps. I'm always interested in cash
gaps because cash is where most of the

5112
01:59:58,790 --> 01:59:58,800
gaps because cash is where most of the
 

5113
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:00,470
gaps because cash is where most of the
money is traded, right? So, 4:00 cash

5114
02:00:00,470 --> 02:00:00,480
money is traded, right? So, 4:00 cash
 

5115
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:01,910
money is traded, right? So, 4:00 cash
gap is here. But again, we've closed it

5116
02:00:01,910 --> 02:00:01,920
gap is here. But again, we've closed it
 

5117
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:04,149
gap is here. But again, we've closed it
on ES. We have relative strength. We're

5118
02:00:04,149 --> 02:00:04,159
on ES. We have relative strength. We're
 

5119
02:00:04,159 --> 02:00:06,229
on ES. We have relative strength. We're
holding up. Okay. It doesn't have to

5120
02:00:06,229 --> 02:00:06,239
holding up. Okay. It doesn't have to
 

5121
02:00:06,239 --> 02:00:09,430
holding up. Okay. It doesn't have to
come down here. Remember this right

5122
02:00:09,430 --> 02:00:09,440
come down here. Remember this right
 

5123
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:11,750
come down here. Remember this right
underneath this. This was a high volume

5124
02:00:11,750 --> 02:00:11,760
underneath this. This was a high volume
 

5125
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:13,669
underneath this. This was a high volume
node here. This can be still be a failed

5126
02:00:13,669 --> 02:00:13,679
node here. This can be still be a failed
 

5127
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:15,669
node here. This can be still be a failed
auction and a reclaim and a trade

5128
02:00:15,669 --> 02:00:15,679
auction and a reclaim and a trade
 

5129

upside. It doesn't have to come down

5130
02:00:17,270 --> 02:00:17,280
upside. It doesn't have to come down
 

5131
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:18,950
upside. It doesn't have to come down
here. It'd be preferable if it does

5132
02:00:18,950 --> 02:00:18,960
here. It'd be preferable if it does
 

5133
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:20,870
here. It'd be preferable if it does
because it offers a better bid up, but

5134
02:00:20,870 --> 02:00:20,880
because it offers a better bid up, but
 

5135
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:26,790
because it offers a better bid up, but
it doesn't have to do it.

5136
02:00:26,790 --> 02:00:26,800

 

5137
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:28,390

Where do I want to go long? For me, I

5138
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:28,400
Where do I want to go long? For me, I
 

5139
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:30,390
Where do I want to go long? For me, I
want to go long down here. That's where

5140
02:00:30,390 --> 02:00:30,400
want to go long down here. That's where
 

5141
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:32,070
want to go long down here. That's where
I want to go long. I'm There's not going

02:00:32,070 --> 02:00:32,080
I want to go long. I'm There's not going
 

5143
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:33,510
I want to go long. I'm There's not going
to be a trade setting up today. It's

5144
02:00:33,510 --> 02:00:33,520
to be a trade setting up today. It's
 

5145
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:34,790
to be a trade setting up today. It's
going to have Well, there might be this

5146
02:00:34,790 --> 02:00:34,800
going to have Well, there might be this
 

5147
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:38,390
going to have Well, there might be this
afternoon. Like, let's move you to high

5148
02:00:38,390 --> 02:00:38,400
afternoon. Like, let's move you to high
 

5149
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:40,950
afternoon. Like, let's move you to high
time frame quickly. Right. This is these

5150
02:00:40,950 --> 02:00:40,960
time frame quickly. Right. This is these
 

5151
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:43,589
time frame quickly. Right. This is these
are the areas. Look at these nodes. this

5152
02:00:43,589 --> 02:00:43,599
are the areas. Look at these nodes. this
 

5153
02:00:43,599 --> 02:00:45,270
are the areas. Look at these nodes. this
back to fair value back to here.

5154
02:00:45,270 --> 02:00:45,280
back to fair value back to here.
 

5155
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:47,430
back to fair value back to here.
Somewhere in here would be lovely. It

5156
02:00:47,430 --> 02:00:47,440
Somewhere in here would be lovely. It
 

5157
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:49,350
Somewhere in here would be lovely. It
might be that it holds it and reclaims

5158
02:00:49,350 --> 02:00:49,360
might be that it holds it and reclaims
 

5159
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:51,510
might be that it holds it and reclaims
which is fine. If it does that, we can

5160
02:00:51,510 --> 02:00:51,520
which is fine. If it does that, we can
 

5161
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:53,350
which is fine. If it does that, we can
join later on. We can join on this dip

5162
02:00:53,350 --> 02:00:53,360
join later on. We can join on this dip
 

5163
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:55,510
join later on. We can join on this dip
here once it's proven itself. But if we

5164
02:00:55,510 --> 02:00:55,520
here once it's proven itself. But if we
 

5165
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:57,910
here once it's proven itself. But if we
can come down here and trap into here,

5166
02:00:57,910 --> 02:00:57,920
can come down here and trap into here,
 

5167
02:00:57,920 --> 02:01:00,149
can come down here and trap into here,
great. We can get long here. We can add

5168
02:01:00,149 --> 02:01:00,159
great. We can get long here. We can add
 

5169
02:01:00,159 --> 02:01:02,629
great. We can get long here. We can add
on here and we can get that continuation

5170
02:01:02,629 --> 02:01:02,639
on here and we can get that continuation
 

5171
02:01:02,639 --> 02:01:04,470
on here and we can get that continuation
trade. If we let go of this, all right,

5172
02:01:04,470 --> 02:01:04,480
trade. If we let go of this, all right,
 

5173
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:07,030
trade. If we let go of this, all right,
and we stay heavy, then we will be short

5174
02:01:07,030 --> 02:01:07,040
and we stay heavy, then we will be short
 

5175
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:09,270
and we stay heavy, then we will be short
for that rotation down into this load

5176
02:01:09,270 --> 02:01:09,280
for that rotation down into this load
 

5177
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:10,870
for that rotation down into this load
here over the next few days. So, we're

5178
02:01:10,870 --> 02:01:10,880
here over the next few days. So, we're
 

5179
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:12,390
here over the next few days. So, we're
setting up well. Look, we're extended

5180
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:12,400
setting up well. Look, we're extended
 

5181
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:15,510
setting up well. Look, we're extended
up. We would expect a bounce at some

5182
02:01:15,510 --> 02:01:15,520
up. We would expect a bounce at some
 

5183
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,669
up. We would expect a bounce at some
point, but ideally we find that first

5184
02:01:17,669 --> 02:01:17,679
point, but ideally we find that first
 

5185
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:19,030
point, but ideally we find that first
bounce from here. And if they're too

5186
02:01:19,030 --> 02:01:19,040
bounce from here. And if they're too
 

5187
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:20,629
bounce from here. And if they're too
trapped here, then we're going to a

5188
02:01:20,629 --> 02:01:20,639
trapped here, then we're going to a
 

5189
02:01:20,639 --> 02:01:22,390
trapped here, then we're going to a
range here for a bit. And then we look

5190
02:01:22,390 --> 02:01:22,400
range here for a bit. And then we look
 

5191
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:24,550
range here for a bit. And then we look
for acceptance above or below when we

5192
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:24,560
for acceptance above or below when we
 

5193
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:25,750
for acceptance above or below when we
get there. But we got to let it build

5194
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:25,760
get there. But we got to let it build
 

5195
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,990
get there. But we got to let it build
out for a little bit. So this is why I

5196
02:01:27,990 --> 02:01:28,000
out for a little bit. So this is why I
 

5197
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,470
out for a little bit. So this is why I
say I wouldn't be short down here.

5198
02:01:30,470 --> 02:01:30,480
say I wouldn't be short down here.
 

5199
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:32,870
say I wouldn't be short down here.

auction here is not too bad. If you

it's setting up better on ES. It's still

5234
02:02:31,430 --> 02:02:31,440
it's setting up better on ES. It's still
 

5235
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:33,430
it's setting up better on ES. It's still
a short because you're still under IB.

5236
02:02:33,430 --> 02:02:33,440
a short because you're still under IB.
 

5237

a short because you're still under IB.
But if you start to build out liquidity

5240
02:02:37,350 --> 02:02:37,360
here and keep trapping shorts down here,

reclaims this, there can be relief, but

5254
02:02:53,830 --> 02:02:53,840
reclaims this, there can be relief, but
 

5255
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:55,750
reclaims this, there can be relief, but
much better down here if possible. Much

And what I would ideally like to see is
in here

5550
02:12:04,390 --> 02:12:04,400
in here
 

5551
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:07,270
in here
sellers get trapped. All right, that's

5552
02:12:07,270 --> 02:12:07,280
sellers get trapped. All right, that's
 

5553
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:09,589
sellers get trapped. All right, that's
what I'd ideally like to see something

5554
02:12:09,589 --> 02:12:09,599
what I'd ideally like to see something
 

5555
02:12:09,599 --> 02:12:12,950
what I'd ideally like to see something
like this in here. And I want them to

5556
02:12:12,950 --> 02:12:12,960
like this in here. And I want them to
 

5557
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:14,950
like this in here. And I want them to
use FOMC

5558
02:12:14,950 --> 02:12:14,960
use FOMC
 

5559
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:16,870
use FOMC
as a way of like trapping them and then

5560
02:12:16,870 --> 02:12:16,880
as a way of like trapping them and then
 

5561
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:19,510
as a way of like trapping them and then
rip it back up. That's the ideal world.

5562
02:12:19,510 --> 02:12:19,520
rip it back up. That's the ideal world.
 

5563
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:22,069
rip it back up. That's the ideal world.
If we don't do that and buyers try and

5564
02:12:22,069 --> 02:12:22,079
If we don't do that and buyers try and
 

5565
02:12:22,079 --> 02:12:23,589
If we don't do that and buyers try and
come in and they get caught and we

5566
02:12:23,589 --> 02:12:23,599
come in and they get caught and we
 

5567
02:12:23,599 --> 02:12:25,109
come in and they get caught and we
reject it, then we can play that

5568
02:12:25,109 --> 02:12:25,119
reject it, then we can play that
 

5569
02:12:25,119 --> 02:12:28,390
reject it, then we can play that
rotation back down into here.

5570
02:12:28,390 --> 02:12:28,400
rotation back down into here.
 

5571
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:29,990
rotation back down into here.
Ideally, we want to play upside where

5572
02:12:29,990 --> 02:12:30,000
Ideally, we want to play upside where
 

5573
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,510
Ideally, we want to play upside where
possible. But if it needs a deeper

5574
02:12:31,510 --> 02:12:31,520
possible. But if it needs a deeper
 

5575
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:34,870
possible. But if it needs a deeper
rotation, right, if it wants to let go

5576
02:12:34,870 --> 02:12:34,880
rotation, right, if it wants to let go
 

5577
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:38,470
rotation, right, if it wants to let go
of uh you know these 100s and 26,000,

5578
02:12:38,470 --> 02:12:38,480
of uh you know these 100s and 26,000,
 

5579
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:40,550
of uh you know these 100s and 26,000,
then it is welcome to come to 900. We

5580
02:12:40,550 --> 02:12:40,560
then it is welcome to come to 900. We
 

5581
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:42,790
then it is welcome to come to 900. We
cannot rule it out back down to 900. It

5582
02:12:42,790 --> 02:12:42,800
cannot rule it out back down to 900. It
 

5583
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:44,310
cannot rule it out back down to 900. It
will still be a breakout pullback, but

5584
02:12:44,310 --> 02:12:44,320
will still be a breakout pullback, but
 

5585
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:46,470
will still be a breakout pullback, but
it would be much stronger if we can just

5586
02:12:46,470 --> 02:12:46,480
it would be much stronger if we can just
 

5587
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:48,069
it would be much stronger if we can just
fade into here, trap sellers, and then

5588
02:12:48,069 --> 02:12:48,079
fade into here, trap sellers, and then
 

5589
02:12:48,079 --> 02:12:50,149
fade into here, trap sellers, and then
bid back up. That would be the best

5590
02:12:50,149 --> 02:12:50,159
bid back up. That would be the best
 

5591
02:12:50,159 --> 02:12:59,109
bid back up. That would be the best
possible scenario in my opinion.

5592
02:12:59,109 --> 02:12:59,119

 

5593
02:12:59,119 --> 02:13:01,109

Say theoretically you were trading with

5594
02:13:01,109 --> 02:13:01,119
Say theoretically you were trading with
 

5595
02:13:01,119 --> 02:13:04,390
Say theoretically you were trading with

there was cash pool.
 

5605
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:17,589
there was cash pool.
Did I miss the first part of the

5606
02:13:17,589 --> 02:13:17,599
Did I miss the first part of the
 

5607
02:13:17,599 --> 02:13:19,910
Did I miss the first part of the
question? Sorry mate. Let say

5608
02:13:19,910 --> 02:13:19,920
question? Sorry mate. Let say
 

5609
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:21,589
question? Sorry mate. Let say
theoretically you were trading with

5610
02:13:21,589 --> 02:13:21,599
theoretically you were trading with
 

5611
02:13:21,599 --> 02:13:24,390
theoretically you were trading with
funded accounts and counter traded. So

5612
02:13:24,390 --> 02:13:24,400
funded accounts and counter traded. So
 

5613
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:26,550
funded accounts and counter traded. So
traded like instruments against each

5614
02:13:26,550 --> 02:13:26,560
traded like instruments against each
 

5615
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:28,950
traded like instruments against each
other and got banned and all other prop

02:13:33,910 --> 02:13:33,920
six day evaluation phase if there was a
 

5621
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:35,589
six day evaluation phase if there was a

bull run and you didn't have time to go

5624
02:13:38,390 --> 02:13:38,400
bull run and you didn't have time to go
 

5625
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:40,709
bull run and you didn't have time to go
through the week long eval phase. How

5626
02:13:40,709 --> 02:13:40,719
through the week long eval phase. How
 

5627
02:13:40,719 --> 02:13:43,430
through the week long eval phase. How
would you go about theoretically using

5628
02:13:43,430 --> 02:13:43,440
would you go about theoretically using
 

5629
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:46,229
would you go about theoretically using
your own 10k to bypass the prop pending?

5630
02:13:46,229 --> 02:13:46,239
your own 10k to bypass the prop pending?
 

5631
02:13:46,239 --> 02:13:47,430
your own 10k to bypass the prop pending?
I'm not really sure what you're asking

5632
02:13:47,430 --> 02:13:47,440
I'm not really sure what you're asking
 

5633
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:49,270
I'm not really sure what you're asking
there mate.

5634
02:13:49,270 --> 02:13:49,280
there mate.
 

5635
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:51,830
there mate.
Are you asking how I trade 10k cash or

5636
02:13:51,830 --> 02:13:51,840
Are you asking how I trade 10k cash or
 

5637
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:54,310
Are you asking how I trade 10k cash or
or what what are you what are you

5638
02:13:54,310 --> 02:13:54,320
or what what are you what are you
 

5639
02:13:54,320 --> 02:14:04,470
or what what are you what are you
actually asking?

5640
02:14:04,470 --> 02:14:04,480

 

5641
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:05,830

Thank you. Hit my target for the week.

5642
02:14:05,830 --> 02:14:05,840
Thank you. Hit my target for the week.
 

5643
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:09,750
Thank you. Hit my target for the week.
Nice.

5644
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:09,760

 

5645
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:11,589

Any trade available? I mean the one the

5646
02:14:11,589 --> 02:14:11,599
Any trade available? I mean the one the
 

5647
02:14:11,599 --> 02:14:13,830
Any trade available? I mean the one the
one you're in now. That's it. That's it.

5648
02:14:13,830 --> 02:14:13,840
one you're in now. That's it. That's it.
 

5649
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:15,669
one you're in now. That's it. That's it.
Until until you see a pivot now, I

5650
02:14:15,669 --> 02:14:15,679
Until until you see a pivot now, I
 

5651
02:14:15,679 --> 02:14:17,030
Until until you see a pivot now, I
wouldn't be entering short. Right. The

5652
02:14:17,030 --> 02:14:17,040
wouldn't be entering short. Right. The
 

5653
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:19,189
wouldn't be entering short. Right. The
the move's happening. You're managing

5654
02:14:19,189 --> 02:14:19,199
the move's happening. You're managing
 

5655
02:14:19,199 --> 02:14:21,109
the move's happening. You're managing
this position and you got half an hour

5656
02:14:21,109 --> 02:14:21,119
this position and you got half an hour
 

5657
02:14:21,119 --> 02:14:23,910
this position and you got half an hour
left for lunch. VIX wants to break 17.

5658
02:14:23,910 --> 02:14:23,920
left for lunch. VIX wants to break 17.
 

5659
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:27,750
left for lunch. VIX wants to break 17.
It does. 1698 came right up there. Uh

5660
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:27,760
It does. 1698 came right up there. Uh
 

5661
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:29,910
It does. 1698 came right up there. Uh
next next point is 1712s. Right. So if

5662
02:14:29,910 --> 02:14:29,920
next next point is 1712s. Right. So if
 

5663
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:31,750
next next point is 1712s. Right. So if
it gets through here, 1712 starting to

5664
02:14:31,750 --> 02:14:31,760
it gets through here, 1712 starting to
 

5665
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:35,830
it gets through here, 1712 starting to
hold those 1680s very very very well.

5666
02:14:35,830 --> 02:14:35,840
hold those 1680s very very very well.
 

5667
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:38,310
hold those 1680s very very very well.
Reversal at 26k there or thereabouts.

5668
02:14:38,310 --> 02:14:38,320
Reversal at 26k there or thereabouts.
 

5669
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:40,709
Reversal at 26k there or thereabouts.
We'd actually prefer it above there.

5670
02:14:40,709 --> 02:14:40,719
We'd actually prefer it above there.
 

5671
02:14:40,719 --> 02:14:44,390
We'd actually prefer it above there.
Somewhere in here. 26100.

5672
02:14:44,390 --> 02:14:44,400
Somewhere in here. 26100.
 

5673
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:51,830
Somewhere in here. 26100.
Somewhere in here would be more ideal.

5674
02:14:51,830 --> 02:14:51,840

 

5675
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:53,990

Somewhere in here. Gap fill is here.

5676
02:14:53,990 --> 02:14:54,000
Somewhere in here. Gap fill is here.
 

5677
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,669
Somewhere in here. Gap fill is here.
Previous day value lows there. But

5678
02:14:55,669 --> 02:14:55,679
Previous day value lows there. But
 

5679
02:14:55,679 --> 02:14:57,830
Previous day value lows there. But
somewhere in here would be ideal. If we

5680
02:14:57,830 --> 02:14:57,840
somewhere in here would be ideal. If we
 

5681
02:14:57,840 --> 02:14:59,910
somewhere in here would be ideal. If we
get stuck here, I'd be very worried

5682
02:14:59,910 --> 02:14:59,920
get stuck here, I'd be very worried
 

5683
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:06,629
get stuck here, I'd be very worried
about that.

5684
02:15:06,629 --> 02:15:06,639

 

5685
02:15:06,639 --> 02:15:10,629

What's the yellow line number? 26080.

5686
02:15:10,629 --> 02:15:10,639
What's the yellow line number? 26080.
 

5687
02:15:10,639 --> 02:15:13,830
What's the yellow line number? 26080.
This one here. 2673ish

5688
02:15:13,830 --> 02:15:13,840
This one here. 2673ish
 

5689
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:17,750
This one here. 2673ish
26073 that's the cash gap

5690
02:15:17,750 --> 02:15:17,760
26073 that's the cash gap
 

5691
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:20,790
26073 that's the cash gap
es by the way uh sorry ES spy actually

5692
02:15:20,790 --> 02:15:20,800
es by the way uh sorry ES spy actually
 

5693
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:22,629
es by the way uh sorry ES spy actually
just finally filled its gaps remember it

5694
02:15:22,629 --> 02:15:22,639
just finally filled its gaps remember it
 

5695
02:15:22,639 --> 02:15:25,030
just finally filled its gaps remember it
came very very close a few times it just

5696
02:15:25,030 --> 02:15:25,040
came very very close a few times it just
 

5697
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:26,470
came very very close a few times it just
filled its cash gap the yellow line

5698
02:15:26,470 --> 02:15:26,480
filled its cash gap the yellow line
 

5699
02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:28,550
filled its cash gap the yellow line
right all right so spy now has done its

5700
02:15:28,550 --> 02:15:28,560
right all right so spy now has done its
 

5701
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:31,030
right all right so spy now has done its
move it's now closed its cash gap which

5702
02:15:31,030 --> 02:15:31,040
move it's now closed its cash gap which
 

5703
02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:32,870
move it's now closed its cash gap which

adding on anymore.

5878
02:21:29,910 --> 02:21:29,920
adding on anymore.
 

5879
02:21:29,920 --> 02:21:39,429
adding on anymore.
You're getting closer and closer.

5880
02:21:39,429 --> 02:21:39,439

 

5881
02:21:39,439 --> 02:21:41,429

What are the indicators? Uh these are my

What are the indicators? Uh these are my
 

5883
02:21:41,439 --> 02:21:43,910
What are the indicators? Uh these are my
flow zone pros.

5884
02:21:43,910 --> 02:21:43,920
flow zone pros.
 

5885
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:55,270
flow zone pros.
Pretty much all one indicator that and V

5886
02:21:55,270 --> 02:21:55,280

 

5887
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:58,710

news. Um I'll see I I never really like

5888
02:21:58,710 --> 02:21:58,720
news. Um I'll see I I never really like
 

5889
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:01,670
news. Um I'll see I I never really like
trading uh FOMC. I like the next day the

5890
02:22:01,670 --> 02:22:01,680
trading uh FOMC. I like the next day the
 

5891
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:14,309
trading uh FOMC. I like the next day the
reaction afterwards better.

5892
02:22:14,309 --> 02:22:14,319

 

5893
02:22:14,319 --> 02:22:16,389

I still don't understand what you're

5894
02:22:16,389 --> 02:22:16,399
I still don't understand what you're
 

5895
02:22:16,399 --> 02:22:19,349
I still don't understand what you're
saying, Matthew, but I'm asking like if

5896
02:22:19,349 --> 02:22:19,359
saying, Matthew, but I'm asking like if
 

5897
02:22:19,359 --> 02:22:22,469
saying, Matthew, but I'm asking like if
you only knew how to trade via prop firm

5898
02:22:22,469 --> 02:22:22,479
you only knew how to trade via prop firm
 

5899
02:22:22,479 --> 02:22:24,309
you only knew how to trade via prop firm
accounts and you got banned from one and

5900
02:22:24,309 --> 02:22:24,319
accounts and you got banned from one and
 

5901
02:22:24,319 --> 02:22:26,469
accounts and you got banned from one and
a massive movement was happening and you

5902
02:22:26,469 --> 02:22:26,479
a massive movement was happening and you
 

5903
02:22:26,479 --> 02:22:29,590
a massive movement was happening and you
didn't have time to do the 5D eval, what

5904
02:22:29,590 --> 02:22:29,600
didn't have time to do the 5D eval, what
 

5905
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:31,670
didn't have time to do the 5D eval, what
do you do? I don't understand that

5906
02:22:31,670 --> 02:22:31,680
do you do? I don't understand that
 

5907
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:33,590
do you do? I don't understand that
question. What is your question there?

5908
02:22:33,590 --> 02:22:33,600
question. What is your question there?
 

5909
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:35,349
question. What is your question there?
What's the actual question there? It's

5910
02:22:35,349 --> 02:22:35,359
What's the actual question there? It's
 

5911
02:22:35,359 --> 02:22:37,030
What's the actual question there? It's
like cryptic.

5912
02:22:37,030 --> 02:22:37,040
like cryptic.
 

5913
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:39,990
like cryptic.
What are you asking? So, if I got banned

5914
02:22:39,990 --> 02:22:40,000
What are you asking? So, if I got banned
 

5915
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:43,030
What are you asking? So, if I got banned
from a prop firm, okay, and there was a

5916
02:22:43,030 --> 02:22:43,040
from a prop firm, okay, and there was a
 

5917
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:45,750
from a prop firm, okay, and there was a
massive movement happening, as in

5918
02:22:45,750 --> 02:22:45,760
massive movement happening, as in
 

5919
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:47,510
massive movement happening, as in
there's volatility, which happens all

5920
02:22:47,510 --> 02:22:47,520
there's volatility, which happens all
 

5921
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:49,670
there's volatility, which happens all
the time, and you didn't have time to do

5922
02:22:49,670 --> 02:22:49,680
the time, and you didn't have time to do
 

5923
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:52,309
the time, and you didn't have time to do
a 5day eval. So, what you're saying is,

5924
02:22:52,309 --> 02:22:52,319
a 5day eval. So, what you're saying is,
 

5925
02:22:52,319 --> 02:22:55,429
a 5day eval. So, what you're saying is,
how can I gamble big on volatility by

5926
02:22:55,429 --> 02:22:55,439
how can I gamble big on volatility by
 

5927
02:22:55,439 --> 02:22:57,190
how can I gamble big on volatility by
using 10K? That's what you're actually

5928
02:22:57,190 --> 02:22:57,200
using 10K? That's what you're actually
 

5929
02:22:57,200 --> 02:22:59,429
using 10K? That's what you're actually
saying, right? And I told you, trade

5930
02:22:59,429 --> 02:22:59,439
saying, right? And I told you, trade
 

5931
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:02,790
saying, right? And I told you, trade
micros. trade micros and earn the right

5932
02:23:02,790 --> 02:23:02,800
micros. trade micros and earn the right
 

5933
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:12,790
micros. trade micros and earn the right
to trade more than one or two micros.

5934
02:23:12,790 --> 02:23:12,800

 

5935
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:14,870

Do I use TPO Rick? Yeah, I do look at it

5936
02:23:14,870 --> 02:23:14,880
Do I use TPO Rick? Yeah, I do look at it
 

5937
02:23:14,880 --> 02:23:16,469
Do I use TPO Rick? Yeah, I do look at it
occasionally. Um, most of the time I

5938
02:23:16,469 --> 02:23:16,479
occasionally. Um, most of the time I
 

5939
02:23:16,479 --> 02:23:17,910
occasionally. Um, most of the time I
don't feel like I I need to look at it.

5940
02:23:17,910 --> 02:23:17,920
don't feel like I I need to look at it.
 

5941
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:20,469
don't feel like I I need to look at it.
I can kind of see from my eyes how long

5942
02:23:20,469 --> 02:23:20,479
I can kind of see from my eyes how long
 

5943
02:23:20,479 --> 02:23:22,070
I can kind of see from my eyes how long
we've spent somewhere, but I do I do

5944
02:23:22,070 --> 02:23:22,080
we've spent somewhere, but I do I do
 

5945
02:23:22,080 --> 02:23:30,389
we've spent somewhere, but I do I do
have it on my charts when I need it.

5946
02:23:30,389 --> 02:23:30,399

 

5947
02:23:30,399 --> 02:23:32,550

I would never advise buying a CFD

5948
02:23:32,550 --> 02:23:32,560
I would never advise buying a CFD
 

5949
02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:35,830
I would never advise buying a CFD
account ever.

5950
02:23:35,830 --> 02:23:35,840

 

5951
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:38,870

What's the equivalent ticker to SPX to

5952
02:23:38,870 --> 02:23:38,880
What's the equivalent ticker to SPX to
 

5953
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:42,150
What's the equivalent ticker to SPX to
MNQ?

5954
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:42,160

 

5955
02:23:42,160 --> 02:23:45,030

I have MEES1, but the candle volume

5956
02:23:45,030 --> 02:23:45,040
I have MEES1, but the candle volume
 

5957
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:47,270
I have MEES1, but the candle volume
footprint bars are super thick compared

5958
02:23:47,270 --> 02:23:47,280
footprint bars are super thick compared
 

5959
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:50,150
footprint bars are super thick compared
to MNQ1. If you're looking at volume,

5960
02:23:50,150 --> 02:23:50,160
to MNQ1. If you're looking at volume,
 

5961
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:51,910
to MNQ1. If you're looking at volume,
you just want to look at ES, right?

5962
02:23:51,910 --> 02:23:51,920
you just want to look at ES, right?
 

5963
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:53,910
you just want to look at ES, right?
Don't look at me. Just look at ES. If

5964
02:23:53,910 --> 02:23:53,920
Don't look at me. Just look at ES. If
 

5965
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:55,590
Don't look at me. Just look at ES. If
you're looking at volume, trade mees,

5966
02:23:55,590 --> 02:23:55,600
you're looking at volume, trade mees,
 

5967
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:57,830
you're looking at volume, trade mees,
but use the levels of ES because you

5968
02:23:57,830 --> 02:23:57,840
but use the levels of ES because you
 

5969
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:06,070
but use the levels of ES because you
want institutional volume.

5970
02:24:06,070 --> 02:24:06,080

 

5971
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:07,590

Previous day value area low, previous

5972
02:24:07,590 --> 02:24:07,600
Previous day value area low, previous
 

5973
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:09,270
Previous day value area low, previous
day point of control is better for a

5974
02:24:09,270 --> 02:24:09,280
day point of control is better for a
 

5975
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:10,469
day point of control is better for a
swing long. Yeah, that's what I'm

5976
02:24:10,469 --> 02:24:10,479
swing long. Yeah, that's what I'm
 

5977
02:24:10,479 --> 02:24:13,110
swing long. Yeah, that's what I'm
looking at like because if we come into

5978
02:24:13,110 --> 02:24:13,120
looking at like because if we come into
 

5979
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:16,870
looking at like because if we come into
here, right, and hold,

5980
02:24:16,870 --> 02:24:16,880
here, right, and hold,
 

5981
02:24:16,880 --> 02:24:19,510
here, right, and hold,
right? Now, if we come into here and we

5982
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:19,520
right? Now, if we come into here and we
 

5983
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:21,670
right? Now, if we come into here and we
hold somewhere in here, right, even

5984
02:24:21,670 --> 02:24:21,680
hold somewhere in here, right, even
 

5985
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:24,150
hold somewhere in here, right, even
here, and we trap and do this, the long,

5986
02:24:24,150 --> 02:24:24,160
here, and we trap and do this, the long,
 

5987
02:24:24,160 --> 02:24:26,710
here, and we trap and do this, the long,
the protrend long is all the way up and

5988
02:24:26,710 --> 02:24:26,720
the protrend long is all the way up and
 

5989
02:24:26,720 --> 02:24:28,630
the protrend long is all the way up and
we're expecting a breakout of the high.

5990
02:24:28,630 --> 02:24:28,640
we're expecting a breakout of the high.
 

5991
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:30,790
we're expecting a breakout of the high.
But at the very minimum, right, even if

5992
02:24:30,790 --> 02:24:30,800
But at the very minimum, right, even if
 

5993
02:24:30,800 --> 02:24:32,070
But at the very minimum, right, even if
we don't get that, we're probably going

5994
02:24:32,070 --> 02:24:32,080
we don't get that, we're probably going
 

5995
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:33,750
we don't get that, we're probably going
to get this trade up into here, right?

5996
02:24:33,750 --> 02:24:33,760
to get this trade up into here, right?
 

5997
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:35,750
to get this trade up into here, right?
So, it will offer profit no matter what.

5998
02:24:35,750 --> 02:24:35,760
So, it will offer profit no matter what.
 

5999
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:37,510
So, it will offer profit no matter what.
We were probably looking at 100 to 200

6000
02:24:37,510 --> 02:24:37,520
We were probably looking at 100 to 200
 

6001
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:39,270
We were probably looking at 100 to 200
points no matter what. And if you get

6002
02:24:39,270 --> 02:24:39,280
points no matter what. And if you get
 

6003
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:43,429
points no matter what. And if you get
lucky, then they'll let it rip.

6004
02:24:43,429 --> 02:24:43,439
lucky, then they'll let it rip.
 

6005
02:24:43,439 --> 02:24:45,030
lucky, then they'll let it rip.
But we just have to be careful based on

6006
02:24:45,030 --> 02:24:45,040
But we just have to be careful based on
 

6007
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:47,030
But we just have to be careful based on
the dailies. Do not forget the dailies.

6008
02:24:47,030 --> 02:24:47,040
the dailies. Do not forget the dailies.
 

6009
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:48,309
the dailies. Do not forget the dailies.
I keep going over this. At the beginning

6010
02:24:48,309 --> 02:24:48,319
I keep going over this. At the beginning
 

6011
02:24:48,319 --> 02:24:49,349
I keep going over this. At the beginning
of the show, we talked about the

6012
02:24:49,349 --> 02:24:49,359
of the show, we talked about the
 

6013
02:24:49,359 --> 02:24:51,429
of the show, we talked about the
Ballinger bands, like where we are on

6014
02:24:51,429 --> 02:24:51,439
Ballinger bands, like where we are on
 

6015
02:24:51,439 --> 02:24:52,950
Ballinger bands, like where we are on
the dailies right now. All right, look

6016
02:24:52,950 --> 02:24:52,960
the dailies right now. All right, look
 

6017
02:24:52,960 --> 02:24:54,790
the dailies right now. All right, look
at this long wick above the daily

6018
02:24:54,790 --> 02:24:54,800
at this long wick above the daily
 

6019
02:24:54,800 --> 02:24:56,630
at this long wick above the daily
Ballinger band. Surprise, surprise. Who

6020
02:24:56,630 --> 02:24:56,640
Ballinger band. Surprise, surprise. Who
 

6021
02:24:56,640 --> 02:24:57,990
Ballinger band. Surprise, surprise. Who
said that? It's very unlikely we're

6022
02:24:57,990 --> 02:24:58,000
said that? It's very unlikely we're
 

6023
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:59,510
said that? It's very unlikely we're
going to get above that, right? The

6024
02:24:59,510 --> 02:24:59,520
going to get above that, right? The
 

6025
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:01,830
going to get above that, right? The
statistical chances of getting above

6026
02:25:01,830 --> 02:25:01,840
statistical chances of getting above
 

6027
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:03,830
statistical chances of getting above
these is small. Tomorrow and the next

6028
02:25:03,830 --> 02:25:03,840
these is small. Tomorrow and the next
 

6029
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:06,469
these is small. Tomorrow and the next
day, once we have this this doing this,

6030
02:25:06,469 --> 02:25:06,479
day, once we have this this doing this,
 

6031
02:25:06,479 --> 02:25:08,710
day, once we have this this doing this,
sure, we would like a pullback into

6032
02:25:08,710 --> 02:25:08,720
sure, we would like a pullback into
 

6033
02:25:08,720 --> 02:25:11,190
sure, we would like a pullback into
this, right, to be absorbed to then go

6034
02:25:11,190 --> 02:25:11,200
this, right, to be absorbed to then go
 

6035
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:12,790
this, right, to be absorbed to then go
long. Maybe it has to come down into

6036
02:25:12,790 --> 02:25:12,800
long. Maybe it has to come down into
 

6037
02:25:12,800 --> 02:25:14,389
long. Maybe it has to come down into
here. Like I said, it's possible it

6038
02:25:14,389 --> 02:25:14,399
here. Like I said, it's possible it
 

6039
02:25:14,399 --> 02:25:17,030
here. Like I said, it's possible it
comes for the 900 check. It is possible.

6040
02:25:17,030 --> 02:25:17,040
comes for the 900 check. It is possible.
 

6041
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:19,190
comes for the 900 check. It is possible.
We cannot rule that out. It is possible

6042
02:25:19,190 --> 02:25:19,200
We cannot rule that out. It is possible
 

6043
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:22,469
We cannot rule that out. It is possible
we do something like this. It is also

6044
02:25:22,469 --> 02:25:22,479
we do something like this. It is also
 

6045
02:25:22,479 --> 02:25:25,990
we do something like this. It is also
possible. We cannot rule this out that

6046
02:25:25,990 --> 02:25:26,000
possible. We cannot rule this out that
 

6047
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,469
possible. We cannot rule this out that
it does that. All right. If this is all

6048
02:25:28,469 --> 02:25:28,479
it does that. All right. If this is all
 

6049
02:25:28,479 --> 02:25:31,270
it does that. All right. If this is all
[\h__\h] and this is a giant stop hunt

6050
02:25:31,270 --> 02:25:31,280
[\h__\h] and this is a giant stop hunt
 

6051
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:34,150
[\h__\h] and this is a giant stop hunt
and you have institutional selling,

6052
02:25:34,150 --> 02:25:34,160
and you have institutional selling,
 

6053
02:25:34,160 --> 02:25:37,270
and you have institutional selling,
right? Institutional selling into this.

6054
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:37,280
right? Institutional selling into this.
 

6055
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:39,510
right? Institutional selling into this.
This is possible. When will we know? I

6056
02:25:39,510 --> 02:25:39,520
This is possible. When will we know? I
 

6057
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:41,349
This is possible. When will we know? I
would say after earnings Thursday,

6058
02:25:41,349 --> 02:25:41,359
would say after earnings Thursday,
 

6059
02:25:41,359 --> 02:25:43,590
would say after earnings Thursday,
Friday. I don't think that's what's

6060
02:25:43,590 --> 02:25:43,600
Friday. I don't think that's what's
 

6061
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:45,190
Friday. I don't think that's what's
going to happen. I think the reason

6062
02:25:45,190 --> 02:25:45,200
going to happen. I think the reason
 

6063
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:47,270
going to happen. I think the reason
we've rotated

6064
02:25:47,270 --> 02:25:47,280
we've rotated
 

6065
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:49,990
we've rotated
back into tech

6066
02:25:49,990 --> 02:25:50,000
back into tech
 

6067
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,230
back into tech
is to position themselves after a long

6068
02:25:52,230 --> 02:25:52,240
is to position themselves after a long
 

6069
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:53,830
is to position themselves after a long
period of consolidation. We talked about

6070
02:25:53,830 --> 02:25:53,840
period of consolidation. We talked about
 

6071
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:56,630
period of consolidation. We talked about
this long period of consolidation. If we

6072
02:25:56,630 --> 02:25:56,640
this long period of consolidation. If we
 

6073
02:25:56,640 --> 02:26:01,349
this long period of consolidation. If we
hold either 26,100 or 25,900,

6074
02:26:01,349 --> 02:26:01,359
hold either 26,100 or 25,900,
 

6075
02:26:01,359 --> 02:26:04,070
hold either 26,100 or 25,900,
if we hold it, we have every single

6076
02:26:04,070 --> 02:26:04,080
if we hold it, we have every single
 

6077
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:05,910
if we hold it, we have every single
player for three months trapped. We have

6078
02:26:05,910 --> 02:26:05,920
player for three months trapped. We have
 

6079
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:08,070
player for three months trapped. We have
an upside squeeze possible. All right,

6080
02:26:08,070 --> 02:26:08,080
an upside squeeze possible. All right,
 

6081
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:09,990
an upside squeeze possible. All right,
that is the most probable thing to

6082
02:26:09,990 --> 02:26:10,000
that is the most probable thing to
 

6083
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,910
that is the most probable thing to
happen. The second thing to happen will

6084
02:26:11,910 --> 02:26:11,920
happen. The second thing to happen will
 

6085
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:14,630
happen. The second thing to happen will
be a failure and a collapse and they use

6086
02:26:14,630 --> 02:26:14,640
be a failure and a collapse and they use
 

6087
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:16,469
be a failure and a collapse and they use
this for institutional selling. All

6088
02:26:16,469 --> 02:26:16,479
this for institutional selling. All
 

6089
02:26:16,479 --> 02:26:17,910
this for institutional selling. All
right? Because if lots of people are

6090
02:26:17,910 --> 02:26:17,920
right? Because if lots of people are
 

6091
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:20,070
right? Because if lots of people are
bidding up and they can sell, they pair

6092
02:26:20,070 --> 02:26:20,080
bidding up and they can sell, they pair
 

6093
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:21,910
bidding up and they can sell, they pair
it off and sell against it. This is

6094
02:26:21,910 --> 02:26:21,920
it off and sell against it. This is
 

6095
02:26:21,920 --> 02:26:24,230
it off and sell against it. This is
still untested. Is possible. It's less

6096
02:26:24,230 --> 02:26:24,240
still untested. Is possible. It's less
 

6097
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:40,790
still untested. Is possible. It's less
likely in my opinion, but it's possible.

6098
02:26:40,790 --> 02:26:40,800

 

6099
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:42,309

right
 

6131
02:27:24,880 --> 02:27:26,550
right
you can argue that we're rejecting this

I do not like the add-on short right now

I do not like the add-on short right now
I will be honest I think it's very very

02:27:30,389 --> 02:27:30,399
I will be honest I think it's very very
 

6137
02:27:30,399 --> 02:27:31,990
I will be honest I think it's very very
risky as you're getting closer remember

6138
02:27:31,990 --> 02:27:32,000
risky as you're getting closer remember

the short was from 250s right each of

the short was from 250s right each of

6143
02:27:37,280 --> 02:27:39,830
these gray boxes has been a cover point.
We can use this as like I'm not even

6144
02:27:39,830 --> 02:27:39,840
We can use this as like I'm not even
 

6145
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:42,630
We can use this as like I'm not even
going to do it as red. It's too risky.

6146
02:27:42,630 --> 02:27:42,640
going to do it as red. It's too risky.
 

6147
02:27:42,640 --> 02:27:45,750
going to do it as red. It's too risky.
Right. So, you've hit TP1,

6148
02:27:45,750 --> 02:27:45,760
Right. So, you've hit TP1,
 

6149
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:49,110
Right. So, you've hit TP1,
TP2, TP3, as long as you weren't a dick

6150
02:27:49,110 --> 02:27:49,120
TP2, TP3, as long as you weren't a dick
 

6151
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:52,389
TP2, TP3, as long as you weren't a dick
for a tick. TP4 will be down here into

6152
02:27:52,389 --> 02:27:52,399
for a tick. TP4 will be down here into
 

6153
02:27:52,399 --> 02:27:55,670
for a tick. TP4 will be down here into
the 120s. TP5 will be down here into the

6154
02:27:55,670 --> 02:27:55,680
the 120s. TP5 will be down here into the
 

6155
02:27:55,680 --> 02:27:57,349
the 120s. TP5 will be down here into the
90s. All right, that that will be the

6156
02:27:57,349 --> 02:27:57,359
90s. All right, that that will be the
 

6157
02:27:57,359 --> 02:27:59,510
90s. All right, that that will be the
trade. So, the next TP will be here, and

6158
02:27:59,510 --> 02:27:59,520
trade. So, the next TP will be here, and
 

6159
02:27:59,520 --> 02:28:43,110
trade. So, the next TP will be here, and
the next TP after that will be here.

6160
02:28:43,110 --> 02:28:43,120

 

6161
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:45,110

Matthew, like your question still

6162
02:28:45,110 --> 02:28:45,120
Matthew, like your question still
 

6163
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:47,110
Matthew, like your question still
doesn't really make sense, mate. If

6164
02:28:47,110 --> 02:28:47,120
doesn't really make sense, mate. If
 

6165
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:49,349
doesn't really make sense, mate. If
you're going to use 10K of your own

6166
02:28:49,349 --> 02:28:49,359
you're going to use 10K of your own
 

6167
02:28:49,359 --> 02:28:51,030
you're going to use 10K of your own
personal money, obviously nothing

6168
02:28:51,030 --> 02:28:51,040
personal money, obviously nothing
 

6169
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:53,270
personal money, obviously nothing
changes, right? You trade the same way.

6170
02:28:53,270 --> 02:28:53,280
changes, right? You trade the same way.
 

6171
02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:55,429
changes, right? You trade the same way.
You trade technical setups the same way.

6172
02:28:55,429 --> 02:28:55,439
You trade technical setups the same way.
 

6173
02:28:55,439 --> 02:28:57,429
You trade technical setups the same way.
You just lower your size because your

6174
02:28:57,429 --> 02:28:57,439
You just lower your size because your
 

6175
02:28:57,439 --> 02:29:01,910
You just lower your size because your
risk is 10K. I would be using one to two

6176
02:29:01,910 --> 02:29:01,920
risk is 10K. I would be using one to two
 

6177
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:04,630
risk is 10K. I would be using one to two
micros if I had a 10k account and I'd be

6178
02:29:04,630 --> 02:29:04,640
micros if I had a 10k account and I'd be
 

6179
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:07,110
micros if I had a 10k account and I'd be
trying to build out let's say at 20% a

6180
02:29:07,110 --> 02:29:07,120
trying to build out let's say at 20% a
 

6181
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:09,030
trying to build out let's say at 20% a
month. You need to go slow, right? You

6182
02:29:09,030 --> 02:29:09,040
month. You need to go slow, right? You
 

6183
02:29:09,040 --> 02:29:11,830
month. You need to go slow, right? You
build 10k to 12k during that first

6184
02:29:11,830 --> 02:29:11,840
build 10k to 12k during that first
 

6185
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:13,190
build 10k to 12k during that first
month. Prove yourself you can do it.

6186
02:29:13,190 --> 02:29:13,200
month. Prove yourself you can do it.
 

6187
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:15,110
month. Prove yourself you can do it.
Then you can start slowly slowly slowly

6188
02:29:15,110 --> 02:29:15,120
Then you can start slowly slowly slowly
 

6189
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:16,550
Then you can start slowly slowly slowly
doing more. If you're experienced trader

6190
02:29:16,550 --> 02:29:16,560
doing more. If you're experienced trader
 

6191
02:29:16,560 --> 02:29:18,550
doing more. If you're experienced trader
and you want to put risk on, [\h__\h]

6192
02:29:18,550 --> 02:29:18,560
and you want to put risk on, [\h__\h]
 

6193
02:29:18,560 --> 02:29:20,710
and you want to put risk on, [\h__\h]
sure, put risk on, right? But if you put

6194
02:29:20,710 --> 02:29:20,720
sure, put risk on, right? But if you put
 

6195
02:29:20,720 --> 02:29:23,590
sure, put risk on, right? But if you put
a mini on and you are wrong by the point

6196
02:29:23,590 --> 02:29:23,600
a mini on and you are wrong by the point
 

6197
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:25,750
a mini on and you are wrong by the point
of 100 points, you've lost 20% of your

6198
02:29:25,750 --> 02:29:25,760
of 100 points, you've lost 20% of your
 

6199
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:28,230
of 100 points, you've lost 20% of your
account instantly. So that's it. Nothing

6200
02:29:28,230 --> 02:29:28,240
account instantly. So that's it. Nothing
 

6201
02:29:28,240 --> 02:29:32,790
account instantly. So that's it. Nothing
really changes.

6202
02:29:32,790 --> 02:29:32,800

 

6203
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:35,590

Correct. Correct. Yeah. Microsoft,

6204
02:29:35,590 --> 02:29:35,600
Correct. Correct. Yeah. Microsoft,
 

6205
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:37,429
Correct. Correct. Yeah. Microsoft,
Tesla, and Meta earnings today and then

6206
02:29:37,429 --> 02:29:37,439
Tesla, and Meta earnings today and then
 

6207
02:29:37,439 --> 02:29:46,389
Tesla, and Meta earnings today and then
you got Apple tomorrow. Correct.

6208
02:29:46,389 --> 02:29:46,399

 

6209
02:29:46,399 --> 02:29:48,150

Oh my god, Alex is the best of the best.

6210
02:29:48,150 --> 02:29:48,160
Oh my god, Alex is the best of the best.
 

6211
02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:56,790
Oh my god, Alex is the best of the best.
That's very kind of you. Thank you.

6212
02:29:56,790 --> 02:29:56,800

 

6213
02:29:56,800 --> 02:29:58,870

What's the obsession with high candles?

6214
02:29:58,870 --> 02:29:58,880
What's the obsession with high candles?
 

6215
02:29:58,880 --> 02:30:00,469
What's the obsession with high candles?
Candles. See a lot of people in my other

6216
02:30:00,469 --> 02:30:00,479
Candles. See a lot of people in my other
 

6217
02:30:00,479 --> 02:30:03,910
Candles. See a lot of people in my other
discords using it. I don't know.

6218
02:30:03,910 --> 02:30:03,920
discords using it. I don't know.
 

6219
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:05,910
discords using it. I don't know.
I can actually just momentum candles.

6220
02:30:05,910 --> 02:30:05,920
I can actually just momentum candles.
 

6221
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:08,710
I can actually just momentum candles.
That's all they are. They they should

6222
02:30:08,710 --> 02:30:08,720
That's all they are. They they should
 

6223
02:30:08,720 --> 02:30:11,349
That's all they are. They they should
make you able to see trend better, but

6224
02:30:11,349 --> 02:30:11,359
make you able to see trend better, but
 

6225
02:30:11,359 --> 02:30:13,030
make you able to see trend better, but
they don't print the actual price. All

6226
02:30:13,030 --> 02:30:13,040
they don't print the actual price. All
 

6227
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:16,469
they don't print the actual price. All
right. So, if we we move to a highashi,

6228
02:30:16,469 --> 02:30:16,479
right. So, if we we move to a highashi,
 

6229
02:30:16,479 --> 02:30:18,950
right. So, if we we move to a highashi,
all right, trend becomes easier to see.

6230
02:30:18,950 --> 02:30:18,960
all right, trend becomes easier to see.
 

6231
02:30:18,960 --> 02:30:20,710
all right, trend becomes easier to see.
All right.

6232
02:30:20,710 --> 02:30:20,720
All right.
 

6233
02:30:20,720 --> 02:30:22,630
All right.
But they won't show they won't always

6234
02:30:22,630 --> 02:30:22,640
But they won't show they won't always
 

6235
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:24,630
But they won't show they won't always
give you the actual price. All right,

6236
02:30:24,630 --> 02:30:24,640
give you the actual price. All right,
 

6237
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:26,469
give you the actual price. All right,
the way they deliver price is slightly

6238
02:30:26,469 --> 02:30:26,479
the way they deliver price is slightly
 

6239
02:30:26,479 --> 02:30:28,550
the way they deliver price is slightly
different. All right, so the wicks on

6240
02:30:28,550 --> 02:30:28,560
different. All right, so the wicks on
 

6241
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:29,910
different. All right, so the wicks on
them will be slightly different. The way

6242
02:30:29,910 --> 02:30:29,920
them will be slightly different. The way
 

6243
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:32,070
them will be slightly different. The way
it's calculated, but it can become

6244
02:30:32,070 --> 02:30:32,080
it's calculated, but it can become
 

6245
02:30:32,080 --> 02:30:34,389
it's calculated, but it can become
easier to see trend using hyenashes.

6246
02:30:34,389 --> 02:30:34,399
easier to see trend using hyenashes.
 

6247
02:30:34,399 --> 02:30:36,870
easier to see trend using hyenashes.
Maybe that's why people who trade trend

6248
02:30:36,870 --> 02:30:36,880
Maybe that's why people who trade trend
 

6249
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:39,429
Maybe that's why people who trade trend
with uh EMAs often like hyenashes.

6250
02:30:39,429 --> 02:30:39,439
with uh EMAs often like hyenashes.
 

6251
02:30:39,439 --> 02:30:40,710
with uh EMAs often like hyenashes.
They're not they're not for me. I have

6252
02:30:40,710 --> 02:30:40,720
They're not they're not for me. I have
 

6253
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:42,630
They're not they're not for me. I have
tried using them before many many many

6254
02:30:42,630 --> 02:30:42,640
tried using them before many many many
 

6255
02:30:42,640 --> 02:30:46,070
tried using them before many many many
years ago.

6256
02:30:46,070 --> 02:30:46,080

 

6257
02:30:46,080 --> 02:30:48,309

Okay, so gray box to gray box. you might

6258
02:30:48,309 --> 02:30:48,319
Okay, so gray box to gray box. you might
 

6259
02:30:48,319 --> 02:30:49,670
Okay, so gray box to gray box. you might
get down into here and hopefully you get

6260
02:30:49,670 --> 02:30:49,680
get down into here and hopefully you get
 

6261
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:55,590
get down into here and hopefully you get
that flush all the way down.

6262
02:30:55,590 --> 02:30:55,600

 

6263
02:30:55,600 --> 02:30:57,270

I mean, it's a simple question. Yeah,

6264
02:30:57,270 --> 02:30:57,280
I mean, it's a simple question. Yeah,
 

6265
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:59,590
I mean, it's a simple question. Yeah,
just trade normally with 10K. Just size

6266
02:30:59,590 --> 02:30:59,600
just trade normally with 10K. Just size
 

6267
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:01,030
just trade normally with 10K. Just size
down. There's there's the simple answer

6268
02:31:01,030 --> 02:31:01,040
down. There's there's the simple answer
 

6269
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:02,870
down. There's there's the simple answer
which I've said many many times. Nothing

6270
02:31:02,870 --> 02:31:02,880
which I've said many many times. Nothing
 

6271
02:31:02,880 --> 02:31:09,990
which I've said many many times. Nothing
else changes.

6272
02:31:09,990 --> 02:31:10,000

 

6273
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:27,590

Thanks, Nick Bob.

6274
02:31:27,590 --> 02:31:27,600

 

6275
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:29,110

You're answering you're answering your

6276
02:31:29,110 --> 02:31:29,120
You're answering you're answering your
 

6277
02:31:29,120 --> 02:31:31,110
You're answering you're answering your
same question. 10K was an example of

6278
02:31:31,110 --> 02:31:31,120
same question. 10K was an example of
 

6279
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:33,030
same question. 10K was an example of
like how I've learned everything I need

6280
02:31:33,030 --> 02:31:33,040
like how I've learned everything I need
 

6281
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:34,950
like how I've learned everything I need
to via safe proper. I still can't

6282
02:31:34,950 --> 02:31:34,960
to via safe proper. I still can't
 

6283
02:31:34,960 --> 02:31:37,030
to via safe proper. I still can't
understand what you're saying here. Most

6284
02:31:37,030 --> 02:31:37,040
understand what you're saying here. Most
 

6285
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:39,349
understand what you're saying here. Most
you loses 100k a time. How do I bypass

6286
02:31:39,349 --> 02:31:39,359
you loses 100k a time. How do I bypass
 

6287
02:31:39,359 --> 02:31:40,950
you loses 100k a time. How do I bypass
all the rules and stuff and just use my

6288
02:31:40,950 --> 02:31:40,960
all the rules and stuff and just use my
 

6289
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:42,469
all the rules and stuff and just use my
own? That's how you bypass the rules,

6290
02:31:42,469 --> 02:31:42,479
own? That's how you bypass the rules,
 

6291
02:31:42,479 --> 02:31:43,990
own? That's how you bypass the rules,
right? You open up a brokerage account.

6292
02:31:43,990 --> 02:31:44,000
right? You open up a brokerage account.
 

6293
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:45,750
right? You open up a brokerage account.
You put 10K in. There you go. You bypass

6294
02:31:45,750 --> 02:31:45,760
You put 10K in. There you go. You bypass
 

6295
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:47,990
You put 10K in. There you go. You bypass
the rules. Now you play to your own rule

6296
02:31:47,990 --> 02:31:48,000
the rules. Now you play to your own rule
 

6297
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:49,429
the rules. Now you play to your own rule
book. But you better be good at managing

6298
02:31:49,429 --> 02:31:49,439
book. But you better be good at managing
 

6299
02:31:49,439 --> 02:31:58,870
book. But you better be good at managing
risk. No zero DTE for me. No.

6300
02:31:58,870 --> 02:31:58,880

at the ENQ. Look at the ES. Here you go
 

6319
02:32:22,479 --> 02:32:24,790
at the ENQ. Look at the ES. Here you go
into your next target. And then the last

6320
02:32:24,790 --> 02:32:24,800
into your next target. And then the last
 

6321
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:26,950
into your next target. And then the last
one you can look for is all the way down

6322
02:32:26,950 --> 02:32:26,960
one you can look for is all the way down
 

6323
02:32:26,960 --> 02:32:28,469
one you can look for is all the way down
into this blue box, which is where I

6324
02:32:28,469 --> 02:32:28,479
into this blue box, which is where I
 

6325
02:32:28,479 --> 02:32:31,030
into this blue box, which is where I
would love to be a buyer from. All

6326
02:32:31,030 --> 02:32:31,040
would love to be a buyer from. All

6329
02:32:33,040 --> 02:32:35,110
right. So, this is a fantastic trade.
So, TP3 into here. here. Now remember

6330
02:32:35,110 --> 02:32:35,120
So, TP3 into here. here. Now remember
 

6331
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:41,110
So, TP3 into here. here. Now remember
TP1 was 92, TP2 was 60, TP3 was 40, TP4

6332
02:32:41,110 --> 02:32:41,120
TP1 was 92, TP2 was 60, TP3 was 40, TP4
 

6333
02:32:41,120 --> 02:32:44,230
TP1 was 92, TP2 was 60, TP3 was 40, TP4
is into these like 20s here and then all

6334
02:32:44,230 --> 02:32:44,240
is into these like 20s here and then all
 

6335
02:32:44,240 --> 02:32:45,990
is into these like 20s here and then all
the way down here. Maybe even gap fill.

6336
02:32:45,990 --> 02:32:46,000
the way down here. Maybe even gap fill.
 

6337
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:47,510
the way down here. Maybe even gap fill.
You never know, you might get the gap

6338
02:32:47,510 --> 02:32:47,520
You never know, you might get the gap
 

6339
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:49,270
You never know, you might get the gap
fill, folks. So this is the higher time

6340
02:32:49,270 --> 02:32:49,280
fill, folks. So this is the higher time
 

6341
02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:50,630
fill, folks. So this is the higher time

out. So some covering in front of these
 

6345
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:54,870
out. So some covering in front of these
sort of 25s and 20s that we talked

6346
02:32:54,870 --> 02:32:54,880
sort of 25s and 20s that we talked
 

6347
02:32:54,880 --> 02:32:57,030
sort of 25s and 20s that we talked
about. Yeah. So when what was I saying?

about. Yeah. So when what was I saying?
 

6349
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:58,309
about. Yeah. So when what was I saying?

02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:25,990

So, TP's in into here and then really

6404
02:34:25,990 --> 02:34:26,000
So, TP's in into here and then really
 

6405
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:27,270
So, TP's in into here and then really
you're looking for previous day value

6406
02:34:27,270 --> 02:34:27,280
you're looking for previous day value
 

6407
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:29,030
you're looking for previous day value
area high, maybe even gap filled if we

6408
02:34:29,030 --> 02:34:29,040
area high, maybe even gap filled if we
 

6409
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:30,950
area high, maybe even gap filled if we
get really lucky. So, we've hit most of

6410
02:34:30,950 --> 02:34:30,960
get really lucky. So, we've hit most of
 

6411
02:34:30,960 --> 02:34:33,670
get really lucky. So, we've hit most of
these. One, two, three, four. If we get

6412
02:34:33,670 --> 02:34:33,680
these. One, two, three, four. If we get
 

6413
02:34:33,680 --> 02:34:36,230
these. One, two, three, four. If we get
five and six, I would after that, I

6414
02:34:36,230 --> 02:34:36,240
five and six, I would after that, I
 

6415
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:38,070
five and six, I would after that, I
would not be touching it. All right. I

6416
02:34:38,070 --> 02:34:38,080
would not be touching it. All right. I
 

6417
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:40,070
would not be touching it. All right. I
would really not be touching it. We get

6418
02:34:40,070 --> 02:34:40,080
would really not be touching it. We get
 

6419
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:42,150
would really not be touching it. We get
very, very, very, very, very close now

6420
02:34:42,150 --> 02:34:42,160
very, very, very, very, very close now
 

6421
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:43,510
very, very, very, very, very close now
to where we want to come. This is

6422
02:34:43,510 --> 02:34:43,520
to where we want to come. This is
 

6423
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:45,670
to where we want to come. This is
ultimately where we want to come. If

6424
02:34:45,670 --> 02:34:45,680
ultimately where we want to come. If
 

6425
02:34:45,680 --> 02:34:47,190
ultimately where we want to come. If
there's a full rotation be down here,

6426
02:34:47,190 --> 02:34:47,200
there's a full rotation be down here,
 

6427
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:49,670
there's a full rotation be down here,
but I think this blue box, it'd be uh

6428
02:34:49,670 --> 02:34:49,680
but I think this blue box, it'd be uh
 

6429
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:51,670
but I think this blue box, it'd be uh
coming towards the edge of where we're

6430
02:34:51,670 --> 02:34:51,680
coming towards the edge of where we're
 

6431
02:34:51,680 --> 02:34:53,030
coming towards the edge of where we're
likely to come. Like we talked about,

6432
02:34:53,030 --> 02:34:53,040
likely to come. Like we talked about,
 

6433
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:55,510
likely to come. Like we talked about,
very thin. To remind you all why. All

6434
02:34:55,510 --> 02:34:55,520
very thin. To remind you all why. All
 

6435
02:34:55,520 --> 02:34:57,510
very thin. To remind you all why. All
right. Once we let go of 92s, for anyone

6436
02:34:57,510 --> 02:34:57,520
right. Once we let go of 92s, for anyone
 

6437
02:34:57,520 --> 02:34:59,750
right. Once we let go of 92s, for anyone
joining late on stream, once we let go

6438
02:34:59,750 --> 02:34:59,760
joining late on stream, once we let go
 

6439
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:02,630
joining late on stream, once we let go
of the 92s, where was that? Was it 92s?

6440
02:35:02,630 --> 02:35:02,640
of the 92s, where was that? Was it 92s?
 

6441
02:35:02,640 --> 02:35:05,750
of the 92s, where was that? Was it 92s?
I'm sure it was 92s here overnight.

6442
02:35:05,750 --> 02:35:05,760
I'm sure it was 92s here overnight.
 

6443
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:08,070
I'm sure it was 92s here overnight.
There we go. Once we let go of this 92s,

6444
02:35:08,070 --> 02:35:08,080
There we go. Once we let go of this 92s,
 

6445
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:10,630
There we go. Once we let go of this 92s,
we are very thin all the way down to

6446
02:35:10,630 --> 02:35:10,640
we are very thin all the way down to
 

6447
02:35:10,640 --> 02:35:12,790
we are very thin all the way down to
this shelf. Okay, so this is why we're

6448
02:35:12,790 --> 02:35:12,800
this shelf. Okay, so this is why we're
 

6449
02:35:12,800 --> 02:35:14,870
this shelf. Okay, so this is why we're
likely to fill in all of this down

6450
02:35:14,870 --> 02:35:14,880
likely to fill in all of this down
 

6451
02:35:14,880 --> 02:35:17,750
likely to fill in all of this down
towards this shelf and then we expect

6452
02:35:17,750 --> 02:35:17,760
towards this shelf and then we expect
 

6453
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:19,349
towards this shelf and then we expect
probably there's some buyers hanging out

6454
02:35:19,349 --> 02:35:19,359
probably there's some buyers hanging out
 

6455
02:35:19,359 --> 02:35:21,030
probably there's some buyers hanging out
here to try and bid it back up at least

6456
02:35:21,030 --> 02:35:21,040
here to try and bid it back up at least
 

6457
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:23,110
here to try and bid it back up at least
to this point here. All right. If they

6458
02:35:23,110 --> 02:35:23,120
to this point here. All right. If they
 

6459
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:24,710
to this point here. All right. If they
fail to bid it back up, there's this

6460
02:35:24,710 --> 02:35:24,720
fail to bid it back up, there's this
 

6461
02:35:24,720 --> 02:35:27,190
fail to bid it back up, there's this
rotation down here. I would imagine this

6462
02:35:27,190 --> 02:35:27,200
rotation down here. I would imagine this
 

6463
02:35:27,200 --> 02:35:29,429
rotation down here. I would imagine this
happens no matter what. And then if they

6464
02:35:29,429 --> 02:35:29,439
happens no matter what. And then if they
 

6465
02:35:29,439 --> 02:35:31,110
happens no matter what. And then if they
want to rotate, they will do that. If

6466
02:35:31,110 --> 02:35:31,120
want to rotate, they will do that. If
 

6467
02:35:31,120 --> 02:35:33,030
want to rotate, they will do that. If
not, we will build out liquidity to move

6468
02:35:33,030 --> 02:35:33,040
not, we will build out liquidity to move
 

6469
02:35:33,040 --> 02:35:34,309
not, we will build out liquidity to move
higher because that is how the market

6470
02:35:34,309 --> 02:35:34,319
higher because that is how the market
 

6471
02:35:34,319 --> 02:35:36,469
higher because that is how the market
moves.

6472
02:35:36,469 --> 02:35:36,479
moves.
 

6473
02:35:36,479 --> 02:35:38,389
moves.
So the higher time frame pullback leg is

6474
02:35:38,389 --> 02:35:38,399
So the higher time frame pullback leg is
 

6475
02:35:38,399 --> 02:35:46,469
So the higher time frame pullback leg is
what's in effect right now.

6476
02:35:46,469 --> 02:35:46,479

 

6477
02:35:46,479 --> 02:35:47,670

02:35:50,309 --> 02:35:50,319
Yeah, I I don't think they're worth the
 

6483
02:35:50,319 --> 02:35:53,429
Yeah, I I don't think they're worth the
money. I think the rules the rules Nick

02:35:53,429 --> 02:35:53,439
money. I think the rules the rules Nick
 

6485
02:35:53,439 --> 02:35:56,070
money. I think the rules the rules Nick
for most of them is like 20%. What? Why?

6486
02:35:56,070 --> 02:35:56,080
for most of them is like 20%. What? Why?
 

6487
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:59,750
for most of them is like 20%. What? Why?
Why? Why? You're paying so much money to

02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:02,230
Why? Why? You're paying so much money to
skip a one day pass or a two-day pass so

6490
02:36:02,230 --> 02:36:02,240
skip a one day pass or a two-day pass so
 

6491
02:36:02,240 --> 02:36:05,429
skip a one day pass or a two-day pass so
that you are constricted far too much.

6492
02:36:05,429 --> 02:36:05,439
that you are constricted far too much.
 

6493
02:36:05,439 --> 02:36:07,910
that you are constricted far too much.
You're better off sticking six or 700

02:36:07,910 --> 02:36:07,920
You're better off sticking six or 700
 

6495
02:36:07,920 --> 02:36:10,230
You're better off sticking six or 700
bucks in your own cash account and

6496
02:36:10,230 --> 02:36:10,240
bucks in your own cash account and

matters so little that it's price is
 

6545

but we'll see. It's been a big trend

6626
02:39:22,630 --> 02:39:22,640
but we'll see. It's been a big trend
 

6627
02:39:22,640 --> 02:39:24,950
but we'll see. It's been a big trend
down. You do not want to get caught

down. You do not want to get caught
 

6629
02:39:24,960 --> 02:39:26,790
down. You do not want to get caught
shorting the lows, right? Look at this

6631
02:39:26,800 --> 02:39:30,550
shorting the lows, right? Look at this
like grind down. They will very, very

6637
02:39:33,520 --> 02:39:35,670
The way that they've built this out,
think how many stops are in stops and

Deep charts. I have looked at them

Deep charts. I have looked at them
 

6709
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:30,790
Deep charts. I have looked at them
briefly. I don't I don't need them, but

6710
02:41:30,790 --> 02:41:30,800
briefly. I don't I don't need them, but
 

6711
02:41:30,800 --> 02:41:33,429
briefly. I don't I don't need them, but
I think they're very good.

6712
02:41:33,429 --> 02:41:33,439
I think they're very good.
 

6713
02:41:33,439 --> 02:41:36,710
I think they're very good.
Here

6714
02:41:36,710 --> 02:41:36,720

 

6715
02:41:36,720 --> 02:41:39,110

we go. All right. You got to be

6716
02:41:39,110 --> 02:41:39,120
we go. All right. You got to be
 

6717
02:41:39,120 --> 02:41:40,469
we go. All right. You got to be
covering. If you are short into this,

6718
02:41:40,469 --> 02:41:40,479
covering. If you are short into this,
 

6719
02:41:40,479 --> 02:41:42,309
covering. If you are short into this,
you have to be covering into this move.

6720
02:41:42,309 --> 02:41:42,319
you have to be covering into this move.
 

6721
02:41:42,319 --> 02:41:44,230
you have to be covering into this move.
Now, this is the overextension as we

6722
02:41:44,230 --> 02:41:44,240
Now, this is the overextension as we
 

6723
02:41:44,240 --> 02:41:45,990
Now, this is the overextension as we
come back into the area where I would

6724
02:41:45,990 --> 02:41:46,000
come back into the area where I would
 

6725
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,469
come back into the area where I would
expect the market very, very likely to

6726
02:41:48,469 --> 02:41:48,479
expect the market very, very likely to
 

6727
02:41:48,479 --> 02:41:50,870
expect the market very, very likely to
start finding bids around this area. So,

6728
02:41:50,870 --> 02:41:50,880
start finding bids around this area. So,
 

6729
02:41:50,880 --> 02:41:53,270
start finding bids around this area. So,
you better be 90% out of this trade if

6730
02:41:53,270 --> 02:41:53,280
you better be 90% out of this trade if
 

6731
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:55,349
you better be 90% out of this trade if
you were short. This is a big winner on

6732
02:41:55,349 --> 02:41:55,359
you were short. This is a big winner on
 

6733
02:41:55,359 --> 02:41:58,309
you were short. This is a big winner on
stream again. You are now

6734
02:41:58,309 --> 02:41:58,319
stream again. You are now
 

6735
02:41:58,319 --> 02:42:01,510
stream again. You are now
120 or 130 points up. Yeah, 130 points

6736
02:42:01,510 --> 02:42:01,520
120 or 130 points up. Yeah, 130 points
 

6737
02:42:01,520 --> 02:42:03,670
120 or 130 points up. Yeah, 130 points
up. What an absolute banger. Another 100

6738
02:42:03,670 --> 02:42:03,680
up. What an absolute banger. Another 100
 

6739
02:42:03,680 --> 02:42:19,510
up. What an absolute banger. Another 100
point trade again on stream for free.

6740
02:42:19,510 --> 02:42:19,520

 

6741
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:21,190

Is there a bookmap type program for

6742
02:42:21,190 --> 02:42:21,200
Is there a bookmap type program for
 

6743
02:42:21,200 --> 02:42:23,030
Is there a bookmap type program for
think or swim? I don't know. Maybe some

6744
02:42:23,030 --> 02:42:23,040
think or swim? I don't know. Maybe some
 

6745
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:25,830
think or swim? I don't know. Maybe some
others can answer that. I I don't know.

6746
02:42:25,830 --> 02:42:25,840
others can answer that. I I don't know.
 

6747
02:42:25,840 --> 02:42:27,830
others can answer that. I I don't know.
What would I be looking at to go longs?

6748
02:42:27,830 --> 02:42:27,840
What would I be looking at to go longs?
 

6749
02:42:27,840 --> 02:42:29,270
What would I be looking at to go longs?
So, what we'd be looking at the same

6750
02:42:29,270 --> 02:42:29,280
So, what we'd be looking at the same
 

6751
02:42:29,280 --> 02:42:30,550
So, what we'd be looking at the same
kind of thing we had here, but the

6752
02:42:30,550 --> 02:42:30,560
kind of thing we had here, but the
 

6753
02:42:30,560 --> 02:42:32,389
kind of thing we had here, but the
opposite. All right. So in this area

6754
02:42:32,389 --> 02:42:32,399
opposite. All right. So in this area
 

6755
02:42:32,399 --> 02:42:35,349
opposite. All right. So in this area
here, you want a good auction, right? So

6756
02:42:35,349 --> 02:42:35,359
here, you want a good auction, right? So
 

6757
02:42:35,359 --> 02:42:39,990
here, you want a good auction, right? So
we want an auction where inside a candle

6758
02:42:39,990 --> 02:42:40,000
we want an auction where inside a candle
 

6759
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,790
we want an auction where inside a candle
inside here, we see lots of sellers. All

6760
02:42:42,790 --> 02:42:42,800
inside here, we see lots of sellers. All
 

6761
02:42:42,800 --> 02:42:45,110
inside here, we see lots of sellers. All
right? And once we see that, that will

6762
02:42:45,110 --> 02:42:45,120
right? And once we see that, that will
 

6763
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:46,630
right? And once we see that, that will
let us know that the auction's finished.

6764
02:42:46,630 --> 02:42:46,640
let us know that the auction's finished.
 

6765
02:42:46,640 --> 02:42:48,150
let us know that the auction's finished.
Ideally, we fill this gap and then we

6766
02:42:48,150 --> 02:42:48,160
Ideally, we fill this gap and then we
 

6767
02:42:48,160 --> 02:42:49,910
Ideally, we fill this gap and then we
start pivoting above maybe something

6768
02:42:49,910 --> 02:42:49,920
start pivoting above maybe something
 

6769
02:42:49,920 --> 02:42:51,830
start pivoting above maybe something
like this where we have trapped volume.

6770
02:42:51,830 --> 02:42:51,840
like this where we have trapped volume.
 

6771
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:53,590
like this where we have trapped volume.
We'd like a node down here to be

6772
02:42:53,590 --> 02:42:53,600
We'd like a node down here to be
 

6773
02:42:53,600 --> 02:42:55,510
We'd like a node down here to be
developed of trapped sellers and then

6774
02:42:55,510 --> 02:42:55,520
developed of trapped sellers and then
 

6775
02:42:55,520 --> 02:42:57,429
developed of trapped sellers and then
we'll use their pain to go back upside

6776
02:42:57,429 --> 02:42:57,439
we'll use their pain to go back upside
 

6777
02:42:57,439 --> 02:42:58,630

today? We're coming back back testing
this. This is the area where we expect,

this. This is the area where we expect,

can thicken this up a bit. This right
here is an area of interest for us to

here is an area of interest for us to
 

6921
02:46:55,439 --> 02:46:57,750
here is an area of interest for us to
potentially buy back. We might go under

6922
02:46:57,750 --> 02:46:57,760
potentially buy back. We might go under
 

6923
02:46:57,760 --> 02:46:59,510
potentially buy back. We might go under
it and reclaim and the buyback could be

6924
02:46:59,510 --> 02:46:59,520
it and reclaim and the buyback could be
 

6925
02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:02,870
it and reclaim and the buyback could be
on a reclaim. It's definitely an area of

02:47:07,190 --> 02:47:07,200
Would I recommend yellowing Apex? I
 

6931
02:47:07,200 --> 02:47:09,110
Would I recommend yellowing Apex? I
mean,

6932
02:47:09,110 --> 02:47:09,120
mean,
 

6933
02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:11,349
mean,
I don't know if I'd recommend it. It's

6934
02:47:11,349 --> 02:47:11,359
I don't know if I'd recommend it. It's
 

6935
02:47:11,359 --> 02:47:13,190
I don't know if I'd recommend it. It's
definitely a way a way that you could

6936
02:47:13,190 --> 02:47:13,200
definitely a way a way that you could
 

6937
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:15,830
definitely a way a way that you could
trade, but I don't think I'd recommend

6938
02:47:15,830 --> 02:47:15,840
trade, but I don't think I'd recommend
 

6939
02:47:15,840 --> 02:47:17,349
trade, but I don't think I'd recommend
it. I still can't do anything. And I'm

6940
02:47:17,349 --> 02:47:17,359
it. I still can't do anything. And I'm
 

6941
02:47:17,359 --> 02:47:18,630
it. I still can't do anything. And I'm
even just trying to put a limit order

6942
02:47:18,630 --> 02:47:18,640
even just trying to put a limit order
 

6943
02:47:18,640 --> 02:47:20,630
even just trying to put a limit order
out here just to see if it can come on a

6944
02:47:20,630 --> 02:47:20,640
out here just to see if it can come on a
 

6945
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:23,830
out here just to see if it can come on a
screen and it just says error. So still

6946
02:47:23,830 --> 02:47:23,840
screen and it just says error. So still
 

6947
02:47:23,840 --> 02:47:25,429
screen and it just says error. So still
no way I can trade with trader eight.

6948
02:47:25,429 --> 02:47:25,439
no way I can trade with trader eight.
 

6949
02:47:25,439 --> 02:47:26,469
no way I can trade with trader eight.
Guys, you're starting to see a bit of

6950
02:47:26,469 --> 02:47:26,479
Guys, you're starting to see a bit of
 

6951
02:47:26,479 --> 02:47:28,309
Guys, you're starting to see a bit of
relief here.

6952
02:47:28,309 --> 02:47:28,319
relief here.
 

6953
02:47:28,319 --> 02:47:30,150
relief here.
Just be careful. Remember, you've hit

6954
02:47:30,150 --> 02:47:30,160
Just be careful. Remember, you've hit
 

6955
02:47:30,160 --> 02:47:31,990
Just be careful. Remember, you've hit
most of your TPS. Like I said, you

6956
02:47:31,990 --> 02:47:32,000
most of your TPS. Like I said, you
 

6957
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:33,910
most of your TPS. Like I said, you
should be out 90% of this move. You

6958
02:47:33,910 --> 02:47:33,920
should be out 90% of this move. You
 

6959
02:47:33,920 --> 02:47:35,590
should be out 90% of this move. You
don't want to be holding through

6960
02:47:35,590 --> 02:47:35,600
don't want to be holding through
 

6961
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:46,950
don't want to be holding through
everything.

6962
02:47:46,950 --> 02:47:46,960

 

6963
02:47:46,960 --> 02:47:49,110

Thanks DS. Looking forward to you

6964
02:47:49,110 --> 02:47:49,120
Thanks DS. Looking forward to you
 

6965
02:47:49,120 --> 02:47:53,030
Thanks DS. Looking forward to you
joining every day.

6966
02:47:53,030 --> 02:47:53,040

 

6967
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:54,950

So if you're looking for the long now,

6968
02:47:54,950 --> 02:47:54,960
So if you're looking for the long now,
 

6969
02:47:54,960 --> 02:47:58,230
So if you're looking for the long now,
starting to see these imbalances push.

6970
02:47:58,230 --> 02:47:58,240
starting to see these imbalances push.
 

6971
02:47:58,240 --> 02:48:00,630
starting to see these imbalances push.
That's not the best auction at the low

6972
02:48:00,630 --> 02:48:00,640
That's not the best auction at the low
 

6973
02:48:00,640 --> 02:48:04,630
That's not the best auction at the low
yet if I'm honest. But here is

6974
02:48:04,630 --> 02:48:04,640
yet if I'm honest. But here is
 

6975
02:48:04,640 --> 02:48:05,990
yet if I'm honest. But here is
definitely where these sellers started

6976
02:48:05,990 --> 02:48:06,000
definitely where these sellers started
 

6977
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:07,750
definitely where these sellers started
to come in in this candle. So this is

6978
02:48:07,750 --> 02:48:07,760
to come in in this candle. So this is
 

6979
02:48:07,760 --> 02:48:09,590
to come in in this candle. So this is
kind of a key level to hold. I don't

6980
02:48:09,590 --> 02:48:09,600
kind of a key level to hold. I don't
 

6981
02:48:09,600 --> 02:48:11,590
kind of a key level to hold. I don't
love that low of day auction yet if I'm

6982
02:48:11,590 --> 02:48:11,600
love that low of day auction yet if I'm
 

6983
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:13,750
love that low of day auction yet if I'm
honest. But if they start to build in

6984
02:48:13,750 --> 02:48:13,760
honest. But if they start to build in
 

6985
02:48:13,760 --> 02:48:15,349
honest. But if they start to build in
here and hold, there might be relief.

6986
02:48:15,349 --> 02:48:15,359
here and hold, there might be relief.
 

6987
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:17,910
here and hold, there might be relief.
But I don't love that. But it's not bad.

6988
02:48:17,910 --> 02:48:17,920
But I don't love that. But it's not bad.
 

6989
02:48:17,920 --> 02:48:21,190
But I don't love that. But it's not bad.
So I'd be watching 21s to 10. So 20s to

6990
02:48:21,190 --> 02:48:21,200
So I'd be watching 21s to 10. So 20s to
 

6991
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:23,110
So I'd be watching 21s to 10. So 20s to
tens again. The low of day doesn't look

6992
02:48:23,110 --> 02:48:23,120
tens again. The low of day doesn't look
 

6993
02:48:23,120 --> 02:48:27,670
tens again. The low of day doesn't look
too good for me yet.

6994
02:48:27,670 --> 02:48:27,680

 

6995
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:29,349

I can't trade it anyway because this

6996
02:48:29,349 --> 02:48:29,359
I can't trade it anyway because this
 

6997
02:48:29,359 --> 02:48:32,469
I can't trade it anyway because this
[\h__\h] thing, but there we go.

6998
02:48:32,469 --> 02:48:32,479
[\h__\h] thing, but there we go.
 

6999
02:48:32,479 --> 02:48:35,110
[\h__\h] thing, but there we go.
But if the 10 to 21 start to hold, you

7000
02:48:35,110 --> 02:48:35,120
But if the 10 to 21 start to hold, you
 

7001
02:48:35,120 --> 02:48:36,710
But if the 10 to 21 start to hold, you
might see some relief. There's lots of

7002
02:48:36,710 --> 02:48:36,720
might see some relief. There's lots of
 

7003
02:48:36,720 --> 02:48:38,070
might see some relief. There's lots of
stops that can be popped. There's

7004
02:48:38,070 --> 02:48:38,080
stops that can be popped. There's
 

7005
02:48:38,080 --> 02:48:39,830
stops that can be popped. There's
probably likely to be relief up here to

7006
02:48:39,830 --> 02:48:39,840
probably likely to be relief up here to
 

7007
02:48:39,840 --> 02:48:42,790
probably likely to be relief up here to
75 to 90 at some point, right? It just

7008
02:48:42,790 --> 02:48:42,800
75 to 90 at some point, right? It just
 

7009
02:48:42,800 --> 02:48:44,950
75 to 90 at some point, right? It just
depends. Is it going to do it now like

7010
02:48:44,950 --> 02:48:44,960
depends. Is it going to do it now like
 

7011
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:46,870
depends. Is it going to do it now like
this or does it need to come and take

7012
02:48:46,870 --> 02:48:46,880
this or does it need to come and take
 

7013
02:48:46,880 --> 02:48:49,990
this or does it need to come and take
this out and then go for it?

7014
02:48:49,990 --> 02:48:50,000
this out and then go for it?
 

7015
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,309
this out and then go for it?
Like I said, 20s to tens are important.

7016
02:48:52,309 --> 02:48:52,319
Like I said, 20s to tens are important.
 

7017
02:48:52,319 --> 02:48:54,389
Like I said, 20s to tens are important.
I don't like the auction at low of day

7018
02:48:54,389 --> 02:48:54,399
I don't like the auction at low of day
 

7019
02:48:54,399 --> 02:48:55,670
I don't like the auction at low of day
right now. There's not enough sellers

7020
02:48:55,670 --> 02:48:55,680
right now. There's not enough sellers
 

7021
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:57,750
right now. There's not enough sellers
caught down there yet. At least not from

7022
02:48:57,750 --> 02:48:57,760
caught down there yet. At least not from
 

7023
02:48:57,760 --> 02:48:59,110
caught down there yet. At least not from
what I'm seeing on Trading View. Let me

7024
02:48:59,110 --> 02:48:59,120
what I'm seeing on Trading View. Let me
 

7025
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:01,269
what I'm seeing on Trading View. Let me
see if I can get any data here on Ninja

7026
02:49:01,269 --> 02:49:01,279
see if I can get any data here on Ninja
 

7027
02:49:01,279 --> 02:49:03,510
see if I can get any data here on Ninja
to see a bit more. Does Ninja look a bit

7028
02:49:03,510 --> 02:49:03,520
to see a bit more. Does Ninja look a bit
 

7029
02:49:03,520 --> 02:49:04,950
to see a bit more. Does Ninja look a bit
better? Ninja does look a little bit

7030
02:49:04,950 --> 02:49:04,960
better? Ninja does look a little bit
 

7031
02:49:04,960 --> 02:49:06,550
better? Ninja does look a little bit
better to be honest. The tick data there

7032
02:49:06,550 --> 02:49:06,560
better to be honest. The tick data there
 

7033
02:49:06,560 --> 02:49:11,670
better to be honest. The tick data there
is a little bit better. So yeah, 19s

7034
02:49:11,670 --> 02:49:11,680
is a little bit better. So yeah, 19s
 

7035
02:49:11,680 --> 02:49:16,230
is a little bit better. So yeah, 19s
down to tens, 20s to tens. If that holds

7036
02:49:16,230 --> 02:49:16,240
down to tens, 20s to tens. If that holds
 

7037
02:49:16,240 --> 02:49:18,469
down to tens, 20s to tens. If that holds
as a higher low,

7038
02:49:18,469 --> 02:49:18,479
as a higher low,
 

7039
02:49:18,479 --> 02:49:21,910
as a higher low,
that's a good sign.

7040
02:49:21,910 --> 02:49:21,920
that's a good sign.
 

7041
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:23,510
that's a good sign.
But we came very very close to this.

7042
02:49:23,510 --> 02:49:23,520
But we came very very close to this.
 

7043
02:49:23,520 --> 02:49:24,950
But we came very very close to this.
It's kind of might as well come and

7044
02:49:24,950 --> 02:49:24,960
It's kind of might as well come and
 

7045
02:49:24,960 --> 02:49:26,309
It's kind of might as well come and
finish the auction, take it all out.

7046
02:49:26,309 --> 02:49:26,319
finish the auction, take it all out.
 

7047
02:49:26,319 --> 02:49:28,309
finish the auction, take it all out.
There's a buy still at 85. There was a

7048
02:49:28,309 --> 02:49:28,319
There's a buy still at 85. There was a
 

7049
02:49:28,319 --> 02:49:30,070
There's a buy still at 85. There was a
spoofer at 70. I'm looking lower to see

7050
02:49:30,070 --> 02:49:30,080
spoofer at 70. I'm looking lower to see
 

7051
02:49:30,080 --> 02:49:31,510
spoofer at 70. I'm looking lower to see
if there's much. A little bit of 50 and

7052
02:49:31,510 --> 02:49:31,520
if there's much. A little bit of 50 and
 

7053
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:34,309
if there's much. A little bit of 50 and
40s, but not a lot. So you'd want this

7054
02:49:34,309 --> 02:49:34,319
40s, but not a lot. So you'd want this
 

7055
02:49:34,319 --> 02:49:37,110
40s, but not a lot. So you'd want this
to hold down towards tens. Now that

7056
02:49:37,110 --> 02:49:37,120
to hold down towards tens. Now that
 

7057
02:49:37,120 --> 02:49:38,469
to hold down towards tens. Now that
doesn't mean you enter there. It's just

7058
02:49:38,469 --> 02:49:38,479
doesn't mean you enter there. It's just
 

7059
02:49:38,479 --> 02:49:39,910
doesn't mean you enter there. It's just
like if buyers are going to step in,

7060
02:49:39,910 --> 02:49:39,920
like if buyers are going to step in,
 

7061
02:49:39,920 --> 02:49:40,950
like if buyers are going to step in,
that's where they're going to need to

7062
02:49:40,950 --> 02:49:40,960
that's where they're going to need to
 

7063
02:49:40,960 --> 02:49:42,309
that's where they're going to need to
step in. But again, the low of day

7064
02:49:42,309 --> 02:49:42,319
step in. But again, the low of day
 

7065
02:49:42,319 --> 02:49:43,990
step in. But again, the low of day
auctions not the best looking right now.

7066
02:49:43,990 --> 02:49:44,000
auctions not the best looking right now.
 

7067
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:50,389
auctions not the best looking right now.
I would say

7068
02:49:50,389 --> 02:49:50,399

 

7069
02:49:50,399 --> 02:49:52,550

imbalance here down towards 10. They are

7070
02:49:52,550 --> 02:49:52,560
imbalance here down towards 10. They are
 

7071
02:49:52,560 --> 02:49:54,710
imbalance here down towards 10. They are
trying to bid in front of that. That's

7072
02:49:54,710 --> 02:49:54,720
trying to bid in front of that. That's
 

7073
02:49:54,720 --> 02:50:00,630
trying to bid in front of that. That's
not a bad sign.

7074
02:50:00,630 --> 02:50:00,640

 

7075
02:50:00,640 --> 02:50:02,469

So there's a good hold of 20s down to

7076
02:50:02,469 --> 02:50:02,479
So there's a good hold of 20s down to
 

7077
02:50:02,479 --> 02:50:05,349
So there's a good hold of 20s down to
tens and there's possible here that they

7078
02:50:05,349 --> 02:50:05,359
tens and there's possible here that they
 

7079
02:50:05,359 --> 02:50:06,870
tens and there's possible here that they

7189
02:52:45,359 --> 02:52:49,429
Where's my thing gone? [\h__\h] hell. So
here. So here's TP1, TP2, TP3. And if

7190
02:52:49,429 --> 02:52:49,439
here. So here's TP1, TP2, TP3. And if
 

7191
02:52:49,439 --> 02:52:50,630
here. So here's TP1, TP2, TP3. And if
you get really lucky, you get all the

02:52:50,630 --> 02:52:50,640
you get really lucky, you get all the
 

7193
02:52:50,640 --> 02:52:52,550
you get really lucky, you get all the
way up into here. But I'd definitely be

7194
02:52:52,550 --> 02:52:52,560
way up into here. But I'd definitely be
 

7195
02:52:52,560 --> 02:52:54,389
way up into here. But I'd definitely be
looking for this to trade 81s if you

7196
02:52:54,389 --> 02:52:54,399
looking for this to trade 81s if you
 

7197

02:52:57,760 --> 02:52:59,349
find acceptance or 70s, 75s if you find
acceptance. This can be a stop hunt up

7200
02:52:59,349 --> 02:52:59,359
acceptance. This can be a stop hunt up
 

7201
02:52:59,359 --> 02:53:01,030
acceptance. This can be a stop hunt up
here and trade back down. So you I would

7202
02:53:01,030 --> 02:53:01,040
here and trade back down. So you I would
 

7203
02:53:01,040 --> 02:53:03,349
here and trade back down. So you I would
have break even already on this because

7204
02:53:03,349 --> 02:53:03,359
have break even already on this because
 

7205
02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:06,469

So it' be TP1 into here. So TP1 into

7208
02:53:09,429 --> 02:53:09,439
So it' be TP1 into here. So TP1 into
 

7209
02:53:09,439 --> 02:53:13,030
So it' be TP1 into here. So TP1 into
here. You hit TP1, TP2, TP3.

here. You hit TP1, TP2, TP3.
 

7211
02:53:13,040 --> 02:53:14,550
here. You hit TP1, TP2, TP3.
And I'd already been moving break even

7212
02:53:14,550 --> 02:53:14,560
And I'd already been moving break even
 

7213
02:53:14,560 --> 02:53:15,750
And I'd already been moving break even
because I don't like the lower day

prop accounts. I just get error
 

7231
02:54:03,279 --> 02:54:05,110
prop accounts. I just get error
messages. It's probably a no trade for

7232
02:54:05,110 --> 02:54:05,120
messages. It's probably a no trade for
 

7233
02:54:05,120 --> 02:54:06,950
messages. It's probably a no trade for
me, unfortunately.

7234
02:54:06,950 --> 02:54:06,960
me, unfortunately.
 

7235
02:54:06,960 --> 02:54:08,469
me, unfortunately.
I'll give you a couple minutes and see

7236
02:54:08,469 --> 02:54:08,479
I'll give you a couple minutes and see
 

7237
02:54:08,479 --> 02:54:10,469
I'll give you a couple minutes and see
if you get this. So, let's see if you

7238
02:54:10,469 --> 02:54:10,479
if you get this. So, let's see if you
 

7239
02:54:10,479 --> 02:54:12,790
if you get this. So, let's see if you
get acceptance through here. But even

7240
02:54:12,790 --> 02:54:12,800
get acceptance through here. But even
 

7241
02:54:12,800 --> 02:54:15,030
get acceptance through here. But even
this

7242
02:54:15,030 --> 02:54:15,040
this
 

7243
02:54:15,040 --> 02:54:18,710
this
there's another 20 points.

7244
02:54:18,710 --> 02:54:18,720
there's another 20 points.
 

7245
02:54:18,720 --> 02:54:20,230
there's another 20 points.
So you probably got you probably just

7246
02:54:20,230 --> 02:54:20,240
So you probably got you probably just
 

7247
02:54:20,240 --> 02:54:22,550
So you probably got you probably just
missed this uh target at low of day. I

7248
02:54:22,550 --> 02:54:22,560
missed this uh target at low of day. I
 

7249
02:54:22,560 --> 02:54:24,389
missed this uh target at low of day. I
don't know. You probably only got into

7250
02:54:24,389 --> 02:54:24,399
don't know. You probably only got into
 

7251
02:54:24,399 --> 02:54:32,230
don't know. You probably only got into
here. So we got 128 points downside move

7252
02:54:32,230 --> 02:54:32,240

 

7253
02:54:32,240 --> 02:54:34,469

and then see what what we get as upside

7254
02:54:34,469 --> 02:54:34,479
and then see what what we get as upside
 

7255
02:54:34,479 --> 02:54:36,630
and then see what what we get as upside
relief.

7256
02:54:36,630 --> 02:54:36,640
relief.
 

7257
02:54:36,640 --> 02:54:38,150
relief.
I'd love it if it would just manipulate

7258
02:54:38,150 --> 02:54:38,160
I'd love it if it would just manipulate
 

7259
02:54:38,160 --> 02:54:40,550
I'd love it if it would just manipulate
a bit lower first and hopefully they fix

7260
02:54:40,550 --> 02:54:40,560
a bit lower first and hopefully they fix
 

7261
02:54:40,560 --> 02:54:42,710
a bit lower first and hopefully they fix
all the accounts and I can pick scoop

7262
02:54:42,710 --> 02:54:42,720
all the accounts and I can pick scoop
 

7263
02:54:42,720 --> 02:54:44,230
all the accounts and I can pick scoop
something up for next uh the next

7264
02:54:44,230 --> 02:54:44,240
something up for next uh the next
 

7265
02:54:44,240 --> 02:54:52,309
something up for next uh the next
session.

7266
02:54:52,309 --> 02:54:52,319

 

7267
02:54:52,319 --> 02:54:55,269

Uh off the chart for me um TJ I' I'd

7268
02:54:55,269 --> 02:54:55,279
Uh off the chart for me um TJ I' I'd
 

7269
02:54:55,279 --> 02:54:59,269
Uh off the chart for me um TJ I' I'd
never execute on Dom. It's just a habit.

7270
02:54:59,269 --> 02:54:59,279
never execute on Dom. It's just a habit.
 

7271
02:54:59,279 --> 02:55:04,230
never execute on Dom. It's just a habit.
It's just a habit.

7272
02:55:04,230 --> 02:55:04,240

 

7273
02:55:04,240 --> 02:55:07,269

Guys, clean up the chat, please. Like,

7274
02:55:07,269 --> 02:55:07,279
Guys, clean up the chat, please. Like,
 

7275
02:55:07,279 --> 02:55:08,630
Guys, clean up the chat, please. Like,
stop all of it. Don't want any

7276
02:55:08,630 --> 02:55:08,640
stop all of it. Don't want any
 

7277
02:55:08,640 --> 02:55:11,590
stop all of it. Don't want any
negativity. Just stop. Just stop it

7278
02:55:11,590 --> 02:55:11,600
negativity. Just stop. Just stop it
 

7279
02:55:11,600 --> 02:55:17,750
negativity. Just stop. Just stop it
completely. Stop it.

7280
02:55:17,750 --> 02:55:17,760

 

7281
02:55:17,760 --> 02:55:19,429

Trend lines can be used as confluence.

7282
02:55:19,429 --> 02:55:19,439
Trend lines can be used as confluence.
 

7283
02:55:19,439 --> 02:55:21,510
Trend lines can be used as confluence.
Yes, great kitty. They they can be used

7284
02:55:21,510 --> 02:55:21,520
Yes, great kitty. They they can be used
 

7285
02:55:21,520 --> 02:55:23,830
Yes, great kitty. They they can be used
as extra confluence.

7286
02:55:23,830 --> 02:55:23,840
as extra confluence.
 

7287
02:55:23,840 --> 02:55:26,710
as extra confluence.
But what what I would say here, right,

7288
02:55:26,710 --> 02:55:26,720
But what what I would say here, right,
 

7289
02:55:26,720 --> 02:55:30,309
But what what I would say here, right,
we went over this a little bit earlier.

7290
02:55:30,309 --> 02:55:30,319
we went over this a little bit earlier.
 

7291
02:55:30,319 --> 02:55:31,990
we went over this a little bit earlier.
What you actually want here is like a

7292
02:55:31,990 --> 02:55:32,000
What you actually want here is like a
 

7293
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:33,670
What you actually want here is like a
buildout of some volume. All right, if

7294
02:55:33,670 --> 02:55:33,680
buildout of some volume. All right, if
 

7295
02:55:33,680 --> 02:55:36,309
buildout of some volume. All right, if
we can start poking this out and some

7296
02:55:36,309 --> 02:55:36,319
we can start poking this out and some
 

7297
02:55:36,319 --> 02:55:38,389
we can start poking this out and some
good volume and then a failed break

7298
02:55:38,389 --> 02:55:38,399
good volume and then a failed break
 

7299
02:55:38,399 --> 02:55:40,950
good volume and then a failed break
below. All right, so let's say we come

7300
02:55:40,950 --> 02:55:40,960
below. All right, so let's say we come
 

7301
02:55:40,960 --> 02:55:43,510
below. All right, so let's say we come
lower, we sweep, we clean out all these

7302
02:55:43,510 --> 02:55:43,520
lower, we sweep, we clean out all these
 

7303
02:55:43,520 --> 02:55:45,830
lower, we sweep, we clean out all these
levels, institutions get long, we come

7304
02:55:45,830 --> 02:55:45,840
levels, institutions get long, we come
 

7305
02:55:45,840 --> 02:55:47,590
levels, institutions get long, we come
back, and then we build above that

7306
02:55:47,590 --> 02:55:47,600
back, and then we build above that
 

7307
02:55:47,600 --> 02:55:49,349
back, and then we build above that
volume and we leave all the shorts

7308
02:55:49,349 --> 02:55:49,359
volume and we leave all the shorts
 

7309
02:55:49,359 --> 02:55:51,910
volume and we leave all the shorts
stuck. That is the better move, right?

7310
02:55:51,910 --> 02:55:51,920
stuck. That is the better move, right?
 

7311
02:55:51,920 --> 02:55:53,830
stuck. That is the better move, right?
This is a very early long. Like I said,

7312
02:55:53,830 --> 02:55:53,840
This is a very early long. Like I said,
 

7313
02:55:53,840 --> 02:55:55,349
This is a very early long. Like I said,
it's very early. I'm not convinced we

7314
02:55:55,349 --> 02:55:55,359
it's very early. I'm not convinced we
 

7315
02:55:55,359 --> 02:55:56,550
it's very early. I'm not convinced we
finished the low of day. I don't like

7316
02:55:56,550 --> 02:55:56,560
finished the low of day. I don't like
 

7317
02:55:56,560 --> 02:55:58,070
finished the low of day. I don't like
the auction at low of day. Remember, I

7318
02:55:58,070 --> 02:55:58,080
the auction at low of day. Remember, I
 

7319
02:55:58,080 --> 02:56:00,309
the auction at low of day. Remember, I
kept saying that it's very, very early.

7320
02:56:00,309 --> 02:56:00,319
kept saying that it's very, very early.
 

7321
02:56:00,319 --> 02:56:02,150
kept saying that it's very, very early.
But there are some sellers stuck between

7322
02:56:02,150 --> 02:56:02,160
But there are some sellers stuck between
 

7323
02:56:02,160 --> 02:56:05,110
But there are some sellers stuck between
20 and tens which we went over right

7324
02:56:05,110 --> 02:56:05,120
20 and tens which we went over right
 

7325
02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:07,990
20 and tens which we went over right
here. Right this right here. But it's

7326
02:56:07,990 --> 02:56:08,000
here. Right this right here. But it's
 

7327
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,150
here. Right this right here. But it's
not significant at low of day. I don't

7328
02:56:10,150 --> 02:56:10,160
not significant at low of day. I don't
 

7329
02:56:10,160 --> 02:56:12,070
not significant at low of day. I don't
like that. All right. There I want to

7330
02:56:12,070 --> 02:56:12,080
like that. All right. There I want to
 

7331
02:56:12,080 --> 02:56:14,389
like that. All right. There I want to
see big red and I'm not seeing that. But

7332
02:56:14,389 --> 02:56:14,399
see big red and I'm not seeing that. But
 

7333
02:56:14,399 --> 02:56:16,790
see big red and I'm not seeing that. But
you can see 20s to tens keeps being

7334
02:56:16,790 --> 02:56:16,800
you can see 20s to tens keeps being
 

7335
02:56:16,800 --> 02:56:20,870
you can see 20s to tens keeps being
absorbed. Where's 20s? 20s to tens. This

7336
02:56:20,870 --> 02:56:20,880
absorbed. Where's 20s? 20s to tens. This
 

7337
02:56:20,880 --> 02:56:24,389
absorbed. Where's 20s? 20s to tens. This
level here keeps being absorbed now. And

7338
02:56:24,389 --> 02:56:24,399
level here keeps being absorbed now. And
 

7339
02:56:24,399 --> 02:56:27,030
level here keeps being absorbed now. And
there is a chance for relief back up.

7340
02:56:27,030 --> 02:56:27,040
there is a chance for relief back up.
 

7341
02:56:27,040 --> 02:56:29,750
there is a chance for relief back up.
But it's not ideal. It is not like an A+

7342
02:56:29,750 --> 02:56:29,760
But it's not ideal. It is not like an A+
 

7343
02:56:29,760 --> 02:56:32,230
But it's not ideal. It is not like an A+
setup, but we are coming into a very,

7344
02:56:32,230 --> 02:56:32,240
setup, but we are coming into a very,
 

7345
02:56:32,240 --> 02:56:34,389
setup, but we are coming into a very,
very good area where I said I would be

7346
02:56:34,389 --> 02:56:34,399
very good area where I said I would be
 

7347
02:56:34,399 --> 02:56:36,550
very good area where I said I would be
willing to look for buys if we can trap

7348
02:56:36,550 --> 02:56:36,560
willing to look for buys if we can trap
 

7349
02:56:36,560 --> 02:56:38,070
willing to look for buys if we can trap
shorts. This is the first time we're

7350
02:56:38,070 --> 02:56:38,080
shorts. This is the first time we're
 

7351
02:56:38,080 --> 02:56:39,990
shorts. This is the first time we're
seeing this. I'd much rather it does

7352
02:56:39,990 --> 02:56:40,000
seeing this. I'd much rather it does
 

7353
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,230
seeing this. I'd much rather it does
this, builds out, and then does that for

7354
02:56:42,230 --> 02:56:42,240
this, builds out, and then does that for
 

7355
02:56:42,240 --> 02:56:44,710
this, builds out, and then does that for
FMC. That would be a plus. But right now

7356
02:56:44,710 --> 02:56:44,720
FMC. That would be a plus. But right now
 

7357
02:56:44,720 --> 02:57:00,870
FMC. That would be a plus. But right now
it's still holding.

7358
02:57:00,870 --> 02:57:00,880

 

7359
02:57:00,880 --> 02:57:02,870

Yeah. Trader [\h__\h] again. Yeah, there

7360
02:57:02,870 --> 02:57:02,880
Yeah. Trader [\h__\h] again. Yeah, there
 

7361
02:57:02,880 --> 02:57:06,630
Yeah. Trader [\h__\h] again. Yeah, there
you go.

7362
02:57:06,630 --> 02:57:06,640

 

7363
02:57:06,640 --> 02:57:08,389

Alex, were you able to stay green each

7364
02:57:08,389 --> 02:57:08,399
Alex, were you able to stay green each
 

7365
02:57:08,399 --> 02:57:10,070
Alex, were you able to stay green each
month last year? How do you keep

7366
02:57:10,070 --> 02:57:10,080
month last year? How do you keep
 

7367
02:57:10,080 --> 02:57:12,950
month last year? How do you keep
yourself from tilt? Um, I think I had

7368
02:57:12,950 --> 02:57:12,960
yourself from tilt? Um, I think I had
 

7369
02:57:12,960 --> 02:57:14,710
yourself from tilt? Um, I think I had
one red month last year. I have to go

7370
02:57:14,710 --> 02:57:14,720
one red month last year. I have to go
 

7371
02:57:14,720 --> 02:57:16,550
one red month last year. I have to go
through which month it was. I had one

7372
02:57:16,550 --> 02:57:16,560
through which month it was. I had one
 

7373
02:57:16,560 --> 02:57:19,510
through which month it was. I had one
technical issue on stream where I got

7374
02:57:19,510 --> 02:57:19,520
technical issue on stream where I got
 

7375
02:57:19,520 --> 02:57:22,389
technical issue on stream where I got
absolutely [\h__\h] smoked

7376
02:57:22,389 --> 02:57:22,399
absolutely [\h__\h] smoked
 

7377
02:57:22,399 --> 02:57:25,030
absolutely [\h__\h] smoked
um on the trade copier and I spent the

7378
02:57:25,030 --> 02:57:25,040
um on the trade copier and I spent the
 

7379
02:57:25,040 --> 02:57:28,870
um on the trade copier and I spent the
next few weeks making it back. How do I

7380
02:57:28,870 --> 02:57:28,880
next few weeks making it back. How do I
 

7381
02:57:28,880 --> 02:57:30,389
next few weeks making it back. How do I
keep myself on tilt? You would have seen

7382
02:57:30,389 --> 02:57:30,399
keep myself on tilt? You would have seen
 

7383
02:57:30,399 --> 02:57:33,030
keep myself on tilt? You would have seen
me go on tilt on stream. Um, but I don't

7384
02:57:33,030 --> 02:57:33,040
me go on tilt on stream. Um, but I don't
 

7385
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:35,750
me go on tilt on stream. Um, but I don't
like go mental when I go on tilt. You'll

7386
02:57:35,750 --> 02:57:35,760
like go mental when I go on tilt. You'll
 

7387
02:57:35,760 --> 02:57:39,110
like go mental when I go on tilt. You'll
see me verbalize when I'm on tilt. So,

7388
02:57:39,110 --> 02:57:39,120
see me verbalize when I'm on tilt. So,
 

7389
02:57:39,120 --> 02:57:41,110
see me verbalize when I'm on tilt. So,
what am I? I can tell you my big tilt

7390
02:57:41,110 --> 02:57:41,120
what am I? I can tell you my big tilt
 

7391
02:57:41,120 --> 02:57:43,910
what am I? I can tell you my big tilt
factors. Too many break evens in a row

7392
02:57:43,910 --> 02:57:43,920
factors. Too many break evens in a row
 

7393
02:57:43,920 --> 02:57:46,870
factors. Too many break evens in a row
or like calling a really good trade and

7394
02:57:46,870 --> 02:57:46,880
or like calling a really good trade and
 

7395
02:57:46,880 --> 02:57:48,710
or like calling a really good trade and
like not having it go for me. So, I

7396
02:57:48,710 --> 02:57:48,720
like not having it go for me. So, I
 

7397
02:57:48,720 --> 02:57:51,830
like not having it go for me. So, I
think it was last week.

7398
02:57:51,830 --> 02:57:51,840
think it was last week.
 

7399
02:57:51,840 --> 02:57:54,710
think it was last week.
Last week there was like three days in a

7400
02:57:54,710 --> 02:57:54,720
Last week there was like three days in a
 

7401
02:57:54,720 --> 02:57:56,710
Last week there was like three days in a
row where I got knocked out. I had three

7402
02:57:56,710 --> 02:57:56,720
row where I got knocked out. I had three
 

7403
02:57:56,720 --> 02:57:58,870
row where I got knocked out. I had three
attempts at a short two days in a row

7404
02:57:58,870 --> 02:57:58,880
attempts at a short two days in a row
 

7405
02:57:58,880 --> 02:58:02,469
attempts at a short two days in a row
for the rotation and I got knocked out

7406
02:58:02,469 --> 02:58:02,479
for the rotation and I got knocked out
 

7407
02:58:02,479 --> 02:58:04,309
for the rotation and I got knocked out
for like 20 points, 20 points, 20 points

7408
02:58:04,309 --> 02:58:04,319
for like 20 points, 20 points, 20 points
 

7409
02:58:04,319 --> 02:58:06,389
for like 20 points, 20 points, 20 points
and it would then on the fourth go it

7410
02:58:06,389 --> 02:58:06,399
and it would then on the fourth go it
 

7411
02:58:06,399 --> 02:58:08,550
and it would then on the fourth go it
would do like 100 point move. One day I

7412
02:58:08,550 --> 02:58:08,560
would do like 100 point move. One day I
 

7413
02:58:08,560 --> 02:58:11,510
would do like 100 point move. One day I
left stream and it went for like a 200

7414
02:58:11,510 --> 02:58:11,520
left stream and it went for like a 200
 

7415
02:58:11,520 --> 02:58:14,790
left stream and it went for like a 200
point fade. Um,

7416
02:58:14,790 --> 02:58:14,800
point fade. Um,
 

7417
02:58:14,800 --> 02:58:16,790
point fade. Um,
so it happens, but you what you'll see

7418
02:58:16,790 --> 02:58:16,800
so it happens, but you what you'll see
 

7419
02:58:16,800 --> 02:58:19,750
so it happens, but you what you'll see
with me is I verbalize it and I note it

7420
02:58:19,750 --> 02:58:19,760
with me is I verbalize it and I note it
 

7421
02:58:19,760 --> 02:58:20,950
with me is I verbalize it and I note it
and I come back to the stream the next

7422
02:58:20,950 --> 02:58:20,960
and I come back to the stream the next
 

7423
02:58:20,960 --> 02:58:23,190
and I come back to the stream the next
day and I'll be like, "Okay,

7424
02:58:23,190 --> 02:58:23,200
day and I'll be like, "Okay,
 

7425
02:58:23,200 --> 02:58:25,590
day and I'll be like, "Okay,
my tilt's up. My anxietyy's up. I'm

7426
02:58:25,590 --> 02:58:25,600

7427
02:58:25,600 --> 02:58:27,190
my tilt's up. My anxietyy's up. I'm
pissed off that I haven't made this much

7428
02:58:27,190 --> 02:58:27,200
pissed off that I haven't made this much
 

7429
02:58:27,200 --> 02:58:29,590
pissed off that I haven't made this much
money, so I need to be careful now. I

7430
02:58:29,590 --> 02:58:29,600
money, so I need to be careful now. I
 

7431
02:58:29,600 --> 02:58:31,590
money, so I need to be careful now. I
need to be very, very careful with my

7432
02:58:31,590 --> 02:58:31,600
need to be very, very careful with my
 

7433
02:58:31,600 --> 02:58:33,830
need to be very, very careful with my
sizing." And that's how I try and avoid

7434
02:58:33,830 --> 02:58:33,840
sizing." And that's how I try and avoid
 

7435
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:36,710
sizing." And that's how I try and avoid
it. Um, you can't people that like

7436
02:58:36,710 --> 02:58:36,720
it. Um, you can't people that like
 

7437
02:58:36,720 --> 02:58:38,309

control your emotions, control you
 

7439
02:58:38,319 --> 02:58:41,910
control your emotions, control you
can't. All you can do is control how you

7440
02:58:41,910 --> 02:58:41,920
can't. All you can do is control how you
 

7441
02:58:41,920 --> 02:58:43,990
can't. All you can do is control how you
view life, how you view things. You

7442
02:58:43,990 --> 02:58:44,000
view life, how you view things. You
 

7443
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:46,469
view life, how you view things. You
can't just There you go. So, trader doc

7444
02:58:46,469 --> 02:58:46,479
can't just There you go. So, trader doc
 

7445
02:58:46,479 --> 02:58:47,590
can't just There you go. So, trader doc
saying, "Yeah, I remember you kept

02:58:47,590 --> 02:58:47,600
saying, "Yeah, I remember you kept
 

7447
02:58:47,600 --> 02:58:49,590
saying, "Yeah, I remember you kept
warning yourself." For me, if I

warning yourself." For me, if I
 

7449
02:58:49,600 --> 02:58:51,990
warning yourself." For me, if I
verbalize it and say it out loud, that

7450
02:58:51,990 --> 02:58:52,000
verbalize it and say it out loud, that
 

7451
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:54,150
verbalize it and say it out loud, that
for me is part of acceptance, right?

7452
02:58:54,150 --> 02:58:54,160
for me is part of acceptance, right?
 

7453
02:58:54,160 --> 02:58:56,710
for me is part of acceptance, right?

7471
02:59:14,319 --> 02:59:15,830

your lifestyle isn't what you thought it

7472
02:59:15,830 --> 02:59:15,840
your lifestyle isn't what you thought it
 

7473
02:59:15,840 --> 02:59:17,590
your lifestyle isn't what you thought it
was? Can you accept that you've just

7477
02:59:20,080 --> 02:59:21,750
taken a bad trade and you've lost on it?
All right, that might sound like really

7478
02:59:21,750 --> 02:59:21,760
All right, that might sound like really
 

7479
02:59:21,760 --> 02:59:24,230
All right, that might sound like really
simple. It's actually not because

7480
02:59:24,230 --> 02:59:24,240
simple. It's actually not because
 

7481
02:59:24,240 --> 02:59:26,309
simple. It's actually not because
acceptance is what allowed you to move

7482
02:59:26,309 --> 02:59:26,319
acceptance is what allowed you to move
 

7483
02:59:26,319 --> 02:59:29,349
acceptance is what allowed you to move
forward. If you cling on to the fact

7484
02:59:29,349 --> 02:59:29,359
forward. If you cling on to the fact
 

7485
02:59:29,359 --> 02:59:30,790
forward. If you cling on to the fact
that those things have happened and you

7486
02:59:30,790 --> 02:59:30,800
that those things have happened and you
 

7487
02:59:30,800 --> 02:59:31,990
that those things have happened and you
can't accept they've happened, it

7488
02:59:31,990 --> 02:59:32,000
can't accept they've happened, it
 

7489
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:34,230
can't accept they've happened, it
doesn't mean it's okay, right? I'm not

7490
02:59:34,230 --> 02:59:34,240
doesn't mean it's okay, right? I'm not
 

7491
02:59:34,240 --> 02:59:36,630
doesn't mean it's okay, right? I'm not
trying to make an excuse for it, but if

7492
02:59:36,630 --> 02:59:36,640
trying to make an excuse for it, but if
 

7493
02:59:36,640 --> 02:59:39,349
trying to make an excuse for it, but if
you cling on to the fact that I'm so

7494
02:59:39,349 --> 02:59:39,359
you cling on to the fact that I'm so
 

7495
02:59:39,359 --> 02:59:40,710
you cling on to the fact that I'm so
pissed off that that's happened or I'm

7496
02:59:40,710 --> 02:59:40,720
pissed off that that's happened or I'm
 

7497
02:59:40,720 --> 02:59:43,429
pissed off that that's happened or I'm
so upset and I'm so devastated, you are

7498
02:59:43,429 --> 02:59:43,439
so upset and I'm so devastated, you are
 

7499
02:59:43,439 --> 02:59:46,870
so upset and I'm so devastated, you are
clinging on to a tag, a a a form of

7500
02:59:46,870 --> 02:59:46,880
clinging on to a tag, a a a form of
 

7501
02:59:46,880 --> 02:59:49,110
clinging on to a tag, a a a form of
tilt, an emotion. If you can just accept

7502
02:59:49,110 --> 02:59:49,120
tilt, an emotion. If you can just accept
 

7503
02:59:49,120 --> 02:59:50,469
tilt, an emotion. If you can just accept
that it's happened, okay, that's

7504
02:59:50,469 --> 02:59:50,479
that it's happened, okay, that's
 

7505
02:59:50,479 --> 02:59:52,790
that it's happened, okay, that's
happened to me. It's unfortunate. I'm

7506
02:59:52,790 --> 02:59:52,800
happened to me. It's unfortunate. I'm
 

7507
02:59:52,800 --> 02:59:55,110
happened to me. It's unfortunate. I'm
not happy about it, but this is how I'm

7508
02:59:55,110 --> 02:59:55,120
not happy about it, but this is how I'm
 

7509
02:59:55,120 --> 02:59:56,870
not happy about it, but this is how I'm
going to move forward. That is how you

7510
02:59:56,870 --> 02:59:56,880
going to move forward. That is how you
 

7511
02:59:56,880 --> 03:00:00,150
going to move forward. That is how you
move from taking a loss to moving

7512
03:00:00,150 --> 03:00:00,160
move from taking a loss to moving
 

7513
03:00:00,160 --> 03:00:03,110
move from taking a loss to moving
forward. So let's say I took a loss.

7514
03:00:03,110 --> 03:00:03,120
forward. So let's say I took a loss.
 

7515
03:00:03,120 --> 03:00:04,870
forward. So let's say I took a loss.
Okay, I accept that's happened. I've

Okay, I accept that's happened. I've
 

7517
03:00:04,880 --> 03:00:06,150
Okay, I accept that's happened. I've
moved forward. What's the next trade

moved forward. What's the next trade
 

7519
03:00:06,160 --> 03:00:08,469
moved forward. What's the next trade
setup? Okay, I've taken another loss. It

7520
03:00:08,469 --> 03:00:08,479
setup? Okay, I've taken another loss. It
 

7521
03:00:08,479 --> 03:00:09,830
setup? Okay, I've taken another loss. It
hasn't worked out for me. Okay, what's

7531
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:17,910

walk away. Come back with a fresh face

7532
03:00:17,910 --> 03:00:17,920
walk away. Come back with a fresh face
 

7533
03:00:17,920 --> 03:00:19,269
walk away. Come back with a fresh face
tomorrow cuz I want to get punched in

7534
03:00:19,269 --> 03:00:19,279
tomorrow cuz I want to get punched in
 

7535
03:00:19,279 --> 03:00:20,790
tomorrow cuz I want to get punched in
the face five times in a row, right?

7536
03:00:20,790 --> 03:00:20,800
the face five times in a row, right?
 

7537
03:00:20,800 --> 03:00:22,230
the face five times in a row, right?
Three times is enough to be punched in

7538
03:00:22,230 --> 03:00:22,240
Three times is enough to be punched in
 

7539
03:00:22,240 --> 03:00:24,550
Three times is enough to be punched in
the face. So it it's just finding

7540
03:00:24,550 --> 03:00:24,560
the face. So it it's just finding
 

7541
03:00:24,560 --> 03:00:26,389
the face. So it it's just finding
acceptance and knowing your tolerance,

7542
03:00:26,389 --> 03:00:26,399
acceptance and knowing your tolerance,
 

7543
03:00:26,399 --> 03:00:28,790
acceptance and knowing your tolerance,
right? If you're going to sit here and

right? If you're going to sit here and
 

7545
03:00:28,800 --> 03:00:30,309
right? If you're going to sit here and
you can't find acceptance for it, what

7546
03:00:30,309 --> 03:00:30,319
you can't find acceptance for it, what
 

7547
03:00:30,319 --> 03:00:31,590
you can't find acceptance for it, what
does not finding acceptance for

7548
03:00:31,590 --> 03:00:31,600
does not finding acceptance for
 

7549
03:00:31,600 --> 03:00:33,349
does not finding acceptance for
something look like? Tell you what it

7569
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:53,830

03:00:53,830 --> 03:00:53,840
what not finding acceptance looks like,
 

7571
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:56,150
what not finding acceptance looks like,
right? Fighting fighting against the

right? Fighting fighting against the
 

7573
03:00:56,160 --> 03:00:59,269
right? Fighting fighting against the
markets. If I'm trading well, I'm never

like understanding the key levels. We

7594
03:01:24,469 --> 03:01:24,479
like understanding the key levels. We
 

7595
03:01:24,479 --> 03:01:25,910
like understanding the key levels. We
can all mark out these key levels,

7596
03:01:25,910 --> 03:01:25,920

7600
03:01:30,550 --> 03:01:30,560
levels. Do you have the patience to wait
 

7601
03:01:30,560 --> 03:01:32,550

03:01:52,150 --> 03:01:52,160
this key level down here into my key
 

7619
03:01:52,160 --> 03:01:58,550
this key level down here into my key

03:01:58,550 --> 03:01:58,560

 

7621
03:01:58,560 --> 03:02:01,030

We didn't trade all this,

7622
03:02:01,030 --> 03:02:01,040
We didn't trade all this,
 

7623
03:02:01,040 --> 03:02:03,269
We didn't trade all this,
right? We waited. I said to you, I'm

7624
03:02:03,269 --> 03:02:03,279
right? We waited. I said to you, I'm
 

7625

03:02:04,550 --> 03:02:04,560
going to ignore this short and I'm going
 

7627
03:02:04,560 --> 03:02:05,910
going to ignore this short and I'm going
to wait for the long. Very much like

7628
03:02:05,910 --> 03:02:05,920

7629
03:02:05,920 --> 03:02:07,990

today, I'm going to ignore this short,

7630
03:02:07,990 --> 03:02:08,000
today, I'm going to ignore this short,
 

7631
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:09,510
today, I'm going to ignore this short,
wait for the long into this key level.

7632
03:02:09,510 --> 03:02:09,520
wait for the long into this key level.
 

7633

The trigger was 40 from what I remember.

7634
03:02:12,230 --> 03:02:12,240
The trigger was 40 from what I remember.
 

7635
03:02:12,240 --> 03:02:15,269
The trigger was 40 from what I remember.
Shorts were stuck here under 40. This

7636
03:02:15,269 --> 03:02:15,279
Shorts were stuck here under 40. This
 

7637
03:02:15,279 --> 03:02:17,750
Shorts were stuck here under 40. This
was the trigger. That's the patient. The

7638
03:02:17,750 --> 03:02:17,760
was the trigger. That's the patient. The
 

7639
03:02:17,760 --> 03:02:19,910
was the trigger. That's the patient. The
patient guy wins. The disciplined trader

7640
03:02:19,910 --> 03:02:19,920
patient guy wins. The disciplined trader
 

7641
03:02:19,920 --> 03:02:22,230
patient guy wins. The disciplined trader
who's willing to let it come to a level,

7642
03:02:22,230 --> 03:02:22,240
who's willing to let it come to a level,
 

7643
03:02:22,240 --> 03:02:24,389
who's willing to let it come to a level,
let it show you it wants to move and

7644
03:02:24,389 --> 03:02:24,399
let it show you it wants to move and
 

7645
03:02:24,399 --> 03:02:27,349
let it show you it wants to move and
then take the trade. If you can start

7646
03:02:27,349 --> 03:02:27,359
then take the trade. If you can start
 

7647
03:02:27,359 --> 03:02:29,349
then take the trade. If you can start
doing that, that is called knowing

7648
03:02:29,349 --> 03:02:29,359
doing that, that is called knowing
 

7649
03:02:29,359 --> 03:02:30,950
doing that, that is called knowing
yourself. Because marking levels is

7650
03:02:30,950 --> 03:02:30,960
yourself. Because marking levels is
 

7651
03:02:30,960 --> 03:02:33,110
yourself. Because marking levels is
easy. Waiting for the levels, that's a

7652
03:02:33,110 --> 03:02:33,120
easy. Waiting for the levels, that's a
 

7653
03:02:33,120 --> 03:02:34,950
easy. Waiting for the levels, that's a
whole new skill. It might sound really

7654
03:02:34,950 --> 03:02:34,960
whole new skill. It might sound really
 

7655
03:02:34,960 --> 03:02:38,309
whole new skill. It might sound really
simple. Most traders cannot wait. They

7656
03:02:38,309 --> 03:02:38,319
simple. Most traders cannot wait. They
 

7657
03:02:38,319 --> 03:02:40,389
simple. Most traders cannot wait. They
cannot wait. They have to click. They

7658
03:02:40,389 --> 03:02:40,399
cannot wait. They have to click. They
 

7659
03:02:40,399 --> 03:02:42,710
cannot wait. They have to click. They
have to be in a trade, right? They

7660
03:02:42,710 --> 03:02:42,720
have to be in a trade, right? They
 

7661
03:02:42,720 --> 03:02:45,269
have to be in a trade, right? They
cannot wait. Look, if you waited now and

7662
03:02:45,269 --> 03:02:45,279
cannot wait. Look, if you waited now and
 

7663
03:02:45,279 --> 03:02:47,110
cannot wait. Look, if you waited now and
the hold of 20 and 10s that we talked

7664
03:02:47,110 --> 03:02:47,120
the hold of 20 and 10s that we talked
 

7665
03:02:47,120 --> 03:02:48,630
the hold of 20 and 10s that we talked
about. Look, we're there. We're almost

7666
03:02:48,630 --> 03:02:48,640
about. Look, we're there. We're almost
 

7667
03:02:48,640 --> 03:02:51,590
about. Look, we're there. We're almost
there already. This is TP2. TP3 would be

7668
03:02:51,590 --> 03:02:51,600
there already. This is TP2. TP3 would be
 

7669
03:02:51,600 --> 03:02:53,110
there already. This is TP2. TP3 would be
up here for acceptance. We're going to

7670
03:02:53,110 --> 03:02:53,120
up here for acceptance. We're going to
 

7671
03:02:53,120 --> 03:02:55,510
up here for acceptance. We're going to
run out all these stops, right? It's

7672
03:02:55,510 --> 03:02:55,520
run out all these stops, right? It's
 

7673
03:02:55,520 --> 03:02:57,269
run out all these stops, right? It's
literally doing everything we've just

7674
03:02:57,269 --> 03:02:57,279
literally doing everything we've just
 

7675
03:02:57,279 --> 03:02:58,950
literally doing everything we've just
talked about. Why? It's not cuz I'm a

7676
03:02:58,950 --> 03:02:58,960
talked about. Why? It's not cuz I'm a
 

7677
03:02:58,960 --> 03:03:01,030
talked about. Why? It's not cuz I'm a
[\h__\h] genius, guys. I'm not a genius.

7678
03:03:01,030 --> 03:03:01,040
[\h__\h] genius, guys. I'm not a genius.
 

7679
03:03:01,040 --> 03:03:21,349
[\h__\h] genius, guys. I'm not a genius.
It's just patience. It's patience.

7680
03:03:21,349 --> 03:03:21,359

 

7681
03:03:21,359 --> 03:03:23,510

I can have accepted big loss as my wife

7682
03:03:23,510 --> 03:03:23,520
I can have accepted big loss as my wife
 

7683
03:03:23,520 --> 03:03:33,910
I can have accepted big loss as my wife
is a different story.

7684
03:03:33,910 --> 03:03:33,920

 

7685
03:03:33,920 --> 03:03:35,830

Acceptance does not mean I can't do

7686
03:03:35,830 --> 03:03:35,840
Acceptance does not mean I can't do
 

7687
03:03:35,840 --> 03:03:38,150
Acceptance does not mean I can't do
something going forward. I accept the

7688
03:03:38,150 --> 03:03:38,160
something going forward. I accept the
 

7689
03:03:38,160 --> 03:03:40,150
something going forward. I accept the
weather is what the weather is and

7690
03:03:40,150 --> 03:03:40,160
weather is what the weather is and
 

7691
03:03:40,160 --> 03:03:41,510
weather is what the weather is and
there's nothing I can do about it.

7692
03:03:41,510 --> 03:03:41,520
there's nothing I can do about it.
 

7693
03:03:41,520 --> 03:03:43,110
there's nothing I can do about it.
However, if it's raining, I can grab an

7694
03:03:43,110 --> 03:03:43,120
However, if it's raining, I can grab an
 

7695
03:03:43,120 --> 03:03:45,750
However, if it's raining, I can grab an
umbrella. That's exactly it, MJ. That is

7696
03:03:45,750 --> 03:03:45,760
umbrella. That's exactly it, MJ. That is
 

7697
03:03:45,760 --> 03:03:48,550
umbrella. That's exactly it, MJ. That is
such a great way to put it. That is such

7698
03:03:48,550 --> 03:03:48,560
such a great way to put it. That is such
 

7699
03:03:48,560 --> 03:03:50,389
such a great way to put it. That is such
a great That is acceptance. It doesn't

7700
03:03:50,389 --> 03:03:50,399
a great That is acceptance. It doesn't
 

7701
03:03:50,399 --> 03:03:52,870
a great That is acceptance. It doesn't
mean you have to like it. It just means

7702
03:03:52,870 --> 03:03:52,880
mean you have to like it. It just means
 

7703
03:03:52,880 --> 03:03:54,550
mean you have to like it. It just means
you accept it's happened. I'm learning

7704
03:03:54,550 --> 03:03:54,560
you accept it's happened. I'm learning
 

7705
03:03:54,560 --> 03:03:56,870
you accept it's happened. I'm learning
this. I'm genuinely I'm still learning

7706
03:03:56,870 --> 03:03:56,880
this. I'm genuinely I'm still learning
 

7707
03:03:56,880 --> 03:03:59,030
this. I'm genuinely I'm still learning
this. You don't have to like everything

7708
03:03:59,030 --> 03:03:59,040
this. You don't have to like everything
 

7709
03:03:59,040 --> 03:04:00,630
this. You don't have to like everything
that happens to you in life, but you

7710
03:04:00,630 --> 03:04:00,640
that happens to you in life, but you
 

7711
03:04:00,640 --> 03:04:02,150
that happens to you in life, but you
have to accept that it's happened. If

7712
03:04:02,150 --> 03:04:02,160
have to accept that it's happened. If
 

7713
03:04:02,160 --> 03:04:04,710
have to accept that it's happened. If
it's in the past, it's already happened.

7714
03:04:04,710 --> 03:04:04,720
it's in the past, it's already happened.
 

7715

it's in the past, it's already happened.
You can [\h__\h] and moan and scream and

You can [\h__\h] and moan and scream and

shout all you want, but all you're doing
 

7719
03:04:07,760 --> 03:04:10,070
shout all you want, but all you're doing
is causing yourself in pain, or you can

7720
03:04:10,070 --> 03:04:10,080
is causing yourself in pain, or you can
 

7721
03:04:10,080 --> 03:04:12,550
is causing yourself in pain, or you can
accept it's happened and try and find

03:04:12,550 --> 03:04:12,560
accept it's happened and try and find
 

7723
03:04:12,560 --> 03:04:14,950
accept it's happened and try and find
the most comforting or best solution for

7724
03:04:14,950 --> 03:04:14,960
the most comforting or best solution for
 

7725
03:04:14,960 --> 03:04:16,790
the most comforting or best solution for
you to move forward. That's trading. You

7726
03:04:16,790 --> 03:04:16,800
you to move forward. That's trading. You
 

7727
03:04:16,800 --> 03:04:18,469
you to move forward. That's trading. You
can accept it, right? If you can't

7728
03:04:18,469 --> 03:04:18,479
can accept it, right? If you can't
 

7729
03:04:18,479 --> 03:04:20,309
can accept it, right? If you can't
accept a loss trading, you're going to

7730
03:04:20,309 --> 03:04:20,319
accept a loss trading, you're going to
 

7731
03:04:20,319 --> 03:04:22,150
accept a loss trading, you're going to
really struggle. You're going to really

7732
03:04:22,150 --> 03:04:22,160
really struggle. You're going to really
 

7733

really struggle. You're going to really
struggle.

7735
03:04:29,760 --> 03:04:33,590

How you know that was the level? Um what

7736
03:04:33,590 --> 03:04:33,600
How you know that was the level? Um what
 

7737
03:04:33,600 --> 03:04:36,790
How you know that was the level? Um what
was your name? Alan Alanis there. Uh

7738
03:04:36,790 --> 03:04:36,800
was your name? Alan Alanis there. Uh
 

7739
03:04:36,800 --> 03:04:38,710
was your name? Alan Alanis there. Uh
it's just based on value. All right.

7740
03:04:38,710 --> 03:04:38,720
it's just based on value. All right.
 

7741
03:04:38,720 --> 03:04:40,230
it's just based on value. All right.

Previous day close. Lots of confluence

7746
03:04:43,590 --> 03:04:43,600
Previous day close. Lots of confluence
 

7747
03:04:43,600 --> 03:04:46,230
Previous day close. Lots of confluence
down here. We are likely to come under

7748
03:04:46,230 --> 03:04:46,240
down here. We are likely to come under
 

7749
03:04:46,240 --> 03:04:48,550
down here. We are likely to come under
this level and find a bid. And you know

7750
03:04:48,550 --> 03:04:48,560
this level and find a bid. And you know
 

7751
03:04:48,560 --> 03:04:51,110
this level and find a bid. And you know
right under it we did. And we trapped

7752
03:04:51,110 --> 03:04:51,120
right under it we did. And we trapped
 

7753
03:04:51,120 --> 03:04:53,349
right under it we did. And we trapped
like we said 20 to 10 was the trap. And

7754
03:04:53,349 --> 03:04:53,359
like we said 20 to 10 was the trap. And
 

7755
03:04:53,359 --> 03:04:58,469
like we said 20 to 10 was the trap. And
here we go. So, this is the move.

7756
03:04:58,469 --> 03:04:58,479
here we go. So, this is the move.
 

7757
03:04:58,479 --> 03:04:59,990
here we go. So, this is the move.
Friska, I'd wait for the pullback now.

7758
03:04:59,990 --> 03:05:00,000
Friska, I'd wait for the pullback now.
 

7759
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:01,670
Friska, I'd wait for the pullback now.
If you if you didn't take this dip in

7760
03:05:01,670 --> 03:05:01,680
If you if you didn't take this dip in
 

7761
03:05:01,680 --> 03:05:02,790
If you if you didn't take this dip in
here, I'd wait for the pullback now

7762
03:05:02,790 --> 03:05:02,800
here, I'd wait for the pullback now
 

7763
03:05:02,800 --> 03:05:03,990
here, I'd wait for the pullback now
because you want to be careful. Think

7764
03:05:03,990 --> 03:05:04,000
because you want to be careful. Think
 

7765
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,870
because you want to be careful. Think
about the uh the amount of legs, right?

7766
03:05:06,870 --> 03:05:06,880
about the uh the amount of legs, right?
 

7767
03:05:06,880 --> 03:05:08,389
about the uh the amount of legs, right?
We we don't want to long at the top of

7768
03:05:08,389 --> 03:05:08,399
We we don't want to long at the top of
 

7769
03:05:08,399 --> 03:05:10,710
We we don't want to long at the top of
this one, two. We don't want a long up

7770
03:05:10,710 --> 03:05:10,720
this one, two. We don't want a long up
 

7771
03:05:10,720 --> 03:05:12,230
this one, two. We don't want a long up
here. We don't want to long up here. So,

7772
03:05:12,230 --> 03:05:12,240
here. We don't want to long up here. So,
 

7773
03:05:12,240 --> 03:05:13,750
here. We don't want to long up here. So,
what you want, let it build out some

7774
03:05:13,750 --> 03:05:13,760
what you want, let it build out some
 

7775
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:15,750
what you want, let it build out some
volume now. Let it prove to you that it

7776
03:05:15,750 --> 03:05:15,760
volume now. Let it prove to you that it
 

7777
03:05:15,760 --> 03:05:17,750
volume now. Let it prove to you that it
doesn't want to go low and then you can

7778
03:05:17,750 --> 03:05:17,760
doesn't want to go low and then you can
 

7779
03:05:17,760 --> 03:05:19,510
doesn't want to go low and then you can
think about trading back upside. I still

7780
03:05:19,510 --> 03:05:19,520
think about trading back upside. I still
 

7781
03:05:19,520 --> 03:05:21,990
think about trading back upside. I still
don't love this. I'll be honest, but we

7782
03:05:21,990 --> 03:05:22,000
don't love this. I'll be honest, but we
 

7783
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:24,150
don't love this. I'll be honest, but we
will see. This is just squeeze relief

7784
03:05:24,150 --> 03:05:24,160
will see. This is just squeeze relief
 

7785
03:05:24,160 --> 03:05:36,550
will see. This is just squeeze relief
back to this shelf.

7786
03:05:36,550 --> 03:05:36,560

 

7787
03:05:36,560 --> 03:05:38,309

It definitely happens, trader doc. It

7788
03:05:38,309 --> 03:05:38,319
It definitely happens, trader doc. It
 

7789
03:05:38,319 --> 03:05:40,790
It definitely happens, trader doc. It
definitely happens.

7790
03:05:40,790 --> 03:05:40,800
definitely happens.
 

7791
03:05:40,800 --> 03:05:42,870
definitely happens.
Do I think that the balance the trade's

7792
03:05:42,870 --> 03:05:42,880
Do I think that the balance the trade's
 

7793
03:05:42,880 --> 03:05:44,309
Do I think that the balance the trade's
going to go back upside? Yeah, I don't

7794
03:05:44,309 --> 03:05:44,319
going to go back upside? Yeah, I don't
 

7795
03:05:44,319 --> 03:05:46,389
going to go back upside? Yeah, I don't
know if we wick this out. Like, I'll be

7796
03:05:46,389 --> 03:05:46,399
know if we wick this out. Like, I'll be
 

7797
03:05:46,399 --> 03:05:48,070
know if we wick this out. Like, I'll be
honest. I don't know if we wick this out

7798
03:05:48,070 --> 03:05:48,080
honest. I don't know if we wick this out
 

7799
03:05:48,080 --> 03:05:51,670
honest. I don't know if we wick this out
still, but my bias is as long as we hold

7800
03:05:51,670 --> 03:05:51,680
still, but my bias is as long as we hold
 

7801
03:05:51,680 --> 03:05:53,750
still, but my bias is as long as we hold
this area, I think we will trade back

7802
03:05:53,750 --> 03:05:53,760
this area, I think we will trade back
 

7803
03:05:53,760 --> 03:05:56,630
this area, I think we will trade back
upside. It doesn't have to be today, but

7804
03:05:56,630 --> 03:05:56,640
upside. It doesn't have to be today, but
 

7805
03:05:56,640 --> 03:05:58,230
upside. It doesn't have to be today, but
as long as we hold this area. I think

7806
03:05:58,230 --> 03:05:58,240
as long as we hold this area. I think
 

7807
03:05:58,240 --> 03:05:59,910
as long as we hold this area. I think
this has been built this way for a

7808
03:05:59,910 --> 03:05:59,920
this has been built this way for a
 

7809
03:05:59,920 --> 03:06:03,030
this has been built this way for a
reason. All right, trap. Right.

7810
03:06:03,030 --> 03:06:03,040
reason. All right, trap. Right.
 

7811
03:06:03,040 --> 03:06:04,230
reason. All right, trap. Right.

Drip, drip, drip. Ideally, we do

7816
03:06:06,950 --> 03:06:06,960
Drip, drip, drip. Ideally, we do
 

7817
03:06:06,960 --> 03:06:08,389
Drip, drip, drip. Ideally, we do
something like this, this, this, this,

7818
03:06:08,389 --> 03:06:08,399
something like this, this, this, this,
 

7819
03:06:08,399 --> 03:06:10,070
something like this, this, this, this,
and then this. I think that's possible.

7820
03:06:10,070 --> 03:06:10,080
and then this. I think that's possible.
 

7821
03:06:10,080 --> 03:06:11,910
and then this. I think that's possible.
If we lose this area, though, you can't

7822
03:06:11,910 --> 03:06:11,920
If we lose this area, though, you can't
 

7823
03:06:11,920 --> 03:06:13,349
If we lose this area, though, you can't
look for that trade. If we lose this

7824
03:06:13,349 --> 03:06:13,359
look for that trade. If we lose this
 

7825
03:06:13,359 --> 03:06:15,269
look for that trade. If we lose this
area, the rotation is back down to the

7826
03:06:15,269 --> 03:06:15,279
area, the rotation is back down to the
 

7827
03:06:15,279 --> 03:06:17,670
area, the rotation is back down to the
900s, right? It's very very possible if

7828
03:06:17,670 --> 03:06:17,680
900s, right? It's very very possible if
 

7829
03:06:17,680 --> 03:06:19,590
900s, right? It's very very possible if
we lose that area, but all the time we

7830
03:06:19,590 --> 03:06:19,600
we lose that area, but all the time we
 

7831
03:06:19,600 --> 03:06:22,870
we lose that area, but all the time we
are holding down into sort of 26,000 and

7832
03:06:22,870 --> 03:06:22,880
are holding down into sort of 26,000 and
 

7833
03:06:22,880 --> 03:06:24,950
are holding down into sort of 26,000 and
50 is the max. But ideally, we want to

7834
03:06:24,950 --> 03:06:24,960
50 is the max. But ideally, we want to
 

7835
03:06:24,960 --> 03:06:29,269
50 is the max. But ideally, we want to
hold 26,100, 26,73 somewhere in here. As

7836
03:06:29,269 --> 03:06:29,279
hold 26,100, 26,73 somewhere in here. As
 

7837
03:06:29,279 --> 03:06:31,349
hold 26,100, 26,73 somewhere in here. As
long as they do this, this this if they

7838
03:06:31,349 --> 03:06:31,359
long as they do this, this this if they
 

7839
03:06:31,359 --> 03:06:32,950
long as they do this, this this if they
build out this and reclaim it, then I

7840
03:06:32,950 --> 03:06:32,960
build out this and reclaim it, then I
 

7841
03:06:32,960 --> 03:06:35,030
build out this and reclaim it, then I
think there's a great upside shot. If

7842
03:06:35,030 --> 03:06:35,040
think there's a great upside shot. If
 

7843
03:06:35,040 --> 03:06:36,550
think there's a great upside shot. If
they're going to do it already, it's it

7844
03:06:36,550 --> 03:06:36,560
they're going to do it already, it's it
 

7845
03:06:36,560 --> 03:06:38,550
they're going to do it already, it's it
is what it is. If that 20 to 10 hold was

7846
03:06:38,550 --> 03:06:38,560
is what it is. If that 20 to 10 hold was
 

7847
03:06:38,560 --> 03:06:40,389
is what it is. If that 20 to 10 hold was
it, it's not the best auction at the low

7848
03:06:40,389 --> 03:06:40,399
it, it's not the best auction at the low
 

7849
03:06:40,399 --> 03:06:56,550
it, it's not the best auction at the low
of day, but if that was it, that was it.

7850
03:06:56,550 --> 03:06:56,560

 

7851
03:06:56,560 --> 03:06:58,230

This is a better look here. This is

This is a better look here. This is
 

7869
03:07:11,840 --> 03:07:13,910
This is a better look here. This is
actually a better buildout. All right,

7870
03:07:13,910 --> 03:07:13,920
actually a better buildout. All right,
 

7871
03:07:13,920 --> 03:07:15,429
actually a better buildout. All right,
underneath higher time frame algo,

7872
03:07:15,429 --> 03:07:15,439
underneath higher time frame algo,
 

7873
03:07:15,439 --> 03:07:17,670
underneath higher time frame algo,
there's your higher time frame algo dip

7874
03:07:17,670 --> 03:07:17,680
there's your higher time frame algo dip
 

7875
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:20,469
there's your higher time frame algo dip
underneath it. Reclaim. If they start

7876
03:07:20,469 --> 03:07:20,479
underneath it. Reclaim. If they start
 

7877
03:07:20,479 --> 03:07:22,790
underneath it. Reclaim. If they start
holding this and reclaiming, this is

7878
03:07:22,790 --> 03:07:22,800
holding this and reclaiming, this is
 

7879
03:07:22,800 --> 03:07:25,750
holding this and reclaiming, this is
your big area PDC to IB. If they if

7880
03:07:25,750 --> 03:07:25,760
your big area PDC to IB. If they if
 

7881
03:07:25,760 --> 03:07:27,269
your big area PDC to IB. If they if
they're able to reclaim this, this has

7882
03:07:27,269 --> 03:07:27,279
they're able to reclaim this, this has
 

7883
03:07:27,279 --> 03:07:29,590
they're able to reclaim this, this has
got a shot. It has got a shot back into

7884
03:07:29,590 --> 03:07:29,600
got a shot. It has got a shot back into
 

7885
03:07:29,600 --> 03:07:33,269
got a shot. It has got a shot back into
it. It's the same kind of story, right?

7886
03:07:33,269 --> 03:07:33,279
it. It's the same kind of story, right?
 

7887
03:07:33,279 --> 03:07:42,389
it. It's the same kind of story, right?
Let's zoom out on an hourly.

7888
03:07:42,389 --> 03:07:42,399

 

7889
03:07:42,399 --> 03:07:45,349

Sunday open. It's a nice flag pullback

7890
03:07:45,349 --> 03:07:45,359
Sunday open. It's a nice flag pullback
 

7891
03:07:45,359 --> 03:07:48,389
Sunday open. It's a nice flag pullback
into the 30s,

7892
03:07:48,389 --> 03:07:48,399
into the 30s,
 

7893
03:07:48,399 --> 03:07:50,630
into the 30s,
right? And the last chance would be into

7894
03:07:50,630 --> 03:07:50,640
right? And the last chance would be into
 

7895
03:07:50,640 --> 03:07:52,550
right? And the last chance would be into
60s. So, I think dip buys, if they're

7896
03:07:52,550 --> 03:07:52,560
60s. So, I think dip buys, if they're
 

7897
03:07:52,560 --> 03:07:53,990
60s. So, I think dip buys, if they're
going to hold it, will be either where

7898
03:07:53,990 --> 03:07:54,000
going to hold it, will be either where
 

7899
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:56,870
going to hold it, will be either where
we are now or down into these 60s. All

7900
03:07:56,870 --> 03:07:56,880
we are now or down into these 60s. All
 

7901
03:07:56,880 --> 03:07:58,150
we are now or down into these 60s. All
right. So, either they're going to do

7902
03:07:58,150 --> 03:07:58,160
right. So, either they're going to do
 

7903
03:07:58,160 --> 03:08:00,550
right. So, either they're going to do
this or they do this move here later in

7904
03:08:00,550 --> 03:08:00,560
this or they do this move here later in
 

7905
03:08:00,560 --> 03:08:02,230
this or they do this move here later in
the week. That's what I would be looking

7906
03:08:02,230 --> 03:08:02,240
the week. That's what I would be looking
 

7907
03:08:02,240 --> 03:08:04,309
the week. That's what I would be looking
for. failing to hold 60s or if you come

7908
03:08:04,309 --> 03:08:04,319
for. failing to hold 60s or if you come
 

7909
03:08:04,319 --> 03:08:05,830
for. failing to hold 60s or if you come
under this I'd be very concerned

7910
03:08:05,830 --> 03:08:05,840
under this I'd be very concerned
 

7911
03:08:05,840 --> 03:08:08,550
under this I'd be very concerned
especially under here but same kind of

7912
03:08:08,550 --> 03:08:08,560
especially under here but same kind of
 

7913
03:08:08,560 --> 03:08:10,469
especially under here but same kind of
same kind of story on ES exactly the

7914
03:08:10,469 --> 03:08:10,479

03:13:23,830 --> 03:13:23,840
Okay. Got stuck at that TP2. And like I
 

8143
03:13:23,840 --> 03:13:25,590
Okay. Got stuck at that TP2. And like I
said, this auction under here, I would

8144
03:13:25,590 --> 03:13:25,600
said, this auction under here, I would
 

8145
03:13:25,600 --> 03:13:27,190
said, this auction under here, I would
be very, very careful. All right.

8146
03:13:27,190 --> 03:13:27,200
be very, very careful. All right.
 

8147
03:13:27,200 --> 03:13:31,349
be very, very careful. All right.
Because this under here,

8148
03:13:31,349 --> 03:13:31,359

 

8149
03:13:31,359 --> 03:13:32,710

there's your last trade. I'd be out of

8150
03:13:32,710 --> 03:13:32,720
there's your last trade. I'd be out of
 

8151
03:13:32,720 --> 03:13:34,630
there's your last trade. I'd be out of
this. out. Let this build out volume.

8152
03:13:34,630 --> 03:13:34,640
this. out. Let this build out volume.
 

8153
03:13:34,640 --> 03:13:36,309
this. out. Let this build out volume.
Now, I don't like this lower day

8154
03:13:36,309 --> 03:13:36,319
Now, I don't like this lower day
 

8155
03:13:36,319 --> 03:13:37,910
Now, I don't like this lower day
auction. I've said it a million times. I

8156
03:13:37,910 --> 03:13:37,920
auction. I've said it a million times. I
 

8157
03:13:37,920 --> 03:13:38,790
auction. I've said it a million times. I
don't think there's enough shorts

8158
03:13:38,790 --> 03:13:38,800
don't think there's enough shorts
 

8159
03:13:38,800 --> 03:13:40,630
don't think there's enough shorts
stucking down in here. The shorts got

8160
03:13:40,630 --> 03:13:40,640
stucking down in here. The shorts got
 

8161
03:13:40,640 --> 03:13:42,550
stucking down in here. The shorts got
stuck 20 to 10. You can still watch that

8162
03:13:42,550 --> 03:13:42,560
stuck 20 to 10. You can still watch that
 

8163
03:13:42,560 --> 03:13:45,030
stuck 20 to 10. You can still watch that
level 20 to 10, but if they don't hold

8164
03:13:45,030 --> 03:13:45,040
level 20 to 10, but if they don't hold
 

8165
03:13:45,040 --> 03:13:47,190
level 20 to 10, but if they don't hold
that, there's highly probable that you

8166
03:13:47,190 --> 03:13:47,200
that, there's highly probable that you
 

8167
03:13:47,200 --> 03:13:50,630
that, there's highly probable that you
get new lower day. Right, last few

8168
03:13:50,630 --> 03:13:50,640
get new lower day. Right, last few
 

8169
03:13:50,640 --> 03:13:51,830
get new lower day. Right, last few
questions and then I've got to get out

8170
03:13:51,830 --> 03:13:51,840
questions and then I've got to get out
 

8171
03:13:51,840 --> 03:14:04,950
questions and then I've got to get out
of here, folks, and get on with my day.

8172
03:14:04,950 --> 03:14:04,960

 

8173
03:14:04,960 --> 03:14:07,590

Yeah, SP I agree. I agree on NQ as well.

8174
03:14:07,590 --> 03:14:07,600
Yeah, SP I agree. I agree on NQ as well.
 

8175
03:14:07,600 --> 03:14:08,870
Yeah, SP I agree. I agree on NQ as well.
I don't like the auction lower day

8176
03:14:08,870 --> 03:14:08,880
I don't like the auction lower day
 

8177
03:14:08,880 --> 03:14:10,550
I don't like the auction lower day
auction. I said it's probably squeeze

8178
03:14:10,550 --> 03:14:10,560
auction. I said it's probably squeeze
 

8179
03:14:10,560 --> 03:14:12,950
auction. I said it's probably squeeze
relief. I would much rather it comes and

8180
03:14:12,950 --> 03:14:12,960
relief. I would much rather it comes and
 

8181
03:14:12,960 --> 03:14:14,550
relief. I would much rather it comes and
digs into all of this and traps more

8182
03:14:14,550 --> 03:14:14,560
digs into all of this and traps more
 

8183
03:14:14,560 --> 03:14:29,269
digs into all of this and traps more
shorts.

8184
03:14:29,269 --> 03:14:29,279

 

8185
03:14:29,279 --> 03:14:44,229

Netflix.

8186
03:14:44,229 --> 03:14:44,239

 

8187
03:14:44,239 --> 03:14:45,750

It's holding up. All right. We just

8188
03:14:45,750 --> 03:14:45,760
It's holding up. All right. We just
 

8189
03:14:45,760 --> 03:14:48,309
It's holding up. All right. We just
We've done one undercut of this. I'm in

8190
03:14:48,309 --> 03:14:48,319
We've done one undercut of this. I'm in
 

8191
03:14:48,319 --> 03:14:51,910
We've done one undercut of this. I'm in
a very small position here, but

8192
03:14:51,910 --> 03:14:51,920
a very small position here, but
 

8193
03:14:51,920 --> 03:14:59,910
a very small position here, but
it's possible we fade a little bit more.

8194
03:14:59,910 --> 03:14:59,920

 

8195
03:14:59,920 --> 03:15:01,510

watching this pivot here on Netflix.

8196
03:15:01,510 --> 03:15:01,520
watching this pivot here on Netflix.
 

8197
03:15:01,520 --> 03:15:08,309
watching this pivot here on Netflix.
Right, this is the big one

8198
03:15:08,309 --> 03:15:08,319

 

8199
03:15:08,319 --> 03:15:13,110

16.

8200
03:15:13,110 --> 03:15:13,120

 

8201
03:15:13,120 --> 03:15:15,349

Yeah, there's a little undercut in here,

8202
03:15:15,349 --> 03:15:15,359
Yeah, there's a little undercut in here,
 

8203
03:15:15,359 --> 03:15:17,990
Yeah, there's a little undercut in here,
which is why I positioned long, just for

8204
03:15:17,990 --> 03:15:18,000
which is why I positioned long, just for
 

8205
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:21,670
which is why I positioned long, just for
a starter.

8206
03:15:21,670 --> 03:15:21,680

 

8207
03:15:21,680 --> 03:15:23,910

Into here would be great. anything in

8208
03:15:23,910 --> 03:15:23,920
Into here would be great. anything in
 

8209
03:15:23,920 --> 03:15:25,510
Into here would be great. anything in
there, I'll start scooping up and then

8210
03:15:25,510 --> 03:15:25,520
there, I'll start scooping up and then
 

8211
03:15:25,520 --> 03:15:27,269
there, I'll start scooping up and then
we'll be looking for that long term. But

8212
03:15:27,269 --> 03:15:27,279
we'll be looking for that long term. But
 

8213
03:15:27,279 --> 03:15:29,030
we'll be looking for that long term. But
we're like, it depends what you're

8214
03:15:29,030 --> 03:15:29,040
we're like, it depends what you're
 

8215
03:15:29,040 --> 03:15:30,469
we're like, it depends what you're
looking for. I'm looking for an all-time

8216
03:15:30,469 --> 03:15:30,479
looking for. I'm looking for an all-time
 

8217
03:15:30,479 --> 03:15:32,550
looking for. I'm looking for an all-time
hold. Like I'm not looking for or a

8218
03:15:32,550 --> 03:15:32,560
hold. Like I'm not looking for or a
 

8219
03:15:32,560 --> 03:15:34,710
hold. Like I'm not looking for or a
trade when I'm looking in this. We're

8220
03:15:34,710 --> 03:15:34,720
trade when I'm looking in this. We're
 

8221
03:15:34,720 --> 03:15:37,110
trade when I'm looking in this. We're
already down what, like 40%.

8222
03:15:37,110 --> 03:15:37,120
already down what, like 40%.
 

8223
03:15:37,120 --> 03:15:41,190
already down what, like 40%.
Yeah, 40% off the highs

8224
03:15:41,190 --> 03:15:41,200
Yeah, 40% off the highs
 

8225
03:15:41,200 --> 03:15:43,910
Yeah, 40% off the highs
and I'm very very small size, but you

8226
03:15:43,910 --> 03:15:43,920
and I'm very very small size, but you
 

8227
03:15:43,920 --> 03:15:46,070
and I'm very very small size, but you
know, we we could do with a big big old

8228
03:15:46,070 --> 03:15:46,080
know, we we could do with a big big old
 

8229
03:15:46,080 --> 03:15:50,630
know, we we could do with a big big old
flush like and a trap and a reclaim,

8230
03:15:50,630 --> 03:15:50,640
flush like and a trap and a reclaim,
 

8231
03:15:50,640 --> 03:15:52,870
flush like and a trap and a reclaim,
right? That would be really nice if we

8232
03:15:52,870 --> 03:15:52,880
right? That would be really nice if we
 

8233
03:15:52,880 --> 03:15:55,750
right? That would be really nice if we
can do it. I don't know if we can do it,

8234
03:15:55,750 --> 03:15:55,760
can do it. I don't know if we can do it,
 

8235
03:15:55,760 --> 03:15:57,190
can do it. I don't know if we can do it,
but certainly if we come into there and

8236
03:15:57,190 --> 03:15:57,200
but certainly if we come into there and
 

8237
03:15:57,200 --> 03:15:59,910
but certainly if we come into there and
we trap shorts, I will be uh swing long

8238
03:15:59,910 --> 03:15:59,920
we trap shorts, I will be uh swing long
 

8239
03:15:59,920 --> 03:16:08,710
we trap shorts, I will be uh swing long
starting to add with more size.

8240
03:16:08,710 --> 03:16:08,720

 

8241
03:16:08,720 --> 03:16:11,110

I'm not worried longterm. Not not in the

8242
03:16:11,110 --> 03:16:11,120
I'm not worried longterm. Not not in the
 

8243
03:16:11,120 --> 03:16:13,910
I'm not worried longterm. Not not in the
slightest.

8244
03:16:13,910 --> 03:16:13,920
slightest.
 

8245
03:16:13,920 --> 03:16:19,030
slightest.
40. I'm 40.

8246
03:16:19,030 --> 03:16:19,040

 

8247
03:16:19,040 --> 03:16:20,870

What's the most reliable strategy or

8248
03:16:20,870 --> 03:16:20,880
What's the most reliable strategy or
 

8249
03:16:20,880 --> 03:16:22,550
What's the most reliable strategy or
confluence that you work with? I would

8250
03:16:22,550 --> 03:16:22,560
confluence that you work with? I would
 

8251
03:16:22,560 --> 03:16:25,429
confluence that you work with? I would
just say volume and like flow zones,

8252
03:16:25,429 --> 03:16:25,439
just say volume and like flow zones,
 

8253
03:16:25,439 --> 03:16:29,349
just say volume and like flow zones,
right? Momentum and volume. So like

8254
03:16:29,349 --> 03:16:29,359
right? Momentum and volume. So like
 

8255
03:16:29,359 --> 03:16:34,229
right? Momentum and volume. So like
volume,

8256
03:16:34,229 --> 03:16:34,239

 

8257
03:16:34,239 --> 03:16:36,870

momentum clouds,

8258
03:16:36,870 --> 03:16:36,880
momentum clouds,
 

8259
03:16:36,880 --> 03:17:12,550
momentum clouds,
right? Don't fight them. Simple as that.

8260
03:17:12,550 --> 03:17:12,560

 

8261
03:17:12,560 --> 03:17:14,550

this anchored volume profile on the

8262
03:17:14,550 --> 03:17:14,560
this anchored volume profile on the
 

8263
03:17:14,560 --> 03:17:17,590
this anchored volume profile on the
right hand side anchored volume profile.

8264
03:17:17,590 --> 03:17:17,600
right hand side anchored volume profile.

03:17:17,600 --> 03:17:19,269
right hand side anchored volume profile.
Okay folks, time for me to get out of

8266
03:17:19,269 --> 03:17:19,279
Okay folks, time for me to get out of

luck with FOMC if you're going to trade

8270
03:17:22,550 --> 03:17:22,560
luck with FOMC if you're going to trade
 

8271
03:17:22,560 --> 03:17:24,229
luck with FOMC if you're going to trade
it. Hopefully trade's back up and

8272
03:17:24,229 --> 03:17:24,239
it. Hopefully trade's back up and
 

8273
03:17:24,239 --> 03:17:26,229
it. Hopefully trade's back up and
running properly for them. Just be

8274
03:17:26,229 --> 03:17:26,239
running properly for them. Just be
 

8275
03:17:26,239 --> 03:17:28,870
running properly for them. Just be
smart, be careful. All right, be smart

8276
03:17:28,870 --> 03:17:28,880
smart, be careful. All right, be smart
 

8277
03:17:28,880 --> 03:17:31,830
smart, be careful. All right, be smart
and be careful. Um, again, I don't think

8278
03:17:31,830 --> 03:17:31,840
and be careful. Um, again, I don't think
 

8279
03:17:31,840 --> 03:17:33,269
and be careful. Um, again, I don't think
we finished the auction. We're still

8280
03:17:33,269 --> 03:17:33,279
we finished the auction. We're still
 

8281
03:17:33,279 --> 03:17:35,030
we finished the auction. We're still
holding the 20s to the tens. That's

8282
03:17:35,030 --> 03:17:35,040
holding the 20s to the tens. That's
 

8283
03:17:35,040 --> 03:17:36,950
holding the 20s to the tens. That's
still the same level. But I don't think

8284
03:17:36,950 --> 03:17:36,960
still the same level. But I don't think
 

8285
03:17:36,960 --> 03:17:38,550
still the same level. But I don't think
we finish the auction at the low. It's

8286
03:17:38,550 --> 03:17:38,560
we finish the auction at the low. It's
 

8287
03:17:38,560 --> 03:17:41,429
we finish the auction at the low. It's
the only thing I would say. I would be

8288
03:17:41,429 --> 03:17:41,439
the only thing I would say. I would be
 

8289
03:17:41,439 --> 03:17:43,510
the only thing I would say. I would be
looking, like I've talked about numerous

8290
03:17:43,510 --> 03:17:43,520
looking, like I've talked about numerous
 

8291
03:17:43,520 --> 03:17:47,110
looking, like I've talked about numerous
times, I'd be looking to see if we trap

8292
03:17:47,110 --> 03:17:47,120
times, I'd be looking to see if we trap
 

8293
03:17:47,120 --> 03:17:50,389
times, I'd be looking to see if we trap
under here, anywhere in here, here,

8294
03:17:50,389 --> 03:17:50,399
under here, anywhere in here, here,
 

8295
03:17:50,399 --> 03:17:52,870
under here, anywhere in here, here,
maybe even that, but ideally not. And

8296
03:17:52,870 --> 03:17:52,880
