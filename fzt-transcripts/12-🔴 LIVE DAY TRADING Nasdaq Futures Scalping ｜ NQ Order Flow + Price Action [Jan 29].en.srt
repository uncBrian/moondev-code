00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,629
Hope you hopefully you had a good
afternoon session if you traded FOMC.

12
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
afternoon session if you traded FOMC.
 

13
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,990
afternoon session if you traded FOMC.
Wasn't too much to trade there. a little

14
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
Wasn't too much to trade there. a little
 

15
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,469
Wasn't too much to trade there. a little
bit of chop, but the big trade that we

16
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
bit of chop, but the big trade that we
 

17
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,150
bit of chop, but the big trade that we
talked about all yesterday morning

18
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
talked about all yesterday morning
 

19
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,749
talked about all yesterday morning
setting up for that trap that happened

20
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
setting up for that trap that happened
 

21
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,070
setting up for that trap that happened
on the earnings report right into 4:00

22
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
on the earnings report right into 4:00
 

23
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,790
on the earnings report right into 4:00
did exactly what we talked about, didn't

24
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
did exactly what we talked about, didn't
 

25
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,710
did exactly what we talked about, didn't
it? So, do me a favor. Lots of you in

26
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
it? So, do me a favor. Lots of you in
 

27
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,309
it? So, do me a favor. Lots of you in
here nice and early. Smash that like

28
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
here nice and early. Smash that like
 

29
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,510
here nice and early. Smash that like
button for me and then I don't have to

30
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
button for me and then I don't have to
 

31
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,430
button for me and then I don't have to
keep saying it through the stream. All

32
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
keep saying it through the stream. All
 

33
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,950
keep saying it through the stream. All
right, so let's have a look on the daily

34
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
right, so let's have a look on the daily
 

35
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,150
right, so let's have a look on the daily
chart. We're starting to get what we've

36
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
chart. We're starting to get what we've
 

37
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,510
chart. We're starting to get what we've
talked about this week. You notice the

38
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
talked about this week. You notice the
 

39
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,270
talked about this week. You notice the
Ballinger bands, they are going to start

40
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
Ballinger bands, they are going to start
 

41
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,350
Ballinger bands, they are going to start
expanding now. All right, so we had

42
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
expanding now. All right, so we had
 

43
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,510
expanding now. All right, so we had
contracting Ballinger bands for quite a

44
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
contracting Ballinger bands for quite a
 

45
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,270
contracting Ballinger bands for quite a
while. The last few days we're starting

46
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
while. The last few days we're starting
 

47
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,430
while. The last few days we're starting
to base up here is allowing expansion of

48
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
to base up here is allowing expansion of
 

49
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,270
to base up here is allowing expansion of
the Ballinger band. And you'll al also

50
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280
the Ballinger band. And you'll al also
 

51
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,749
the Ballinger band. And you'll al also
notice this 5day moving average with

52
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
notice this 5day moving average with
 

53
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,070
notice this 5day moving average with
this Ballinger band starting to take

54
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
this Ballinger band starting to take
 

55
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,390
this Ballinger band starting to take
effect. Doesn't guarantee a trend, but

56
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
effect. Doesn't guarantee a trend, but
 

57
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,070
effect. Doesn't guarantee a trend, but
it just means, you know, there is a

58
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
it just means, you know, there is a
 

59
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,830
it just means, you know, there is a
chance now that we're going to create

60
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:43,840
chance now that we're going to create
 

61
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,510
chance now that we're going to create
some room for it to move upside. Uh,

62
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520
some room for it to move upside. Uh,
 

63
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,189
some room for it to move upside. Uh,
ideally, I would like to see an inside

64
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
ideally, I would like to see an inside
 

65
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,270
ideally, I would like to see an inside
day print uh a little bit longer into

66
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
day print uh a little bit longer into
 

67
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,870
day print uh a little bit longer into
the end of the week and give this chance

68
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
the end of the week and give this chance
 

69
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,350
the end of the week and give this chance
to really get moving. Right. Yesterday,

70
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
to really get moving. Right. Yesterday,
 

71
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,189
to really get moving. Right. Yesterday,
we talked about flipping this. This was

72
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
we talked about flipping this. This was
 

73
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,909
we talked about flipping this. This was
a red box right into potential demand

74
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
a red box right into potential demand
 

75
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,790
a red box right into potential demand
with that poke up, a dip, a hold, and a

76
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
with that poke up, a dip, a hold, and a
 

77
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,710
with that poke up, a dip, a hold, and a
drive out. We had it last night. What I

78
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
drive out. We had it last night. What I
 

79
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,390
drive out. We had it last night. What I
would say so far, we've had a failed

80
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
would say so far, we've had a failed
 

81
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,790
would say so far, we've had a failed
breakout. All right, failed breakout

82
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
breakout. All right, failed breakout
 

83
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,150
breakout. All right, failed breakout
overnight. That is all right. We're

84
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
overnight. That is all right. We're
 

85
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,070
overnight. That is all right. We're
holding this. So technically, we are

86
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
holding this. So technically, we are
 

87
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,749
holding this. So technically, we are
still bullish in terms of structure. We

88
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
still bullish in terms of structure. We
 

89
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,830
still bullish in terms of structure. We
are holding this. If we lose that and

90
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
are holding this. If we lose that and
 

91
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,189
are holding this. If we lose that and
come under it, there is a deeper

92
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
come under it, there is a deeper
 

93
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,790
come under it, there is a deeper
rotation like we always talk about. But

94
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
rotation like we always talk about. But
 

95
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,390
rotation like we always talk about. But
until that point, you want to be very

96
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
until that point, you want to be very
 

97
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,629
until that point, you want to be very
careful. We want to be considering that

98
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
careful. We want to be considering that
 

99
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,710
careful. We want to be considering that
inside bar, how we might play out today,

100
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
inside bar, how we might play out today,
 

101
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,430
inside bar, how we might play out today,
edge to edge. Probably unlikely to get

102
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
edge to edge. Probably unlikely to get
 

103
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,870
edge to edge. Probably unlikely to get
too much of a bid outside of this

104
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
too much of a bid outside of this
 

105
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,390
too much of a bid outside of this
because the bowls aren't extended enough

106
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
because the bowls aren't extended enough
 

107
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,629
because the bowls aren't extended enough
yet. All right, so just understand what

108
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
yet. All right, so just understand what
 

109
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,629
yet. All right, so just understand what
is likely to happen today. I would not

110
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
is likely to happen today. I would not
 

111
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,790
is likely to happen today. I would not
be surprised to see an inside bar today.

112
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
be surprised to see an inside bar today.
 

113
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,710
be surprised to see an inside bar today.
If we start losing 26,000, then we can

114
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
If we start losing 26,000, then we can
 

115
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,550
If we start losing 26,000, then we can
think about this move into the 900s. If

116
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
think about this move into the 900s. If
 

117
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,950
think about this move into the 900s. If
we lose 900s, then I would almost

118
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960
we lose 900s, then I would almost
 

119
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,309
we lose 900s, then I would almost
certainly say that this is a failed

120
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,319
certainly say that this is a failed
 

121
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,070
certainly say that this is a failed
breakout then and we are playing a

122
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
breakout then and we are playing a
 

123
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,390
breakout then and we are playing a
rotation back down. Until that point,

124
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
rotation back down. Until that point,
 

125
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,710
rotation back down. Until that point,
we're watching to see if this holds.

126
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
we're watching to see if this holds.
 

127
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,230
we're watching to see if this holds.
We're going to get more clues about this

128
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
We're going to get more clues about this
 

129
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,270
We're going to get more clues about this
as we move into the hourly chart. So,

130
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
as we move into the hourly chart. So,
 

131
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,670
as we move into the hourly chart. So,
let's do that now.

132
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
let's do that now.
 

133
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,430
let's do that now.
And pull this up just so you can see it

134
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440
And pull this up just so you can see it
 

135
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,430
And pull this up just so you can see it
a little bit better.

136
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
a little bit better.
 

137
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,869
a little bit better.
All right. This is the current week's

138
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
All right. This is the current week's
 

139
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,270
All right. This is the current week's
developing profile. All right. Here's

140
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
developing profile. All right. Here's
 

141
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,469
developing profile. All right. Here's
previous week value area high all the

142
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
previous week value area high all the
 

143
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,710
previous week value area high all the
way down here. Current week developing

144
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
way down here. Current week developing
 

145
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,469
way down here. Current week developing
profile. You can see this week we have

146
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
profile. You can see this week we have
 

147
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,550
profile. You can see this week we have
been in a constant grind from the

148
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
been in a constant grind from the
 

149
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,550
been in a constant grind from the
Sunday, right? Monday into Tuesday. That

150
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:18,560
Sunday, right? Monday into Tuesday. That
 

151
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,230
Sunday, right? Monday into Tuesday. That
was the dip and rip that we played on

152
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
was the dip and rip that we played on
 

153
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,189
was the dip and rip that we played on
Tuesday into Wednesday, which was the

154
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
Tuesday into Wednesday, which was the
 

155
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,110
Tuesday into Wednesday, which was the
dip and rip. And then yesterday, we

156
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
dip and rip. And then yesterday, we
 

157
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,550
dip and rip. And then yesterday, we
played that you played that pullback

158
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
played that you played that pullback
 

159
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,270
played that you played that pullback
short leg into this area. And we talked

160
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
short leg into this area. And we talked
 

161
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,589
short leg into this area. And we talked
about the trap happening somewhere under

162
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
about the trap happening somewhere under
 

163
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,750
about the trap happening somewhere under
here. Here was the trap underneath,

164
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
here. Here was the trap underneath,
 

165
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,990
here. Here was the trap underneath,
reclaimed, and straight back up. Right,

166
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
reclaimed, and straight back up. Right,
 

167
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,909
reclaimed, and straight back up. Right,
we've now built liquidity. The problem

168
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
we've now built liquidity. The problem
 

169
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,870
we've now built liquidity. The problem
is it did it when it ran out of time. It

170
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
is it did it when it ran out of time. It
 

171
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,310
is it did it when it ran out of time. It
did it when no one was really at the

172
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,320
did it when no one was really at the
 

173
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,509
did it when no one was really at the
desk. All right, that was the earnings.

174
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
desk. All right, that was the earnings.
 

175
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,310
desk. All right, that was the earnings.
There's the trap underneath with the dip

176
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,320
There's the trap underneath with the dip
 

177
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,190
There's the trap underneath with the dip
and the rip, but hasn't taken out this

178
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
and the rip, but hasn't taken out this
 

179
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,030
and the rip, but hasn't taken out this
high. Now, can this be bullish rotation?

180
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
high. Now, can this be bullish rotation?
 

181
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,190
high. Now, can this be bullish rotation?
Absolutely it can. All right, it can be

182
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
Absolutely it can. All right, it can be
 

183
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,430
Absolutely it can. All right, it can be
bullish rotation in here, but we are

184
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
bullish rotation in here, but we are
 

185
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,430
bullish rotation in here, but we are
boxed in in here. All right, the current

186
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
boxed in in here. All right, the current
 

187
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,710
boxed in in here. All right, the current
weak uh point of control over here

188
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
weak uh point of control over here
 

189
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,750
weak uh point of control over here
26100ish very very key as is previous

190
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760
26100ish very very key as is previous
 

191
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,550
26100ish very very key as is previous
day value area low. This area here here

192
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
day value area low. This area here here
 

193
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,389
day value area low. This area here here
is key for bulls to defend. If they

194
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:10,399
is key for bulls to defend. If they
 

195
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,150
is key for bulls to defend. If they
defend it, they'll be looking for a

196
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
defend it, they'll be looking for a
 

197
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,829
defend it, they'll be looking for a
rotation back up to the previous day

198
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
rotation back up to the previous day
 

199
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,750
rotation back up to the previous day
value high. But you can see overnight,

200
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
value high. But you can see overnight,
 

201
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,230
value high. But you can see overnight,
one, two, two attempts to get over it.

202
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
one, two, two attempts to get over it.
 

203
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,910
one, two, two attempts to get over it.
Not doing too well. We're building out

204
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:19,920
Not doing too well. We're building out
 

205
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,550
Not doing too well. We're building out
lots of volume down here. So, I would be

206
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
lots of volume down here. So, I would be
 

207
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,550
lots of volume down here. So, I would be
watching this both ways on the tape

208
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
watching this both ways on the tape
 

209
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,670
watching this both ways on the tape
today. I would be highly expecting a

210
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
today. I would be highly expecting a
 

211
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,590
today. I would be highly expecting a
rotational kind of day, an inside kind

212
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
rotational kind of day, an inside kind
 

213
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,670
rotational kind of day, an inside kind
of day, which means edges are more

214
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
of day, which means edges are more
 

215
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,990
of day, which means edges are more
likely to play today than trends. And it

216
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
likely to play today than trends. And it
 

217
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,750
likely to play today than trends. And it
means you're going to have to be careful

218
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,760
means you're going to have to be careful
 

219
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,509
means you're going to have to be careful
with making sure you manage your

220
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
with making sure you manage your
 

221
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,430
with making sure you manage your
positions. Lock in those profits. see

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440

223
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,590

money take money. So if we hold dips

224
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,600
money take money. So if we hold dips
 

225
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,110
money take money. So if we hold dips
down into here this morning, there's

226
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
down into here this morning, there's
 

227
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,470
down into here this morning, there's
probably a rotation TP1, TP2, maybe even

228
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
probably a rotation TP1, TP2, maybe even
 

229
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,949
probably a rotation TP1, TP2, maybe even
TP3 if you get lucky. But it's also very

230
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
TP3 if you get lucky. But it's also very
 

231
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,790
TP3 if you get lucky. But it's also very
possible, right, that we get stuck here

232
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
possible, right, that we get stuck here
 

233
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,630
possible, right, that we get stuck here
and we come down this way and we do

234
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
and we come down this way and we do
 

235
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,269
and we come down this way and we do
this. If we lose, right, if we lose a

236
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
this. If we lose, right, if we lose a
 

237
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,990
this. If we lose, right, if we lose a
bid under here, we need to be careful

238
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
bid under here, we need to be careful
 

239
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,310
bid under here, we need to be careful
that it doesn't come and revisit all the

240
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
that it doesn't come and revisit all the
 

241
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,670
that it doesn't come and revisit all the
way down here. You can see where we

242
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680
way down here. You can see where we
 

243
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,990
way down here. You can see where we
building out a cluster down here, down

244
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
building out a cluster down here, down
 

245
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,910
building out a cluster down here, down
here, down here, down here. So need to

246
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:05,920
here, down here, down here. So need to
 

247
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,750
here, down here, down here. So need to
be willing to play the other side of the

248
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760
be willing to play the other side of the
 

249
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,430
be willing to play the other side of the
tape. If we start to lose bids 26,100

250
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
tape. If we start to lose bids 26,100
 

251
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,910
tape. If we start to lose bids 26,100
and stay heavy. All right. So it's a big

252
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
and stay heavy. All right. So it's a big
 

253
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,590
and stay heavy. All right. So it's a big
level. As we drift into this probably

254
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
level. As we drift into this probably
 

255
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,110
level. As we drift into this probably
early morning, we're going to see

256
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120
early morning, we're going to see
 

257
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,430
early morning, we're going to see
sentiment either fake out and bid back

258
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440
sentiment either fake out and bid back
 

259
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,590
sentiment either fake out and bid back
up or we're going to lose that bid and

260
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
up or we're going to lose that bid and
 

261
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,710
up or we're going to lose that bid and
rotate. But this is your range being

262
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
rotate. But this is your range being
 

263
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,230
rotate. But this is your range being
developed. All right, you can quite

264
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
developed. All right, you can quite
 

265
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,990
developed. All right, you can quite
clearly see that they are starting to

266
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
clearly see that they are starting to
 

267
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,990
clearly see that they are starting to
settle in here. It is not a small range.

268
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
settle in here. It is not a small range.
 

269
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,949
settle in here. It is not a small range.
300 down to less than 100. So at least

270
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:32,959
300 down to less than 100. So at least
 

271
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,509
300 down to less than 100. So at least
200 250 points. You do not want to be

272
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:35,519
200 250 points. You do not want to be
 

273
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,069
200 250 points. You do not want to be
the wrong side of that range. All right,

274
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,079
the wrong side of that range. All right,
 

275
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,230
the wrong side of that range. All right,
onto the five minute. And you can see

276
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
onto the five minute. And you can see
 

277
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,350
onto the five minute. And you can see
the same thing we've talked about.

278
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
the same thing we've talked about.
 

279
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,509
the same thing we've talked about.
There's the dip and rip

280
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
There's the dip and rip
 

281
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,269
There's the dip and rip
into that key level. Dip and rip.

282
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279
into that key level. Dip and rip.
 

283
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,110
into that key level. Dip and rip.
There's the hold. There's the bid back

284
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
There's the hold. There's the bid back
 

285
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,670
There's the hold. There's the bid back
up during GlobeEx. London goes sideways.

286
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:49,680
up during GlobeEx. London goes sideways.
 

287
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,990
up during GlobeEx. London goes sideways.
Get stuck. Cannot take out these key

288
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,000
Get stuck. Cannot take out these key
 

289
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,509
Get stuck. Cannot take out these key
levels up here. All right. So, that is a

290
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
levels up here. All right. So, that is a
 

291
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,910
levels up here. All right. So, that is a
failed break. Lower high. Lower high.

292
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
failed break. Lower high. Lower high.
 

293
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,310
failed break. Lower high. Lower high.
Lower high. Lower high. And we're

00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
Lower high. Lower high. And we're
 

295
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,470
Lower high. Lower high. And we're
rotating back down towards this. Just

296
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
rotating back down towards this. Just
 

297

Um, if you're struggling with seeing

302
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
Um, if you're struggling with seeing
 

303
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,310
Um, if you're struggling with seeing
that, all you have to do is go to the

304
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,320
that, all you have to do is go to the
 

305
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,990
that, all you have to do is go to the
indicator right up here. What are we

306
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
indicator right up here. What are we
 

307
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,190
indicator right up here. What are we
doing? Higher time frame, we are

308
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
doing? Higher time frame, we are
 

309
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,870
doing? Higher time frame, we are
building liquidity. Lower time frame

currently bearish, right? We're in a
 

313
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,389
currently bearish, right? We're in a
sell,

314
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:16,399
sell,
 

315
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,670
sell,
but the higher time frame building

316
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
but the higher time frame building
 

317
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,110
but the higher time frame building
liquidity. So, understand that we're

318
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
liquidity. So, understand that we're
 

319
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,710
liquidity. So, understand that we're
between the lower time frame algo and

320
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720
between the lower time frame algo and
 

321
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,310
between the lower time frame algo and
the higher time frame algo. You can see

322
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
the higher time frame algo. You can see
 

323
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,230
the higher time frame algo. You can see
between these at the moment while it

324
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
between these at the moment while it
 

325
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,230
between these at the moment while it
makes its decision.

326
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
makes its decision.
 

327
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,670
makes its decision.
Overall though, technically the market

328
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
Overall though, technically the market
 

329
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,069
Overall though, technically the market
is still bullish overall for now. for

330
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
is still bullish overall for now. for
 

331
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,350
is still bullish overall for now. for
now unless this becomes a failed

332
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
now unless this becomes a failed
 

333
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,269
now unless this becomes a failed
breakout. All right, let's go through

334
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:33,279
breakout. All right, let's go through
 

335
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,350
breakout. All right, let's go through
some of the other names. We can start

336
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
some of the other names. We can start
 

337
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:43,750
some of the other names. We can start
off in the ES.

338
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760

 

339
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,310

Let's have a quick look here.

340
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
Let's have a quick look here.
 

341
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,190
Let's have a quick look here.
So, alltime high break yesterday and

342
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
So, alltime high break yesterday and
 

343
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,870
So, alltime high break yesterday and
trading back inside. We're not seeing

344
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:50,880
trading back inside. We're not seeing
 

345
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,389
trading back inside. We're not seeing
follow through away from here, but so

346
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
follow through away from here, but so
 

347
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,230
follow through away from here, but so
far still technically bullish all the

348
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
far still technically bullish all the
 

349
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,630
far still technically bullish all the
time. We're holding sort of 78. All

350
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:56,640
time. We're holding sort of 78. All
 

351
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,550
time. We're holding sort of 78. All
right, somewhere in here. all the time

352
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
right, somewhere in here. all the time
 

353
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,910
right, somewhere in here. all the time
we're holding this technically still

354
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920
we're holding this technically still
 

355
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,230
we're holding this technically still
bullish. We start to lose that certainly

356
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
bullish. We start to lose that certainly
 

357
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,389
bullish. We start to lose that certainly
if we lose this then that deeper

358
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:04,399
if we lose this then that deeper
 

359
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,790
if we lose this then that deeper
rotation right this will start to be

360
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
rotation right this will start to be
 

361
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,470
rotation right this will start to be
sold off. So they bulls really need to

362
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,480
sold off. So they bulls really need to
 

363
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,990
sold off. So they bulls really need to
hold this and start to get going. If

364
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
hold this and start to get going. If
 

365
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,670
hold this and start to get going. If
they don't we're going to see that

366
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
they don't we're going to see that
 

367
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,990
they don't we're going to see that
collapse that we talked about yesterday

368
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,000
collapse that we talked about yesterday
 

369
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,590
collapse that we talked about yesterday
right they will need to see momentum at

370
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
right they will need to see momentum at
 

371
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,710
right they will need to see momentum at
these highs. Remember we've got Apple

372
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
these highs. Remember we've got Apple
 

373
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,190
these highs. Remember we've got Apple
earnings tonight as well.

374
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
earnings tonight as well.
 

375
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,949
earnings tonight as well.
If we go on a lower time frame just see

376
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:20,959
If we go on a lower time frame just see
 

377
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,310
If we go on a lower time frame just see
where we're at. We're opening up pretty

378
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
where we're at. We're opening up pretty
 

379
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,509
where we're at. We're opening up pretty
much flat.

380
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
much flat.
 

381
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,110
much flat.
All right. Some very key pivots here.

382
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
All right. Some very key pivots here.
 

383
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,190
All right. Some very key pivots here.
You can see all you need to look at ES

384
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
You can see all you need to look at ES
 

385
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,509
You can see all you need to look at ES
is this right here.

386
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
is this right here.
 

387
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,430
is this right here.
This is quite clearly a key level that

388
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
This is quite clearly a key level that
 

389
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,949
This is quite clearly a key level that
we are still currently holding. All

390
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959
we are still currently holding. All
 

391
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,829
we are still currently holding. All
right, previous day low and that's your

392
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:37,839
right, previous day low and that's your
 

393
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,269
right, previous day low and that's your
rotation from the current high to

394
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
rotation from the current high to
 

395
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,710
rotation from the current high to
previous day low. If you start getting

396
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
previous day low. If you start getting
 

397
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,910
previous day low. If you start getting
weakness under there, that's where

398
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:43,920
weakness under there, that's where
 

399
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,269
weakness under there, that's where
we can start seeing that bigger

400
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279
we can start seeing that bigger
 

401
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,110
we can start seeing that bigger
rotation. Right, let's have a look at

402
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
rotation. Right, let's have a look at
 

403
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,710
rotation. Right, let's have a look at
the ETFs. Make sure they're all lining

404
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
the ETFs. Make sure they're all lining
 

405
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,949
the ETFs. Make sure they're all lining
up. Okay, we start on the spies. We've

406
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:50,959
up. Okay, we start on the spies. We've
 

407
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,750
up. Okay, we start on the spies. We've
just done ES. Same kind of story there.

408
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
just done ES. Same kind of story there.
 

409
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,750
just done ES. Same kind of story there.
And same kind of rotation. Let's zoom

410
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:55,760
And same kind of rotation. Let's zoom
 

411
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,590
And same kind of rotation. Let's zoom
out here a little bit. Yeah, right into

412
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:57,600
out here a little bit. Yeah, right into
 

413
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,230
out here a little bit. Yeah, right into
this nugget. This cluster here still

414
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
this nugget. This cluster here still
 

415
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,870
this nugget. This cluster here still
holding dips. Can it do this is the

416
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
holding dips. Can it do this is the
 

417
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,269
holding dips. Can it do this is the
question today. If it can't, then we're

418
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
question today. If it can't, then we're
 

419
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,710
question today. If it can't, then we're
just going to build out the liquidity. I

420
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
just going to build out the liquidity. I
 

421
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,750
just going to build out the liquidity. I
think we're probably going to build out

422
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
think we're probably going to build out
 

423
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,509
think we're probably going to build out
liquidity today. That's what I think we

424
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
liquidity today. That's what I think we
 

425
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,790
liquidity today. That's what I think we
are more likely to do. Q's, same story.

426
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
are more likely to do. Q's, same story.
 

427
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,990
are more likely to do. Q's, same story.
All right, tapped through the highs

428
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
All right, tapped through the highs
 

429
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,110
All right, tapped through the highs
yesterday uh in the pre-market. Never

430
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
yesterday uh in the pre-market. Never
 

431
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,470
yesterday uh in the pre-market. Never
able to get back up there to that

432
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
able to get back up there to that
 

433
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,110
able to get back up there to that
all-time high and just building out more

434
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
all-time high and just building out more
 

435
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,190
all-time high and just building out more
of the same again. And if we start to

436
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,200
of the same again. And if we start to
 

437
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,590
of the same again. And if we start to
lose the bid here, it's very very steep

438
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:25,600
lose the bid here, it's very very steep
 

439
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,430
lose the bid here, it's very very steep
up this week. We think about from

440
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
up this week. We think about from
 

441
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,269
up this week. We think about from
Sunday into Monday, but we think about

442
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
Sunday into Monday, but we think about
 

443
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,509
Sunday into Monday, but we think about
from here, right? We're pretty steep up

444
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:33,519
from here, right? We're pretty steep up
 

445
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,389
from here, right? We're pretty steep up
from this open. We can expect that move

446
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
from this open. We can expect that move
 

447
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,949
from this open. We can expect that move
down here and still be okay. All right.

448
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
down here and still be okay. All right.
 

449
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,870
down here and still be okay. All right.
So, just be aware of that. Be aware of

450
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
So, just be aware of that. Be aware of
 

451
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,110
So, just be aware of that. Be aware of
it. Let's have a look at the VIX.

452
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,120
it. Let's have a look at the VIX.
 

453
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,550
it. Let's have a look at the VIX.
Starting to climb, isn't it? Still in

454
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
Starting to climb, isn't it? Still in
 

455
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,990
Starting to climb, isn't it? Still in
this big channel that we've talked

456
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
this big channel that we've talked
 

457
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,069
this big channel that we've talked
about. All right. Still holding in the

458
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:48,079
about. All right. Still holding in the
 

459
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,030
about. All right. Still holding in the
16s. It's got previous day high 7. So,

460
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,040
16s. It's got previous day high 7. So,
 

461
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,990
16s. It's got previous day high 7. So,
we're watching 1720 1738

462
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
we're watching 1720 1738
 

463
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,350
we're watching 1720 1738
and then yeah, 38 pivot might even get

464
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
and then yeah, 38 pivot might even get
 

465
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,269
and then yeah, 38 pivot might even get
us up to 1950. Quite thin in there

466
00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
us up to 1950. Quite thin in there
 

467
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,350
us up to 1950. Quite thin in there
through that. So, we need to be careful.

468
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
through that. So, we need to be careful.
 

469
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,590
through that. So, we need to be careful.
We can also extend this out a little

470
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
We can also extend this out a little
 

471
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,110
We can also extend this out a little
bit. Make sure this is accurate

472
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
bit. Make sure this is accurate
 

473
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,910
bit. Make sure this is accurate
somewhere in here. There we go. All

474
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
somewhere in here. There we go. All
 

475
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,269
somewhere in here. There we go. All
right. So, we need to be careful. We're

476
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:09,279
right. So, we need to be careful. We're
 

477
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,030
right. So, we need to be careful. We're
still in that channel, but we can see

478
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,040
still in that channel, but we can see
 

479
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,509
still in that channel, but we can see
it's still bullish rotation on the VIX,

480
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519
it's still bullish rotation on the VIX,
 

481
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,430
it's still bullish rotation on the VIX,
right? Everyone's saying that this is

482
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,440
right? Everyone's saying that this is
 

483
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,110
right? Everyone's saying that this is
like going to collapse. It hasn't.

484
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,120
like going to collapse. It hasn't.
 

485
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,110
like going to collapse. It hasn't.
Bullish rotation squeeze back into the

486
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
Bullish rotation squeeze back into the
 

487
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,949
Bullish rotation squeeze back into the
channel. All right. So if this is was a

488
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:20,959
channel. All right. So if this is was a
 

489
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,870
channel. All right. So if this is was a
uptrending regression channel, we

490
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
uptrending regression channel, we
 

491
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,389
uptrending regression channel, we
squeezed out, pulled back, squeezed out,

492
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
squeezed out, pulled back, squeezed out,
 

493
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,670
squeezed out, pulled back, squeezed out,
pulled back, squeezed out, pulled back.

494
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
pulled back, squeezed out, pulled back.
 

495
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,189
pulled back, squeezed out, pulled back.
We haven't collapsed under this channel

496
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:27,199
We haven't collapsed under this channel
 

497
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,269
We haven't collapsed under this channel
right now. I would still have some

498
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
right now. I would still have some
 

499
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,350
right now. I would still have some
certain warning signs up about this,

500
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360
certain warning signs up about this,
 

501
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,790
certain warning signs up about this,
right? Very quickly going to have to get

502
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:32,800
right? Very quickly going to have to get
 

503
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,110
right? Very quickly going to have to get
through the mag now. Apple earnings,

504
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120
through the mag now. Apple earnings,
 

505
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,949
through the mag now. Apple earnings,
remember earnings are tonight. Held that

506
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:36,959
remember earnings are tonight. Held that
 

507
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,710
remember earnings are tonight. Held that
dip yesterday, like little fake out

508
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:38,720
dip yesterday, like little fake out
 

509
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,790
dip yesterday, like little fake out
under reclaim. So want to see if Apple

510
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
under reclaim. So want to see if Apple
 

511
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,310
under reclaim. So want to see if Apple
can get back up to these highs. If they

512
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
can get back up to these highs. If they
 

513
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,470
can get back up to these highs. If they
start bidding it up before earnings

514
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:44,480
start bidding it up before earnings
 

515
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,990
start bidding it up before earnings
today, do they position themselves

516
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,000
today, do they position themselves
 

517
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,430
today, do they position themselves
before earnings or is this going to be

518
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:47,440
before earnings or is this going to be
 

519
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,350
before earnings or is this going to be
profit taking? They're expecting weak

520
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
profit taking? They're expecting weak
 

521
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,110
profit taking? They're expecting weak
earnings. Softy earnings weren't too

522
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,120
earnings. Softy earnings weren't too
 

523
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,030
earnings. Softy earnings weren't too
bad, but they sold off on the conference

524
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
bad, but they sold off on the conference
 

525
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,870
bad, but they sold off on the conference
call because their uh guidance was a bit

526
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
call because their uh guidance was a bit
 

527
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,389

lower than expected. Everything else was

528
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
lower than expected. Everything else was
 

529
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,230
lower than expected. Everything else was
good yesterday. The other dip on Apple

530
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
good yesterday. The other dip on Apple
 

531
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,389
good yesterday. The other dip on Apple
be down into these 50s. Right, Amazon

gapping down into key level here. So,

534
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:04,399
gapping down into key level here. So,
 

535
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,389
gapping down into key level here. So,
big drive out yesterday. Faded it, held

536
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:06,399

00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:09,519
the held the uh the gap and now is in
 

539
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,870
the held the uh the gap and now is in
kind of no man's land while it makes

540
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:10,880
kind of no man's land while it makes
 

541
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,430
kind of no man's land while it makes
that decision into that pivot. Goo, nice

542
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,440
that decision into that pivot. Goo, nice
 

543
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,430
that decision into that pivot. Goo, nice
drive up. There you go. Nice drive up

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:17,680
into the earnings. Big peak out. holding
 

547
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,310
into the earnings. Big peak out. holding
gains well. So Google right now I mean

548
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,320
gains well. So Google right now I mean
 

549
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,829
gains well. So Google right now I mean
we can think about this but we can also

550
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
we can think about this but we can also
 

551
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,910
we can think about this but we can also
think about this up here as another

552
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:23,920
think about this up here as another
 

553
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,949
think about this up here as another
level. So does Google need a back test

554
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
level. So does Google need a back test
 

555
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,430
level. So does Google need a back test
to make sure it stays firm meta big

556
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,440
to make sure it stays firm meta big
 

557
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,590
to make sure it stays firm meta big
earnings. Remember I'm long meta. This

558
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
earnings. Remember I'm long meta. This
 

559
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,030
earnings. Remember I'm long meta. This
is starting to pay really well. Now

560
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
is starting to pay really well. Now
 

561
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,550
is starting to pay really well. Now
anyone in Discord who took these longs

562
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
anyone in Discord who took these longs
 

563
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,030
anyone in Discord who took these longs
remember I'm long from down here 88s. We

564
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
remember I'm long from down here 88s. We
 

565
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,389
remember I'm long from down here 88s. We
were looking for this move back up

566
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:38,399
were looking for this move back up
 

567
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,910
were looking for this move back up
towards this pivot. We've got it. That

568
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:39,920
towards this pivot. We've got it. That
 

569
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,670
towards this pivot. We've got it. That
is a fantastic trade to uh sort of start

570
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680
is a fantastic trade to uh sort of start
 

571
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,910
is a fantastic trade to uh sort of start
this year from somewhere down here. I'll

572
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
this year from somewhere down here. I'll
 

573
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,069
this year from somewhere down here. I'll
have to get my uh bler up to see where I

574
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
have to get my uh bler up to see where I
 

575
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,670
have to get my uh bler up to see where I
was, but I was long down here and we're

576
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
was, but I was long down here and we're
 

577
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,949
was, but I was long down here and we're
starting to really get motoring now.

578
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:50,959
starting to really get motoring now.
 

579
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,870
starting to really get motoring now.
That's a massive trade. Very, very happy

580
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
That's a massive trade. Very, very happy
 

581
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,949
That's a massive trade. Very, very happy
with that one. Gapping up and pretty

582
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:54,959
with that one. Gapping up and pretty
 

583
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,269
with that one. Gapping up and pretty
extended into some key levels here on

584
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
extended into some key levels here on
 

585
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,030
extended into some key levels here on
Meta. Want to be careful. This pivot

586
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,040
Meta. Want to be careful. This pivot
 

587
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,710
Meta. Want to be careful. This pivot
here is what I'll be watching now. So,

588
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:00,720
here is what I'll be watching now. So,
 

589
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,110
here is what I'll be watching now. So,
we can set a price alert there to see if

590
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
we can set a price alert there to see if
 

591
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,069
we can set a price alert there to see if
it can get through and have

592
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079
it can get through and have
 

593
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,990
it can get through and have
continuation. Microsoft Softy, like I

594
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
continuation. Microsoft Softy, like I
 

595
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,990
continuation. Microsoft Softy, like I
said, sold off on that on the earnings

596
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
said, sold off on that on the earnings
 

597
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,870
said, sold off on that on the earnings
call back down into its pivot. So, the

598
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
call back down into its pivot. So, the
 

599
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,550
call back down into its pivot. So, the
big question here on softy, does it hold

600
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:12,560
big question here on softy, does it hold
 

601
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,550
big question here on softy, does it hold
this? If it doesn't and we start to get

602
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:14,560
this? If it doesn't and we start to get
 

603
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,150
this? If it doesn't and we start to get
weak, you'll see this market start to

604
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,160
weak, you'll see this market start to
 

605
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,910
weak, you'll see this market start to
rotate, but that's uh kind of the only

606
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
rotate, but that's uh kind of the only
 

607
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,310
rotate, but that's uh kind of the only
one right now seeing a lot of weakness.

608
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,320
one right now seeing a lot of weakness.
 

609
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,069
one right now seeing a lot of weakness.

up flat again. All dips into 90s. If

612
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
up flat again. All dips into 90s. If
 

613
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,470
up flat again. All dips into 90s. If
those keep holding, Nvidia's okay.

614
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
those keep holding, Nvidia's okay.
 

615
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,110
those keep holding, Nvidia's okay.

you're probably not having too much fun
 

621
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,389
you're probably not having too much fun
right now. I would say here is is where

right now. I would say here is is where
 

623
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,069
right now. I would say here is is where
it's boxed in right here for the whole

624
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
it's boxed in right here for the whole
 

625
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,749
it's boxed in right here for the whole
of this year so far. Rotation, rotation,

626
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:37,759
of this year so far. Rotation, rotation,
 

627
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,189
of this year so far. Rotation, rotation,
rotation, rotation. All right, it's just

628
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
rotation, rotation. All right, it's just
 

629
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,590
rotation, rotation. All right, it's just
boxed in. We can have a quick look at

630
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
boxed in. We can have a quick look at
 

631
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,470
boxed in. We can have a quick look at
some of the broader names. Oracle still

632
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:44,480
some of the broader names. Oracle still
 

633
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,990
some of the broader names. Oracle still
dropping down. I'm starting to get more

634
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
dropping down. I'm starting to get more
 

635
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,509
dropping down. I'm starting to get more
and more interested in that. If we can

636
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
and more interested in that. If we can
 

637
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,030
and more interested in that. If we can
come down into here, it is of interest.

638
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,040
come down into here, it is of interest.
 

639
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,550
come down into here, it is of interest.
And

640
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,560
And
 

641
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,710
And
Netflix

642
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:54,720
Netflix
 

643
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,470
Netflix
still long in this just a tiny tiny

644
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480
still long in this just a tiny tiny
 

645
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,110
still long in this just a tiny tiny
piece on. I still think that we've got a

646
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
piece on. I still think that we've got a
 

647
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,470
piece on. I still think that we've got a
chance to flush lower. So just want to

648
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:00,480
chance to flush lower. So just want to
 

649
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,710
chance to flush lower. So just want to
see if we retest lower and what happens

650
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:02,720
see if we retest lower and what happens
 

651
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,510
see if we retest lower and what happens
down there if we trap some shorts. AMD

652
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,520
down there if we trap some shorts. AMD
 

653
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,870
down there if we trap some shorts. AMD
starting to get boxed in here. You can

654
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
starting to get boxed in here. You can
 

655
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,309
starting to get boxed in here. You can
see the levels. So I've drawn it in.

656
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:08,319
see the levels. So I've drawn it in.
 

657
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,150
see the levels. So I've drawn it in.

That is pretty much it, folks. That's

664
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:17,839
That is pretty much it, folks. That's
 

665
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,189
That is pretty much it, folks. That's
pretty much going to cover us. Not much

666
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
pretty much going to cover us. Not much
 

667
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,470
pretty much going to cover us. Not much
else we want to look at today, I don't

668
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,480
else we want to look at today, I don't
 

669
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,230
else we want to look at today, I don't
think. We can have a quick look at the

670
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,240
think. We can have a quick look at the
 

671
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,549
think. We can have a quick look at the
uh 10 year. Starting to get going.

672
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:26,559
uh 10 year. Starting to get going.
 

673
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,069
uh 10 year. Starting to get going.
That looks very dangerous. Remember, we

674
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,079
That looks very dangerous. Remember, we
 

675
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,070
That looks very dangerous. Remember, we
talked about the breakout above this.

676
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
talked about the breakout above this.
 

677
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,070
talked about the breakout above this.
The last year or so, we based above it.

678
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
The last year or so, we based above it.
 

679
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,710
The last year or so, we based above it.
Now, we're breaking out above this. This

680
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:34,720
Now, we're breaking out above this. This
 

681
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,390
Now, we're breaking out above this. This
is not good for the market. I'll tell

682
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,400
is not good for the market. I'll tell
 

683
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,750
is not good for the market. I'll tell
you, it's really not good for the

684
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,760
you, it's really not good for the
 

685
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,870
you, it's really not good for the
market. I guess the last thing we should

686
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,880
market. I guess the last thing we should
 

687
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,270
market. I guess the last thing we should
look at is the Dixie, which is probably

688
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,280
look at is the Dixie, which is probably
 

689
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,430
look at is the Dixie, which is probably
still selling off.

690
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
still selling off.
 

691
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,350
still selling off.
Yeah, still got a chance to break down

692
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,360
Yeah, still got a chance to break down
 

693
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,789
Yeah, still got a chance to break down
lower. Is gold still pushing? Yep, still

694
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
lower. Is gold still pushing? Yep, still
 

695
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,590
lower. Is gold still pushing? Yep, still
basing on gold. So, if you're trading

696
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
basing on gold. So, if you're trading
 

697
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,029
basing on gold. So, if you're trading
gold today, you're just basically

698
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:53,039
gold today, you're just basically
 

699
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,430
gold today, you're just basically
watching this box. All right. And if you

700
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
watching this box. All right. And if you
 

701
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,750
watching this box. All right. And if you
start to lose that, you know what's

702
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,760
start to lose that, you know what's
 

703
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,350
start to lose that, you know what's
going to happen. Otherwise, it's still

704
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,360
going to happen. Otherwise, it's still
 

705
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,070
going to happen. Otherwise, it's still
bullish. Silver still going. There's the

706
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080
bullish. Silver still going. There's the
 

707
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,909
bullish. Silver still going. There's the
same story here. Those are your pivots.

708
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:03,919
same story here. Those are your pivots.
 

709

It's still holding until you see a
 

711
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,870
It's still holding until you see a
backside. Remember, we've talked about

712
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880
backside. Remember, we've talked about
 

713
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,549
backside. Remember, we've talked about
this. We haven't seen backside in

714
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:08,559
this. We haven't seen backside in
 

715
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,710
this. We haven't seen backside in
silver. Everyone's too too keen to get

716
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:10,720
silver. Everyone's too too keen to get
 

717
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,630

718
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,640
the short as it will be a crowded trade
 

719
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,150
the short as it will be a crowded trade
that. All right. The more shorts that

720
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,160
that. All right. The more shorts that
 

721
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,590
that. All right. The more shorts that
pile into that, it's starting to feel

722
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:15,600
pile into that, it's starting to feel
 

723
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,070
pile into that, it's starting to feel
like a small cap, the higher it's going

724
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,080
like a small cap, the higher it's going
 

725
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,549
like a small cap, the higher it's going
to go as they get themselves caught. All

ENQ. So it's exactly the same. There's
no difference. You're just trading CFD

778
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,200
no difference. You're just trading CFD
 

779
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,669
no difference. You're just trading CFD
for it. All right,

780
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:25,679

 

781
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,230

let me get my chart sorted out here. So

782
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,240
let me get my chart sorted out here. So
 

783
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,669
let me get my chart sorted out here. So
we've got some support structure down

784
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
we've got some support structure down
 

785
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,750
we've got some support structure down
here at previous day value area low. We

786
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:31,760
here at previous day value area low. We
 

787
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,549
here at previous day value area low. We
can see we actually get thicker

788
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
can see we actually get thicker
 

789
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,150
can see we actually get thicker
Um, from where's that edge? Yeah, sort

790
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,160
Um, from where's that edge? Yeah, sort
 

791
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,230
Um, from where's that edge? Yeah, sort
of 98s

792
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
of 98s
 

793
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,669
of 98s
down into Have a look at this. Is there

794
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
down into Have a look at this. Is there
 

795
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,350
down into Have a look at this. Is there
an old maker point control down here?

796
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:45,360
an old maker point control down here?
 

797
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,830
an old maker point control down here?
There might well be. Yes, there is.

798
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840
There might well be. Yes, there is.
 

799
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,350
There might well be. Yes, there is.
Yeah, 98s down to 90s

800
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360
Yeah, 98s down to 90s
 

801
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,630
Yeah, 98s down to 90s
and even 72. So 98 down to 90. Yeah, in

802
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,640
and even 72. So 98 down to 90. Yeah, in
 

803
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,310
and even 72. So 98 down to 90. Yeah, in
here we get a bit thicker. So I wonder

804
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,320
here we get a bit thicker. So I wonder
 

805
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,190
here we get a bit thicker. So I wonder
if they can come and test that today.

806
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
if they can come and test that today.
 

807
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,990
if they can come and test that today.
Um, but yeah, neutral bias today.

808
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,000
Um, but yeah, neutral bias today.
 

809
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,070
Um, but yeah, neutral bias today.
Overall, we're technically bullish, but

810
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,080
Overall, we're technically bullish, but
 

811
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,150
Overall, we're technically bullish, but
uh we are opening up an inside bar,

812
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,160
uh we are opening up an inside bar,
 

813
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,630
uh we are opening up an inside bar,
inside value. All right, inside bar,

814
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640
inside value. All right, inside bar,
 

815
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,150
inside value. All right, inside bar,
inside value. More likely to see

816
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:10,160
inside value. More likely to see
 

817
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,669
inside value. More likely to see
rotation. The only thing I've got my eye

818
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:11,679
rotation. The only thing I've got my eye
 

819
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,470
rotation. The only thing I've got my eye
on is BIX.

820
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:14,480

carryover tilt from yesterday or
 

847

carryover tilt from yesterday or
anything like that. Just take the day

848
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:41,600
anything like that. Just take the day
 

849
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,510
anything like that. Just take the day
off or just sit here and and and learn.

Don't be risking capital if you're not

Don't be risking capital if you're not
 

853

854
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:46,720
fit and able to trade. Make sure the
 

855
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,990
fit and able to trade. Make sure the
market conditions are something that you

856
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
market conditions are something that you
 

857
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,909
market conditions are something that you
like at the moment. For me, they're not

858
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:49,919
like at the moment. For me, they're not
 

859
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,830
like at the moment. For me, they're not
they're not my favorite trade. But we

860
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
they're not my favorite trade. But we
 

861
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,110
they're not my favorite trade. But we
will see if we flush down and hold or if

862
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120
will see if we flush down and hold or if
 

863
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,029
will see if we flush down and hold or if
we flush down and stay heavy if there's

864
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:57,039
we flush down and stay heavy if there's
 

865
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,270
we flush down and stay heavy if there's
a bigger rotation that's going to take

866
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
a bigger rotation that's going to take
 

867
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,870
a bigger rotation that's going to take
place.

868
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:00,880
place.
 

869
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,950
place.
All right, 5 seconds here, folks. Let's

870
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:02,960
All right, 5 seconds here, folks. Let's
 

871
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,750
All right, 5 seconds here, folks. Let's
see what we can get.

872
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:05,760
see what we can get.
 

873
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,230
see what we can get.
So, into value area low to start the day

874
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
So, into value area low to start the day
 

875
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,190
So, into value area low to start the day
by the looks of it. Magga mixed bag

876
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,200
by the looks of it. Magga mixed bag
 

877
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,669
by the looks of it. Magga mixed bag
right now. The big loser uh Microsoft

878
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:13,679
right now. The big loser uh Microsoft
 

879
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,549
right now. The big loser uh Microsoft
8.46% down.

880
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,559
8.46% down.
 

881
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,149
8.46% down.
So, protecting in front of value area

882
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:18,159
So, protecting in front of value area
 

883
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,750
So, protecting in front of value area
low back to previous day point of

884
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:19,760
low back to previous day point of
 

885
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,270
low back to previous day point of
control. If they go through point of

886
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:21,280
control. If they go through point of
 

887
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,430
control. If they go through point of
control, we can look maybe for the

888
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:23,440
control, we can look maybe for the
 

889
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,270
control, we can look maybe for the
rotation to value area high. So this is

890
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:25,280
rotation to value area high. So this is
 

891
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,510
rotation to value area high. So this is
the rotation today here to here and just

892
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,520
the rotation today here to here and just
 

893
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,190
the rotation today here to here and just
outside of it and just outside of it to

894
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:29,200
outside of it and just outside of it to
 

895
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,350
outside of it and just outside of it to
the underside like we said inside bar

896
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,360
the underside like we said inside bar
 

897
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,110
the underside like we said inside bar
inside value rotational day today until

898
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,120
inside value rotational day today until
 

899
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,630
inside value rotational day today until
it proves otherwise right that can

00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:36,640
it proves otherwise right that can
 

901
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,990
it proves otherwise right that can
change that sentiment can change

902
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,000
change that sentiment can change
 

903
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,990
change that sentiment can change
I've just said a million times it's a

I've just said a million times it's a
 

905
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,149
I've just said a million times it's a
neutral bias today we are an inside bar

906
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:44,159
neutral bias today we are an inside bar
 

907
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,990
neutral bias today we are an inside bar
we're in rotation it's probably more

908
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,000
we're in rotation it's probably more
 

909
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,149
we're in rotation it's probably more
likely that edges are going to play are

00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:48,159
likely that edges are going to play are
 

911
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,070
likely that edges are going to play are

That might very well go SSR if it keeps

Natron is mean. Thank you for that.

934
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799
Natron is mean. Thank you for that.
 

935
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,149
Natron is mean. Thank you for that.
Appreciate it. Glad that video helped

936
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159
Appreciate it. Glad that video helped
 

937
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,070
Appreciate it. Glad that video helped
you. Glad that video helped you. All

938
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
you. Glad that video helped you. All
 

939
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,750
you. Glad that video helped you. All
right, so the rotation still in effect

940
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,760
right, so the rotation still in effect
 

941
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,310
right, so the rotation still in effect
this morning. New York open straight up

942
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:38,320
this morning. New York open straight up
 

943
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,669
this morning. New York open straight up
to previous day point of control. Can't

944
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:39,679
to previous day point of control. Can't
 

945
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,789
to previous day point of control. Can't
get through it. Back down to New York

946
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:40,799
get through it. Back down to New York
 

947
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,390
get through it. Back down to New York
open. That's already happened twice. And

948
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,400
open. That's already happened twice. And
 

949
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,669
open. That's already happened twice. And
if they keep failing, they're going to

950
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:43,679
if they keep failing, they're going to
 

951
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,190
if they keep failing, they're going to
come back down for value. All right,

952
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,200
come back down for value. All right,
 

953
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,029
come back down for value. All right,
this is just the rotation is where we

954
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:47,039
this is just the rotation is where we
 

955
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,710
this is just the rotation is where we
are.

956
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:48,720
are.
 

957
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,070
are.
So, probably going to try and attack

958
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,080
So, probably going to try and attack
 

959
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,669
So, probably going to try and attack
value right now as we start drifting

960
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,679
value right now as we start drifting
 

961
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,029
value right now as we start drifting
lower. Here you go. Here's the move to

962
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:53,039
lower. Here you go. Here's the move to
 

963
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,190
lower. Here you go. Here's the move to
value. So, in this short, trimming some

964
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,200
value. So, in this short, trimming some
 

965
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,590
value. So, in this short, trimming some
into value now as we start to lose this.

966
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:57,600
into value now as we start to lose this.
 

967
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,270
into value now as we start to lose this.
And we're just in a runner now from New

968
00:22:59,270 --> 00:22:59,280
And we're just in a runner now from New
 

969
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,110
And we're just in a runner now from New
York. And if we reprint it, we go back

970
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,120
York. And if we reprint it, we go back
 

971
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,870
York. And if we reprint it, we go back
upside. I'll cut the rest out. But just

972
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:02,880
upside. I'll cut the rest out. But just
 

973
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,190
upside. I'll cut the rest out. But just
in here to value, trim some. If we get

974
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,200
in here to value, trim some. If we get
 

975
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,350
in here to value, trim some. If we get
down into here, lovely bonus, but we

976
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:07,360
down into here, lovely bonus, but we
 

977
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,430
down into here, lovely bonus, but we
don't expect that. It's a nice bonus if

978
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,440
don't expect that. It's a nice bonus if
 

979
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,270
don't expect that. It's a nice bonus if
we do. But two failures at previous day

980
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,280
we do. But two failures at previous day
 

981
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,270
we do. But two failures at previous day
point of control said enough for me to

982
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,280
point of control said enough for me to
 

983
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,669
point of control said enough for me to
just have a little scalp down there.

984
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:15,679
just have a little scalp down there.
 

985
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,710
just have a little scalp down there.
Okay, up towards VWAP again.

986
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:18,720
Okay, up towards VWAP again.
 

987
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,270
Okay, up towards VWAP again.
and see if they get stuck here.

988
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,280

 

989
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,510

Microsoft now SSR I think on I'm

990
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:25,520
Microsoft now SSR I think on I'm
 

991
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,110
Microsoft now SSR I think on I'm
assuming it has gone 10% because I just

992
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,120
assuming it has gone 10% because I just
 

993
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,510
assuming it has gone 10% because I just
saw it at 9.98%. So I'm assuming they

994
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,520
saw it at 9.98%. So I'm assuming they
 

995
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,310
saw it at 9.98%. So I'm assuming they
didn't save that 9.97 again. I'm going

996
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,320
didn't save that 9.97 again. I'm going
 

997
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,270
didn't save that 9.97 again. I'm going
to assume Microsoft would be SSR now. So

998
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,280
to assume Microsoft would be SSR now. So
 

999
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,950
to assume Microsoft would be SSR now. So
for tomorrow there might be a bid on

1000
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:36,960
for tomorrow there might be a bid on
 

1001
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,789
for tomorrow there might be a bid on
Microsoft as they fail to sell it. I

1002
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:38,799
Microsoft as they fail to sell it. I
 

1003
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,270
Microsoft as they fail to sell it. I
would imagine

1004
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:43,280

 

1005
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,190

IQ's coming into their block which they

1006
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:45,200
IQ's coming into their block which they
 

1007
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,909
IQ's coming into their block which they
keep defending.

1008
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:47,919
keep defending.
 

1009
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,350
keep defending.
Still in this with a runner all the

1010
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,360
Still in this with a runner all the
 

1011
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,710
Still in this with a runner all the
time. We're rejecting New York open.

1012
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:50,720
time. We're rejecting New York open.
 

1013
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,149
time. We're rejecting New York open.
Still in this with a runner to see if we

1014
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:52,159
Still in this with a runner to see if we
 

1015
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,149
Still in this with a runner to see if we
move lower

1016
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,159
move lower
 

1017
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,590
move lower
but already locking in no matter what

1018
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:55,600
but already locking in no matter what
 

1019
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:05,909

Nice. Here we go. See if we can get this

00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:12,159
Nice. Here we go. See if we can get this
 

1025

Nice. Here we go. See if we can get this
runner to go for us. Here we go, folks.

runner to go for us. Here we go, folks.
 

1027
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,590
runner to go for us. Here we go, folks.
Beautiful. So, still protecting that New

1028
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:15,600
Beautiful. So, still protecting that New
 

1029
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,750
Beautiful. So, still protecting that New
York open blue line. If we get follow

1030
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:17,760
York open blue line. If we get follow
 

1031
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,190
York open blue line. If we get follow
through under previous day value, we're

1032
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
through under previous day value, we're
 

1033
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,549
through under previous day value, we're
looking for these blue boxes. Previous

1034
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
looking for these blue boxes. Previous
 

1035
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,710
looking for these blue boxes. Previous
day high, GlobeEx. And if we get really

1036
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:22,720
day high, GlobeEx. And if we get really
 

1037
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,230
day high, GlobeEx. And if we get really
lucky down into this,

1038
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,240
lucky down into this,
 

1039
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,149
lucky down into this,
just don't be adding too late. We're

1040
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:28,159
just don't be adding too late. We're
 

1041
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,830
just don't be adding too late. We're
positioned for this in case it wants to

1042
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:29,840
positioned for this in case it wants to
 

1043
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,830
positioned for this in case it wants to
do it. But our expectation is a

1044
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:31,840
do it. But our expectation is a
 

1045
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,590
do it. But our expectation is a
rotation. It very well might be that

1046
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
rotation. It very well might be that
 

1047
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,830
rotation. It very well might be that
they want to bid at previous day value

1048
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:35,840
they want to bid at previous day value
 

1049
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,190
they want to bid at previous day value
low. I would like to see them bid down

1050
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
low. I would like to see them bid down
 

1051
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,549
low. I would like to see them bid down
here or down here because I'm in the

1052
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:38,559
here or down here because I'm in the
 

1053
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:52,310
here or down here because I'm in the
short already

1054
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:52,320

 

1055
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,430

tape. See if we can see some follow

1056
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:53,440
tape. See if we can see some follow
 

1057
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,909
tape. See if we can see some follow
through here.

1058
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:55,919
through here.
 

1059
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,669
through here.
Nice.

1060
00:24:59,669 --> 00:24:59,679

 

1061
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,029

Some sellers keep getting caught down

1062
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:01,039
Some sellers keep getting caught down
 

1063
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,390
Some sellers keep getting caught down
here in the 10. So, we need follow

1064
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:02,400
here in the 10. So, we need follow
 

1065
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,669
here in the 10. So, we need follow
through underneath that right now.

1066
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:03,679
through underneath that right now.
 

1067
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,470
through underneath that right now.
Otherwise, they're going to get

1068
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:04,480
Otherwise, they're going to get
 

1069
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,470
Otherwise, they're going to get
themselves caught.

1070
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:06,480
themselves caught.
 

1071
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,350
themselves caught.
Move my stop down a little bit here.

1072
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:11,360

 

1073
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,510

VPO now at 22s. Really nice. Here we go,

1074
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
VPO now at 22s. Really nice. Here we go,
 

1075
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,750
VPO now at 22s. Really nice. Here we go,
folks. Into these next TP areas. Let's

folks. Into these next TP areas. Let's
 

1077
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,230
folks. Into these next TP areas. Let's
get some volume on here.

1078
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,240
get some volume on here.
 

1079
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,230
get some volume on here.
Really good. Fantastic. Here's our

1080
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,240
Really good. Fantastic. Here's our
 

1081
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,310
Really good. Fantastic. Here's our
trade. Locking in money here and we will

1082
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,320
trade. Locking in money here and we will
 

1083
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,830
trade. Locking in money here and we will
hold runners now just in case we get

1084
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:25,840
hold runners now just in case we get
 

1085
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,510
hold runners now just in case we get
down to this gray area. Beautiful. Nice

1086
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:27,520
down to this gray area. Beautiful. Nice
 

1087
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,870
down to this gray area. Beautiful. Nice
win to start the day. So, two failures

1088
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:28,880
win to start the day. So, two failures
 

1089
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,230
win to start the day. So, two failures
into previous day point of control. We

1090
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,240
into previous day point of control. We
 

1091
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,590
into previous day point of control. We
lost the New York. We trade down to

1092
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:31,600
lost the New York. We trade down to
 

1093
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,590
lost the New York. We trade down to
value and we see how deep we can go now.

1094
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600
value and we see how deep we can go now.
 

1095
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,830
value and we see how deep we can go now.
Very very very nice. Yeah. And Microsoft

1096
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:35,840
Very very very nice. Yeah. And Microsoft
 

1097
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,110
Very very very nice. Yeah. And Microsoft
getting absolutely crushed here like

1098
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:37,120
getting absolutely crushed here like
 

1099
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,789
getting absolutely crushed here like
expected. So now SSR over 10% down. That

1100
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:40,799
expected. So now SSR over 10% down. That
 

1101
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,149
expected. So now SSR over 10% down. That
thing's in big big trouble.

1102
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:44,159
thing's in big big trouble.
 

1103
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,870
thing's in big big trouble.
Right into these 150s. So coming in

1104
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:46,880
Right into these 150s. So coming in
 

1105
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,390
Right into these 150s. So coming in
towards the edge of range. Make sure

1106
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:48,400
towards the edge of range. Make sure
 

1107
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,750
towards the edge of range. Make sure
you're zooming out. Remember this is

1108
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:49,760
you're zooming out. Remember this is
 

1109
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,190
you're zooming out. Remember this is
point of control on the developing

1110
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,200
point of control on the developing
 

1111
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,950
point of control on the developing
weekly profile where we are now. This

1112
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:52,960
weekly profile where we are now. This
 

1113
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,630
weekly profile where we are now. This
right here is point of control on the

1114
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:54,640
right here is point of control on the
 

1115
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,470
right here is point of control on the
developing weekly profile. It's a big

1116
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:56,480
developing weekly profile. It's a big
 

1117
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,870
developing weekly profile. It's a big
level that bulls will want to defend. If

1118
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:58,880
level that bulls will want to defend. If
 

1119
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,549
level that bulls will want to defend. If
we stay heavy under here and they fail

1120
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
we stay heavy under here and they fail
 

1121
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,710
we stay heavy under here and they fail
to defend it, I will be looking to trade

1122
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:02,720
to defend it, I will be looking to trade
 

1123
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,789
to defend it, I will be looking to trade
all the way down to 25s and possibly

1124
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:04,799
all the way down to 25s and possibly
 

1125
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,110
all the way down to 25s and possibly
down to that 26,000. But I expect this

1126
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,120
down to that 26,000. But I expect this
 

1127
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,430
down to that 26,000. But I expect this
to be a very heavily contested level

1128
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:09,440
to be a very heavily contested level
 

1129
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,549
to be a very heavily contested level
right now.

1130
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:12,559
right now.
 

1131
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,830
right now.
Yeah, if you if you're in this short

1132
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:13,840
Yeah, if you if you're in this short
 

1133
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,029
Yeah, if you if you're in this short
with me, you should have locked a good

1134
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:15,039
with me, you should have locked a good
 

1135
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,590
with me, you should have locked a good
chunk in. W's in chat for me. And let's

1136
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600
chunk in. W's in chat for me. And let's
 

1137
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,630
chunk in. W's in chat for me. And let's
see how low we caning go. Here we go,

1138
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:20,640
see how low we caning go. Here we go,
 

1139
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,190
see how low we caning go. Here we go,
baby. What a nice one to start the day.

1140
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,200
baby. What a nice one to start the day.
 

1141
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,190
baby. What a nice one to start the day.
Come on. Come on. Let's come all the way

1142
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:25,200
Come on. Come on. Let's come all the way
 

1143
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,310
Come on. Come on. Let's come all the way
down. Let's be very kind.

1144
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,320
down. Let's be very kind.
 

1145
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,990
down. Let's be very kind.
So I would start moving your stop down

1146
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,000
So I would start moving your stop down
 

1147
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,350
So I would start moving your stop down
aggressively because we are being

1148
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:31,360
aggressively because we are being
 

1149
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,789
aggressively because we are being
aggressive on the tape here and the

1150
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:32,799
aggressive on the tape here and the
 

1151
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,390
aggressive on the tape here and the
bounce back will be violent if and when

1152
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:34,400
bounce back will be violent if and when
 

1153
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,750
bounce back will be violent if and when
they do it. Gap now filled on the ES gap

1154
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:37,760
they do it. Gap now filled on the ES gap
 

1155
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,149
they do it. Gap now filled on the ES gap
now filled on the SPY as well. So just

1156
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:40,159
now filled on the SPY as well. So just
 

1157
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,590
now filled on the SPY as well. So just
be aware of that. We have an efficient

1158
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,600
be aware of that. We have an efficient
 

1159
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,029
be aware of that. We have an efficient
market. We're obviously well below the

1160
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:43,039
market. We're obviously well below the
 

1161
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,350
market. We're obviously well below the
gap on the Q's. VIX is absolutely

1162
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:45,360
gap on the Q's. VIX is absolutely
 

1163
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,549
gap on the Q's. VIX is absolutely
ripping through that 22 level 1722s or

1164
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:48,559
ripping through that 22 level 1722s or
 

1165
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,870
ripping through that 22 level 1722s or
1718s that we talked about pre-market.

1166
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:50,880
1718s that we talked about pre-market.
 

1167
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,390
1718s that we talked about pre-market.
We are still in this short. We're still

1168
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:52,400
We are still in this short. We're still
 

1169
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,630
We are still in this short. We're still
looking for more but we are now managing

1170
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:54,640
looking for more but we are now managing
 

1171
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,630
looking for more but we are now managing
our runners right watching this blue

1172
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640
our runners right watching this blue
 

1173
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,269
our runners right watching this blue
box. if they can start turning this into

1174
00:26:59,269 --> 00:26:59,279
box. if they can start turning this into
 

1175
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,870
box. if they can start turning this into
resistance. If we think about what this

1176
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:00,880
resistance. If we think about what this
 

1177
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,190
resistance. If we think about what this
is, this is a huge level on the weekly

1178
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,200
is, this is a huge level on the weekly
 

1179
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,390
is, this is a huge level on the weekly
profile. If we start losing this on the

1180
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:06,400
profile. If we start losing this on the
 

1181
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,470
profile. If we start losing this on the
developing weekly profile, if we build

1182
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:08,480
developing weekly profile, if we build
 

1183
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,149
developing weekly profile, if we build
into this and lose it, I'm looking for

1184
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:10,159
into this and lose it, I'm looking for
 

1185
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,830
into this and lose it, I'm looking for
this. It might not even give us a chance

1186
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:11,840
this. It might not even give us a chance
 

1187
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,909
this. It might not even give us a chance
to get any more on. It might just slide

1188
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:13,919
to get any more on. It might just slide
 

1189
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,909
to get any more on. It might just slide
all the way down at the moment.

1190
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:17,919
all the way down at the moment.
 

1191
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,110
all the way down at the moment.
Really good.

1192
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,120
Really good.
 

1193
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,029
Really good.
Really nice. What an absolute pear. What

1194
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:25,039
Really nice. What an absolute pear. What
 

1195
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,029
Really nice. What an absolute pear. What
a beautiful day. All right, gray box is

1196
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:27,039
a beautiful day. All right, gray box is
 

1197
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,669
a beautiful day. All right, gray box is
your next cover. Then the green line

1198
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:31,679

 

1199
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,350

short from here.

1200
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:35,360

 

1201
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,110

See if we get gray box, which we just

1202
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,120
See if we get gray box, which we just
 

1203
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,510
See if we get gray box, which we just
got.

1204
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:39,520
got.
 

1205
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,269
got.
And underneath gray box, we'll look for

1206
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:41,279
And underneath gray box, we'll look for
 

1207
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,870
And underneath gray box, we'll look for
this. Right, if we go all the way down,

1208
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
this. Right, if we go all the way down,
 

1209
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,230
this. Right, if we go all the way down,
we'll look for this. But these are big

1210
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:44,240
we'll look for this. But these are big
 

1211
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,870
we'll look for this. But these are big
cover points. Beautiful.

1212
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:48,880

 

1213
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,310

So, you should be locking in some good

1214
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
So, you should be locking in some good
 

1215
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,149
So, you should be locking in some good
chunk of change into here, guys. This is

1216
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:52,159
chunk of change into here, guys. This is
 

1217
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,990
chunk of change into here, guys. This is
about 100 point trade already. And this

1218
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,000
about 100 point trade already. And this
 

1219
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,269
about 100 point trade already. And this
is about the fifth day in a row giving

1220
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:55,279
is about the fifth day in a row giving
 

1221
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,430
is about the fifth day in a row giving
you 100 pointer. Let's see if we lose

1222
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:57,440
you 100 pointer. Let's see if we lose
 

1223
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,830
you 100 pointer. Let's see if we lose
this gray box and we really get motoring

1224
00:27:59,830 --> 00:27:59,840
this gray box and we really get motoring
 

1225
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,350
this gray box and we really get motoring
and we are going to use this as an

1226
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:01,360
and we are going to use this as an
 

1227
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,950
and we are going to use this as an
overunder now. All right, this might be

1228
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:02,960
overunder now. All right, this might be
 

1229
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,350
overunder now. All right, this might be
a key level.

1230
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,360

 

1231
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,110

Beautiful. Beautiful. Look at very heavy

1232
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,120
Beautiful. Beautiful. Look at very heavy
 

1233
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,590
Beautiful. Beautiful. Look at very heavy
tape. This is what we like to see. Heavy

1234
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:13,600
tape. This is what we like to see. Heavy
 

1235
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,630
tape. This is what we like to see. Heavy
tape once we lost this coming down into

1236
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:16,640
tape once we lost this coming down into
 

1237
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,510
tape once we lost this coming down into
this big whole number of 26,000.

1238
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:19,520
this big whole number of 26,000.
 

1239
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,710
this big whole number of 26,000.
Still heavy tape. We're going to get

1240
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:20,720
Still heavy tape. We're going to get
 

1241
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,230
Still heavy tape. We're going to get
this previous day low, this wick

1242
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,240
this previous day low, this wick
 

1243
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,710
this previous day low, this wick
hopefully from overnight where they

1244
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:24,720
hopefully from overnight where they
 

1245
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,310
hopefully from overnight where they
dipped and ripped. So, just be careful

1246
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,320
dipped and ripped. So, just be careful
 

1247
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,230
dipped and ripped. So, just be careful
down here. You do not want much size

1248
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:28,240
down here. You do not want much size
 

1249
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,549
down here. You do not want much size
after this.

1250
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:32,559

 

1251
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,510

Beautiful.

1252
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:37,520

 

1253
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,269

It's still bidding down at 75. So, I

1254
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:39,279
It's still bidding down at 75. So, I
 

1255
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,470
It's still bidding down at 75. So, I
wonder if we can get a flush beyond

1256
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:40,480
wonder if we can get a flush beyond
 

1257
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,310
wonder if we can get a flush beyond
this. Really, it needs a pullback at

1258
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:42,320
this. Really, it needs a pullback at
 

1259
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,990
this. Really, it needs a pullback at
some point. We're very extended from the

1260
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,000
some point. We're very extended from the
 

1261
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,750
some point. We're very extended from the
flow zones now. So, just be careful. You

1262
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:45,760
flow zones now. So, just be careful. You
 

1263
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,110
flow zones now. So, just be careful. You
might want to manage your position. You

1264
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,120
might want to manage your position. You
 

1265
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,230
might want to manage your position. You
might not want to sit through this

1266
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:48,240
might not want to sit through this
 

1267
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,909
might not want to sit through this
pullback because it might be violent

1268
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:49,919
pullback because it might be violent
 

1269
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,510
pullback because it might be violent
back up to this red line up here.

1270
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:53,520
back up to this red line up here.
 

1271
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,110
back up to this red line up here.
So, if you want to take it all off now,

1272
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,120
So, if you want to take it all off now,
 

1273
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,870
So, if you want to take it all off now,
you can. You absolutely could take it

1274
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:56,880
you can. You absolutely could take it
 

1275
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,389
you can. You absolutely could take it
all off. That's a big trade. It's well

1276
00:28:58,389 --> 00:28:58,399
all off. That's a big trade. It's well
 

1277
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,990
all off. That's a big trade. It's well
over 100 points for you to start the

1278
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,000
over 100 points for you to start the
 

1279
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,830
over 100 points for you to start the
day. And we're what, 7 minutes into the

1280
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:01,840
day. And we're what, 7 minutes into the
 

1281
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,110
day. And we're what, 7 minutes into the
day and you've just had a 100 point

1282
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:03,120
day and you've just had a 100 point
 

1283
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,750
day and you've just had a 100 point
banger. You are welcome. You are

1284
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:05,760
banger. You are welcome. You are
 

1285
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,070
banger. You are welcome. You are
welcome. VIX absolutely ripping. So, VIX

1286
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,080
welcome. VIX absolutely ripping. So, VIX
 

1287
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,310
welcome. VIX absolutely ripping. So, VIX
into its next pivot in towards these

1288
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:10,320
into its next pivot in towards these
 

1289
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,430
into its next pivot in towards these
1744s all the way up to 17 sort of 60s.

1290
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:13,440
1744s all the way up to 17 sort of 60s.
 

1291
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,710
1744s all the way up to 17 sort of 60s.
So, it might get stuck there to VIX.

1292
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:14,720
So, it might get stuck there to VIX.
 

1293
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,750
So, it might get stuck there to VIX.
Here comes the pullback. So, if you want

1294
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:15,760
Here comes the pullback. So, if you want
 

1295
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,750
Here comes the pullback. So, if you want
to get out of this now, you can. I still

1296
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:17,760
to get out of this now, you can. I still
 

1297
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,110
to get out of this now, you can. I still
think we have a chance to move lower,

1298
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,120
think we have a chance to move lower,
 

1299
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,269
think we have a chance to move lower,
but certainly some shorts came in under

1300
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:21,279
but certainly some shorts came in under
 

1301
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,909
but certainly some shorts came in under
22, but I'm expecting a pullback. Um,

1302
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:23,919
22, but I'm expecting a pullback. Um,
 

1303
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,510
22, but I'm expecting a pullback. Um,
and then see if they resell it in

1304
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:25,520
and then see if they resell it in
 

1305
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:44,310
and then see if they resell it in
towards that red box would be ideal.

1306
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:44,320

 

1307
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,990

They're still defending 50. So, I would

1308
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,000
They're still defending 50. So, I would
 

1309
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,909
They're still defending 50. So, I would
actually like them to lift this up all

1310
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:47,919
actually like them to lift this up all
 

1311
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,389
actually like them to lift this up all
the way up here and defend it up there

1312
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:50,399
the way up here and defend it up there
 

1313
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,389
the way up here and defend it up there
if I'm going to add on for a second

1314
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:52,399
if I'm going to add on for a second
 

1315
00:29:52,399 --> 00:30:09,669
if I'm going to add on for a second
trade here, but we will see.

1316
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:09,679

 

1317
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,310

It's still bidding down at 6 uh 26,000

1318
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:12,320
It's still bidding down at 6 uh 26,000
 

1319
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,070
It's still bidding down at 6 uh 26,000
below. Here comes the lift. Can they

1320
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,080
below. Here comes the lift. Can they
 

1321
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,430
below. Here comes the lift. Can they
lift this a bit higher? I'm not going to

1322
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:15,440
lift this a bit higher? I'm not going to
 

1323
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,950
lift this a bit higher? I'm not going to
play this long. I want to see them lift

1324
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:16,960
play this long. I want to see them lift
 

1325
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,830
play this long. I want to see them lift
it higher and see if we hold this now.

1326
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:19,840
it higher and see if we hold this now.
 

1327
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,190
it higher and see if we hold this now.
Right. If we hold this now, we've moved

1328
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,200
Right. If we hold this now, we've moved
 

1329
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,750
Right. If we hold this now, we've moved
outside of previous day's value. This is

1330
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:23,760
outside of previous day's value. This is
 

1331
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,549
outside of previous day's value. This is
current week's point of control. I want

1332
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:26,559
current week's point of control. I want
 

1333
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,149
current week's point of control. I want
to see if sellers are willing to defend

1334
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:28,159
to see if sellers are willing to defend
 

1335
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,830
to see if sellers are willing to defend
that. If we scream through that, then

1336
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:29,840
that. If we scream through that, then
 

1337
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,430
that. If we scream through that, then
we're going to go on a squeeze. But

1338
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:31,440
we're going to go on a squeeze. But
 

1339
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,430
we're going to go on a squeeze. But
right now, I'm wanting to see, right?

1340
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:33,440
right now, I'm wanting to see, right?
 

1341
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,750
right now, I'm wanting to see, right?
Are sellers willing to defend up here?

1342
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:35,760
Are sellers willing to defend up here?
 

1343
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,269
Are sellers willing to defend up here?
They can set they can defend in front of

1344
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:37,279
They can set they can defend in front of
 

1345
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,870
They can set they can defend in front of
it. You can see this shelf here. But I'm

1346
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:38,880
it. You can see this shelf here. But I'm
 

1347
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,470
it. You can see this shelf here. But I'm
wondering if we just let this through

1348
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:40,480
wondering if we just let this through
 

1349
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:49,269
wondering if we just let this through
and then redefend it. Also

1350
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:49,279

 

1351
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,830

watching ES and Spy into the PDC, right,

1352
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:51,840
watching ES and Spy into the PDC, right,
 

1353
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,389
watching ES and Spy into the PDC, right,
Spy already there. ES almost there,

1354
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:54,399
Spy already there. ES almost there,
 

1355
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,070
Spy already there. ES almost there,
right? So they flushed under. I'm

1356
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,080
right? So they flushed under. I'm
 

1357
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,110
right? So they flushed under. I'm
interested. Do they defend PDC? Spy now

1358
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,120
interested. Do they defend PDC? Spy now
 

1359
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,230
interested. Do they defend PDC? Spy now
starting to reclaim it.

1360
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:02,240
starting to reclaim it.
 

1361
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,149
starting to reclaim it.
Can this have a shove up is what I'm

1362
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:04,159
Can this have a shove up is what I'm
 

1363
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,430
Can this have a shove up is what I'm
thinking now. If I'm going to reshort, I

1364
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:05,440
thinking now. If I'm going to reshort, I
 

1365
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,110
thinking now. If I'm going to reshort, I
want to see a shove up and then stay

1366
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,120
want to see a shove up and then stay
 

1367
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,750
want to see a shove up and then stay
heavy. We are developing nodes down here

1368
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:09,760
heavy. We are developing nodes down here
 

1369
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,789
heavy. We are developing nodes down here
now. Remember

1370
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:12,799
now. Remember
 

1371
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,630
now. Remember
this was the area that they dipped and

1372
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:14,640
this was the area that they dipped and
 

1373
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,190
this was the area that they dipped and
ripped um last night. This was the area

1374
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,200
ripped um last night. This was the area
 

1375
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,950
ripped um last night. This was the area
where we were looking for that trap last

1376
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:18,960
where we were looking for that trap last
 

1377
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,110
where we were looking for that trap last
night, right? It looks like they're

1378
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,120
night, right? It looks like they're
 

1379
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,389
night, right? It looks like they're
defending early here. We might get

1380
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:22,399
defending early here. We might get
 

1381
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,830
defending early here. We might get
follow through further. Yeah, we're

1382
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:23,840
follow through further. Yeah, we're
 

1383
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,269
follow through further. Yeah, we're
coming down for that previous day low

1384
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:25,279
coming down for that previous day low
 

1385
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,110
coming down for that previous day low
now. Shorts definitely keep getting

1386
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,120
now. Shorts definitely keep getting
 

1387
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,430
now. Shorts definitely keep getting
stuck in

1388
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:29,440
stuck in
 

1389
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,430
stuck in
and around 10 now.

1390
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:33,440
and around 10 now.
 

1391
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:42,230
and around 10 now.
I really want them to lift this for me.

1392
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,240

 

1393
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,830

Yeah, lots of you locking good in there.

1394
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:43,840
Yeah, lots of you locking good in there.
 

1395

1403
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,070
That's very kind.
Stuck in a range. Well, we will see,

1404
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,080
Stuck in a range. Well, we will see,
 

1405
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,750
Stuck in a range. Well, we will see,
won't we? We will see. Like we talked

1406
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:57,760
won't we? We will see. Like we talked
 

1407
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,870
won't we? We will see. Like we talked
about, we were inside bars, but that

1408
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:00,880
about, we were inside bars, but that
 

1409
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,870
about, we were inside bars, but that
inside bar finishes at this green line,

1410
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:02,880
inside bar finishes at this green line,
 

1411
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,190
inside bar finishes at this green line,
right? So, the daily inside bar finishes

1412
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:05,200
right? So, the daily inside bar finishes
 

1413
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,310
right? So, the daily inside bar finishes
here. We are moving outside of value.

1414
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,320
here. We are moving outside of value.
 

1415
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,149
here. We are moving outside of value.
Previous day value area low now being

1416
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:10,159
Previous day value area low now being
 

1417
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,590
Previous day value area low now being
left. So if we come back up here and

1418
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:13,600
left. So if we come back up here and
 

1419
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,350
left. So if we come back up here and
fade it, I expect lower here and fade

1420
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:15,360
fade it, I expect lower here and fade
 

1421
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,789
fade it, I expect lower here and fade
it. I expect lower. We need to be

1422
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:16,799
it. I expect lower. We need to be
 

1423
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,669
it. I expect lower. We need to be
careful of traps in this area. But right

1424
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:19,679
careful of traps in this area. But right
 

1425
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:27,269
careful of traps in this area. But right
now the tape is heavy.

1426
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:27,279

 

1427
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,950

This is the edge of the inside bar. And

1428
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:28,960
This is the edge of the inside bar. And
 

1429
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,870
This is the edge of the inside bar. And
this is down here is current week value

1430
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:30,880
this is down here is current week value
 

1431
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,549
this is down here is current week value
area low. And we have liquidity down

1432
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:32,559
area low. And we have liquidity down
 

1433
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,710
area low. And we have liquidity down
here the 900s if they really want to do

1434
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:34,720
here the 900s if they really want to do
 

1435
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,669
here the 900s if they really want to do
it. Here it comes. So coming into

1436
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:37,679
it. Here it comes. So coming into
 

1437
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,509
it. Here it comes. So coming into
previous day value, previous day low,

1438
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:39,519
previous day value, previous day low,
 

1439
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,149
previous day value, previous day low,
this is your next cover point. Do not be

1440
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:42,159
this is your next cover point. Do not be
 

1441
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:49,269
this is your next cover point. Do not be
a dick for a tick, please.

1442
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:49,279

 

1443
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,190

If I come to to Italy, you'll take me

1444
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:51,200
If I come to to Italy, you'll take me
 

1445
00:32:51,200 --> 00:33:02,230
If I come to to Italy, you'll take me
for dinner. Oh, thank you. Sounds good.

1446
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:02,240

 

1447
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,029

475* 10. There you go. That's a nice

1448
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:05,039
475* 10. There you go. That's a nice
 

1449
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,070
475* 10. There you go. That's a nice
winning day, isn't it? $4,750. Nice

1450
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,080
winning day, isn't it? $4,750. Nice
 

1451
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,549
winning day, isn't it? $4,750. Nice
work. All right. Previous day low here.

1452
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:10,559
work. All right. Previous day low here.
 

1453
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,149
work. All right. Previous day low here.
This is your TP. And then through this,

1454
00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:12,159
This is your TP. And then through this,
 

1455
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,509
This is your TP. And then through this,
we're looking down here. If we get

1456
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:13,519
we're looking down here. If we get
 

1457
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,350
we're looking down here. If we get
follow through, this is the edge of the

1458
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:15,360
follow through, this is the edge of the
 

1459
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,950
follow through, this is the edge of the
inside bar, right? Think about the

1460
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:16,960
inside bar, right? Think about the
 

1461
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,350
inside bar, right? Think about the
daily. This is the daily low. If there's

1462
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:19,360
daily. This is the daily low. If there's
 

1463
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,070
daily. This is the daily low. If there's
follow through under here, we will be

1464
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,080
follow through under here, we will be
 

1465
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,710
follow through under here, we will be
looking for actually down here into this

1466
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:24,720
looking for actually down here into this
 

1467
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,350
looking for actually down here into this
blue box really into sort of 9 920s.

1468
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,360
blue box really into sort of 9 920s.
 

1469
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,310
blue box really into sort of 9 920s.
There we go. It's a tiny tiny tiny size

1470
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:32,320
There we go. It's a tiny tiny tiny size
 

1471
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,950
There we go. It's a tiny tiny tiny size
left. Now I'm basically out of all of it

1472
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:34,960
left. Now I'm basically out of all of it
 

1473
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,789
left. Now I'm basically out of all of it
and uh we'll see if we get all the way

1474
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:36,799
and uh we'll see if we get all the way
 

1475
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,630
and uh we'll see if we get all the way
down here now. So the next target is

1476
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:38,640
down here now. So the next target is
 

1477
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,149
down here now. So the next target is
down into this blue box. Right, this is

1478
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:40,159
down into this blue box. Right, this is
 

1479
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,990
down into this blue box. Right, this is
the edge of current week value, but

1480
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,000
the edge of current week value, but
 

1481
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,149
the edge of current week value, but
there is actually a big node down in

1482
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
there is actually a big node down in
 

1483
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,789
there is actually a big node down in
this blue level. So if I zoom you out, I

1484
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:46,799
this blue level. So if I zoom you out, I
 

1485
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,389
this blue level. So if I zoom you out, I
can show you why and what I'm looking

1486
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:48,399
can show you why and what I'm looking
 

1487
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,830
can show you why and what I'm looking
at. It comes from the higher time

1488
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:49,840
at. It comes from the higher time
 

1489
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,909
at. It comes from the higher time
frames, comes from this hourly, right?

1490
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:51,919
frames, comes from this hourly, right?
 

1491
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,230
frames, comes from this hourly, right?
We just let go of this node. We traded

1492
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:54,240
We just let go of this node. We traded
 

1493
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,230
We just let go of this node. We traded
to this node. We let go of this node.

1494
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:56,240
to this node. We let go of this node.
 

1495
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,870
to this node. We let go of this node.
We're trading down towards here now.

1496
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:58,880
We're trading down towards here now.
 

1497
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,549
We're trading down towards here now.
Right? You can see this. All right? So

1498
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:00,559
Right? You can see this. All right? So
 

1499
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,630
Right? You can see this. All right? So
this is thin. We're repricing the thin.

1500
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:02,640
this is thin. We're repricing the thin.
 

1501
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,549
this is thin. We're repricing the thin.
They might very well bid off there. We

1502
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:04,559
They might very well bid off there. We
 

1503
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,950
They might very well bid off there. We
don't know, right? We don't know. We're

1504
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:06,960
don't know, right? We don't know. We're
 

1505
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,030
don't know, right? We don't know. We're
just playing this trade right here,

1506
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,040
just playing this trade right here,
 

1507
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,109
just playing this trade right here,
right now for this reason. And then we

1508
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:11,119
right now for this reason. And then we
 

1509
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,550
right now for this reason. And then we
can deal with what's next once we get

1510
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:12,560
can deal with what's next once we get
 

1511
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,869
can deal with what's next once we get
there. All right. So, dip and rip so far

1512
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:14,879
there. All right. So, dip and rip so far
 

1513
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,230
there. All right. So, dip and rip so far
is what they're attempting to do. I'm

1514
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,240
is what they're attempting to do. I'm
 

1515
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,869
is what they're attempting to do. I'm
not convinced yet. This gray box is key.

1516
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:18,879
not convinced yet. This gray box is key.
 

1517
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,550
not convinced yet. This gray box is key.
Relief over the gray box. We go to red

1518
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:20,560
Relief over the gray box. We go to red
 

1519
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:30,230

1521
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,230

and we're trading back down to that 5day

1522
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:32,240
and we're trading back down to that 5day
 

1523
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,470
and we're trading back down to that 5day
on the ES as well. GlobeEx hanging out

on the ES as well. GlobeEx hanging out
 

1525
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,310
on the ES as well. GlobeEx hanging out
underneath now. So 5day on ES

1526
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:38,320
underneath now. So 5day on ES
 

1527
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,470
underneath now. So 5day on ES
and previous day low on the spiders

pre-market, we talked about these pivots
 

1535
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,109
pre-market, we talked about these pivots
coming up on the VIX,

1536
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:55,119

 

1537
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,589

right? We're trading into

00:34:59,270 --> 00:34:59,280
this next key pivot. Now, we've ripped
 

1541
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,710

I guess you could target down here if

1556
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:14,880
I guess you could target down here if
 

1557
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,790
I guess you could target down here if
you really wanted to. It's quite a lot

1558
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:16,800
you really wanted to. It's quite a lot
 

1559
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:31,750
you really wanted to. It's quite a lot
without a pullback.

00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:31,760

 

1561
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,190

a strong sneaking suspicion we would
 

1579
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,310
a strong sneaking suspicion we would
have the ability to do this today if we

1580
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:54,320
have the ability to do this today if we
 

1581
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:02,870
have the ability to do this today if we
left the range, which we did.

1582
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:02,880

 

1583
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,790

the edge of current week's um developing
 

1591
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,069

1698
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,000
will re-enter. Now, if if you're looking
 

1699
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,750
will re-enter. Now, if if you're looking
for a re-entry, I will think about a

1700
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:27,760
for a re-entry, I will think about a
 

1701
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,990
for a re-entry, I will think about a
re-enter somewhere in here. All right.

1702
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,000
re-enter somewhere in here. All right.
 

1703
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,150
re-enter somewhere in here. All right.
If I see balls get trapped, I'll think

1704
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,160
If I see balls get trapped, I'll think
 

1705
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:41,270
If I see balls get trapped, I'll think
about that play there.

1706
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:41,280

 

1707
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,870

It was quick. It was quick today. Yeah.

1708
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:42,880
It was quick. It was quick today. Yeah.
 

1709
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,630
It was quick. It was quick today. Yeah.
I mean, I can't I don't get to choose

1710
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:44,640
I mean, I can't I don't get to choose
 

1711
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,310
I mean, I can't I don't get to choose
how quick it is, guys. I can only watch

1712
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:46,320
how quick it is, guys. I can only watch
 

1713
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,750
how quick it is, guys. I can only watch
the tape. The moment I kept telling you,

1714
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:49,760
the tape. The moment I kept telling you,
 

1715
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,390
the tape. The moment I kept telling you,
look, the rotation is happening from

1716
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:54,400
look, the rotation is happening from
 

1717
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,630
look, the rotation is happening from
previous day value area low into point

1718
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:56,640
previous day value area low into point
 

1719
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,390
previous day value area low into point
of control. They kept getting stuck and

1720
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:58,400
of control. They kept getting stuck and
 

1721
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,470
of control. They kept getting stuck and
once they let go, it was like, okay, we

1722
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:00,480
once they let go, it was like, okay, we
 

1723
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,829
once they let go, it was like, okay, we
can't get through the New York open,

1724
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:01,839
can't get through the New York open,
 

1725
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,190
can't get through the New York open,
we're going to trade down. And I

1726
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:03,200
we're going to trade down. And I
 

1727
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,550
we're going to trade down. And I
positioned for that trade down. So,

1728
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:04,560
positioned for that trade down. So,
 

1729
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,270
positioned for that trade down. So,
here's the squeeze back up. Why? Because

1730
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:07,280
here's the squeeze back up. Why? Because
 

1731
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,870
here's the squeeze back up. Why? Because
we hit the key level. We are likely to

1732
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:08,880
we hit the key level. We are likely to
 

1733
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,990
we hit the key level. We are likely to
come and retest this gray box now. And

1734
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,000
come and retest this gray box now. And
 

1735
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,390
come and retest this gray box now. And
point of control on the current day is

1736
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:14,400
point of control on the current day is
 

1737
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,069
point of control on the current day is
in that gray box, right? So, the relief

1738
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:16,079
in that gray box, right? So, the relief
 

1739
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,589
in that gray box, right? So, the relief
is back upside to here. And there might

1740
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:17,599
is back upside to here. And there might
 

1741
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,150
is back upside to here. And there might
be there might be a reshort opportunity

1742
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,160
be there might be a reshort opportunity
 

1743
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,670
be there might be a reshort opportunity
as we come into this. We will have to

1744
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:21,680
as we come into this. We will have to
 

1745
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,510
as we come into this. We will have to
see if buyers get stuck or if they're

1746
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:23,520
see if buyers get stuck or if they're
 

1747
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,109
see if buyers get stuck or if they're
going to do a full reversal. This is

1748
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:25,119
going to do a full reversal. This is
 

1749
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,950
going to do a full reversal. This is
also an big level for me. in this gray

1750
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:26,960
also an big level for me. in this gray
 

1751
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,069
also an big level for me. in this gray
box and then above it. Right?

1752
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:30,079
box and then above it. Right?
 

1753
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,430
box and then above it. Right?
So you can see the importance of

1754
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:31,440
So you can see the importance of
 

1755
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,430
So you can see the importance of
covering into key levels. Not being

1756
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:33,440
covering into key levels. Not being
 

1757
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:46,470
covering into key levels. Not being
greedy. Must cover into key levels.

1758
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:46,480

 

1759
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,069

Like them just to lift this a little bit

1760
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:48,079
Like them just to lift this a little bit
 

1761
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,750
Like them just to lift this a little bit
higher and see if it offers a reshort

1762
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:49,760
higher and see if it offers a reshort
 

1763
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,750
higher and see if it offers a reshort
here. So if we trap buys here or the red

1764
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:51,760
here. So if we trap buys here or the red
 

1765
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,670
here. So if we trap buys here or the red
box, I will think about the trade back

1766
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:53,680
box, I will think about the trade back
 

1767
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,150
box, I will think about the trade back
down. I won't. My expectations will be

1768
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:56,160
down. I won't. My expectations will be
 

1769
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,910
down. I won't. My expectations will be
lowered now because we've done the main

1770
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:57,920
lowered now because we've done the main
 

1771
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,310
lowered now because we've done the main
move. So I will think about only if I

1772
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:00,320
move. So I will think about only if I
 

1773
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,790
move. So I will think about only if I
see buyers trapped. All right, this kind

1774
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:02,800
see buyers trapped. All right, this kind
 

1775
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,790
see buyers trapped. All right, this kind
of move down into here now. All right,

1776
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:06,800
of move down into here now. All right,
 

1777
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,470
of move down into here now. All right,
if we trap buyers, if we trap them up

1778
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:08,480
if we trap buyers, if we trap them up
 

1779
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,750
if we trap buyers, if we trap them up
here, I'll look for the same move. But

1780
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:09,760
here, I'll look for the same move. But
 

1781
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,910
here, I'll look for the same move. But
I'd be looking for something like this.

1782
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:11,920
I'd be looking for something like this.
 

1783
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,829
I'd be looking for something like this.
If we start to trap buyers up here

1784
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:17,839

 

1785
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:31,750

or at least expect that pullback move

1786
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:31,760

 

1787
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,670

this shelf here, you can see VPO just

1788
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:33,680
this shelf here, you can see VPO just
 

1789
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,589
this shelf here, you can see VPO just
trading VPO previous day low trying to

1790
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:35,599
trading VPO previous day low trying to
 

1791
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,750
trading VPO previous day low trying to
be reclaimed here.

1792
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:37,760
be reclaimed here.
 

1793
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,270
be reclaimed here.
Watching the tape to see if they start

1794
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:39,280
Watching the tape to see if they start
 

1795
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,589
Watching the tape to see if they start
trapping by soon. Like one more little

1796
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:41,599
trapping by soon. Like one more little
 

1797
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,190
trapping by soon. Like one more little
shove up would be most ideal.

1798
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,200
shove up would be most ideal.
 

1799
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,630
shove up would be most ideal.
Looking pretty good here into these

1800
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:46,640
Looking pretty good here into these
 

1801
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,630
Looking pretty good here into these
26,000s. I would like a little lift up

1802
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:48,640
26,000s. I would like a little lift up
 

1803
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,270
26,000s. I would like a little lift up
towards 30s.

1804
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,280
towards 30s.
 

1805
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,950
towards 30s.
Value area high in the day 50s. That

1806
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:52,960
Value area high in the day 50s. That
 

1807
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,030
Value area high in the day 50s. That
would be ideal. Watching these 26,000s.

1808
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,040
would be ideal. Watching these 26,000s.
 

1809
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,870
would be ideal. Watching these 26,000s.
I would like a lift up first if

1810
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:56,880
I would like a lift up first if
 

1811
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,430
I would like a lift up first if
possible, but will position. Here we go.

1812
00:40:59,430 --> 00:40:59,440
possible, but will position. Here we go.
 

1813
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,870
possible, but will position. Here we go.
Starting to see some weakness come in

1814
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:00,880
Starting to see some weakness come in
 

1815
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,030
Starting to see some weakness come in
here. We might get this move now. Might

1816
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,040
here. We might get this move now. Might
 

1817
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,470
here. We might get this move now. Might
not even make it, which would be

1818
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:04,480
not even make it, which would be
 

1819
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,270
not even make it, which would be
annoying. Would rather size up higher.

1820
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:07,280
annoying. Would rather size up higher.
 

1821
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,670
annoying. Would rather size up higher.
would like one leg up higher first, but

1822
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:09,680
would like one leg up higher first, but
 

1823
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,470
would like one leg up higher first, but
this might be it, folks.

1824
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:12,480
this might be it, folks.
 

1825
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,750
this might be it, folks.
Yep. Okay. Trading this back downside at

1826
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:15,760
Yep. Okay. Trading this back downside at
 

1827
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,589
Yep. Okay. Trading this back downside at
the moment. Taking some partials into

1828
00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:17,599
the moment. Taking some partials into
 

1829
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,790
the moment. Taking some partials into
some of these imbalances. We have

1830
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:18,800
some of these imbalances. We have
 

1831
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,030
some of these imbalances. We have
imbalances down into 61s, which we're

1832
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,040
imbalances down into 61s, which we're
 

1833
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,190
imbalances down into 61s, which we're
coming into now. Trimming some here and

1834
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:23,200
coming into now. Trimming some here and
 

1835
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,390
coming into now. Trimming some here and
then we'll hold some. See if we can go

1836
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:24,400
then we'll hold some. See if we can go
 

1837
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,829
then we'll hold some. See if we can go
lower day

1838
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:27,839

 

1839
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,750

through the next imbalance 50s. And then

1840
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:29,760
through the next imbalance 50s. And then
 

1841
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,030
through the next imbalance 50s. And then
there's one down into sort of 35s.

1842
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,040
there's one down into sort of 35s.
 

1843
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,790
there's one down into sort of 35s.
Paying myself on this cuz we don't know

1844
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:34,800
Paying myself on this cuz we don't know
 

1845
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,790
Paying myself on this cuz we don't know
if they rebid off this, right? We don't

1846
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:36,800
if they rebid off this, right? We don't
 

1847
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,190
if they rebid off this, right? We don't
know. Sellers got stuck down here. We

1848
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:39,200
know. Sellers got stuck down here. We
 

1849
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,630
know. Sellers got stuck down here. We
don't know if they rebid off this. So

1850
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:40,640
don't know if they rebid off this. So
 

1851
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,829
don't know if they rebid off this. So
the trade is from here to here. I would

1852
00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:41,839
the trade is from here to here. I would
 

1853
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,190
the trade is from here to here. I would
have loved it from here to here, but the

1854
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:43,200
have loved it from here to here, but the
 

1855
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,630
have loved it from here to here, but the
trade is from here to here. If they

1856
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:44,640
trade is from here to here. If they
 

1857
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,550
trade is from here to here. If they
rebid this, they can do second leg up.

1858
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:46,560
rebid this, they can do second leg up.
 

1859
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,670
rebid this, they can do second leg up.
And we can think about the same thing up

1860
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:47,680
And we can think about the same thing up
 

1861
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,950
And we can think about the same thing up
there again. There we go. Out of this

1862
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:48,960
there again. There we go. Out of this
 

1863
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,550
there again. There we go. Out of this
already. Just just filling those

1864
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:50,560
already. Just just filling those
 

1865
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,910
already. Just just filling those
imbalances on the way down.

1866
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:53,920
imbalances on the way down.
 

1867
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,270
imbalances on the way down.
Right? So we can make that make sense

1868
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,280
Right? So we can make that make sense
 

1869
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,430
Right? So we can make that make sense
for you on here.

1870
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:57,440
for you on here.
 

1871
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,190
for you on here.
I was looking at in here. See these

1872
00:41:59,190 --> 00:41:59,200
I was looking at in here. See these
 

1873
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,870
I was looking at in here. See these
imbalances? All these green blocks,

1874
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:00,880
imbalances? All these green blocks,
 

1875
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,230
imbalances? All these green blocks,
these imbalances. So once these buyers

1876
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:04,240
these imbalances. So once these buyers
 

1877
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,069
these imbalances. So once these buyers
got caught,

1878
00:42:06,069 --> 00:42:06,079
got caught,
 

1879
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,589
got caught,
these buyers got caught. We used their

1880
00:42:07,589 --> 00:42:07,599
these buyers got caught. We used their
 

1881
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,510
these buyers got caught. We used their
pain to trade into here and we defended

1882
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:09,520
pain to trade into here and we defended
 

1883
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,829
pain to trade into here and we defended
this. So I'm all out. It might now flush

1884
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:11,839
this. So I'm all out. It might now flush
 

1885
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,230
this. So I'm all out. It might now flush
back down without me possibly. That was

1886
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:14,240
back down without me possibly. That was
 

1887
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,150
back down without me possibly. That was
the trade from here to here.

1888
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:18,160
the trade from here to here.
 

1889
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,270
the trade from here to here.
Let's see if they have follow through

1890
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:19,280
Let's see if they have follow through
 

1891
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,710
Let's see if they have follow through
for you guys. I'm out of it already.

1892
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:20,720
for you guys. I'm out of it already.
 

1893
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,510
for you guys. I'm out of it already.
Didn't sit through that.

1894
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:23,520
Didn't sit through that.
 

1895
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,109
Didn't sit through that.
All right, while you guys just figure

1896
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:25,119
All right, while you guys just figure
 

1897
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,710
All right, while you guys just figure
this out, let me just get my bottle of

1898
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:26,720
this out, let me just get my bottle of
 

1899
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:52,870
this out, let me just get my bottle of
water. I've left it next door.

1900
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:52,880

 

1901
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,990

So all those imbalances now filled

1902
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,000
So all those imbalances now filled
 

1903
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,069
So all those imbalances now filled
back into value area low for the

1904
00:42:58,069 --> 00:42:58,079
back into value area low for the
 

1905
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,990
back into value area low for the
developing week. Remember this blue

1906
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,000
developing week. Remember this blue
 

1907
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,670
developing week. Remember this blue
cluster, this blue box underneath that

1908
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:01,680
cluster, this blue box underneath that
 

1909
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,190
cluster, this blue box underneath that
is a very thick cluster that we've

1910
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:03,200
is a very thick cluster that we've
 

1911
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,270
is a very thick cluster that we've
developed this week. This is a very

1912
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:05,280
developed this week. This is a very
 

1913
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,870
developed this week. This is a very
thick cluster and previous week value

1914
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:06,880
thick cluster and previous week value
 

1915
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,670
thick cluster and previous week value
area high is here.

1916
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:11,680

 

1917
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,349

Maybe they give you follow through. I

1918
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:13,359
Maybe they give you follow through. I
 

1919
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:21,270
Maybe they give you follow through. I
might have taken that too early.

1920
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:21,280

 

1921
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,870

The volume profile right now, where is

1922
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:22,880
The volume profile right now, where is
 

1923
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,270
The volume profile right now, where is
it anchored to? Uh, today's open 9:30

1924
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:25,280
it anchored to? Uh, today's open 9:30
 

1925
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,750
it anchored to? Uh, today's open 9:30
open.

1926
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:29,760

 

1927
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,230

How can you see the imbalances with just

1928
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:32,240
How can you see the imbalances with just
 

1929
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,230
How can you see the imbalances with just
volume profile and CVD? Um, you can't

1930
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:34,240
volume profile and CVD? Um, you can't
 

1931
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,309
volume profile and CVD? Um, you can't
see them with just that. You would need

1932
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:36,319
see them with just that. You would need
 

1933
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,829
see them with just that. You would need
footprint which is what I'm using right

1934
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:39,839
footprint which is what I'm using right
 

1935
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,390
footprint which is what I'm using right
so it it's on here

1936
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:42,400
so it it's on here
 

1937
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,750
so it it's on here
but it's on the screen I'm trading

00:43:59,270 --> 00:43:59,280
get follow through under here now you
 

1955
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,390
get follow through under here now you
can see this little shelf if you get

1956
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:00,400
can see this little shelf if you get
 

1957
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,510
can see this little shelf if you get
follow through under here I'll be

00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:01,520
follow through under here I'll be
 

1959
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,270
follow through under here I'll be
watching this low to get snapped see if

1960
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:03,280
watching this low to get snapped see if
 

1961
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,790
watching this low to get snapped see if
you can run into the edge of this this

1962
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:04,800
you can run into the edge of this this
 

1963
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,990
you can run into the edge of this this
is the thick

1964
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,000
is the thick
 

1965
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,309
is the thick
level I'd say into sort of 85s and if

1966
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:08,319
level I'd say into sort of 85s and if
 

1967
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,230
level I'd say into sort of 85s and if
you get follow through under that well

1968
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:10,240
you get follow through under that well
 

1969
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,910
you get follow through under that well
you might well come all the way down to

1970
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:11,920
you might well come all the way down to
 

1971
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,150
you might well come all the way down to
previous week value.

1972
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:14,160
previous week value.
 

1973
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,670
previous week value.
Having a good bloody go at it. There you

1974
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:15,680
Having a good bloody go at it. There you
 

1975
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,829
Having a good bloody go at it. There you
go. More sellers got caught there at 10.

1976
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:17,839
go. More sellers got caught there at 10.
 

1977
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,430
go. More sellers got caught there at 10.
Just be aware of that. They came in very

1978
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:19,440
Just be aware of that. They came in very
 

1979
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,670
Just be aware of that. They came in very
heavy there at 10.

1980
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:21,680
heavy there at 10.
 

1981
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,510
heavy there at 10.
So that you have got breakout sellers at

1982
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:23,520
So that you have got breakout sellers at
 

1983
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,030
So that you have got breakout sellers at
the low of day right now. Just be aware

1984
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:25,040
the low of day right now. Just be aware
 

1985
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,390
the low of day right now. Just be aware
of that. There's some absorption on the

1986
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:26,400
of that. There's some absorption on the
 

1987
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,150
of that. There's some absorption on the
tape happening but think you're going to

1988
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:28,160
tape happening but think you're going to
 

1989
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,790
tape happening but think you're going to
get the 85sish because they keep adding

1990
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:30,800
get the 85sish because they keep adding
 

1991
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,829
get the 85sish because they keep adding
bids down there lower right now.

1992
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:37,839

 

1993
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,670

May I please know the key level it

1994
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:39,680
May I please know the key level it
 

1995
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,190
May I please know the key level it
turned from? This is a it's the current

1996
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:43,200
turned from? This is a it's the current
 

1997
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,309
turned from? This is a it's the current
week uh volume. There's a big cluster

1998
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:46,319
week uh volume. There's a big cluster
 

1999
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,230
week uh volume. There's a big cluster
down there. If you build out if you look

2000
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:48,240
down there. If you build out if you look
 

2001
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,870
down there. If you build out if you look
at the profile from the Sunday open all

2002
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:50,880
at the profile from the Sunday open all
 

2003
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,870
at the profile from the Sunday open all
the way to today, you will see a big

2004
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:52,880
the way to today, you will see a big
 

2005
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,190
the way to today, you will see a big
cluster which is this blue box. Right?

2006
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:57,200
cluster which is this blue box. Right?
 

2007
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,470
cluster which is this blue box. Right?
That's what you're thinking about. If

2008
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:58,480
That's what you're thinking about. If
 

2009
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,829
That's what you're thinking about. If
you're thinking about the sell point,

2010
00:44:59,829 --> 00:44:59,839
you're thinking about the sell point,
 

2011
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,390
you're thinking about the sell point,
well, we sold through current week point

2012
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:02,400
well, we sold through current week point
 

2013
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,150
well, we sold through current week point
of control, right? developing point of

2014
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:04,160
of control, right? developing point of
 

2015
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,870
of control, right? developing point of
control and the current uh and the

2016
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:06,880
control and the current uh and the
 

2017
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:14,150
control and the current uh and the
cluster above at 160.

2018
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:14,160

 

2019
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,670

The other thing to note, we've had many

2020
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:15,680
The other thing to note, we've had many
 

2021
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,589
The other thing to note, we've had many
many many P-shape profiles this week

2022
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:17,599
many many P-shape profiles this week
 

2023
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:33,349
many many P-shape profiles this week
without much of a rebalance.

2024
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:33,359

 

2025
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:38,150

Okay. Blue box key level.

2026
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,160
Okay. Blue box key level.
 

2027
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:44,069
Okay. Blue box key level.
Key level.

2028
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:44,079

 

2029
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,230

Q is also holding a key level. VIX

2030
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:46,240
Q is also holding a key level. VIX
 

2031
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:56,150
Q is also holding a key level. VIX
holding around a high of day right now.

2032
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:56,160

 

2033
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,750

I'd say next level for VIX to trade up

2034
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:57,760
I'd say next level for VIX to trade up
 

2035
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,550
I'd say next level for VIX to trade up
to will be those 19s all the way up to

2036
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:00,560
to will be those 19s all the way up to
 

2037
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,710
to will be those 19s all the way up to
sort of 1950s, 1958s.

2038
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:04,720

 

2039
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,030

We got to see if it rebids on the VIX

2040
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:07,040
We got to see if it rebids on the VIX
 

2041
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,950
We got to see if it rebids on the VIX
because it's it's been quite spicy this

2042
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:08,960
because it's it's been quite spicy this
 

2043
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,630
because it's it's been quite spicy this
morning. You got to expect a pull back

2044
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:10,640
morning. You got to expect a pull back
 

2045
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,150
morning. You got to expect a pull back
on the VIX and see if they rebid those

2046
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:12,160
on the VIX and see if they rebid those
 

2047
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,550
on the VIX and see if they rebid those
sort of 1750s. Right, starting to build

2048
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:14,560
sort of 1750s. Right, starting to build
 

2049
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,150
sort of 1750s. Right, starting to build
out a bit of a range here now while they

2050
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:16,160
out a bit of a range here now while they
 

2051
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,430
out a bit of a range here now while they
start to build out liquidity. Remember,

2052
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:17,440
start to build out liquidity. Remember,
 

2053
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,150
start to build out liquidity. Remember,
we've had a 250 odd point move downside

2054
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:20,160
we've had a 250 odd point move downside
 

2055
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,589
we've had a 250 odd point move downside
today. There hasn't wasn't that much of

2056
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:21,599
today. There hasn't wasn't that much of
 

2057
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,190
today. There hasn't wasn't that much of
a squeeze back up, right? We didn't even

2058
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:23,200
a squeeze back up, right? We didn't even
 

2059
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,750
a squeeze back up, right? We didn't even
hit this level here. They're building

2060
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:25,760
hit this level here. They're building
 

2061
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,430
hit this level here. They're building
out liquidity. They will want to trap

2062
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:27,440
out liquidity. They will want to trap
 

2063
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,670
out liquidity. They will want to trap
more buyers in if they are to come lower

2064
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:29,680
more buyers in if they are to come lower
 

2065
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,030
more buyers in if they are to come lower
for today. And obviously, they will want

2066
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:31,040
for today. And obviously, they will want
 

2067
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,630
for today. And obviously, they will want
to trap more shorts in if they are to

2068
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:32,640
to trap more shorts in if they are to
 

2069
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,470
to trap more shorts in if they are to
have a squeeze out higher. So, your easy

2070
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:34,480
have a squeeze out higher. So, your easy
 

2071
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,630
have a squeeze out higher. So, your easy
money trade for the day has absolutely

2072
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:36,640
money trade for the day has absolutely
 

2073
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,030
money trade for the day has absolutely
gone. It came very earlier, very, very

2074
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,040
gone. It came very earlier, very, very
 

2075
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:52,470
gone. It came very earlier, very, very
early.

2076
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:52,480

 

2077
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,150

I just are definitely not looking for a

2078
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:54,160
I just are definitely not looking for a
 

2079
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,990
I just are definitely not looking for a
buy or sell now. I just heard you say

2080
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:56,000
buy or sell now. I just heard you say
 

2081
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,630
buy or sell now. I just heard you say
that you were short and was curious. It

2082
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:58,640
that you were short and was curious. It
 

2083
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,510
that you were short and was curious. It
was during development of M1 candle. No,

2084
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:01,520
was during development of M1 candle. No,
 

2085
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,270
was during development of M1 candle. No,
it was

2086
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:03,280
it was
 

2087
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,589
it was
once these guys had got caught. Right. I

2088
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:05,599
once these guys had got caught. Right. I
 

2089
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,030
once these guys had got caught. Right. I
kept saying I'll be looking for buyers

2090
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:07,040
kept saying I'll be looking for buyers
 

2091
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,630
kept saying I'll be looking for buyers
to get caught. They got caught. I traded

2092
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:08,640
to get caught. They got caught. I traded
 

2093
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,109
to get caught. They got caught. I traded
short. That was it. It was a pullback

2094
00:47:11,109 --> 00:47:11,119
short. That was it. It was a pullback
 

2095
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,150
short. That was it. It was a pullback
because after we've had a big move down,

2096
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:14,160
because after we've had a big move down,
 

2097
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,910
because after we've had a big move down,
right, we expect a pullback. The

2098
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:15,920
right, we expect a pullback. The
 

2099
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,069
right, we expect a pullback. The
pullback came into previous days low

2100
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:18,079
pullback came into previous days low
 

2101
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,910
pullback came into previous days low
into a node. I would have preferred it

2102
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:19,920
into a node. I would have preferred it
 

2103
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,349
into a node. I would have preferred it
higher, but I didn't get it higher

2104
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:21,359
higher, but I didn't get it higher
 

2105
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:22,950
higher, but I didn't get it higher
because they got stuck here. So, I play

2106
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:22,960
because they got stuck here. So, I play
 

2107
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,710
because they got stuck here. So, I play
that short and I covered into this cuz

2108
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:24,720
that short and I covered into this cuz
 

2109
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,710
that short and I covered into this cuz
my expectation was that shorts probably

2110
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:26,720
my expectation was that shorts probably
 

2111
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,790
my expectation was that shorts probably
get stuck here.

2112
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:30,800

 

2113
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,470

I don't care about if the candle's

2114
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:32,480
I don't care about if the candle's
 

2115
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,030
I don't care about if the candle's
developing or any of that bollocks like

2116
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:35,040
developing or any of that bollocks like
 

2117
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,950
developing or any of that bollocks like
candle closure. I I'm not at a level

2118
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:36,960
candle closure. I I'm not at a level
 

2119
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,309
candle closure. I I'm not at a level
where I need to give a [\h__\h] about that.

2120
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:38,319
where I need to give a [\h__\h] about that.
 

2121
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,230
where I need to give a [\h__\h] about that.
I care about who's trapped. If they're

2122
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:40,240
I care about who's trapped. If they're
 

2123
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,829
I care about who's trapped. If they're
trapped in one second, I'm going to play

2124
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:41,839
trapped in one second, I'm going to play
 

2125
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,349
trapped in one second, I'm going to play
their pain straight away. I don't need

2126
00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:43,359
their pain straight away. I don't need
 

2127
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,710
their pain straight away. I don't need
that candle to close.

2128
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:46,720
that candle to close.
 

2129
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,390
that candle to close.
And the moment we move away from someone

2130
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:48,400
And the moment we move away from someone
 

2131
00:47:48,400 --> 00:48:01,190
And the moment we move away from someone
trapped, I'm in.

2132
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:01,200

00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:30,800
side of this range, possibly even up
 

2163
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,950
side of this range, possibly even up
here. You can see value for the day has

2164
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:32,960
here. You can see value for the day has
 

2165
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,950
here. You can see value for the day has
moved down quite significantly towards

2166
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:34,960
moved down quite significantly towards
 

2167
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,870
moved down quite significantly towards
my gray box down towards here. All

2168
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:36,880
my gray box down towards here. All
 

2169
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,630
my gray box down towards here. All
right, that is now your value. This

2170
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:38,640
right, that is now your value. This
 

2171
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,710
right, that is now your value. This
would be a big old B shape. All right.

2172
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:40,720
would be a big old B shape. All right.
 

2173
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,589
would be a big old B shape. All right.
So, this might signal the end of the

2174
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:43,599
So, this might signal the end of the
 

2175
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,270
So, this might signal the end of the
upside auction cuz we've gone from

2176
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:45,280
upside auction cuz we've gone from
 

2177
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,589
upside auction cuz we've gone from
Pshape to Bshape at the moment. Assuming

2178
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:47,599
Pshape to Bshape at the moment. Assuming
 

2179
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:58,150
Pshape to Bshape at the moment. Assuming
we close in the B-shape, that is.

2180
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:58,160

 

2181
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,710

You were all long, right? Today. Good

2182
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:00,720
You were all long, right? Today. Good
 

2183
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,549
You were all long, right? Today. Good
job. All long. I'm not sure what you

2184
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:02,559
job. All long. I'm not sure what you
 

2185
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:07,829
job. All long. I'm not sure what you
mean.

2186
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:07,839

 

2187
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,230

What determines trap signs?

2188
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:10,240
What determines trap signs?
 

2189
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,670
What determines trap signs?
Offside delta.

2190
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:13,680
Offside delta.
 

2191
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,230
Offside delta.
Offside delta at key levels. Just want

2192
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:16,240
Offside delta at key levels. Just want
 

2193
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,750
Offside delta at key levels. Just want
to just see if they're adding bids lower

2194
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:17,760
to just see if they're adding bids lower
 

2195
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,470
to just see if they're adding bids lower
right now. Yeah, 85 still there. 70

2196
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:20,480
right now. Yeah, 85 still there. 70
 

2197
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,109
right now. Yeah, 85 still there. 70
there. Thick level at 50. Thick level at

2198
00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:23,119
there. Thick level at 50. Thick level at
 

2199
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,349
there. Thick level at 50. Thick level at
40. They're bidding so much lower here.

2200
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:25,359
40. They're bidding so much lower here.
 

2201
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,030
40. They're bidding so much lower here.
And there's a lot more weakness possibly

2202
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:27,040
And there's a lot more weakness possibly
 

2203
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,829
And there's a lot more weakness possibly
to come in this market now.

2204
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:29,839
to come in this market now.
 

2205
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:32,630
to come in this market now.
Oh, that might have been a really poor

2206
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:32,640
Oh, that might have been a really poor
 

2207
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,390
Oh, that might have been a really poor
cover point here.

2208
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:36,400

 

2209
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,390

Kind of crazy, isn't it? you get 250

2210
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:38,400
Kind of crazy, isn't it? you get 250
 

2211
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,030
Kind of crazy, isn't it? you get 250
points and you're like, "Oh, think I

2212
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,040
points and you're like, "Oh, think I
 

2213
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:48,950
points and you're like, "Oh, think I
could have get 400."

2214
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:48,960

 

2215
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,069

Okay, 20-day coming up for the ESP

2216
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:54,079

 

2217
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,510

spy not too far away. It would have to

2218
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:55,520
spy not too far away. It would have to
 

2219
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:00,230
spy not too far away. It would have to
trade 90s for that 20-day.

2220
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:00,240

 

2221
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,670

Next level's down here, previous week

2222
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:01,680
Next level's down here, previous week
 

2223
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,430
Next level's down here, previous week
value area high. So, this node here is

2224
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:03,440
value area high. So, this node here is
 

2225
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,030
value area high. So, this node here is
pretty big. If we lose that, you'll kind

2226
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:05,040
pretty big. If we lose that, you'll kind
 

2227
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,470
pretty big. If we lose that, you'll kind
of come straight down into here. And

2228
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:06,480
of come straight down into here. And
 

2229
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,470
of come straight down into here. And
this is the weekly close, is it? Are you

2230
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:08,480
this is the weekly close, is it? Are you
 

2231
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,630
this is the weekly close, is it? Are you
sure?

2232
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:10,640
sure?
 

2233
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,150
sure?
Previous week close. Yeah. So that big

2234
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:12,160
Previous week close. Yeah. So that big
 

2235
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,750
Previous week close. Yeah. So that big
gap fill into the previous week. That

2236
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:13,760
gap fill into the previous week. That
 

2237
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,790
gap fill into the previous week. That
would be giving back the whole week.

2238
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:16,800
would be giving back the whole week.
 

2239
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,510
would be giving back the whole week.
It's very possible.

2240
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:21,520

 

2241
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,030

Big sell there. We haven't had a big day

2242
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:23,040
Big sell there. We haven't had a big day
 

2243
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:32,069
Big sell there. We haven't had a big day
like this for a while. It's nice.

2244
00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:32,079

 

2245
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,069

Maybe we have another leg up. Um well,

2246
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:34,079
Maybe we have another leg up. Um well,
 

2247
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,030
Maybe we have another leg up. Um well,
we will have to see. Um, we are pulling

2248
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:37,040
we will have to see. Um, we are pulling
 

2249
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,870
we will have to see. Um, we are pulling
back to potential RBS levels, but it

2250
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:38,880
back to potential RBS levels, but it
 

2251
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,630
back to potential RBS levels, but it
really going to depend. Can it can it

2252
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:40,640
really going to depend. Can it can it
 

2253
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,750
really going to depend. Can it can it
hold, you know, 830s?

2254
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:43,760
hold, you know, 830s?
 

2255
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,309
hold, you know, 830s?
If it can't hold 830s, then I'd expect

2256
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:46,319
If it can't hold 830s, then I'd expect
 

2257
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,549
If it can't hold 830s, then I'd expect
we will trade 700s today. And it will

2258
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:48,559
we will trade 700s today. And it will
 

2259
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,950
we will trade 700s today. And it will
need to hold that on a dip because if it

2260
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:50,960
need to hold that on a dip because if it
 

2261
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,549
need to hold that on a dip because if it
does not hold that on a dip, like I've

2262
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:52,559
does not hold that on a dip, like I've
 

2263
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,790
does not hold that on a dip, like I've
talked about numerous times, if this

2264
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:54,800
talked about numerous times, if this
 

2265
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,790
talked about numerous times, if this
becomes a giant failed breakout this

2266
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:56,800
becomes a giant failed breakout this
 

2267
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,510
becomes a giant failed breakout this
week, then we have a lot of pain coming

2268
00:50:59,510 --> 00:50:59,520
week, then we have a lot of pain coming
 

2269
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,390
week, then we have a lot of pain coming
in for this market.

2270
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:02,400
in for this market.
 

2271
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,630
in for this market.
So if we don't hold this, we will trade

2272
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:04,640
So if we don't hold this, we will trade
 

2273
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,710
So if we don't hold this, we will trade
700s.

2274
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:06,720
700s.
 

2275
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,230
700s.
This would be another cover point here

2276
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:08,240
This would be another cover point here
 

2277
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:16,470
This would be another cover point here
for most people.

2278
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:16,480

 

2279
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,270

Nice, Greg. Glad it helped.

2280
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:19,280
Nice, Greg. Glad it helped.
 

2281
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:29,270
Nice, Greg. Glad it helped.
Yeah, flow still very bearish.

2282
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:29,280

 

2283
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,950

Big sellers coming in down here. Just

2284
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:30,960
Big sellers coming in down here. Just
 

2285
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,390
Big sellers coming in down here. Just
watch this delta here. Still follow

2286
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:32,400
watch this delta here. Still follow
 

2287
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,829
watch this delta here. Still follow
through. They're looking for value area

2288
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:33,839
through. They're looking for value area
 

2289
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,150
through. They're looking for value area
high. Now, this is previous week high.

2290
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:36,160
high. Now, this is previous week high.
 

2291
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,670
high. Now, this is previous week high.
Previous week value area high was your

2292
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:37,680
Previous week value area high was your
 

2293
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,230
Previous week value area high was your
next color point into 30. Kicking myself

2294
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:40,240
next color point into 30. Kicking myself
 

2295
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,430
next color point into 30. Kicking myself
now that I'm not in this. Here we go.

2296
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:41,440
now that I'm not in this. Here we go.
 

2297
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,630
now that I'm not in this. Here we go.
Very big follow through. Probably all

2298
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:42,640
Very big follow through. Probably all
 

2299
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,309
Very big follow through. Probably all
the way down into here now. So, we're

2300
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:44,319
the way down into here now. So, we're
 

2301
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:47,030
the way down into here now. So, we're
thin down into this.

2302
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:47,040
thin down into this.
 

2303
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:55,750
thin down into this.
Oh my days. Oh my days.

2304
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:55,760

 

2305
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,990

Going to kick myself. Can tell already

2306
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:58,000
Going to kick myself. Can tell already
 

2307
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,630
Going to kick myself. Can tell already
tell I'm going to be kicking myself.

2308
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:02,640

 

2309
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,390

Oh, this short that we took here could

2310
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:04,400
Oh, this short that we took here could
 

2311
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,270
Oh, this short that we took here could
have held it through. Never mind. Never

2312
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:07,280
have held it through. Never mind. Never
 

2313
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,349
have held it through. Never mind. Never
mind.

2314
00:52:11,349 --> 00:52:11,359

 

2315
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,750

Never mind. Right, back to previous week

2316
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:13,760
Never mind. Right, back to previous week
 

2317
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,670
Never mind. Right, back to previous week
value area high. See if they defend this

2318
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:15,680

2381
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,670

Heavy heavy heavy tape down here is my

Cluster now built at the 800. So 800

2386
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:11,200
Cluster now built at the 800. So 800
 

2387
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,910
Cluster now built at the 800. So 800
will probably be be 800 and 815 will be

2388
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:13,920
will probably be be 800 and 815 will be
 

2389
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,230
will probably be be 800 and 815 will be
a squeeze trigger higher

2390
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:16,240
a squeeze trigger higher
 

2391
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,230
a squeeze trigger higher
um just for the counter trend little

2392
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:18,240
um just for the counter trend little
 

2393
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,829
um just for the counter trend little
push out back and then they will

2394
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:19,839
push out back and then they will
 

2395
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,270
push out back and then they will
probably try and resell it down to the

2396
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:21,280
probably try and resell it down to the
 

2397
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,430
probably try and resell it down to the
lows. Just so you know this these nodes

2398
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:23,440
lows. Just so you know this these nodes
 

2399
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,349
lows. Just so you know this these nodes
here can be squeeze trigger highs. I

2400
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:25,359
here can be squeeze trigger highs. I
 

2401
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:26,710
here can be squeeze trigger highs. I
expect them to try and defend here

2402
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:26,720
expect them to try and defend here
 

2403
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,790
expect them to try and defend here

definitely certainly to defend up here.
But if you're in this short just make

2406
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:30,640
But if you're in this short just make
 

2407
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,549
But if you're in this short just make
sure you know you don't want to be

00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,069
sure you know you don't want to be
adding down here. You want to be moving

2410
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:34,079
adding down here. You want to be moving
 

2411
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,510
adding down here. You want to be moving
your stop to protect some of this

your stop to protect some of this
 

2413
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,030
your stop to protect some of this
looking for this fade paying yourself

2414
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:37,040
looking for this fade paying yourself
 

2415
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,430
looking for this fade paying yourself
into some of these levels.

2416
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:39,440
into some of these levels.
 

2417
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,990
into some of these levels.
I would not be adding short now at these

2418
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:42,000
I would not be adding short now at these
 

2419
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,510
I would not be adding short now at these
lows. You're getting very close to your

2420
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:43,520
lows. You're getting very close to your
 

2421
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,349
lows. You're getting very close to your
cover points.

2422
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:45,359
cover points.
 

2423
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,109

2429
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,150
underneath. And I would imagine they
will want to trim down there.

2430
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:56,160

 

2431
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,670

course. You will have to do the course
 

2437
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,349
course. You will have to do the course
volume profile and order flow course. So

2438
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:05,359
volume profile and order flow course. So
 

2439
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:06,870
volume profile and order flow course. So
I would advise that you do stuff for

2440

profile and order flow course that you
understand structure how the market

2448
00:55:14,309 --> 00:55:14,319

I volume node at 700. Uh yeah, exactly.

2454
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:21,760
I volume node at 700. Uh yeah, exactly.
 

2455
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:27,109
I volume node at 700. Uh yeah, exactly.
So it's, you know, six 696 basically is

2456
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:27,119
So it's, you know, six 696 basically is
 

2457
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,109
So it's, you know, six 696 basically is
previous week's point of control and

2458
00:55:29,109 --> 00:55:29,119
previous week's point of control and
 

2459
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,270
previous week's point of control and
it's the weeks before that value area

2460
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:31,280
it's the weeks before that value area
 

2461
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,750
it's the weeks before that value area
low. All right, so it's multiple things

2462
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:33,760
low. All right, so it's multiple things
 

2463
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,430
low. All right, so it's multiple things
down there.

2464
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:37,440

 

2465
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:54,150

Multiple multiple things down there.

2466
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:54,160

 

2467
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,390

Back to this node at 800 that we just

2468
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:56,400
Back to this node at 800 that we just
 

2469
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,109
Back to this node at 800 that we just
talked about.

2470
00:55:59,109 --> 00:55:59,119
talked about.
 

2471
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:01,510
talked about.
This is your key level 800 and 815. If

2472
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:01,520
This is your key level 800 and 815. If
 

2473
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,630
This is your key level 800 and 815. If
they get through that, you will see

2474
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:02,640
they get through that, you will see
 

2475
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,069
they get through that, you will see
squeeze relief.

2476
00:56:06,069 --> 00:56:06,079

 

2477
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,750

back towards this 800 like we just

2478
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:07,760
back towards this 800 like we just
 

2479
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,349
back towards this 800 like we just
talked about. If you get through that in

2480
00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:09,359
talked about. If you get through that in
 

2481
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,430
talked about. If you get through that in
8:15, you might get squeeze relief up to

2482
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:11,440
8:15, you might get squeeze relief up to
 

2483
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,190
8:15, you might get squeeze relief up to
value area low. The big sellers came in

2484
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:13,200
value area low. The big sellers came in
 

2485
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,030
value area low. The big sellers came in
at 850. Just so you know that the big

2486
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:15,040
at 850. Just so you know that the big
 

2487
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,190
at 850. Just so you know that the big
sellers, it came in at way up at 850. We

2488
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:17,200
sellers, it came in at way up at 850. We
 

2489
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,549
sellers, it came in at way up at 850. We
have imbalances all the way up there.

2490
00:56:18,549 --> 00:56:18,559
have imbalances all the way up there.
 

2491
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:20,789
have imbalances all the way up there.
There we goes is the squeeze relief. So

2492
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:20,799
There we goes is the squeeze relief. So
 

2493
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,270
There we goes is the squeeze relief. So
28 800 to 8:15. Now if they get through

2494
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:23,280
28 800 to 8:15. Now if they get through
 

2495
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,309
28 800 to 8:15. Now if they get through
8:15, we can viably see 850 here for

2496
00:56:26,309 --> 00:56:26,319
8:15, we can viably see 850 here for
 

2497
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:27,670
8:15, we can viably see 850 here for
squeeze relief. So if you were short,

2498
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:27,680
squeeze relief. So if you were short,
 

2499
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,950
squeeze relief. So if you were short,
you probably don't want to sit through

2500
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:28,960
you probably don't want to sit through
 

2501
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,549
you probably don't want to sit through
what might be potentially coming here if

2502
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:30,559
what might be potentially coming here if
 

2503
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:37,990
what might be potentially coming here if
we get through the 15s.

2504
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:38,000

 

2505
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,910

Oh, but how did Alex know? Because I'm

2506
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:39,920
Oh, but how did Alex know? Because I'm
 

2507
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,910
Oh, but how did Alex know? Because I'm
reading the order flow. I understand

2508
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:41,920
reading the order flow. I understand
 

2509
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,710
reading the order flow. I understand
where we're moving and how. Right into

2510
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:44,720
where we're moving and how. Right into
 

2511
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,670
where we're moving and how. Right into
value area low. This area here is the

2512
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:47,680
value area low. This area here is the
 

2513
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,230
value area low. This area here is the
area sellers must defend. Now, they fail

2514
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:50,240
area sellers must defend. Now, they fail
 

2515
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,549
area sellers must defend. Now, they fail
to defend this. This is the big relief.

2516
00:56:52,549 --> 00:56:52,559
to defend this. This is the big relief.
 

2517
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,230
to defend this. This is the big relief.
If sellers defend this, they will have

2518
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:54,240
If sellers defend this, they will have
 

2519
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,109
If sellers defend this, they will have
one more go at coming back down. That's

2520
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:57,119
one more go at coming back down. That's
 

2521
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,630
one more go at coming back down. That's
why I saying you do not want to be short

2522
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:58,640
why I saying you do not want to be short
 

2523
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:16,069
why I saying you do not want to be short
down here.

2524
00:57:16,069 --> 00:57:16,079

 

2525
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:17,349

I'll be honest with you, I didn't really

2526
00:57:17,349 --> 00:57:17,359
I'll be honest with you, I didn't really
 

2527
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,829
I'll be honest with you, I didn't really
have any good trading mentors.

2528
00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:19,839
have any good trading mentors.
 

2529
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,390
have any good trading mentors.
I just didn't. My trading mentors

2530
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:22,400
I just didn't. My trading mentors
 

2531
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,309
I just didn't. My trading mentors
probably taught me 90% of what I learned

2532
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:24,319
probably taught me 90% of what I learned
 

2533
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:28,150
probably taught me 90% of what I learned
was the worst thing to learn.

2534
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:28,160
was the worst thing to learn.
 

2535
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,309
was the worst thing to learn.
Okay, so defending 15s and 20s into that

2536
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:30,319
Okay, so defending 15s and 20s into that
 

2537
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:35,829
Okay, so defending 15s and 20s into that
imbalance back down to the 800s

2538
00:57:35,829 --> 00:57:35,839

 

2539
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,589

buy side imbalance here at 80. I would

2540
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:37,599
buy side imbalance here at 80. I would
 

2541
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,750
buy side imbalance here at 80. I would
say a big buy stepped in at 70 and we do

2542
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:39,760
say a big buy stepped in at 70 and we do
 

2543
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,589
say a big buy stepped in at 70 and we do
have a decent auction at that low. It's

2544
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:41,599
have a decent auction at that low. It's
 

2545
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,990
have a decent auction at that low. It's
not huge access. We haven't quite closed

2546
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:44,000
not huge access. We haven't quite closed
 

2547
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,950
not huge access. We haven't quite closed
the gap. Tell you what, ES did ES did

2548
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:46,960
the gap. Tell you what, ES did ES did
 

2549
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,990
the gap. Tell you what, ES did ES did
close its gap. All right, so ES did tag.

2550
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:50,000
close its gap. All right, so ES did tag.
 

2551
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,510
close its gap. All right, so ES did tag.
We might have missed it by a tick. Let's

2552
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:51,520
We might have missed it by a tick. Let's
 

2553
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,069
We might have missed it by a tick. Let's
have a look. Previous week close on ES

2554
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:54,079
have a look. Previous week close on ES
 

2555
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:58,470
have a look. Previous week close on ES
was 94575. We hit 94 Oh, we didn't close

2556
00:57:58,470 --> 00:57:58,480
was 94575. We hit 94 Oh, we didn't close
 

2557
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,950
was 94575. We hit 94 Oh, we didn't close
it. We hit 947.

2558
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:00,960
it. We hit 947.
 

2559
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:11,510
it. We hit 947.
So, we're a couple points short.

2560
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:11,520

 

2561
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,710

Still think they want to try and get

2562
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:12,720
Still think they want to try and get
 

2563
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:37,829
Still think they want to try and get
into it, but we will see.

2564
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:37,839

 

2565
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,789

starting to get tight here on the tape.

2566
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:40,799
starting to get tight here on the tape.
 

2567
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,950
starting to get tight here on the tape.
10 to 85. Starting to get tight. It's

2568
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:42,960
10 to 85. Starting to get tight. It's
 

2569
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,710
10 to 85. Starting to get tight. It's
probably one way or another is going to

2570
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:44,720
probably one way or another is going to
 

2571
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,789
probably one way or another is going to
get caught. Just watching this liquidity

2572
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:46,799
get caught. Just watching this liquidity
 

2573
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,630
get caught. Just watching this liquidity
build out very very tight on the tape

2574
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:48,640
build out very very tight on the tape
 

2575
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,549
build out very very tight on the tape
here.

2576
00:58:50,549 --> 00:58:50,559
here.
 

2577
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,870
here.
Still think there's a flush in this just

2578
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:52,880
Still think there's a flush in this just
 

2579
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,470
Still think there's a flush in this just
to come and run everyone out, but we

2580
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:54,480
to come and run everyone out, but we
 

2581
00:58:54,480 --> 00:59:03,990
to come and run everyone out, but we
will see

2582
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:04,000

 

2583
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,750

what what can I say about the psychology

2584
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:05,760
what what can I say about the psychology
 

2585
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,710
what what can I say about the psychology
of wanting to go long from here?

2586
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:08,720
of wanting to go long from here?
 

2587
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,150
of wanting to go long from here?
Why do people feel that urge? Because

2588
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:10,160
Why do people feel that urge? Because
 

2589
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,670
Why do people feel that urge? Because
they think it's gone down so far, it

2590
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:11,680
they think it's gone down so far, it
 

2591
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,109
they think it's gone down so far, it
can't go down any further. So, your

2592
00:59:13,109 --> 00:59:13,119
can't go down any further. So, your
 

2593
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,870
can't go down any further. So, your
natural instinct is to try and buy it

2594
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:14,880
natural instinct is to try and buy it
 

2595
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,870
natural instinct is to try and buy it
back up.

2596
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:16,880
back up.
 

2597
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,549
back up.
or a lot of people's natural instinct is

2598
00:59:18,549 --> 00:59:18,559
or a lot of people's natural instinct is
 

2599
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:22,470
or a lot of people's natural instinct is
to try and buy it back up.

2600
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:22,480

 

2601
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,710

Be very careful

2602
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:24,720
Be very careful
 

2603
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,390
Be very careful
if they get acceptance through here of

2604
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:26,400
if they get acceptance through here of
 

2605
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:36,230
if they get acceptance through here of
this back up into that

2606
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:36,240

 

2607
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,230

and we go back to the 15s again. We can

2608
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:38,240
and we go back to the 15s again. We can
 

2609
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,990
and we go back to the 15s again. We can
see this rotation to the 15s previous

2610
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:40,000
see this rotation to the 15s previous
 

2611
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,990
see this rotation to the 15s previous
week value area higher here. They go

2612
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:42,000
week value area higher here. They go
 

2613
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,510
week value area higher here. They go
through this, they will get a relief

2614
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:43,520
through this, they will get a relief
 

2615
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,670
through this, they will get a relief
because this is very very thin. Sellers

2616
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:45,680
because this is very very thin. Sellers
 

2617
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,710
because this is very very thin. Sellers
will want to defend this level here.

2618
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:48,720
will want to defend this level here.
 

2619
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,069
will want to defend this level here.
They will not want this going through

2620
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:50,079
They will not want this going through
 

2621
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,990
They will not want this going through
here because they will get run out

2622
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:52,000
here because they will get run out
 

2623
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,589
here because they will get run out
fairly aggressively potentially up

2624
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:53,599
fairly aggressively potentially up
 

2625
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,430
fairly aggressively potentially up
towards 900. So they will attempt to

2626
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:55,440
towards 900. So they will attempt to
 

2627
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:10,069
towards 900. So they will attempt to
defend this.

2628
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:10,079

 

2629
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,390

Nice.

2630
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:12,400
Nice.
 

2631
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:23,750
Nice.
How much more juice has it got?

2632
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:23,760

 

2633
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,390

Good defender 15s or 20s, but there or

2634
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:26,400
Good defender 15s or 20s, but there or
 

2635
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,150
Good defender 15s or 20s, but there or
thereabouts. This edge, you see this

2636
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:28,160
thereabouts. This edge, you see this
 

2637
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,150
thereabouts. This edge, you see this
edge right here. We're building out

2638
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:30,160
edge right here. We're building out
 

2639
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,829
edge right here. We're building out
profile now. We're building out volume

2640
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:33,839
profile now. We're building out volume
 

2641
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:37,510
profile now. We're building out volume
into here.

2642
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:37,520

 

2643
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,030

It's a little messy how they've done it

2644
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:39,040
It's a little messy how they've done it
 

2645
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,950
It's a little messy how they've done it
twice, but that's what they've done,

2646
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:40,960
twice, but that's what they've done,
 

2647
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,630
twice, but that's what they've done,
right? Sentiment is still lower until

2648
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:42,640
right? Sentiment is still lower until
 

2649
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,309
right? Sentiment is still lower until
they can get above that. This is still

2650
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:44,319
they can get above that. This is still
 

2651
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:48,549
they can get above that. This is still
the target.

2652
01:00:48,549 --> 01:00:48,559

 

2653
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,549

Big buyer came in at 70 early this

2654
01:00:50,549 --> 01:00:50,559
Big buyer came in at 70 early this
 

2655
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,390
Big buyer came in at 70 early this
earlier today. All right, that's where

2656
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:52,400
earlier today. All right, that's where
 

2657
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,829
earlier today. All right, that's where
the huge buyer came in at time was this

2658
01:00:55,829 --> 01:00:55,839
the huge buyer came in at time was this
 

2659
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:58,950
the huge buyer came in at time was this
10:04.

2660
01:00:58,950 --> 01:00:58,960

 

2661
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,109

They are still adding liquidity lower.

2662
01:01:01,109 --> 01:01:01,119
They are still adding liquidity lower.
 

2663
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:02,789
They are still adding liquidity lower.
We still haven't quite filled that gap.

2664
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:02,799
We still haven't quite filled that gap.
 

2665
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:07,030
We still haven't quite filled that gap.
So, it's almost there.

2666
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:07,040

 

2667
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,069

We go. They're going to try and get
 

2669
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,750
We go. They're going to try and get
through these 70s. 70 is the key level.

2670
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:11,760
through these 70s. 70 is the key level.
 

2671
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,430
through these 70s. 70 is the key level.
It's where the big buyer came in. Just

2672
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:13,440
It's where the big buyer came in. Just
 

2673
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,789
It's where the big buyer came in. Just
want to see if he turns up again.

2674
01:01:14,789 --> 01:01:14,799
want to see if he turns up again.
 

2675
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:15,990
want to see if he turns up again.
There's lots of bids here. We're going

2676
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:16,000
There's lots of bids here. We're going

70s through him. Now they're adding a

2680
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:20,240
70s through him. Now they're adding a
 

2681
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,549
70s through him. Now they're adding a

2682
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:22,559
45. So, we're going to snap it. We
 

2683
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,069
45. So, we're going to snap it. We
should trade low of day here and get to

2685

should trade low of day here and get to
previous week close.

2686
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:35,119

 

2687
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:36,710

01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:54,799
Right. We were in liquidity building
 

2709
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:57,190
Right. We were in liquidity building
phase before the market opened. Once we

phase before the market opened. Once we
 

2711
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,950
phase before the market opened. Once we
let go of that liquidity, it was good

01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:05,760
We're at the 20-day on the QQQ, which
 

2719
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,270
We're at the 20-day on the QQQ, which
keeps finding a bid. We are under the

2725
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:14,789
at the 20-day on the on the SPY. We're
not the 20-day on a QQQ and ES keeps

2726
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:14,799
not the 20-day on a QQQ and ES keeps
 

2727
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:15,990
not the 20-day on a QQQ and ES keeps
finding a bid right in front of that

2728
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:16,000
finding a bid right in front of that
 

2729
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,390
finding a bid right in front of that
previous week close. This gray line here

2730
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:18,400
previous week close. This gray line here
 

2731
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,069
previous week close. This gray line here
be nice to see that filled, but it's not

2732
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:20,079
be nice to see that filled, but it's not
 

2733
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:21,510
be nice to see that filled, but it's not
filling it right now. So, back to the

2734
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:21,520
filling it right now. So, back to the
 

2735
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,390
filling it right now. So, back to the
top side again. And relief can happen

2736
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:24,400
top side again. And relief can happen
 

2737
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,230
top side again. And relief can happen
over here like we talked about if they

2738
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:26,240
over here like we talked about if they
 

2739
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,309
over here like we talked about if they
can bully their way through back through

2740
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:28,319
can bully their way through back through
 

2741
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:31,750
can bully their way through back through
previous week value area high.

2742
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:31,760
previous week value area high.
 

2743
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,589
previous week value area high.
So, they will need to try and bid over

2744
01:02:33,589 --> 01:02:33,599
So, they will need to try and bid over
 

2745
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,670
So, they will need to try and bid over
this. And if they can't, then all we're

2746
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:35,680
this. And if they can't, then all we're
 

2747
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,109
this. And if they can't, then all we're
saying is we're in the previous week's

2748
01:02:37,109 --> 01:02:37,119
saying is we're in the previous week's
 

2749
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,349
saying is we're in the previous week's
value. And that rotation can take place

2750
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:39,359
value. And that rotation can take place
 

2751
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:49,829
value. And that rotation can take place
in previous week's value

2752
01:02:49,829 --> 01:02:49,839

 

2753
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:51,510

2785
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,390
everyone out, and then see if it traps.
Don't really want it to do the same as

yesterday and not flush everyone out.
 

2789
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,750

I'd want to see everyone flushed out.
 

2791

2793
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,230

What for a long rotation? If I was going

2794
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:46,240
What for a long rotation? If I was going
 

2795
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,150
What for a long rotation? If I was going
to look for a long rotation, I would

2796
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:48,160
to look for a long rotation, I would
 

2797
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,150
to look for a long rotation, I would
want to see this happen first, wash

2798
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:50,160
want to see this happen first, wash
 

2799
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,349
want to see this happen first, wash
these guys out, then reclaim this, and

2800
01:03:53,349 --> 01:03:53,359
these guys out, then reclaim this, and
 

2801
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:56,630
these guys out, then reclaim this, and
then offer that rotation back up.

2802
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:56,640
then offer that rotation back up.
 

2803
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,390
then offer that rotation back up.
Not until then. Very much like

yesterday. Like if if it does this and
 

2807
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:02,950
yesterday. Like if if it does this and
just does this, I'm not going to touch

2808
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:02,960
just does this, I'm not going to touch

01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:50,549
bleeding under that. I will show you
what I'm looking at if we're going to do

2942
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:50,559
what I'm looking at if we're going to do
 

2943
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:52,789
what I'm looking at if we're going to do
that. I don't think we will do that but

2944
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:52,799
that. I don't think we will do that but
 

2945
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,630
that. I don't think we will do that but
can't rule it out. If we are going to

2946
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:54,640
can't rule it out. If we are going to
 

2947
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,510
can't rule it out. If we are going to
bleed underneath this node, right, this

2948
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:57,520
bleed underneath this node, right, this
 

2949
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,630
bleed underneath this node, right, this
is quite thick. So you got to be

2950
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:58,640
is quite thick. So you got to be
 

2951
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,950
is quite thick. So you got to be
somewhat careful. Then this opens up,

2952
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:00,960
somewhat careful. Then this opens up,
 

2953
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,109
somewhat careful. Then this opens up,
right? So here bid bid bid. We think

2954
01:07:03,109 --> 01:07:03,119
right? So here bid bid bid. We think
 

2955
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,270
right? So here bid bid bid. We think
about this trend line. Bid bid bid bid

2956
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:05,280
about this trend line. Bid bid bid bid
 

2957
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,190
about this trend line. Bid bid bid bid
bid bid bid bid bid bid bid bid bid bid

2958
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:07,200
bid bid bid bid bid bid bid bid bid bid
 

2959
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,029
bid bid bid bid bid bid bid bid bid bid
bid bid bid. Failed to move higher

2960
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:09,039
bid bid bid. Failed to move higher
 

2961
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:10,549
bid bid bid. Failed to move higher
failed to move higher. Two failed

2962
01:07:10,549 --> 01:07:10,559
failed to move higher. Two failed
 

2963
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,950
failed to move higher. Two failed
breakouts. Once we lose that trap buys

2964
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:12,960
breakouts. Once we lose that trap buys
 

2965
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,270
breakouts. Once we lose that trap buys
and snap, right? And what is the

2966
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:15,280
and snap, right? And what is the
 

2967
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,950
and snap, right? And what is the
breakout point? It's here, right? That

2968
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:16,960
breakout point? It's here, right? That
 

2969
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,950
breakout point? It's here, right? That
was where we broke out from. This is the

2970
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:18,960
was where we broke out from. This is the
 

2971
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,029
was where we broke out from. This is the
pull back in. We can probably bid up

2972
01:07:21,029 --> 01:07:21,039
pull back in. We can probably bid up
 

2973
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:24,470
pull back in. We can probably bid up
from here back towards 26,000 now either

2974
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:24,480
from here back towards 26,000 now either
 

2975
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,230
from here back towards 26,000 now either
today or tomorrow. All right, even if

2976
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:26,240
today or tomorrow. All right, even if
 

2977
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,990
today or tomorrow. All right, even if
it's going to be resold, we can probably

2978
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:28,000
it's going to be resold, we can probably
 

2979
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,230
it's going to be resold, we can probably
see something like that or we can see

2980
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:30,240
see something like that or we can see
 

2981
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,829
see something like that or we can see
something like this, right? But I would

2982
01:07:31,829 --> 01:07:31,839
something like this, right? But I would
 

2983
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,750
something like this, right? But I would
imagine somewhere around here they will

2984
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:33,760
imagine somewhere around here they will
 

2985
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,829
imagine somewhere around here they will
try and bid back up to this node which

2986
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:35,839
try and bid back up to this node which
 

2987
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:37,430
try and bid back up to this node which
is why I don't want to be short anymore

2988
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:37,440
is why I don't want to be short anymore
 

2989
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,829
is why I don't want to be short anymore
now. That is it done with the shorts.

2990
01:07:39,829 --> 01:07:39,839
now. That is it done with the shorts.
 

2991
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:41,750
now. That is it done with the shorts.
Hopefully that makes sense to you all.

2992
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:41,760
Hopefully that makes sense to you all.
 

2993
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,190
Hopefully that makes sense to you all.
We talk about those higher time frame.

2994
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:43,200
We talk about those higher time frame.
 

2995
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,109
We talk about those higher time frame.
What is the pullback leg? Where does it

2996
01:07:45,109 --> 01:07:45,119
What is the pullback leg? Where does it
 

2997
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,349
What is the pullback leg? Where does it
go to? How do we position oursel for the

2998
01:07:47,349 --> 01:07:47,359
go to? How do we position oursel for the
 

2999
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:58,789
go to? How do we position oursel for the
next move?

3000
01:07:58,789 --> 01:07:58,799

 

3001
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:02,470

Now I'm pro projecting along. Are you

3002
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:02,480
Now I'm pro projecting along. Are you
 

3003
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,589
Now I'm pro projecting along. Are you
saying um I'm imagining that it might

3004
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:05,599
saying um I'm imagining that it might
 

3005
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,029
saying um I'm imagining that it might
take some time to develop. It doesn't

3006
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:07,039
take some time to develop. It doesn't
 

3007
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,349
take some time to develop. It doesn't
happen have to happen to develop today,

3008
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:09,359
happen have to happen to develop today,
 

3009
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:12,470
happen have to happen to develop today,
but I would imagine somewhere in here.

3010
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:12,480
but I would imagine somewhere in here.
 

3011
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,990
but I would imagine somewhere in here.
All right. Doesn't happen have to happen

3012
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:14,000
All right. Doesn't happen have to happen
 

3013
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,910
All right. Doesn't happen have to happen
today. They might want to dip below and

3014
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:15,920
today. They might want to dip below and
 

3015
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,309
today. They might want to dip below and
come and do this tomorrow. But I imagine

3016
01:08:18,309 --> 01:08:18,319
come and do this tomorrow. But I imagine
 

3017
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,789
come and do this tomorrow. But I imagine
there's a retest back towards here.

3018
01:08:20,789 --> 01:08:20,799
there's a retest back towards here.
 

3019
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:22,309
there's a retest back towards here.
That's going to happen at some point.

3020
01:08:22,309 --> 01:08:22,319
That's going to happen at some point.
 

3021
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:24,789
That's going to happen at some point.
Where's 26,000? Towards here. All right.

3022
01:08:24,789 --> 01:08:24,799
Where's 26,000? Towards here. All right.
 

3023
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,550
Where's 26,000? Towards here. All right.
So, I'd imagine this happens. It doesn't

3024
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:26,560
So, I'd imagine this happens. It doesn't
 

3025
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,269
So, I'd imagine this happens. It doesn't
have to happen today. Right. Unless

3026
01:08:29,269 --> 01:08:29,279
have to happen today. Right. Unless
 

3027
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,030
have to happen today. Right. Unless
they're going to do this and really come

3028
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:31,040
they're going to do this and really come
 

3029
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,590
they're going to do this and really come
down into here, which I would be a very

3030
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:33,600
down into here, which I would be a very
 

3031
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,990
down into here, which I would be a very
big ask. I would imagine there is a

3032
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:36,000
big ask. I would imagine there is a
 

3033
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,910
big ask. I would imagine there is a
relief leg back up higher now. And then

3034
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:37,920
relief leg back up higher now. And then
 

3035
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,510
relief leg back up higher now. And then
once it gets up there, if it goes

3036
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:39,520
once it gets up there, if it goes
 

3037
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,189
once it gets up there, if it goes
sideways, we build out liquidity to go

3038
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:41,199
sideways, we build out liquidity to go
 

3039
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:42,870
sideways, we build out liquidity to go
high. If it comes up and they reject it

3040
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:42,880
high. If it comes up and they reject it
 

3041
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,870
high. If it comes up and they reject it
and trap buyers, then it will be the

3042
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:44,880
and trap buyers, then it will be the
 

3043
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,510
and trap buyers, then it will be the
lower high to go lower.

3044
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:47,520
lower high to go lower.
 

3045
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,870
lower high to go lower.
So try and make this make sense for you.

3046
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:50,880
So try and make this make sense for you.
 

3047
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,870
So try and make this make sense for you.
We don't know. All right. If this has

3048
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:52,880
We don't know. All right. If this has
 

3049
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,550
We don't know. All right. If this has
been the trend, let's just think about

3050
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:54,560
been the trend, let's just think about
 

3051
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,709
been the trend, let's just think about
this is the trend since last week. Boxed

3052
01:08:56,709 --> 01:08:56,719
this is the trend since last week. Boxed
 

3053
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:01,189
this is the trend since last week. Boxed
in breakout retest up up up.

3054
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:01,199
in breakout retest up up up.
 

3055
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:04,870
in breakout retest up up up.
Here's the trap. Fail to break higher.

3056
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:04,880
Here's the trap. Fail to break higher.
 

3057
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,189
Here's the trap. Fail to break higher.
Lose this. That's the snap. Right. This

3058
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:07,199
Lose this. That's the snap. Right. This
 

3059
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,789
Lose this. That's the snap. Right. This
is what we played this morning. We're in

3060
01:09:08,789 --> 01:09:08,799
is what we played this morning. We're in
 

3061
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:11,430
is what we played this morning. We're in
this back down to this area. Our

3062
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:11,440
this back down to this area. Our
 

3063
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,030
this back down to this area. Our
expectation is we're not going to keep

3064
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:13,040
expectation is we're not going to keep
 

3065
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,749
expectation is we're not going to keep
going down. We don't think it might, but

3066
01:09:15,749 --> 01:09:15,759
going down. We don't think it might, but
 

3067
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,430
going down. We don't think it might, but
normally you would expect what? A

3068
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:17,440
normally you would expect what? A
 

3069
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,870
normally you would expect what? A
pullback leg, which is probably going to

3070
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:18,880
pullback leg, which is probably going to
 

3071
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,110
pullback leg, which is probably going to
go to where? Well, either here or here.

3072
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:21,120
go to where? Well, either here or here.
 

3073
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,749
go to where? Well, either here or here.
Now, once we get there, we don't know at

3074
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:23,759
Now, once we get there, we don't know at
 

3075
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,990
Now, once we get there, we don't know at
that point, right? If we're going to go

3076
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:26,000
that point, right? If we're going to go
 

3077
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,789
that point, right? If we're going to go
sideways to build the inverse head and

3078
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:28,799
sideways to build the inverse head and
 

3079
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:31,669
sideways to build the inverse head and
shoulder to go higher or is this the

3080
01:09:31,669 --> 01:09:31,679
shoulder to go higher or is this the
 

3081
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:34,789
shoulder to go higher or is this the
first lower high set leaving trap buyers

3082
01:09:34,789 --> 01:09:34,799
first lower high set leaving trap buyers
 

3083
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,630
first lower high set leaving trap buyers
to go lower? We will make that decision

3084
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:36,640
to go lower? We will make that decision
 

3085
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,149
to go lower? We will make that decision
next week probably, but my expectation

3086
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:38,159
next week probably, but my expectation
 

3087
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:43,349
next week probably, but my expectation
is we will drift back up.

3088
01:09:43,349 --> 01:09:43,359

 

3089
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:45,910

That blue box coming in pretty good so

3090
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:45,920
That blue box coming in pretty good so
 

3091
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,030
That blue box coming in pretty good so
far. All right, so starting to see that

3092
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:49,040
far. All right, so starting to see that
 

3093
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,510
far. All right, so starting to see that
squeeze back up starting already. And

3094
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:51,520
squeeze back up starting already. And
 

3095
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,590
squeeze back up starting already. And
the big buyers came in at 800. So if we

3096
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:53,600
the big buyers came in at 800. So if we
 

3097
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,270
the big buyers came in at 800. So if we
get through 800s, there's more upside

3098
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:55,280
get through 800s, there's more upside
 

3099
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,669
get through 800s, there's more upside
here. Imagine they're trying to protect

3100
01:09:57,669 --> 01:09:57,679
here. Imagine they're trying to protect
 

3101
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:06,709
here. Imagine they're trying to protect
in front of 800s.

3102
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:06,719

 

3103
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,070

Hopefully this makes sense to you all

3104
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:08,080
Hopefully this makes sense to you all
 

3105
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,630
Hopefully this makes sense to you all
like you especially you guys who are new

3106
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:10,640
like you especially you guys who are new
 

3107
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,390
like you especially you guys who are new
why we're trading and how we're trading

3108
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:12,400
why we're trading and how we're trading
 

3109
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,910
why we're trading and how we're trading
like why we're trading what direction

3110
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:13,920
like why we're trading what direction
 

3111
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,270
like why we're trading what direction
we're trading in I guess is a better way

3112
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:15,280
we're trading in I guess is a better way
 

3113
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,430
we're trading in I guess is a better way
of saying it why what our expectations

3114
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:17,440
of saying it why what our expectations
 

3115
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,990
of saying it why what our expectations
is why I'm done with the shorts now why

3116
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:20,000
is why I'm done with the shorts now why
 

3117
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,709
is why I'm done with the shorts now why
for me low hanging fruit has gone we

3118
01:10:22,709 --> 01:10:22,719
for me low hanging fruit has gone we
 

3119
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,750
for me low hanging fruit has gone we
always talk about trading the low

3120
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:23,760
always talk about trading the low
 

3121
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,350
always talk about trading the low
hanging fruit my expectation now is

3122
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:25,360
hanging fruit my expectation now is
 

3123
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,030
hanging fruit my expectation now is
probably going to be you know shorts

3124
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:27,040
probably going to be you know shorts
 

3125
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,630
probably going to be you know shorts
will likely get trapped near the lows

3126
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:28,640
will likely get trapped near the lows
 

3127
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,350
will likely get trapped near the lows
and we will probably see relief back

3128
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:31,360
and we will probably see relief back
 

3129
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,270
and we will probably see relief back
upside to some sort It might might not

3130
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:33,280
upside to some sort It might might not
 

3131
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,030
upside to some sort It might might not
be today. Like I said, this gray box is

3132
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:35,040
be today. Like I said, this gray box is
 

3133
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,709
be today. Like I said, this gray box is
a big big area. Previous week's value

3134
01:10:36,709 --> 01:10:36,719
a big big area. Previous week's value
 

3135
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:38,229
a big big area. Previous week's value
area high is a big big area. But I can

3136
01:10:38,229 --> 01:10:38,239
area high is a big big area. But I can
 

3137
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:39,750
area high is a big big area. But I can
tell you what, if we get through this

3138
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:39,760
tell you what, if we get through this
 

3139
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,990
tell you what, if we get through this
and shorts get caught down here, this is

3140
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:42,000
and shorts get caught down here, this is
 

3141
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,910
and shorts get caught down here, this is
probably going to happen. All right, so

3142
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:43,920
probably going to happen. All right, so
 

3143
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,189
probably going to happen. All right, so
let's just look at the low of day

3144
01:10:45,189 --> 01:10:45,199
let's just look at the low of day
 

3145
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,750
let's just look at the low of day
auction and see how we actually look

3146
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:47,760
auction and see how we actually look
 

3147
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,590
auction and see how we actually look
down there. Is it a good auction low?

3148
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:49,600
down there. Is it a good auction low?
 

3149
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,229
down there. Is it a good auction low?
It's not the best to be honest. That's

3150
01:10:52,229 --> 01:10:52,239
It's not the best to be honest. That's
 

3151
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:54,470
It's not the best to be honest. That's
not that good. Good selling in here, but

3152
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:54,480
not that good. Good selling in here, but
 

3153
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,910
not that good. Good selling in here, but
I don't want to see buyers at the lows,

3154
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:55,920
I don't want to see buyers at the lows,
 

3155
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,910
I don't want to see buyers at the lows,
so it might not be done yet, but we will

3156
01:10:57,910 --> 01:10:57,920
so it might not be done yet, but we will
 

3157
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,350
so it might not be done yet, but we will
see. The last two days has been a bit of

3158
01:10:59,350 --> 01:10:59,360
see. The last two days has been a bit of
 

3159
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:06,310
see. The last two days has been a bit of
a messy auction at the lows.

3160
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:06,320

3183
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,910
get all of that. I'm sorry. My bad. But
we got the first leg. Should have held

3184
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:33,920
we got the first leg. Should have held
 

3185
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,990
we got the first leg. Should have held
the second leg. And now I'm kind of done

3186
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:36,000
the second leg. And now I'm kind of done
 

3187
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,070
the second leg. And now I'm kind of done
with it.

3188
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:38,080
with it.
 

3189
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,990
with it.
So just uh smash that like button for

3190
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:40,000
So just uh smash that like button for
 

3191
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,110
So just uh smash that like button for
me. So here's the the lift up. So if you

3192
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:43,120
me. So here's the the lift up. So if you
 

3193
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,709
me. So here's the the lift up. So if you
want to play the counter trend, you can

3194
01:11:44,709 --> 01:11:44,719
want to play the counter trend, you can
 

3195
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:46,390
want to play the counter trend, you can
think about this now. Maybe you got long

3196
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:46,400
think about this now. Maybe you got long
 

3197
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,350
think about this now. Maybe you got long
from the blue box. If you see the market

3198
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:49,360
from the blue box. If you see the market
 

3199
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,910
from the blue box. If you see the market
start to base over here, then you'll

3200
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:51,920
start to base over here, then you'll
 

3201
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,510
start to base over here, then you'll
probably get this relief up here. All

3202
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:53,520
probably get this relief up here. All
 

3203
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,270
probably get this relief up here. All
right? So maybe you go long from here to

3204
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:55,280
right? So maybe you go long from here to
 

3205
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,189
right? So maybe you go long from here to
here. If you see it base, maybe you get

3206
01:11:57,189 --> 01:11:57,199
here. If you see it base, maybe you get
 

3207
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,630
here. If you see it base, maybe you get
this leg up here. If you want to play

3208
01:11:58,630 --> 01:11:58,640
this leg up here. If you want to play
 

3209
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,070
this leg up here. If you want to play
the counter trend leg, that's what I

3210
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:00,080
the counter trend leg, that's what I
 

3211
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,229
the counter trend leg, that's what I
would be looking for. And just remember,

3212
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:02,239
would be looking for. And just remember,
 

3213
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:03,590
would be looking for. And just remember,
you haven't flipped the flow zones or

3214
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:03,600
you haven't flipped the flow zones or
 

3215
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,790
you haven't flipped the flow zones or
anything like that yet, and you're not

3216
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:04,800
anything like that yet, and you're not
 

3217
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,630
anything like that yet, and you're not
over previous week value. But this is a

3218
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:06,640
over previous week value. But this is a
 

3219
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,229
over previous week value. But this is a
nice squeeze from blue to gray. And you

3220
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:08,239
nice squeeze from blue to gray. And you
 

3221
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:10,070
nice squeeze from blue to gray. And you
might well, if they can base here, you

3222
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:10,080
might well, if they can base here, you
 

3223
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:14,149
might well, if they can base here, you
might well get a pop through sort of 30s

3224
01:12:14,149 --> 01:12:14,159
might well get a pop through sort of 30s
 

3225
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:16,310
might well get a pop through sort of 30s
all the way up into 900s. It's very,

3226
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:16,320
all the way up into 900s. It's very,
 

3227
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,830
all the way up into 900s. It's very,
very possible for that counter trend

3228
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:17,840
very possible for that counter trend
 

3229
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,550
very possible for that counter trend
leg. All depends if shorts willing to

3230
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:20,560
leg. All depends if shorts willing to
 

3231
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,390
leg. All depends if shorts willing to
fend here or if they want to defend up

3232
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:22,400
fend here or if they want to defend up
 

3233
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:45,110
fend here or if they want to defend up
here.

3234

What is the red box next to the New York

3244
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:56,080
What is the red box next to the New York
 

3245
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,550
What is the red box next to the New York
VW? It's just like a supply channel that

3246
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:58,560
VW? It's just like a supply channel that
 

3247
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,270
VW? It's just like a supply channel that
I've got, right? It's old point of

3248
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:01,280
I've got, right? It's old point of
 

3249
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,070
I've got, right? It's old point of
control. It's uh current week value area

3250
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:04,080
control. It's uh current week value area
 

3251
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,149
control. It's uh current week value area
low developing week and it's point of

3252
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:06,159
low developing week and it's point of
 

3253
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:09,030
low developing week and it's point of
control from the week of Monday the 12th

3254
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:09,040
control from the week of Monday the 12th
 

3255
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,510
control from the week of Monday the 12th
of Jan. So, it's a big level. You can

3256
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:11,520
of Jan. So, it's a big level. You can
 

3257
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,229
of Jan. So, it's a big level. You can
see we reacted off that level, right? It

3258
01:13:14,229 --> 01:13:14,239
see we reacted off that level, right? It
 

3259
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:17,030
see we reacted off that level, right? It
was demand, we reacted off it. We

3260
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:17,040
was demand, we reacted off it. We
 

3261
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,030
was demand, we reacted off it. We
reacted off it. It was blue. We snapped

3262
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:19,040
reacted off it. It was blue. We snapped
 

3263
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,270
reacted off it. It was blue. We snapped
through. I now know that this can

3264
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:21,280
through. I now know that this can
 

3265
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,709
through. I now know that this can
potentially be supply. So if we get

3266
01:13:22,709 --> 01:13:22,719
potentially be supply. So if we get
 

3267
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:25,270
potentially be supply. So if we get
relief, it can be into this. This is an

3268
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:25,280
relief, it can be into this. This is an
 

3269
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,390
relief, it can be into this. This is an
old PC and it's been thickened up from

3270
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:28,400
old PC and it's been thickened up from
 

3271
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,830
old PC and it's been thickened up from
today as well.

3272
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:31,840
today as well.
 

3273
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,709
today as well.
And it's also this is current weak

3274
01:13:34,709 --> 01:13:34,719
And it's also this is current weak
 

3275
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:38,630
And it's also this is current weak
developing weak value area low.

3276
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:38,640
developing weak value area low.
 

3277
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:54,790
developing weak value area low.
So lots of confluence up there.

3278
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:54,800

 

3279
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,470

It seems price always looks for point of

3280
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:56,480
It seems price always looks for point of
 

3281
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,149
It seems price always looks for point of
control. Am I right? Yeah. Especially

3282
01:13:58,149 --> 01:13:58,159
control. Am I right? Yeah. Especially
 

3283
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:00,709
control. Am I right? Yeah. Especially
when it's naked. But yeah, obviously

3284
01:14:00,709 --> 01:14:00,719
when it's naked. But yeah, obviously
 

3285
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:01,990
when it's naked. But yeah, obviously
point of control, you just got to think

3286
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:02,000
point of control, you just got to think
 

3287
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,189
point of control, you just got to think
what point of control is. Point of

3288
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:03,199
what point of control is. Point of
 

3289
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,510
what point of control is. Point of
control is fair value. All right. Why is

3290
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:05,520
control is fair value. All right. Why is
 

3291
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,189
control is fair value. All right. Why is
it fair value? Because it's the most

3292
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:07,199
it fair value? Because it's the most
 

3293
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:09,590
it fair value? Because it's the most
traded price by both buyers and sellers.

3294
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:09,600
traded price by both buyers and sellers.
 

3295
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,990
traded price by both buyers and sellers.
So if if buyers and sellers agree on

3296
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:12,000
So if if buyers and sellers agree on
 

3297
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,229
So if if buyers and sellers agree on
price, it's going to spend the most

3298
01:14:14,229 --> 01:14:14,239
price, it's going to spend the most
 

3299
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:16,470
price, it's going to spend the most
amount of time and build the most amount

3300
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:16,480
amount of time and build the most amount
 

3301
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,990
amount of time and build the most amount
of volume up there, which means it will

3302
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:18,000
of volume up there, which means it will
 

3303
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,709
of volume up there, which means it will
be the point of control on the day. So

3304
01:14:20,709 --> 01:14:20,719
be the point of control on the day. So
 

3305
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:23,110
be the point of control on the day. So
if they agree on price, which currently

3306
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:23,120
if they agree on price, which currently
 

3307
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,030
if they agree on price, which currently
they agree that this is fair price. Now

3308
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:25,040
they agree that this is fair price. Now
 

3309
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,669
they agree that this is fair price. Now
if buyers decide shortly that this is

3310
01:14:27,669 --> 01:14:27,679
if buyers decide shortly that this is
 

3311
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:29,430
if buyers decide shortly that this is
too cheap, we will try and auction

3312
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:29,440
too cheap, we will try and auction
 

3313
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,830
too cheap, we will try and auction
higher. If sellers decide this is too

3314
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:31,840
higher. If sellers decide this is too
 

3315
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,430
higher. If sellers decide this is too
expensive, we will try and auction

3316
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:33,440
expensive, we will try and auction
 

3317
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,510
expensive, we will try and auction
lower. Right? I'd imagine they will try

3318
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:35,520
lower. Right? I'd imagine they will try
 

3319
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,430
lower. Right? I'd imagine they will try
and get through here and do this move

3320
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:37,440
and get through here and do this move
 

3321
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:38,709
and get through here and do this move
like I talked about. But you have to see

3322
01:14:38,709 --> 01:14:38,719
like I talked about. But you have to see
 

3323
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,550
like I talked about. But you have to see
if they build out the liquidity to do it

3324
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:40,560
if they build out the liquidity to do it
 

3325
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,229
if they build out the liquidity to do it
because they will need what to do it.

3326
01:14:42,229 --> 01:14:42,239
because they will need what to do it.
 

3327
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:44,470
because they will need what to do it.
They need sellers, sellers, sellers,

3328
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:44,480
They need sellers, sellers, sellers,
 

3329
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,669
They need sellers, sellers, sellers,
sellers, sellers, sellers stuck who then

3330
01:14:47,669 --> 01:14:47,679
sellers, sellers, sellers stuck who then
 

3331
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,070
sellers, sellers, sellers stuck who then
become buyers who then offer this and

3332
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:50,080
become buyers who then offer this and
 

3333
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,669
become buyers who then offer this and
then probably see a rejection from there

3334
01:14:51,669 --> 01:14:51,679
then probably see a rejection from there
 

3335
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:53,750
then probably see a rejection from there
back down if they're able to do it. I'm

3336
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:53,760
back down if they're able to do it. I'm
 

3337
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,110
back down if they're able to do it. I'm
not going to trade the counter trend.

3338
01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:55,120
not going to trade the counter trend.
 

3339
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,470
not going to trade the counter trend.
I've made my money today like we talked

3340
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:56,480
I've made my money today like we talked
 

3341
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,149
I've made my money today like we talked
about. Low hanging fruit's gone, but I

3342
01:14:58,149 --> 01:14:58,159
about. Low hanging fruit's gone, but I
 

3343
01:14:58,159 --> 01:14:59,590
about. Low hanging fruit's gone, but I
will sit here and help you guys as much

3344
01:14:59,590 --> 01:14:59,600
will sit here and help you guys as much
 

3345
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,590
will sit here and help you guys as much
as I can.

3346
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:01,600
as I can.
 

3347
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,830
as I can.
What's my win rate? 100%. No, it's not

3348
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:03,840
What's my win rate? 100%. No, it's not
 

3349
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,070
What's my win rate? 100%. No, it's not
100%. I'm joking. uh it's normally

3350
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:06,080
100%. I'm joking. uh it's normally
 

3351
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:09,990
100%. I'm joking. uh it's normally
around 66 to 73%. But what I will tell

3352
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:10,000
around 66 to 73%. But what I will tell
 

3353
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,669
around 66 to 73%. But what I will tell
you with that, which I'm very very

3354
01:15:11,669 --> 01:15:11,679
you with that, which I'm very very
 

3355
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,990
you with that, which I'm very very
honest about, lots of those will be like

3356
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:14,000
honest about, lots of those will be like
 

3357
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,070
honest about, lots of those will be like
break even plus one. So they won't

3358
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:16,080
break even plus one. So they won't
 

3359
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,870
break even plus one. So they won't
always be like today, right? If you were

3360
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:18,880
always be like today, right? If you were
 

3361
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,750
always be like today, right? If you were
here last week, I think it was last

3362
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:21,760
here last week, I think it was last
 

3363
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,510
here last week, I think it was last
week, you would have seen me three days

3364
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:23,520
week, you would have seen me three days
 

3365
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,310
week, you would have seen me three days
in a row get knocked out, break even,

3366
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:26,320
in a row get knocked out, break even,
 

3367
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,110
in a row get knocked out, break even,
and missing 100 to 200 point trades.

3368
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:29,120
and missing 100 to 200 point trades.
 

3369
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,550
and missing 100 to 200 point trades.
three days in a row, but those will all

3370
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:30,560
three days in a row, but those will all
 

3371
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,270
three days in a row, but those will all
show as positive trades on my bladder,

3372
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:33,280
show as positive trades on my bladder,
 

3373
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,430
show as positive trades on my bladder,
but they're positive by like five 10

3374
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:35,440
but they're positive by like five 10
 

3375
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,870
but they're positive by like five 10
points. They don't [\h__\h] mean [\h__\h] Do

3376
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:36,880
points. They don't [\h__\h] mean [\h__\h] Do
 

3377
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,310
points. They don't [\h__\h] mean [\h__\h] Do
you know what I mean? Pardon my French,

3378
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:38,320
you know what I mean? Pardon my French,
 

3379
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:41,990
you know what I mean? Pardon my French,
but they don't. So,

3380
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:42,000
but they don't. So,
 

3381
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,990
but they don't. So,
win rate,

3382
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:44,000
win rate,
 

3383
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,790
win rate,
it might it might be uh it might look

3384
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:46,800
it might it might be uh it might look
 

3385
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,709
it might it might be uh it might look
better than it is, if that makes sense.

3386
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:48,719
better than it is, if that makes sense.
 

3387
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:50,149
better than it is, if that makes sense.
There's quite a few break evens in

3388
01:15:50,149 --> 01:15:50,159
There's quite a few break evens in
 

3389
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,669
There's quite a few break evens in
there, but the difference is I'm trying

3390
01:15:51,669 --> 01:15:51,679
there, but the difference is I'm trying
 

3391
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,709
there, but the difference is I'm trying
to position myself for these moves. If

3392
01:15:54,709 --> 01:15:54,719
to position myself for these moves. If
 

3393
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:56,149
to position myself for these moves. If
you join me on stream, you will see I

3394
01:15:56,149 --> 01:15:56,159
you join me on stream, you will see I
 

3395
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:57,990
you join me on stream, you will see I
will try and position myself for these

3396
01:15:57,990 --> 01:15:58,000
will try and position myself for these
 

3397
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,990
will try and position myself for these
moves. Like even here. Wow, that's poor,

3398
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:00,000
moves. Like even here. Wow, that's poor,
 

3399
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,510
moves. Like even here. Wow, that's poor,
Alex. That's so poor. But I just thought

3400
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:01,520
Alex. That's so poor. But I just thought
 

3401
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,430
Alex. That's so poor. But I just thought
we were going to hold that. But there we

3402
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:03,440
we were going to hold that. But there we
 

3403
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,669
we were going to hold that. But there we
go. Missed I missed this here. That's a

3404
01:16:05,669 --> 01:16:05,679
go. Missed I missed this here. That's a
 

3405
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:07,430
go. Missed I missed this here. That's a
shame.

3406

shame.
 

3407

But there we go. Didn't like what I saw
 

3409
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,350
But there we go. Didn't like what I saw
on the tape, but there we go. It's all

What are the benefits of being a member
 

3451
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,110
What are the benefits of being a member
of this channel? Not much really, I

of this channel? Not much really, I
 

3453
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,510
of this channel? Not much really, I
guess. Just supporting me, getting more

3454
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:13,520
guess. Just supporting me, getting more
 

3455
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,510
guess. Just supporting me, getting more
shoutouts. If you ask a question, I will

3456
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:15,520
shoutouts. If you ask a question, I will
 

3457
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,870

01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,870
answer it because it will show up on my
screen. I can't answer all the questions

3460
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:18,880
screen. I can't answer all the questions
 

3461
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,310
screen. I can't answer all the questions
now, especially as we get bigger and

3462
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:20,320
now, especially as we get bigger and
 

3463
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:21,830
now, especially as we get bigger and
bigger on stream. I try to answer as

3464
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:21,840
bigger on stream. I try to answer as
 

3465
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,510
bigger on stream. I try to answer as
many as I can, but obviously then

3466
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:23,520
many as I can, but obviously then
 

3467
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,830
many as I can, but obviously then
members will get preference. But if you

3468
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:25,840
members will get preference. But if you
 

3469
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,030
members will get preference. But if you
want to support the stream, that's a

3470
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:27,040
want to support the stream, that's a
 

3471
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:30,709
want to support the stream, that's a
good way of doing it.

3472
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:30,719

 

3473
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:32,790

How do I find where the gap was? The

3474
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:32,800
How do I find where the gap was? The
 

3475
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,430
How do I find where the gap was? The
close cash gap closed.

3476
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:37,440
close cash gap closed.
 

3477
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,189

GC swan diving. Is it? Let's have a

3478
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:39,199
GC swan diving. Is it? Let's have a
 

3479
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,550
GC swan diving. Is it? Let's have a
little look. Let's have a little look.

3480
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:40,560
little look. Let's have a little look.
 

3481
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,830
little look. Let's have a little look.
See, have they gone risk off on

3482
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:41,840
See, have they gone risk off on
 

3483
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,229
See, have they gone risk off on
everything? Oh, they have. So GC's just

3484
01:17:44,229 --> 01:17:44,239
everything? Oh, they have. So GC's just
 

3485
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:45,910
everything? Oh, they have. So GC's just
closed its gap as well. So next thing

3486
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:45,920
closed its gap as well. So next thing
 

3487
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,510
closed its gap as well. So next thing
you'd be looking at is these lows down

3488
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:47,520
you'd be looking at is these lows down
 

3489
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,270
you'd be looking at is these lows down
here. See, I haven't got any volume

3490
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:49,280
here. See, I haven't got any volume
 

3491
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,790
here. See, I haven't got any volume
built out. But yeah, you could look at

3492
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:50,800
built out. But yeah, you could look at
 

3493
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,149
built out. But yeah, you could look at
this pivot in here into 265. And if it

3494
01:17:54,149 --> 01:17:54,159
this pivot in here into 265. And if it
 

3495
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:56,470
this pivot in here into 265. And if it
lets go of that, there's an old low of

3496
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:56,480
lets go of that, there's an old low of
 

3497
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,229
lets go of that, there's an old low of
190. This looks very, very much like the

3498
01:17:58,229 --> 01:17:58,239
190. This looks very, very much like the
 

3499
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:00,070
190. This looks very, very much like the
same. Bid up, bid up, bid up, coming

3500
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:00,080
same. Bid up, bid up, bid up, coming
 

3501
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,910
same. Bid up, bid up, bid up, coming
back into key level. I'd be like going

3502
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:01,920
back into key level. I'd be like going
 

3503
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,590
back into key level. I'd be like going
risk off now at this point. If I was on

3504
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:03,600
risk off now at this point. If I was on
 

3505
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,390
risk off now at this point. If I was on
GC, right? All you have to do on GC if

3506
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:06,400
GC, right? All you have to do on GC if
 

3507
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,750
GC, right? All you have to do on GC if
you didn't take this break was just take

3508
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:07,760
you didn't take this break was just take
 

3509
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,990
you didn't take this break was just take
this break here, right? Take this break

3510
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:10,000
this break here, right? Take this break
 

3511
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,830
this break here, right? Take this break
here. Very thin. You can see lack of

3512
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:11,840
here. Very thin. You can see lack of
 

3513
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,590
here. Very thin. You can see lack of
structure in there. Straight back down

3514
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:13,600
structure in there. Straight back down
 

3515
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,550
structure in there. Straight back down
into here. Break down into here. Run us

3516
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:16,560
into here. Break down into here. Run us
 

3517
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,870
into here. Break down into here. Run us
down into there.

3518
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:18,880
down into there.
 

3519
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,470
down into there.
Same thing, same setup, same kind of

Do you have trap participants? Is there

3524
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:25,440
Do you have trap participants? Is there
 

3525
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,990
Do you have trap participants? Is there
a shelf? If there is, can we get

3526
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:28,000
a shelf? If there is, can we get
 

3527
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:38,310
a shelf? If there is, can we get
involved somehow?

3529
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,229

Why do I think we crashed today when the

01:18:40,229 --> 01:18:40,239
Why do I think we crashed today when the
 

3531
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:42,310
Why do I think we crashed today when the
big tech company's earnings are tonight?

big tech company's earnings are tonight?
Well, most of them were last night. Um,

01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,550
daily. Right, you regulars tell me what
did we expect up here and why, right? If

3548
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:02,560
did we expect up here and why, right? If
 

3549
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,390
did we expect up here and why, right? If
you're a regular, you tell me what we

3550
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:04,400
you're a regular, you tell me what we
 

3551
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:08,470
you're a regular, you tell me what we
expect up here and why. Right? What do

3552
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:08,480
expect up here and why. Right? What do
 

3553
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:14,870
expect up here and why. Right? What do
we expect?

3554
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:14,880

 

3555
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,350

There you go. Ballinger bands. Ballinger

3556
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:17,360
There you go. Ballinger bands. Ballinger
 

3557
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,830
There you go. Ballinger bands. Ballinger
bands. All right. Ballinger bands. So,

3558
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:19,840
bands. All right. Ballinger bands. So,
 

3559
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,430
bands. All right. Ballinger bands. So,
we were running out of room. We talked

3560
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:21,440
we were running out of room. We talked
 

3561
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,830
we were running out of room. We talked
about it. These are starting to expand,

3562
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:23,840
about it. These are starting to expand,
 

3563
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,830
about it. These are starting to expand,
but we can't get over these. We can't

3564
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:25,840
but we can't get over these. We can't
 

3565
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,430
but we can't get over these. We can't
get over these. We can't get under

3566
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:27,440
get over these. We can't get under
 

3567
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,910
get over these. We can't get under
these. We can't get under these. We

3568
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:29,920
these. We can't get under these. We
 

3569
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,590
these. We can't get under these. We
can't get over them. We can't get under

3570
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:31,600
can't get over them. We can't get under
 

3571
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,030
can't get over them. We can't get under
them. We can't get over them. We can't

3572
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:33,040
them. We can't get over them. We can't
 

3573
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,310
them. We can't get over them. We can't
get under them. There's some edge for

3574
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:34,320
get under them. There's some edge for
 

3575
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,070
get under them. There's some edge for
you. But before you do anything else,

3576
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:36,080
you. But before you do anything else,
 

3577
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,310
you. But before you do anything else,
you can look at that. Now, did we know

3578
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:38,320
you can look at that. Now, did we know
 

3579
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,070
you can look at that. Now, did we know
we were going to sell hard today? No, we

3580
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:40,080
we were going to sell hard today? No, we
 

3581
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,750
we were going to sell hard today? No, we
didn't. We didn't know we were going to

3582
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:41,760
didn't. We didn't know we were going to
 

3583
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,110
didn't. We didn't know we were going to
sell hard. I actually thought we'd

3584
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:43,120
sell hard. I actually thought we'd
 

3585
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,510
sell hard. I actually thought we'd
probably have an inside bar, right? I

3586
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:45,520
probably have an inside bar, right? I
 

3587
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,590
probably have an inside bar, right? I
thought we'd trade down into here and

3588
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:47,600
thought we'd trade down into here and
 

3589
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,910
thought we'd trade down into here and
see if they can hold the bid and go

3590
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:49,920
see if they can hold the bid and go
 

3591
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,750
see if they can hold the bid and go
inside and build this out, right? To try

3592
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:53,760
inside and build this out, right? To try
 

3593
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,830
inside and build this out, right? To try
and open this up. But we didn't, which

3594
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:55,840
and open this up. But we didn't, which
 

3595
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,229
and open this up. But we didn't, which
means what? Well, this becomes trapped

3596
01:19:58,229 --> 01:19:58,239
means what? Well, this becomes trapped
 

3597
01:19:58,239 --> 01:20:00,630
means what? Well, this becomes trapped
buyers, right? And now we're starting to

3598
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:00,640
buyers, right? And now we're starting to
 

3599
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,350
buyers, right? And now we're starting to
lose this. What does that become? A

3600
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:03,360
lose this. What does that become? A
 

3601
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,669
lose this. What does that become? A
failed breakout. All right. So if you

3602
01:20:05,669 --> 01:20:05,679
failed breakout. All right. So if you
 

3603
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:07,189
failed breakout. All right. So if you
think about all the participants who

3604
01:20:07,189 --> 01:20:07,199
think about all the participants who
 

3605
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:09,270
think about all the participants who
position net long, remember I've talked

3606
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:09,280
position net long, remember I've talked
 

3607
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,750
position net long, remember I've talked
about all week the rotation happened

3608
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:11,760
about all week the rotation happened
 

3609
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,229
about all week the rotation happened
here Friday, right? We started buying

3610
01:20:14,229 --> 01:20:14,239
here Friday, right? We started buying
 

3611
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:17,430
here Friday, right? We started buying
Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. You

3612
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:17,440
Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. You
 

3613
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,430
Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. You
don't want to buy the breakout, guys.

3614
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:19,440
don't want to buy the breakout, guys.
 

3615
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,270
don't want to buy the breakout, guys.
You don't want to buy the breakout. You

3616
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:21,280
You don't want to buy the breakout. You
 

3617
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,030
You don't want to buy the breakout. You
want to be positioned for the breakout

3618
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:23,040
want to be positioned for the breakout
 

3619
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,669
want to be positioned for the breakout
for this very reason. Right? They didn't

3620
01:20:25,669 --> 01:20:25,679
for this very reason. Right? They didn't
 

3621
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:27,189
for this very reason. Right? They didn't
hold the breakout, which means what? All

3622
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:27,199
hold the breakout, which means what? All
 

3623
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:29,110
hold the breakout, which means what? All
these buyers are now becoming sellers.

3624
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:29,120
these buyers are now becoming sellers.
 

3625
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,470
these buyers are now becoming sellers.
And all we're doing is trading back

3626
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:30,480
And all we're doing is trading back
 

3627
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,310
And all we're doing is trading back
down. So now we've cleaned up all these

3628
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:32,320
down. So now we've cleaned up all these
 

3629
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,790
down. So now we've cleaned up all these
stops. We've filled this gap. Remember I

3630
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:34,800
stops. We've filled this gap. Remember I
 

3631
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:35,910
stops. We've filled this gap. Remember I
talked about this gap? We have

3632
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:35,920
talked about this gap? We have
 

3633
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,590
talked about this gap? We have
efficiently filled that gap. Now the

3634
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:37,600
efficiently filled that gap. Now the
 

3635
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,350
efficiently filled that gap. Now the
market has become efficient. We talked

3636
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:39,360
market has become efficient. We talked
 

3637
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,790
market has become efficient. We talked
about this. You can go back and rewind

3638
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:40,800
about this. You can go back and rewind
 

3639
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,950
about this. You can go back and rewind
the streams. I said if they're going to

3640
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:42,960
the streams. I said if they're going to
 

3641
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,950
the streams. I said if they're going to
be really nasty, we will do a fail

3642
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:44,960
be really nasty, we will do a fail
 

3643
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,189
be really nasty, we will do a fail
breakout. We will fill that gap. We will

3644
01:20:47,189 --> 01:20:47,199
breakout. We will fill that gap. We will
 

3645
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:49,110
breakout. We will fill that gap. We will
lose the bid and we will now come all

3646
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:49,120
lose the bid and we will now come all
 

3647
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,870
lose the bid and we will now come all
the way down here and clean all this

3648
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:50,880
the way down here and clean all this
 

3649
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,149
the way down here and clean all this
out. That is why it's happening. It

3650
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:54,159
out. That is why it's happening. It
 

3651
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:55,750
out. That is why it's happening. It
doesn't matter what the catalyst is.

3652
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:55,760
doesn't matter what the catalyst is.
 

3653
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,149
doesn't matter what the catalyst is.
Like it really doesn't matter. It what

3654
01:20:58,149 --> 01:20:58,159
Like it really doesn't matter. It what
 

3655
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:00,149
Like it really doesn't matter. It what
matters is the volume's caught, right?

3656
01:21:00,149 --> 01:21:00,159
matters is the volume's caught, right?
 

3657
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:01,590
matters is the volume's caught, right?
What matters is the volume's caught. And

3658
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:01,600
What matters is the volume's caught. And
 

3659
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,550
What matters is the volume's caught. And
then we go from there down a time frame

3660
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:04,560
then we go from there down a time frame
 

3661
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,630
then we go from there down a time frame
into like an hourly

3662
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:08,640

 

3663
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:12,630

right this right here.

3664
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:12,640

 

3665
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,870

Where's your volume from the last few

3666
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:14,880
Where's your volume from the last few
 

3667
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,630
Where's your volume from the last few
sessions? If we think about this from

3668
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:16,640
sessions? If we think about this from
 

3669
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:20,550
sessions? If we think about this from
Tuesday, all right, from Tuesday bid up

3670
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:20,560
Tuesday, all right, from Tuesday bid up
 

3671
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,990
Tuesday, all right, from Tuesday bid up
Wednesday

3672
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:24,000

 

3673
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,070

and Thursday morning, right? Globeex. So

3674
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:26,080
and Thursday morning, right? Globeex. So
 

3675
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,390
and Thursday morning, right? Globeex. So
you got Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

3676
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:28,400
you got Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
 

3677
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,950
you got Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
Gloveex. What happens here? These are

3678
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:30,960
Gloveex. What happens here? These are
 

3679
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,550
Gloveex. What happens here? These are
all trapped buyers. They become what

3680
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:32,560
all trapped buyers. They become what
 

3681
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,310
all trapped buyers. They become what
under here? Market sellers. What do we

3682
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:34,320
under here? Market sellers. What do we
 

3683
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,070
under here? Market sellers. What do we
do? We use their pain. Where do we come

3684
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:36,080
do? We use their pain. Where do we come
 

3685
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,950
do? We use their pain. Where do we come
to? Next key level

3686
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:38,960
to? Next key level
 

3687
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,709
to? Next key level
confluence. Next key level. So old point

3688
01:21:40,709 --> 01:21:40,719
confluence. Next key level. So old point
 

3689
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:43,030
confluence. Next key level. So old point
of control. Old value area low. Old

3690
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:43,040
of control. Old value area low. Old
 

3691
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,270
of control. Old value area low. Old
point of control. Old point of control.

3692
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:45,280
point of control. Old point of control.
 

3693
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,790
point of control. Old point of control.
This is the old balance that we just

3694
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:46,800
This is the old balance that we just
 

3695
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,709
This is the old balance that we just
broke out from. This can still

3696
01:21:48,709 --> 01:21:48,719
broke out from. This can still
 

3697
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:51,590
broke out from. This can still
technically technically this can still

3698
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:51,600
technically technically this can still
 

3699
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,270
technically technically this can still
be a breakout and pullback like I've

3700
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:53,280
be a breakout and pullback like I've
 

3701
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,709
be a breakout and pullback like I've
talked about. If they bid off here and

3702
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:54,719
talked about. If they bid off here and
 

3703
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:56,550
talked about. If they bid off here and
come back here and build liquidity, we

3704
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:56,560
come back here and build liquidity, we
 

3705
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:57,990
come back here and build liquidity, we
will then have room to go higher because

3706
01:21:57,990 --> 01:21:58,000
will then have room to go higher because
 

3707
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,350
will then have room to go higher because
the Ballinger bands would have moved.

3708
01:21:59,350 --> 01:21:59,360
the Ballinger bands would have moved.
 

3709
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,430
the Ballinger bands would have moved.
But they can also come up here, lose the

3710
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:01,440
But they can also come up here, lose the
 

3711
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,270
But they can also come up here, lose the
bid and absolutely slam this. My

3712
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:03,280
bid and absolutely slam this. My
 

3713
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,709
bid and absolutely slam this. My
expectation, like I talked about, we

3714
01:22:04,709 --> 01:22:04,719
expectation, like I talked about, we
 

3715
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:07,590
expectation, like I talked about, we
probably will come up here

3716
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:07,600
probably will come up here
 

3717
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,149
probably will come up here
maybe tomorrow, maybe Monday, Tuesday,

3718
01:22:10,149 --> 01:22:10,159
maybe tomorrow, maybe Monday, Tuesday,
 

3719
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,550
maybe tomorrow, maybe Monday, Tuesday,
next week. What happens then is what's

3720
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:12,560
next week. What happens then is what's
 

3721
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,629
next week. What happens then is what's
going to be absolutely pivotal for the

3722
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:14,639
going to be absolutely pivotal for the
 

3723
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:25,910
going to be absolutely pivotal for the
rest of the uh quarter.

3724
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:25,920

 

3725
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,030

3735
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:46,550

Doesn't mean I'm currently bearish for

3736
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:46,560
Doesn't mean I'm currently bearish for
 

3737
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,149
Doesn't mean I'm currently bearish for
the future. I think it's too too early

3738
01:22:48,149 --> 01:22:48,159
the future. I think it's too too early
 

3739
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:50,229
the future. I think it's too too early
too early to say. I was bearish for that

3740
01:22:50,229 --> 01:22:50,239
too early to say. I was bearish for that
 

3741
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:52,790
too early to say. I was bearish for that
breakdown to here.

3742
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:52,800
breakdown to here.
 

3743
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,030
breakdown to here.
If we start losing these key levels on

If we start losing these key levels on
 

3745

If we start losing these key levels on

very kind of you. Okay. S uh ES keeps
 

3759
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,110
very kind of you. Okay. S uh ES keeps
rejecting that 20-day.

3760
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:15,120
rejecting that 20-day.
 

3761
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,470
rejecting that 20-day.
I'm just wondering, do they want to

3762
01:23:16,470 --> 01:23:16,480
I'm just wondering, do they want to
 

3763
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:19,750
I'm just wondering, do they want to
attack the lower Ballinger band?

3764
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:19,760
attack the lower Ballinger band?
 

3765
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,270
attack the lower Ballinger band?
Because ES is already trading through

3766
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:21,280
Because ES is already trading through
 

3767
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,590
Because ES is already trading through
that that 20-day and it's staying heavy

3768
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:23,600
that that 20-day and it's staying heavy
 

3769

Why do we never see an influencer talk

3772
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:35,600
Why do we never see an influencer talk
 

3773

01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:53,520
Average price 590. So I'm long from

Why is I'm only up 15% then? That don't
make sense. Check that out. I want to

3866
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:15,280
make sense. Check that out. I want to
 

3867
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,629
make sense. Check that out. I want to
see if we can get up into it. I think we

3868
01:26:16,629 --> 01:26:16,639
see if we can get up into it. I think we
 

3869
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:18,390
see if we can get up into it. I think we
can. But we filled that gap, haven't we?

3870
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:18,400
can. But we filled that gap, haven't we?

can. But we filled that gap, haven't we?

3874
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:23,040
Maybe I'll just trim a little bit.
 

3875
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,030
Maybe I'll just trim a little bit.

01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:10,149
orb right here which is currently value
area high on the day very much would

4012
01:30:10,149 --> 01:30:10,159
area high on the day very much would
 

4013
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:13,910
area high on the day very much would
have worked

4014
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:13,920

 

4015
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,669

basically what we took here we just

4016
01:30:15,669 --> 01:30:15,679
basically what we took here we just
 

4017
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:16,950
basically what we took here we just
didn't get the continuation when I

4018
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:16,960
didn't get the continuation when I
 

4019
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,270
didn't get the continuation when I
wanted it

4020
01:30:19,270 --> 01:30:19,280
wanted it
 

4021
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,510
wanted it
and the blood is still very present in

4022
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:21,520
and the blood is still very present in
 

4023
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,229
and the blood is still very present in
this market things not a day to be

4024
01:30:24,229 --> 01:30:24,239
this market things not a day to be
 

4025
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:29,350
this market things not a day to be
trying to bid on it that's for sure

4026
01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:29,360

 

4027
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,189

I left 20k on the table yeah probably

4028
01:30:31,189 --> 01:30:31,199
I left 20k on the table yeah probably
 

4029
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:35,430
I left 20k on the table yeah probably
and some to be honest there we

4030
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:35,440

 

4031
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,270

All right. This is the next spot, I

4032
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:37,280
All right. This is the next spot, I
 

4033
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,870
All right. This is the next spot, I
think, potentially.

4034
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:40,880

 

4035
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:43,270

Is that here? Yeah. 600. That's probably

4036
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:43,280
Is that here? Yeah. 600. That's probably
 

4037
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:49,430
Is that here? Yeah. 600. That's probably
the next spot.

4038
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:49,440

 

4039
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:53,669

Where's the low volume node? 540

4040
01:30:53,669 --> 01:30:53,679
Where's the low volume node? 540
 

4041
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:58,310
Where's the low volume node? 540
to 513s.

4042
01:30:58,310 --> 01:30:58,320

 

4043
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:01,430

Let's think about uh

4044
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:01,440
Let's think about uh
 

4045
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,470
Let's think about uh
that Sunday open low to the high of

4046
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:04,480
that Sunday open low to the high of
 

4047
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,550
that Sunday open low to the high of
week. We're now in the golden pocket as

4048
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:06,560
week. We're now in the golden pocket as
 

4049
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,070
week. We're now in the golden pocket as
well. You can see these orange lines.

4050
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:08,080
well. You can see these orange lines.
 

4051
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,590
well. You can see these orange lines.
We're now well into that golden pocket.

4052
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:09,600
We're now well into that golden pocket.
 

4053
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,990
We're now well into that golden pocket.
So, you don't want to be a new money

4054
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:12,000
So, you don't want to be a new money
 

4055
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,750
So, you don't want to be a new money
short down here. You really don't. That

4056
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:13,760
short down here. You really don't. That
 

4057
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:14,870
short down here. You really don't. That
doesn't mean you want to be long, but

4058
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:14,880
doesn't mean you want to be long, but
 

4059
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,310
doesn't mean you want to be long, but
you really don't want to be a new money

4060
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:16,320
you really don't want to be a new money
 

4061
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,310
you really don't want to be a new money
short, right? We're at like we've done a

4062
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:18,320
short, right? We're at like we've done a
 

4063
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:22,870
short, right? We're at like we've done a
70% fade since the uh

4064
01:31:22,870 --> 01:31:22,880
70% fade since the uh
 

4065
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,950
70% fade since the uh
yesterday's high. We've pulled back over

4066
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:24,960
yesterday's high. We've pulled back over
 

4067
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,950
yesterday's high. We've pulled back over
70% now. Don't want to be new money

4068
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:26,960
70% now. Don't want to be new money
 

4069
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:32,310
70% now. Don't want to be new money
short. Blue box coming up here, folks.

4070
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:32,320

 

4071
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:37,270

And 620s on the cues.

4072
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:37,280

 

4073
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,310

Vick still going.

4074
01:31:40,310 --> 01:31:40,320
Vick still going.
 

4075
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:54,709
Vick still going.
The Vicky Vicks is still going.

4076
01:31:54,709 --> 01:31:54,719

 

4077
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:56,629

Alex, so more trapped buyers with price

4078
01:31:56,629 --> 01:31:56,639
Alex, so more trapped buyers with price
 

4079
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:59,030
Alex, so more trapped buyers with price
moving down. Is 830 in play for a

4080
01:31:59,030 --> 01:31:59,040
moving down. Is 830 in play for a
 

4081
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:03,590
moving down. Is 830 in play for a
squeeze up? For more trap buyers? Um,

4082
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:03,600
squeeze up? For more trap buyers? Um,
 

4083
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,189
squeeze up? For more trap buyers? Um,
you you need trap sellers for the

4084
01:32:05,189 --> 01:32:05,199
you you need trap sellers for the
 

4085
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:07,510
you you need trap sellers for the
squeeze up? You need trap sellers for

4086
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:07,520
squeeze up? You need trap sellers for
 

4087
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,590
squeeze up? You need trap sellers for
the squeeze up. Right now, Delta's been

4088
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:09,600
the squeeze up. Right now, Delta's been
 

4089
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,270
the squeeze up. Right now, Delta's been
very, very, very heavy this whole way

4090
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:11,280
very, very, very heavy this whole way
 

4091
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,950
very, very, very heavy this whole way
down. It just depends if and when they

4092
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:12,960
down. It just depends if and when they
 

4093
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:13,990
down. It just depends if and when they
finish with the auction. They're just

4094
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:14,000
finish with the auction. They're just
 

4095
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,390
finish with the auction. They're just
dumping inventory right now. It's

4096
01:32:16,390 --> 01:32:16,400
dumping inventory right now. It's
 

4097
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,470
dumping inventory right now. It's
probably around here. And if not, then

4098
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:18,480
probably around here. And if not, then
 

4099
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:19,910
probably around here. And if not, then
can keep coming lower. But like you

4100
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:19,920
can keep coming lower. But like you
 

4101
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,430
can keep coming lower. But like you
don't want to bid. You're going to need

4102
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:21,440
don't want to bid. You're going to need
 

4103
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,030
don't want to bid. You're going to need
trap buyers. So you're going to need if

4104
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:23,040
trap buyers. So you're going to need if
 

4105
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,390
trap buyers. So you're going to need if
you're going to play that counter trend,

4106
01:32:24,390 --> 01:32:24,400
you're going to play that counter trend,
 

4107
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,590
you're going to play that counter trend,
which I always say it's the hardest

4108
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:25,600
which I always say it's the hardest
 

4109
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,030
which I always say it's the hardest
trade in the book. I don't try and trade

4110
01:32:27,030 --> 01:32:27,040
trade in the book. I don't try and trade
 

4111
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,470
trade in the book. I don't try and trade
it. You're going to need something like

4112
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:28,480
it. You're going to need something like
 

4113
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,149
it. You're going to need something like
this. And you're going to need trap

4114
01:32:30,149 --> 01:32:30,159
this. And you're going to need trap
 

4115
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:32,470
this. And you're going to need trap
buyers, you know, down here and then a

4116
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:32,480
buyers, you know, down here and then a
 

4117
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,390
buyers, you know, down here and then a
reclaim of profile and then a squeeze

4118
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:34,400
reclaim of profile and then a squeeze
 

4119
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:35,910
reclaim of profile and then a squeeze
back up into each level. But you're

4120
01:32:35,910 --> 01:32:35,920
back up into each level. But you're
 

4121
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:37,990
back up into each level. But you're
going to need to respect each of these.

4122
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:38,000
going to need to respect each of these.
 

4123
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:52,790
going to need to respect each of these.
Now,

4124
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:52,800

 

4125
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,709

how do I get the blue boxes? I draw them

4126
01:32:54,709 --> 01:32:54,719
how do I get the blue boxes? I draw them
 

4127
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:57,669
how do I get the blue boxes? I draw them
on just based on old volume areas,

4128
01:32:57,669 --> 01:32:57,679
on just based on old volume areas,
 

4129
01:32:57,679 --> 01:32:59,270
on just based on old volume areas,
right? They're just based on old volume

4130
01:32:59,270 --> 01:32:59,280
right? They're just based on old volume
 

4131
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:05,030
right? They're just based on old volume
areas on previous week profiles.

4132
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:05,040

 

4133
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,030

What profile am I using on TV in the

4134
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:07,040
What profile am I using on TV in the
 

4135
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,470
What profile am I using on TV in the
settings? This is anchored volume

4136
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:08,480
settings? This is anchored volume
 

4137
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:11,110
settings? This is anchored volume
profile. All right. So, anchored to 930

4138
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:11,120
profile. All right. So, anchored to 930
 

4139
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,750
profile. All right. So, anchored to 930
and I set it to two ticks. If you don't

4140
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:13,760
and I set it to two ticks. If you don't
 

4141
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:15,669
and I set it to two ticks. If you don't
want ticks, you can set it to 1,000 a

4142
01:33:15,669 --> 01:33:15,679
want ticks, you can set it to 1,000 a
 

4143
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:28,310
want ticks, you can set it to 1,000 a
row.

4144
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:28,320

 

4145
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,990

So, I'm going to build out a node down

4146
01:33:29,990 --> 01:33:30,000
So, I'm going to build out a node down
 

4147
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,830
So, I'm going to build out a node down
here like we just talked about, right?

4148
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:31,840
here like we just talked about, right?
 

4149
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,110
here like we just talked about, right?
This is the type of thing you want to

4150
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:33,120
This is the type of thing you want to
 

4151
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,390
This is the type of thing you want to
see. And then you want like a flush

4152
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:34,400
see. And then you want like a flush
 

4153
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,990
see. And then you want like a flush
under it and a reclaim of it. If you're

4154
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:36,000
under it and a reclaim of it. If you're
 

4155
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,350
under it and a reclaim of it. If you're
going to be the counter trend long

4156
01:33:37,350 --> 01:33:37,360
going to be the counter trend long
 

4157
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,790
going to be the counter trend long
because we're extended away. So you want

4158
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:38,800
because we're extended away. So you want
 

4159
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,470
because we're extended away. So you want
like a flush under and a reclaim. And

4160
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:40,480
like a flush under and a reclaim. And
 

4161
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:43,350
like a flush under and a reclaim. And
then if you're absolutely adamant on

4162
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:43,360
then if you're absolutely adamant on
 

4163
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,790
then if you're absolutely adamant on
playing that counter trend, that's what

4164
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:44,800
playing that counter trend, that's what
 

4165
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,950
playing that counter trend, that's what
you'd want to see. You But for me,

4166
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:46,960
you'd want to see. You But for me,
 

4167
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,470
you'd want to see. You But for me,
you're just bidding against the tape.

4168
01:33:48,470 --> 01:33:48,480
you're just bidding against the tape.
 

4169
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:49,590
you're just bidding against the tape.
You'd need to see something like this,

4170
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:49,600
You'd need to see something like this,
 

4171
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,750
You'd need to see something like this,
this, this, this, and this. Otherwise, I

4172
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:51,760
this, this, this, and this. Otherwise, I
 

4173
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:53,430
this, this, this, and this. Otherwise, I
just would I in fact, I just wouldn't

4174
01:33:53,430 --> 01:33:53,440
just would I in fact, I just wouldn't
 

4175
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,270
just would I in fact, I just wouldn't
touch it long anyway. We're just dumping

4176
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:55,280
touch it long anyway. We're just dumping
 

4177
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,430
touch it long anyway. We're just dumping
inventory. But each to their own. I

4178
01:33:57,430 --> 01:33:57,440
inventory. But each to their own. I
 

4179
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,030
inventory. But each to their own. I
would say sellers have got caught now at

4180
01:33:59,030 --> 01:33:59,040
would say sellers have got caught now at
 

4181
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,350
would say sellers have got caught now at
30s. So, if they don't get an expansion

4182
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:01,360
30s. So, if they don't get an expansion
 

4183
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:02,870
30s. So, if they don't get an expansion
330s, they've got caught, but you're

4184
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:02,880
330s, they've got caught, but you're
 

4185
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,870
330s, they've got caught, but you're
going to need to see it pivot over this

4186
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:04,880
going to need to see it pivot over this
 

4187
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:07,189
going to need to see it pivot over this
node for you to have that counter trend

4188
01:34:07,189 --> 01:34:07,199
node for you to have that counter trend
 

4189
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:09,030
node for you to have that counter trend
long. I really would be very skeptical

4190
01:34:09,030 --> 01:34:09,040
long. I really would be very skeptical
 

4191
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:11,110
long. I really would be very skeptical
about taking anything wrongside today.

4192
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:11,120
about taking anything wrongside today.
 

4193
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:13,430
about taking anything wrongside today.
We're in a big trend down day. We're

4194
01:34:13,430 --> 01:34:13,440
We're in a big trend down day. We're
 

4195
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:16,229
We're in a big trend down day. We're
just absolutely melting. Ask yourself,

4196
01:34:16,229 --> 01:34:16,239
just absolutely melting. Ask yourself,
 

4197
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:18,709
just absolutely melting. Ask yourself,
is there a reason to do it? Blue box

4198
01:34:18,709 --> 01:34:18,719
is there a reason to do it? Blue box
 

4199
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:21,510
is there a reason to do it? Blue box
coming up here.

4200
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:21,520
coming up here.
 

4201
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,310
coming up here.
And then if we trade through this blue

4202
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:24,320
And then if we trade through this blue
 

4203
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:27,189
And then if we trade through this blue
box,

4204
01:34:27,189 --> 01:34:27,199
box,
 

4205
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:30,629
box,
probably talk about into here maybe.

4206
01:34:30,629 --> 01:34:30,639
probably talk about into here maybe.
 

4207
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:32,870
probably talk about into here maybe.
And this thin node all the way down to

4208
01:34:32,870 --> 01:34:32,880
And this thin node all the way down to
 

4209
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:46,709
And this thin node all the way down to
534s.

4210
01:34:46,709 --> 01:34:46,719

 

4211
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:58,870

So blue box now tagged.

4212
01:34:58,870 --> 01:34:58,880

 

4213
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:00,550

How often do they dump inventory every

4214
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:00,560
How often do they dump inventory every
 

4215
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:03,030
How often do they dump inventory every
one to two months? Uh, really depends

4216
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:03,040
one to two months? Uh, really depends
 

4217
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:05,350
one to two months? Uh, really depends
how extended we've got and how trapped.

4218
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:05,360
how extended we've got and how trapped.
 

4219
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,590
how extended we've got and how trapped.
Um, but if you have a look, we did it in

4220
01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:07,600
Um, but if you have a look, we did it in
 

4221
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:11,510
Um, but if you have a look, we did it in
July, did it in August,

4222
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:11,520
July, did it in August,
 

4223
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,990
July, did it in August,
we did it in October,

4224
01:35:13,990 --> 01:35:14,000
we did it in October,
 

4225
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,149
we did it in October,
we did it in November, and then we've

4226
01:35:16,149 --> 01:35:16,159
we did it in November, and then we've
 

4227
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:17,669
we did it in November, and then we've
been in a range since. This is the

4228
01:35:17,669 --> 01:35:17,679
been in a range since. This is the
 

4229
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:19,189
been in a range since. This is the
first. I guess you could argue like

4230
01:35:19,189 --> 01:35:19,199
first. I guess you could argue like
 

4231
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:21,110
first. I guess you could argue like
early December there was a bit of a

4232
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:21,120
early December there was a bit of a
 

4233
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:23,830
early December there was a bit of a
dump, but not not like this. This is on

4234
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:23,840
dump, but not not like this. This is on
 

4235
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:43,830
dump, but not not like this. This is on
a fail breakout.

4236
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:43,840

 

4237
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,470

Oh, well, there's your 500 pointer.

4238
01:35:46,470 --> 01:35:46,480
Oh, well, there's your 500 pointer.
 

4239
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:49,350
Oh, well, there's your 500 pointer.
[\h__\h] That's hard to look at, man. That

4240
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:49,360
[\h__\h] That's hard to look at, man. That
 

4241
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:51,110
[\h__\h] That's hard to look at, man. That
is hard to look at. We had the best sell

4242
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:51,120
is hard to look at. We had the best sell
 

4243
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:55,590
is hard to look at. We had the best sell
of the day.

4244
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:55,600

 

4245
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:56,950

Trading's cruel, isn't it? You think

4246
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:56,960
Trading's cruel, isn't it? You think
 

4247
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,870
Trading's cruel, isn't it? You think
you've done really well with 250 odd

4248
01:35:58,870 --> 01:35:58,880
you've done really well with 250 odd
 

4249
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,950
you've done really well with 250 odd
points

4250
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:00,960
points
 

4251
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:07,270
points
and then it does another 250 plus.

4252
01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:07,280

 

4253
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:10,310

Oh god.

4254
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:10,320
Oh god.
 

4255
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:14,310
Oh god.
Oh my god.

4256
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:14,320

 

4257
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:15,830

So, you turn it on at the start of the

4258
01:36:15,830 --> 01:36:15,840
So, you turn it on at the start of the
 

4259
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,430
So, you turn it on at the start of the
session. AP. Yeah, I anchor it at the

4260
01:36:17,430 --> 01:36:17,440
session. AP. Yeah, I anchor it at the
 

4261
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:26,950
session. AP. Yeah, I anchor it at the
start of each session.

4262
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:26,960

 

4263
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,790

Starting to see these sellers try and

4264
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:28,800
Starting to see these sellers try and
 

4265
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,870
Starting to see these sellers try and
pile in at these lows here. There still

4266
01:36:30,870 --> 01:36:30,880
pile in at these lows here. There still
 

4267
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,830
pile in at these lows here. There still
bids down lower into 600, but it's

4268
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:33,840
bids down lower into 600, but it's
 

4269
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,629
bids down lower into 600, but it's
getting a bit wonky down here.

4270
01:36:36,629 --> 01:36:36,639
getting a bit wonky down here.
 

4271
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:41,910
getting a bit wonky down here.
Definitely getting wonky down here.

4272
01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:41,920

 

4273
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,510

they get themselves caught there be a

4274
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:43,520
they get themselves caught there be a
 

4275
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,669
they get themselves caught there be a
nasty swipe.

4276
01:36:45,669 --> 01:36:45,679
nasty swipe.
 

4277
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:53,350
nasty swipe.
They are piling in right now.

4278
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:53,360

 

4279
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,510

The long would happen for a base over

4280
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:55,520
The long would happen for a base over
 

4281
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:58,149
The long would happen for a base over
640 in my mind. Over 640 there's

4282
01:36:58,149 --> 01:36:58,159
640 in my mind. Over 640 there's
 

4283
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:00,629
640 in my mind. Over 640 there's
potential for a squeeze just a small

4284
01:37:00,629 --> 01:37:00,639
potential for a squeeze just a small
 

4285
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:01,990
potential for a squeeze just a small
counter trend squeeze. So here's the

4286
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:02,000
counter trend squeeze. So here's the
 

4287
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,830
counter trend squeeze. So here's the
move back towards 640 probably. So it

4288
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:03,840
move back towards 640 probably. So it
 

4289
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,910
move back towards 640 probably. So it
all depends if they defend this or not.

4290
01:37:05,910 --> 01:37:05,920
all depends if they defend this or not.
 

4291
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:12,390
all depends if they defend this or not.
Now,

4292
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:12,400

 

4293
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,149

where did we tap then? 35s. And they

4294
01:37:14,149 --> 01:37:14,159
where did we tap then? 35s. And they
 

4295
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:16,149
where did we tap then? 35s. And they
defended it successfully. So, still no

4296
01:37:16,149 --> 01:37:16,159
defended it successfully. So, still no
 

4297
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:18,310
defended it successfully. So, still no
squeeze over 40s. The gray box still

4298
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:18,320
squeeze over 40s. The gray box still
 

4299
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,750
squeeze over 40s. The gray box still
holding up, right? Gray box still

4300
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:19,760
holding up, right? Gray box still
 

4301
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:32,470
holding up, right? Gray box still
holding up.

4302
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:32,480

 

4303
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,950

When I trade Ninja, do I use ATMs? I do.

4304
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:34,960
When I trade Ninja, do I use ATMs? I do.
 

4305
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:37,109
When I trade Ninja, do I use ATMs? I do.
Yes.

4306
01:37:37,109 --> 01:37:37,119
Yes.
 

4307
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:39,590
Yes.
Uh I just trade I I use a minute chart

4308
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:39,600
Uh I just trade I I use a minute chart
 

4309
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,189
Uh I just trade I I use a minute chart
but I have a third party um

4310
01:37:43,189 --> 01:37:43,199
but I have a third party um
 

4311
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:46,310
but I have a third party um
uh city for my profiles. All right. So

4312
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:46,320
uh city for my profiles. All right. So
 

4313
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:52,790
uh city for my profiles. All right. So
like this.

4314
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:52,800

 

4315
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,870

All right. So come back to these 40s. If

4316
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:54,880
All right. So come back to these 40s. If
 

4317
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,470
All right. So come back to these 40s. If
they can base over 40s, there's probably

4318
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:56,480
they can base over 40s, there's probably
 

4319
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,790
they can base over 40s, there's probably
some relief back up towards 90s, but not

4320
01:37:58,790 --> 01:37:58,800
some relief back up towards 90s, but not
 

4321
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:00,390
some relief back up towards 90s, but not
unless they base over it. This is very

4322
01:38:00,390 --> 01:38:00,400
unless they base over it. This is very
 

4323
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:01,510
unless they base over it. This is very
much like earlier. Remember every time

4324
01:38:01,510 --> 01:38:01,520
much like earlier. Remember every time
 

4325
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,790
much like earlier. Remember every time
they've tried to do that, the same

4326
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:02,800
they've tried to do that, the same
 

4327
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,470
they've tried to do that, the same
stories here. They pushed and pushed and

4328
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:04,480
stories here. They pushed and pushed and
 

4329
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:07,189
stories here. They pushed and pushed and
pushed and kept getting sold into. So

4330
01:38:07,189 --> 01:38:07,199
pushed and kept getting sold into. So
 

4331
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:09,189
pushed and kept getting sold into. So
there will not be a trigger long and

4332
01:38:09,189 --> 01:38:09,199
there will not be a trigger long and
 

4333
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:10,790
there will not be a trigger long and
that will be bottom picking by the way,

4334
01:38:10,790 --> 01:38:10,800
that will be bottom picking by the way,
 

4335
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,229
that will be bottom picking by the way,
but there will not be that counter trend

4336
01:38:12,229 --> 01:38:12,239
but there will not be that counter trend
 

4337
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:14,709
but there will not be that counter trend
trigger long until

4338
01:38:14,709 --> 01:38:14,719
trigger long until
 

4339
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:17,189
trigger long until
you see this move here. All right, until

4340
01:38:17,189 --> 01:38:17,199
you see this move here. All right, until
 

4341
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:18,629
you see this move here. All right, until
you see that and pull back and hold

4342
01:38:18,629 --> 01:38:18,639
you see that and pull back and hold
 

4343
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:19,910
you see that and pull back and hold
until that all the time they're doing

4344
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:19,920
until that all the time they're doing
 

4345
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,430
until that all the time they're doing
that, they're going to keep digging

4346
01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:21,440
that, they're going to keep digging
 

4347
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,950
that, they're going to keep digging
lower and lower and lower and lower

4348
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:22,960
lower and lower and lower and lower
 

4349
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:33,669
lower and lower and lower and lower
until they're done with it.

4350
01:38:33,669 --> 01:38:33,679

 

4351
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:35,109

What's the next trade long? I think I

4352
01:38:35,109 --> 01:38:35,119
What's the next trade long? I think I
 

4353
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:37,430
What's the next trade long? I think I
just showed it for you. Right. It's over

4354
01:38:37,430 --> 01:38:37,440
just showed it for you. Right. It's over
 

4355
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,350
just showed it for you. Right. It's over
40. It will be a trigger over 40. Here's

4356
01:38:39,350 --> 01:38:39,360
40. It will be a trigger over 40. Here's
 

4357
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:41,510
40. It will be a trigger over 40. Here's
the approach of 40.

4358
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:41,520
the approach of 40.
 

4359
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:42,950
the approach of 40.
Sellers trying to defend this. If they

4360
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:42,960
Sellers trying to defend this. If they
 

4361
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,470
Sellers trying to defend this. If they
can't defend this, we will see a squeeze

4362
01:38:44,470 --> 01:38:44,480
can't defend this, we will see a squeeze
 

4363
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:45,830
can't defend this, we will see a squeeze
up. There is an imbalance all the way up

4364
01:38:45,830 --> 01:38:45,840
up. There is an imbalance all the way up
 

4365
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,669
up. There is an imbalance all the way up
to 64. And it's very possible we'd lift

4366
01:38:47,669 --> 01:38:47,679
to 64. And it's very possible we'd lift
 

4367
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:49,830
to 64. And it's very possible we'd lift
all the way up to 90 if they can base

4368
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:49,840
all the way up to 90 if they can base
 

4369
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,390
all the way up to 90 if they can base
through 40. So, come on. Catch up,

4370
01:38:52,390 --> 01:38:52,400
through 40. So, come on. Catch up,
 

4371
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,790
through 40. So, come on. Catch up,
please. There we go. Not you guys. I'm

4372
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:54,800
please. There we go. Not you guys. I'm
 

4373
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:58,629
please. There we go. Not you guys. I'm
talking to But she keeps pausing on me.

4374
01:38:58,629 --> 01:38:58,639
talking to But she keeps pausing on me.
 

4375

So 40 is the level. This gray box the

4376
01:39:00,470 --> 01:39:00,480
So 40 is the level. This gray box the
 

4377
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,229
So 40 is the level. This gray box the
level. Can they base over it and forces

4378
01:39:02,229 --> 01:39:02,239
level. Can they base over it and forces
 

4379
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:06,550
level. Can they base over it and forces
squeeze up

4380
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:06,560

 

4381
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,310

a chance to do it now? It's now or never

4382
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:08,320
a chance to do it now? It's now or never
 

4383
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,790
a chance to do it now? It's now or never
if they're going to do it. Nope. So they

4384
01:39:10,790 --> 01:39:10,800
if they're going to do it. Nope. So they
 

4385
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:16,470
if they're going to do it. Nope. So they
just failed there again.

4386
01:39:16,470 --> 01:39:16,480

 

4387
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,229

Oh, someone's just come in. Some big

4388
01:39:18,229 --> 01:39:18,239
Oh, someone's just come in. Some big
 

4389
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:19,590
Oh, someone's just come in. Some big
boy's coming in there trying to absorb

4390
01:39:19,590 --> 01:39:19,600
boy's coming in there trying to absorb
 

4391
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:23,990
boy's coming in there trying to absorb
the tape. I'm not convinced.

4392
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:24,000
the tape. I'm not convinced.
 

4393
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,669
the tape. I'm not convinced.
What's your game, mate?

4394
01:39:27,669 --> 01:39:27,679
What's your game, mate?
 

4395
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:29,510
What's your game, mate?
I would say sellers are caught under 20

4396
01:39:29,510 --> 01:39:29,520
I would say sellers are caught under 20
 

4397
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:32,229
I would say sellers are caught under 20
at the moment. So I guess that's their

4398
01:39:32,229 --> 01:39:32,239
at the moment. So I guess that's their
 

4399
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:35,189
at the moment. So I guess that's their
pain point. If if it bases above 20 and

4400
01:39:35,189 --> 01:39:35,199
pain point. If if it bases above 20 and
 

4401
01:39:35,199 --> 01:39:36,790
pain point. If if it bases above 20 and
holds between 20 and 40 and then

4402
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:36,800
holds between 20 and 40 and then
 

4403
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,390
holds between 20 and 40 and then
squeezes through 40, they can use their

4404
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:38,400
squeezes through 40, they can use their
 

4405
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,709
squeezes through 40, they can use their
pain. But if we come back under 20,

4406
01:39:40,709 --> 01:39:40,719
pain. But if we come back under 20,
 

4407
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:42,470
pain. But if we come back under 20,
those sellers are in control of this

4408
01:39:42,470 --> 01:39:42,480
those sellers are in control of this
 

4409
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:45,030
those sellers are in control of this

just I'm just talking about uh what I'm
 

4415

just I'm just talking about uh what I'm
seeing here

4416
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:57,760

 

4417
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:00,310

this level
here

4420
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:04,000

 

4421
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,990

is 20. If they sell through this

4422
01:40:05,990 --> 01:40:06,000
is 20. If they sell through this
 

4423
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:15,910
is 20. If they sell through this
obviously we move lower

4424
01:40:15,910 --> 01:40:15,920

 

4425
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:17,910

and starting to sell through. So, no no

4426
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:17,920
and starting to sell through. So, no no
 

4427
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,310
and starting to sell through. So, no no
base over 40s, failure over 40s again,

base over 40s, failure over 40s again,

just like we talked about up here. No,

4430
01:40:22,709 --> 01:40:22,719
just like we talked about up here. No,
 

4431
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:26,390
just like we talked about up here. No,
no bid over 40 and down to the 600.

01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:26,400
no bid over 40 and down to the 600.

no bid over 40 and down to the 600.
Let's see if they're adding liquidity

4434
01:40:27,669 --> 01:40:27,679
Let's see if they're adding liquidity
 

4435
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:31,510
Let's see if they're adding liquidity
lower.

Just full dump of inventory. 80 is
 

4439
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:34,709
Just full dump of inventory. 80 is
coming up here. You can see them adding

4440
01:40:34,709 --> 01:40:34,719
coming up here. You can see them adding
 

4441
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:37,109
coming up here. You can see them adding
on the book really low now into the edge

4442
01:40:37,109 --> 01:40:37,119
on the book really low now into the edge
 

4443

on the book really low now into the edge
of this next blue box.

There is a low volume though down to

There is a low volume though down to
 

4447
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,669
There is a low volume though down to
523s. Now I am like starting to get very

4448
01:40:45,669 --> 01:40:45,679
523s. Now I am like starting to get very
 

4449
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:49,510
523s. Now I am like starting to get very
very upset at this point.

4450
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:49,520
very upset at this point.
 

4451
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:50,950
very upset at this point.
How much money am I going to feel like

4452
01:40:50,950 --> 01:40:50,960
How much money am I going to feel like
 

4453
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,390
How much money am I going to feel like
I've left on the table by the end of the

I've left on the table by the end of the

4457
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:58,950

It doesn't matter about the news, guys.

It doesn't matter about the news, guys.
 

4459

It doesn't matter about the news, guys.
News doesn't matter. You got to

News doesn't matter. You got to
 

4461
01:41:00,159 --> 01:41:02,070
News doesn't matter. You got to
understand news is just a catalyst. All

understand news is just a catalyst. All
 

4463

understand news is just a catalyst. All
right? This is a dump a dumping of

right? This is a dump a dumping of
 

4465
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:07,669
right? This is a dump a dumping of
inventory based on who's trapped in the

01:41:07,669 --> 01:41:07,679
inventory based on who's trapped in the
 

4467
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:09,350
inventory based on who's trapped in the
market. Don't worry about it. Like all

01:41:09,350 --> 01:41:09,360
market. Don't worry about it. Like all
 

4469
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:11,189
market. Don't worry about it. Like all
we're really doing what's actually

01:41:11,189 --> 01:41:11,199
we're really doing what's actually
 

4471
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:13,270
we're really doing what's actually
changed, right? Maybe we go down to this

4472
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:13,280
changed, right? Maybe we go down to this
 

4473
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,270
changed, right? Maybe we go down to this
apolog by the end of the day. But all

4474
01:41:15,270 --> 01:41:15,280
apolog by the end of the day. But all

01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:17,830
apolog by the end of the day. But all
we're actually doing is coming back into

01:41:17,830 --> 01:41:17,840
we're actually doing is coming back into
 

4477
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,510
we're actually doing is coming back into
mean. I mean, we have gone past the

4478
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:19,520
mean. I mean, we have gone past the
 

4479
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,189
mean. I mean, we have gone past the
mean. But if you look at where we've

4480
01:41:21,189 --> 01:41:21,199
mean. But if you look at where we've
 

4481
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:23,750
mean. But if you look at where we've
traded really from the highs, the

4482
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:23,760
traded really from the highs, the
 

4483
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:25,510
traded really from the highs, the
all-time highs that we put in down to

4484
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:25,520
all-time highs that we put in down to
 

4485
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:27,030
all-time highs that we put in down to
that sort of November low, and then you

4486
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:27,040
that sort of November low, and then you
 

4487
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,229
that sort of November low, and then you
look at the range that we created

4488
01:41:28,229 --> 01:41:28,239
look at the range that we created
 

4489
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:29,510
look at the range that we created
before, all we've done is a failed

4490
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:29,520
before, all we've done is a failed
 

4491
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:31,109
before, all we've done is a failed
breakout. We've gone over it so many

4492
01:41:31,109 --> 01:41:31,119
breakout. We've gone over it so many
 

4493
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:33,189
breakout. We've gone over it so many
times. It's a failed breakout. That's

4494
01:41:33,189 --> 01:41:33,199
times. It's a failed breakout. That's
 

4495
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:35,109
times. It's a failed breakout. That's
all we've done. Failed breakout. Trading

4496
01:41:35,109 --> 01:41:35,119
all we've done. Failed breakout. Trading
 

4497
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:37,990
all we've done. Failed breakout. Trading
back inside. I am starting to like look

4498
01:41:37,990 --> 01:41:38,000
back inside. I am starting to like look
 

4499
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,830
back inside. I am starting to like look
at this chart thinking are we actually

4500
01:41:39,830 --> 01:41:39,840
at this chart thinking are we actually
 

4501
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,430
at this chart thinking are we actually
coming for that lower ballinger band

4502
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:41,440
coming for that lower ballinger band
 

4503
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,830
coming for that lower ballinger band
today? Are we actually going to trade

4504
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:43,840
today? Are we actually going to trade
 

4505
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,750
today? Are we actually going to trade
top bowl to low bowl? The last day we

4506
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:45,760
top bowl to low bowl? The last day we
 

4507
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,950
top bowl to low bowl? The last day we
did that was October the 9th. October

4508
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:48,960
did that was October the 9th. October
 

4509
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:50,550
did that was October the 9th. October
the 9th we did that exact trade. We

4510
01:41:50,550 --> 01:41:50,560
the 9th we did that exact trade. We
 

4511
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:54,070
the 9th we did that exact trade. We
traded top bowl to low ball

4512
01:41:54,070 --> 01:41:54,080
traded top bowl to low ball
 

4513
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:58,550
traded top bowl to low ball
on a daily which is a four sigma move

4514
01:41:58,550 --> 01:41:58,560
on a daily which is a four sigma move
 

4515
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:02,470
on a daily which is a four sigma move
which is insane. It's absolutely insane,

4516
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:02,480
which is insane. It's absolutely insane,
 

4517
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:12,950
which is insane. It's absolutely insane,
but it has happened.

4518
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:12,960

 

4519
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,070

Yeah, it would be four standard

4520
01:42:14,070 --> 01:42:14,080
Yeah, it would be four standard
 

4521
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:15,590
Yeah, it would be four standard
deviations, Brandon. Yeah. So, if you

4522
01:42:15,590 --> 01:42:15,600
deviations, Brandon. Yeah. So, if you
 

4523
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:17,430
deviations, Brandon. Yeah. So, if you
look back on a daily chart with your

4524
01:42:17,430 --> 01:42:17,440
look back on a daily chart with your
 

4525
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,510
look back on a daily chart with your
Ballinger bands on, go back to Friday

4526
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:19,520
Ballinger bands on, go back to Friday
 

4527
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:22,629
Ballinger bands on, go back to Friday
the 10th of October. That was the last

4528
01:42:22,629 --> 01:42:22,639
the 10th of October. That was the last
 

4529
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:24,229
the 10th of October. That was the last
time we did it. It's a very rare

4530
01:42:24,229 --> 01:42:24,239
time we did it. It's a very rare
 

4531
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:26,790
time we did it. It's a very rare
occasion to do that, but we have done

4532
01:42:26,790 --> 01:42:26,800
occasion to do that, but we have done
 

4533
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,830
occasion to do that, but we have done
it.

4534
01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:29,840

 

4535
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,870

4547
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:58,709

straight up 50-day next stop for the

4548
01:42:58,709 --> 01:42:58,719
straight up 50-day next stop for the
 

4549
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:04,149
straight up 50-day next stop for the
cues probably.

4550
01:43:04,149 --> 01:43:04,159

 

4551
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:12,070

Oh, Alex.

Um,
 

4555
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:22,229
Um,
just do an expansion of IB just to see.

4556
01:43:22,229 --> 01:43:22,239

 

4557
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:25,669

I feel like it's doable then.

4558
01:43:25,669 --> 01:43:25,679
I feel like it's doable then.
 

4559
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:28,390
I feel like it's doable then.

4569
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,510

How would you know when a big move like

4570
01:43:51,510 --> 01:43:51,520
How would you know when a big move like
 

4571
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:53,910
How would you know when a big move like
today happens? Um, well, you don't. You

4572
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:53,920
today happens? Um, well, you don't. You
 

4573
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:56,390
today happens? Um, well, you don't. You
just position for it.

4574
01:43:56,390 --> 01:43:56,400
just position for it.
 

4575
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,310
just position for it.
There's no guarantees. Like, you have to

4576
01:43:58,310 --> 01:43:58,320
There's no guarantees. Like, you have to
 

4577
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,390
There's no guarantees. Like, you have to
position when we leave volume and you

4578
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:00,400
position when we leave volume and you
 

4579
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,149
position when we leave volume and you
have to take partials by looking left

4580
01:44:02,149 --> 01:44:02,159
have to take partials by looking left
 

4581
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:04,950
have to take partials by looking left
into each key level. Um, you don't know

4582
01:44:04,950 --> 01:44:04,960
into each key level. Um, you don't know
 

4583
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:06,229
into each key level. Um, you don't know
that it's going to come down and do

4584
01:44:06,229 --> 01:44:06,239
that it's going to come down and do
 

4585
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:07,510
that it's going to come down and do
this. There's no way there's no clear

4586
01:44:07,510 --> 01:44:07,520
this. There's no way there's no clear
 

4587
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:08,950
this. There's no way there's no clear
way of saying that you know that. We

4588
01:44:08,950 --> 01:44:08,960
way of saying that you know that. We
 

4589
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,709
way of saying that you know that. We
don't know where it's going to stop. We

4590
01:44:10,709 --> 01:44:10,719
don't know where it's going to stop. We
 

4591
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:13,189
don't know where it's going to stop. We
have ideas. You can see each blue box.

4592
01:44:13,189 --> 01:44:13,199
have ideas. You can see each blue box.
 

4593
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:14,790
have ideas. You can see each blue box.
We find a bid. We find a bid, but we're

4594
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:14,800
We find a bid. We find a bid, but we're
 

4595
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,070
We find a bid. We find a bid, but we're
trading through it. So then it's like

4596
01:44:16,070 --> 01:44:16,080
trading through it. So then it's like
 

4597
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:17,669
trading through it. So then it's like
next level, next level, next level. Let

4598
01:44:17,669 --> 01:44:17,679
next level, next level, next level. Let
 

4599
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:19,270
next level, next level, next level. Let
me just put 470 on because that's

4600
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:19,280
me just put 470 on because that's
 

4601
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:22,550
me just put 470 on because that's
previous week. Um,

4602
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:22,560
previous week. Um,
 

4603
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:26,470
previous week. Um,
open. Just make sure I get it on.

4604
01:44:26,470 --> 01:44:26,480
open. Just make sure I get it on.
 

4605
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:28,229
open. Just make sure I get it on.
In fact, I can just turn it on my flow

4606
01:44:28,229 --> 01:44:28,239
In fact, I can just turn it on my flow
 

4607
01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:33,350
In fact, I can just turn it on my flow
zones. Hang on.

4608
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:33,360

 

4609
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,189

Previous week open. Let's put that to

4610
01:44:35,189 --> 01:44:35,199
Previous week open. Let's put that to
 

4611
01:44:35,199 --> 01:44:38,390
Previous week open. Let's put that to
gray.

4613
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:47,669

should have gone on. There we go.

4614
01:44:47,669 --> 01:44:47,679

 

4615
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:50,310

Yeah, just a normal normal uh Ballinger

Yeah, just a normal normal uh Ballinger

Yeah, just a normal normal uh Ballinger
bands. They should always be set then

4618
01:44:52,709 --> 01:44:52,719
bands. They should always be set then
 

4619
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:54,310
bands. They should always be set then
normally they are always too standard.

01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:17,840
What do you reckon? Apple save the day
 

4635
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:27,910
What do you reckon? Apple save the day
and we rip rip it right back up.

4636
01:45:27,910 --> 01:45:27,920

 

4637
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:30,790

What's my strategy, Alex? Um, close my

4638
01:45:30,790 --> 01:45:30,800
What's my strategy, Alex? Um, close my
 

4639
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:36,950
What's my strategy, Alex? Um, close my
eyes and guess.

4640
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:36,960

 

4641
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:38,550

My strategy is ju just to play the

4642
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:38,560
My strategy is ju just to play the
 

4643
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,109
My strategy is ju just to play the
protrend where possible. And so like

4644
01:45:41,109 --> 01:45:41,119
protrend where possible. And so like
 

4645
01:45:41,119 --> 01:45:43,350
protrend where possible. And so like
when we left value today, the protren

4646
01:45:43,350 --> 01:45:43,360
when we left value today, the protren
 

4647
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:46,550
when we left value today, the protren
became down for the day.

4648
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:46,560
became down for the day.
 

4649
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:49,669
became down for the day.
That's my that's my uh strategy.

4650
01:45:49,669 --> 01:45:49,679
That's my that's my uh strategy.
 

4651
01:45:49,679 --> 01:46:05,189
That's my that's my uh strategy.
And then finding ways of joining up

4652
01:46:05,189 --> 01:46:05,199

 

4653
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:06,870

Every flag is working. Yeah, it is. They

4654
01:46:06,870 --> 01:46:06,880
Every flag is working. Yeah, it is. They
 

4655
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:09,030
Every flag is working. Yeah, it is. They
keep selling off. It's just like you got

4656
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:09,040
keep selling off. It's just like you got
 

4657
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:10,149
keep selling off. It's just like you got
to understand like if you're playing

4658
01:46:10,149 --> 01:46:10,159
to understand like if you're playing
 

4659
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:13,030
to understand like if you're playing
these these like breakdowns,

4660
01:46:13,030 --> 01:46:13,040
these these like breakdowns,
 

4661
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:14,790
these these like breakdowns,
you're

4662
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:14,800
you're
 

4663
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:17,189
you're
play you're playing like deep discount.

4664
01:46:17,189 --> 01:46:17,199
play you're playing like deep discount.
 

4665
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:19,350
play you're playing like deep discount.
You're selling deep discount to go lower

4666
01:46:19,350 --> 01:46:19,360
You're selling deep discount to go lower
 

4667
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:21,910
You're selling deep discount to go lower
is so risky. It's not how I like to

4668
01:46:21,910 --> 01:46:21,920
is so risky. It's not how I like to
 

4669
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,830
is so risky. It's not how I like to
play. I like to position myself short in

4670
01:46:23,830 --> 01:46:23,840
play. I like to position myself short in
 

4671
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:26,310
play. I like to position myself short in
premium to get to discount

4672
01:46:26,310 --> 01:46:26,320
premium to get to discount
 

4673
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:32,229
premium to get to discount
based on value.

4674
01:46:32,229 --> 01:46:32,239

 

4675
01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:34,470

Big seller came in at 560. That's like a

4676
01:46:34,470 --> 01:46:34,480
Big seller came in at 560. That's like a
 

4677
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,390
Big seller came in at 560. That's like a
big level now. Big seller came in at

4678
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:36,400
big level now. Big seller came in at
 

4679
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:39,189
big level now. Big seller came in at
560.

4680
01:46:39,189 --> 01:46:39,199
560.
 

4681
01:46:39,199 --> 01:46:41,109
560.
Here's the move back to 560 where they

4682
01:46:41,109 --> 01:46:41,119
Here's the move back to 560 where they
 

4683
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:42,709
Here's the move back to 560 where they
were. Are they going to refresh here? If

4684
01:46:42,709 --> 01:46:42,719
were. Are they going to refresh here? If
 

4685
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:46,950
were. Are they going to refresh here? If
they don't,

4686
01:46:46,950 --> 01:46:46,960

 

4687
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:51,669

big relief

4688
01:46:51,669 --> 01:46:51,679

 

4689
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:54,310

through that 560. That's the squeeze

4690
01:46:54,310 --> 01:46:54,320
through that 560. That's the squeeze
 

4691
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,870
through that 560. That's the squeeze
watching now. We did trap now. So 560 is

4692
01:46:56,870 --> 01:46:56,880
watching now. We did trap now. So 560 is
 

4693
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:01,109
watching now. We did trap now. So 560 is
a big big big level.

4694
01:47:01,109 --> 01:47:01,119
a big big big level.
 

4695
01:47:01,119 --> 01:47:02,470
a big big big level.
They're starting to offer a bid now and

4696
01:47:02,470 --> 01:47:02,480
They're starting to offer a bid now and
 

4697
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:03,910
They're starting to offer a bid now and
try and walk it up. I'm interested in

4698
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:03,920
try and walk it up. I'm interested in
 

4699
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:08,070
try and walk it up. I'm interested in
this for a little upside squeeze here.

4700
01:47:08,070 --> 01:47:08,080
this for a little upside squeeze here.
 

4701
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:10,070
this for a little upside squeeze here.
Thank you.

4702
01:47:10,070 --> 01:47:10,080
Thank you.
 

4703
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:13,109
Thank you.
Let's see if they hold 60s

4704
01:47:13,109 --> 01:47:13,119
Let's see if they hold 60s
 

4705
01:47:13,119 --> 01:47:15,109
Let's see if they hold 60s
and come and revisit 37s. Here they

4706
01:47:15,109 --> 01:47:15,119
and come and revisit 37s. Here they
 

4707
01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:17,510
and come and revisit 37s. Here they
come.

4708
01:47:17,510 --> 01:47:17,520
come.
 

4709
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:21,109
come.
What a flyer.

4710
01:47:21,109 --> 01:47:21,119

 

4711
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:23,109

So, probably going to revisit the 600s

4712
01:47:23,109 --> 01:47:23,119
So, probably going to revisit the 600s
 

4713
01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:25,270
So, probably going to revisit the 600s
and possibly the 37s. I'm going to make

4714
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:25,280
and possibly the 37s. I'm going to make
 

4715
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:30,470
and possibly the 37s. I'm going to make
too much [\h__\h] money on this.

4716
01:47:30,470 --> 01:47:30,480

 

4717
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:32,310

My next problem, right, got to sell

4718
01:47:32,310 --> 01:47:32,320
My next problem, right, got to sell
 

4719
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,470
My next problem, right, got to sell
that. Made too much money. Only buy a

4720
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:34,480
that. Made too much money. Only buy a
 

4721
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:39,669
that. Made too much money. Only buy a
little bit.

4722
01:47:39,669 --> 01:47:39,679

 

4723
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:47,270

This game.

4724
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:47,280

 

4725
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:49,510

So, why was I interested there? The big

4726
01:47:49,510 --> 01:47:49,520
So, why was I interested there? The big
 

4727
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:53,189
So, why was I interested there? The big
seller got himself caught.

4728
01:47:53,189 --> 01:47:53,199
seller got himself caught.
 

4729
01:47:53,199 --> 01:47:55,430
seller got himself caught.
There's the relief through it. The

4730
01:47:55,430 --> 01:47:55,440
There's the relief through it. The
 

4731
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,189
There's the relief through it. The
seller actually came in at 60s. I'll try

4732
01:47:57,189 --> 01:47:57,199
seller actually came in at 60s. I'll try
 

4733
01:47:57,199 --> 01:48:00,070
seller actually came in at 60s. I'll try
and show you him here. All right. the

4734
01:48:00,070 --> 01:48:00,080
and show you him here. All right. the
 

4735
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:02,229
and show you him here. All right. the
seller. Big seller here. So, selling at

4736
01:48:02,229 --> 01:48:02,239
seller. Big seller here. So, selling at
 

4737
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:04,149
seller. Big seller here. So, selling at
the lows. Good auction at lows. 60 was

4738
01:48:04,149 --> 01:48:04,159
the lows. Good auction at lows. 60 was
 

4739
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:05,830
the lows. Good auction at lows. 60 was
their trigger point. Right. Once we got

4740
01:48:05,830 --> 01:48:05,840
their trigger point. Right. Once we got
 

4741
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,669
their trigger point. Right. Once we got
through 60s, there's the relief up into

4742
01:48:07,669 --> 01:48:07,679
through 60s, there's the relief up into
 

4743
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:09,669
through 60s, there's the relief up into
this imbalance. So, you should be taking

4744
01:48:09,669 --> 01:48:09,679
this imbalance. So, you should be taking
 

4745
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:11,830
this imbalance. So, you should be taking
partials now. I wasn't going to trade

4746
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:11,840
partials now. I wasn't going to trade
 

4747
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:13,189
partials now. I wasn't going to trade
it, but once I saw him have that much

4748
01:48:13,189 --> 01:48:13,199
it, but once I saw him have that much
 

4749
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:14,550
it, but once I saw him have that much
size at the lows, I just thought, you

4750
01:48:14,550 --> 01:48:14,560
size at the lows, I just thought, you
 

4751
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:17,109
size at the lows, I just thought, you
absolute idiot. What are you doing? Um,

4752
01:48:17,109 --> 01:48:17,119
absolute idiot. What are you doing? Um,
 

4753
01:48:17,119 --> 01:48:18,870
absolute idiot. What are you doing? Um,
so now it's very simple. Pullbacks need

4754
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:18,880
so now it's very simple. Pullbacks need
 

4755
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:22,229
so now it's very simple. Pullbacks need
to hold into these imbalances for that

4756
01:48:22,229 --> 01:48:22,239
to hold into these imbalances for that
 

4757
01:48:22,239 --> 01:48:25,030
to hold into these imbalances for that
rotation higher. And you'd be targeting

4758
01:48:25,030 --> 01:48:25,040
rotation higher. And you'd be targeting
 

4759
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:28,870
rotation higher. And you'd be targeting
the next level of 640s.

4760
01:48:28,870 --> 01:48:28,880

 

4761
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:29,830

Right? All right. So, remember they got

4762
01:48:29,830 --> 01:48:29,840
Right? All right. So, remember they got
 

4763
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:31,910
Right? All right. So, remember they got
trapped here. We can do this trap level

4764
01:48:31,910 --> 01:48:31,920
trapped here. We can do this trap level
 

4765
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:33,350
trapped here. We can do this trap level
right here. This is where they're stuck

4766
01:48:33,350 --> 01:48:33,360
right here. This is where they're stuck
 

4767
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:37,109
right here. This is where they're stuck
from. They got stuck here and under.

4768
01:48:37,109 --> 01:48:37,119
from. They got stuck here and under.
 

4769
01:48:37,119 --> 01:48:39,990
from. They got stuck here and under.
I'm actually going to

4770
01:48:39,990 --> 01:48:40,000
I'm actually going to
 

4771
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,070
I'm actually going to
leave this on for a second and see if we

4772
01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:42,080
leave this on for a second and see if we
 

4773
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:43,510
leave this on for a second and see if we
get over 40s. Now, I'm going to have to

4774
01:48:43,510 --> 01:48:43,520
get over 40s. Now, I'm going to have to
 

4775
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:44,870
get over 40s. Now, I'm going to have to
switch accounts here. There too much

4776
01:48:44,870 --> 01:48:44,880
switch accounts here. There too much
 

4777
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:49,350
switch accounts here. There too much
money on that account.

4778
01:48:49,350 --> 01:48:49,360

 

4779
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:50,790

Yeah, I went long just for the squeeze

4780
01:48:50,790 --> 01:48:50,800
Yeah, I went long just for the squeeze
 

4781
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:53,189
Yeah, I went long just for the squeeze
up. Once we reclaim that 60s, I'm

4782
01:48:53,189 --> 01:48:53,199
up. Once we reclaim that 60s, I'm
 

4783
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:56,470
up. Once we reclaim that 60s, I'm
already out of it.

4784
01:48:56,470 --> 01:48:56,480
already out of it.
 

4785
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,390
already out of it.
And I'm watching this node here into 40s

4786
01:48:58,390 --> 01:48:58,400
And I'm watching this node here into 40s
 

4787
01:48:58,400 --> 01:48:59,750
And I'm watching this node here into 40s
to see if we get over that, I'll

4788
01:48:59,750 --> 01:48:59,760
to see if we get over that, I'll
 

4789
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:02,149
to see if we get over that, I'll
consider an ad. And if we dip down and

4790
01:49:02,149 --> 01:49:02,159
consider an ad. And if we dip down and
 

4791
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:04,550
consider an ad. And if we dip down and
hold,

4792
01:49:04,550 --> 01:49:04,560
hold,
 

4793
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:05,990
hold,
we'll see. It won't even be an ad. It'll

4794
01:49:05,990 --> 01:49:06,000
we'll see. It won't even be an ad. It'll
 

4795
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,109
we'll see. It won't even be an ad. It'll
be a fresh position because I'm already

4796
01:49:07,109 --> 01:49:07,119
be a fresh position because I'm already
 

4797
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:08,629
be a fresh position because I'm already
out on that first account. Made too much

4798
01:49:08,629 --> 01:49:08,639
out on that first account. Made too much
 

4799
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:11,350
out on that first account. Made too much
money. It was

4800
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:11,360
money. It was
 

4801
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:14,950
money. It was
well over the uh 30%.

4802
01:49:14,950 --> 01:49:14,960
well over the uh 30%.
 

4803
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:16,950
well over the uh 30%.
Let's see.

4804
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:16,960
Let's see.
 

4805
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,790
Let's see.
Remember 60s is the key level here.

4806
01:49:18,790 --> 01:49:18,800
Remember 60s is the key level here.
 

4807
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,709
Remember 60s is the key level here.
Buyers will need to defend 60s here. We

4808
01:49:20,709 --> 01:49:20,719
Buyers will need to defend 60s here. We
 

4809
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:22,310
Buyers will need to defend 60s here. We
are still in a trend down. I want you to

4810
01:49:22,310 --> 01:49:22,320
are still in a trend down. I want you to
 

4811
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:24,790
are still in a trend down. I want you to
remind you that. I'm just interested how

4812
01:49:24,790 --> 01:49:24,800
remind you that. I'm just interested how
 

4813
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:35,830
remind you that. I'm just interested how
we act into here.

4814
01:49:35,830 --> 01:49:35,840

 

4815
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,510

still holding it well so far. Well in

4816
01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:37,520
still holding it well so far. Well in
 

4817
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:40,229
still holding it well so far. Well in
front of it. There are imbalances all

4818
01:49:40,229 --> 01:49:40,239
front of it. There are imbalances all
 

4819
01:49:40,239 --> 01:49:42,470
front of it. There are imbalances all
the way down to 48. Downside there

4820
01:49:42,470 --> 01:49:42,480
the way down to 48. Downside there
 

4821
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:53,030
the way down to 48. Downside there
imbalances upside up to uh 626.

4822
01:49:53,030 --> 01:49:53,040

 

4823
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:54,149

I really want to see if we can live

4824
01:49:54,149 --> 01:49:54,159
I really want to see if we can live
 

4825
01:49:54,159 --> 01:49:56,149
I really want to see if we can live
through 40s or or come back and test

4826
01:49:56,149 --> 01:49:56,159
through 40s or or come back and test
 

4827
01:49:56,159 --> 01:50:07,430
through 40s or or come back and test
40s. At the moment, not.

4828
01:50:07,430 --> 01:50:07,440

 

4829
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:08,790

How do I figure out the seller down

4830
01:50:08,790 --> 01:50:08,800
How do I figure out the seller down
 

4831
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:11,189
How do I figure out the seller down
there again? Delta bookmap and

4832
01:50:11,189 --> 01:50:11,199
there again? Delta bookmap and
 

4833
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:13,109
there again? Delta bookmap and
footprints showing me the delta. I can

4834
01:50:13,109 --> 01:50:13,119
footprints showing me the delta. I can
 

4835
01:50:13,119 --> 01:50:15,910
footprints showing me the delta. I can
see when they're offside.

4836
01:50:15,910 --> 01:50:15,920
see when they're offside.
 

4837
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,910
see when they're offside.
I know that 60 level is massive right

4838
01:50:17,910 --> 01:50:17,920
I know that 60 level is massive right
 

4839
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:20,790
I know that 60 level is massive right
now.

4840
01:50:20,790 --> 01:50:20,800
now.
 

4841
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,310
now.
Doesn't mean we can't move lower. It

4842
01:50:22,310 --> 01:50:22,320
Doesn't mean we can't move lower. It
 

4843
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:24,149
Doesn't mean we can't move lower. It
just means that's currently where

4844
01:50:24,149 --> 01:50:24,159
just means that's currently where
 

4845
01:50:24,159 --> 01:50:25,590
just means that's currently where
they're trapped. That's all it means.

4846
01:50:25,590 --> 01:50:25,600
they're trapped. That's all it means.
 

4847
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:27,270
they're trapped. That's all it means.
It's currently where they're trapped.

4848
01:50:27,270 --> 01:50:27,280
It's currently where they're trapped.
 

4849
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:30,310
It's currently where they're trapped.
This gray box. You can see we haven't

4850
01:50:30,310 --> 01:50:30,320
This gray box. You can see we haven't
 

4851
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:32,070
This gray box. You can see we haven't
It's not like we've shifted, right? We

4852
01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:32,080
It's not like we've shifted, right? We
 

4853
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,950
It's not like we've shifted, right? We
haven't done this yet, right? So, we can

4854
01:50:34,950 --> 01:50:34,960
haven't done this yet, right? So, we can
 

4855
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,550
haven't done this yet, right? So, we can
build liquidity out into here and they

4856
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:36,560
build liquidity out into here and they
 

4857
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:37,830
build liquidity out into here and they
still use that for a sell off.

4858
01:50:37,830 --> 01:50:37,840
still use that for a sell off.
 

4859
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:40,390
still use that for a sell off.
Understand that. So, I played this

4860
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:40,400
Understand that. So, I played this
 

4861
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:41,990
Understand that. So, I played this
relief to here. If they hold this,

4862
01:50:41,990 --> 01:50:42,000
relief to here. If they hold this,
 

4863
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,070
relief to here. If they hold this,
there's possible relief to here. Squeeze

4864
01:50:44,070 --> 01:50:44,080
there's possible relief to here. Squeeze
 

4865
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:45,990
there's possible relief to here. Squeeze
will happen over here and we can still

4866
01:50:45,990 --> 01:50:46,000
will happen over here and we can still
 

4867
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,430
will happen over here and we can still
just build liquidity there that they

4868
01:50:47,430 --> 01:50:47,440
just build liquidity there that they
 

4869
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,350
just build liquidity there that they
resell down. It's very possible. I won't

4870
01:50:49,350 --> 01:50:49,360
resell down. It's very possible. I won't
 

4871
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:51,189
resell down. It's very possible. I won't
be taking sales now because we're so far

4872
01:50:51,189 --> 01:50:51,199
be taking sales now because we're so far
 

4873
01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:53,270
be taking sales now because we're so far
into discount, right? So, if I'm going

4874
01:50:53,270 --> 01:50:53,280
into discount, right? So, if I'm going
 

4875
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:54,629
into discount, right? So, if I'm going
to take trades, they're going to be

4876
01:50:54,629 --> 01:50:54,639
to take trades, they're going to be
 

4877
01:50:54,639 --> 01:50:57,189
to take trades, they're going to be
scalpy long trades based on trap

4878
01:50:57,189 --> 01:50:57,199
scalpy long trades based on trap
 

4879
01:50:57,199 --> 01:50:59,669
scalpy long trades based on trap
participants. And really, I probably

4880
01:50:59,669 --> 01:50:59,679
participants. And really, I probably
 

4881
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:08,790
participants. And really, I probably
should be done for the day.

4882
01:51:08,790 --> 01:51:08,800

 

4883
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:11,669

So, see if these 60s hold. It's the big

4884
01:51:11,669 --> 01:51:11,679
So, see if these 60s hold. It's the big
 

4885
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:13,270
So, see if these 60s hold. It's the big
level right now. They trade through it

4886
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:13,280
level right now. They trade through it
 

4887
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:15,109
level right now. They trade through it
then probably a new lower day. If they

4888
01:51:15,109 --> 01:51:15,119
then probably a new lower day. If they
 

4889
01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:17,430
then probably a new lower day. If they
hold in front of it or at it, there is

4890
01:51:17,430 --> 01:51:17,440
hold in front of it or at it, there is
 

4891
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:19,350
hold in front of it or at it, there is
relief. So, so far holding in front of

4892
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:19,360
relief. So, so far holding in front of
 

4893
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:21,350
relief. So, so far holding in front of
it.

4894
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:21,360
it.
 

4895
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:23,350
it.
Here we go. So, can they lift this now

4896
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:23,360
Here we go. So, can they lift this now
 

4897
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:29,189
Here we go. So, can they lift this now
up towards these 40s is the question.

4898
01:51:29,189 --> 01:51:29,199

 

4899
01:51:29,199 --> 01:51:43,750

It's tried. Not getting very far here.

4900
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:43,760

 

4901
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:45,270

So, that gray box holding that we just

4902
01:51:45,270 --> 01:51:45,280
So, that gray box holding that we just
 

4903
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:46,870
So, that gray box holding that we just
put in, that's where that trap seller

4904
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:46,880
put in, that's where that trap seller
 

4905
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:49,669
put in, that's where that trap seller
is. He's there. We just need to see this

4906
01:51:49,669 --> 01:51:49,679
is. He's there. We just need to see this
 

4907
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:56,070
is. He's there. We just need to see this
light lift now.

4908
01:51:56,070 --> 01:51:56,080

 

4909
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:57,350

Going to try these. 600 is big

4910
01:51:57,350 --> 01:51:57,360
Going to try these. 600 is big
 

4911
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:59,990
Going to try these. 600 is big
psychological number.

4912
01:51:59,990 --> 01:52:00,000
psychological number.
 

4913
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,470
psychological number.
Here we go.

4914
01:52:02,470 --> 01:52:02,480
Here we go.
 

4915
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:04,629

You got to lift.
They're still stacking these sellers.

They're still trying to force this lower
at the moment.

4928

5057
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:48,470
those 600s. Still no confirmation above
this blue box. So that higher time frame

5058
01:55:48,470 --> 01:55:48,480
this blue box. So that higher time frame
 

5059
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:51,589
this blue box. So that higher time frame
level still holding us down.

5060

5077
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:16,070
there at 53 and getting caught. There's
definitely some form of absorption

definitely some form of absorption
 

5079
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:18,550
definitely some form of absorption
happening down here, but it's too early

5080
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:18,560
happening down here, but it's too early
 

5081
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,629
happening down here, but it's too early

move up. But there is 100% I'm seeing
 

5085

5091
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:31,830
It doesn't mean they can't flush them
all, but every time they're coming down

5092
01:56:31,830 --> 01:56:31,840
all, but every time they're coming down
 

5093
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:44,390
all, but every time they're coming down
there, there is a buyer nibbling at it.

5099
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:52,629
and force this up to 605s right now.
Here we go.

5100
01:56:52,629 --> 01:56:52,639

 

5101
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:54,790

seller coming in at 80s. They got to pop

5102
01:56:54,790 --> 01:56:54,800
seller coming in at 80s. They got to pop
 

5103
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:56,950
seller coming in at 80s. They got to pop
through 80s to get that move to 605.

5104
01:56:56,950 --> 01:56:56,960
through 80s to get that move to 605.
 

5105
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:03,430
through 80s to get that move to 605.
This is getting to do to do to

5106
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:03,440

 

5107
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:07,270

Yeah, we had 175 lots stuck at 550. 127

5108
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:07,280
Yeah, we had 175 lots stuck at 550. 127
 

5109
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:09,350
Yeah, we had 175 lots stuck at 550. 127
lot stuck at 560 and that's just in the

5110
01:57:09,350 --> 01:57:09,360
lot stuck at 560 and that's just in the
 

5111
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:11,510
lot stuck at 560 and that's just in the
last leg down. So, someone is trying to

5112
01:57:11,510 --> 01:57:11,520
last leg down. So, someone is trying to
 

5113
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:14,149
last leg down. So, someone is trying to
absorb 60s to 50s. Doesn't mean we can't

5114
01:57:14,149 --> 01:57:14,159
absorb 60s to 50s. Doesn't mean we can't
 

5115
01:57:14,159 --> 01:57:16,709
absorb 60s to 50s. Doesn't mean we can't
move lower. All I'm saying is I can see

5116
01:57:16,709 --> 01:57:16,719
move lower. All I'm saying is I can see
 

5117
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:18,470
move lower. All I'm saying is I can see
in here we are starting to see

5118
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:18,480
in here we are starting to see
 

5119
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:20,310
in here we are starting to see
absorption under these this level. Look

5120
01:57:20,310 --> 01:57:20,320
absorption under these this level. Look
 

5121
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:22,550
absorption under these this level. Look
at all these sellers, sellers, sellers,

5122
01:57:22,550 --> 01:57:22,560
at all these sellers, sellers, sellers,
 

5123
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,310
at all these sellers, sellers, sellers,
sellers. Someone is absorbing under

5124
01:57:24,310 --> 01:57:24,320
sellers. Someone is absorbing under
 

5125
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:25,510
sellers. Someone is absorbing under
here. There you go. They're trying to

5126
01:57:25,510 --> 01:57:25,520
here. There you go. They're trying to
 

5127
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:27,109
here. There you go. They're trying to
absorb it again. I can see it on the

5128
01:57:27,109 --> 01:57:27,119
absorb it again. I can see it on the
 

5129
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:29,990
absorb it again. I can see it on the
tape. It doesn't mean we move higher. It

5130
01:57:29,990 --> 01:57:30,000
tape. It doesn't mean we move higher. It
 

5131
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,790
tape. It doesn't mean we move higher. It
means that there is a buyer sat here

5132
01:57:32,790 --> 01:57:32,800
means that there is a buyer sat here
 

5133
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:35,030
means that there is a buyer sat here
right now absorbing this. He does not

5134
01:57:35,030 --> 01:57:35,040
right now absorbing this. He does not
 

5135
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,430
right now absorbing this. He does not
want it under there. If he gets his way,

5136
01:57:37,430 --> 01:57:37,440
want it under there. If he gets his way,
 

5137
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,669
want it under there. If he gets his way,
he will get this move here. But if

5138
01:57:39,669 --> 01:57:39,679
he will get this move here. But if
 

5139
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:41,350
he will get this move here. But if
sellers get their way, they will crush

5140
01:57:41,350 --> 01:57:41,360
sellers get their way, they will crush
 

5141
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:42,629
sellers get their way, they will crush
him because he keeps trying to absorb

5142
01:57:42,629 --> 01:57:42,639
him because he keeps trying to absorb
 

5143
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:43,990
him because he keeps trying to absorb
it. And you'll get this move down to

5144
01:57:43,990 --> 01:57:44,000
it. And you'll get this move down to
 

5145
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,510
it. And you'll get this move down to
here. That is the battle right now.

5146
01:57:45,510 --> 01:57:45,520
here. That is the battle right now.
 

5147
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:47,430
here. That is the battle right now.

5149
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:48,950
There is a two-sided tape, but I can
tell you right now there is a buyer sat

5150
01:57:48,950 --> 01:57:48,960
tell you right now there is a buyer sat

01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:50,709
tell you right now there is a buyer sat
here trying to absorb everything he can.

Back through the 60s.
 

5253
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,910
Back through the 60s.
Do they force relief now? Because

5254
02:00:35,910 --> 02:00:35,920
Do they force relief now? Because
 

5255
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:38,070
Do they force relief now? Because
they've done a failed breakdown. Shorts

5256
02:00:38,070 --> 02:00:38,080
they've done a failed breakdown. Shorts
 

5257
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:43,510
they've done a failed breakdown. Shorts
have failed to break the lows now.

5258
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:43,520

 

5259
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:45,669

Um this edge here 80s is an interesting

5260
02:00:45,669 --> 02:00:45,679
Um this edge here 80s is an interesting
 

5261
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:47,350
Um this edge here 80s is an interesting
level through 80s. Then I think there's

5262
02:00:47,350 --> 02:00:47,360
level through 80s. Then I think there's
 

5263
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:49,109
level through 80s. Then I think there's
possible for a lift all the way up to

5264
02:00:49,109 --> 02:00:49,119
possible for a lift all the way up to
 

5265
02:00:49,119 --> 02:00:51,750
possible for a lift all the way up to
40s.

5266
02:00:51,750 --> 02:00:51,760
40s.
 

5267
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:53,430
40s.
That's like a base over 80s. Not just

5268
02:00:53,430 --> 02:00:53,440
That's like a base over 80s. Not just
 

5269
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:55,030
That's like a base over 80s. Not just
like a tap into it. We need to get above

5270
02:00:55,030 --> 02:00:55,040
like a tap into it. We need to get above
 

5271
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,229
like a tap into it. We need to get above
and hold above it. And then there's

5272
02:00:56,229 --> 02:00:56,239
and hold above it. And then there's
 

5273
02:00:56,239 --> 02:00:58,390
and hold above it. And then there's
probably a move all the way up to 640.

5274
02:00:58,390 --> 02:00:58,400
probably a move all the way up to 640.
 

5275
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:03,910
probably a move all the way up to 640.
Here's the move to 80s.

5276
02:01:03,910 --> 02:01:03,920

 

5277
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:07,189

We can see if we can hold here.

5278
02:01:07,189 --> 02:01:07,199
We can see if we can hold here.
 

5279
02:01:07,199 --> 02:01:08,870
We can see if we can hold here.
Back to 60s. Probably see if they test

5280
02:01:08,870 --> 02:01:08,880
Back to 60s. Probably see if they test
 

5281
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:12,870
Back to 60s. Probably see if they test
this 60s and hold it.

5282
02:01:12,870 --> 02:01:12,880

 

5283
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:15,510

No hold of 60s. Still no trade. Then no

5284
02:01:15,510 --> 02:01:15,520
No hold of 60s. Still no trade. Then no
 

5285
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,430
No hold of 60s. Still no trade. Then no
hold of 80s. No hold of 60s. Still no

5286
02:01:17,430 --> 02:01:17,440
hold of 80s. No hold of 60s. Still no
 

5287
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:18,950
hold of 80s. No hold of 60s. Still no
trade. I tell you what, while they do

5288
02:01:18,950 --> 02:01:18,960
trade. I tell you what, while they do
 

5289
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:20,229
trade. I tell you what, while they do
this, cuz I reckon I can give it a

5290
02:01:20,229 --> 02:01:20,239
this, cuz I reckon I can give it a
 

5291
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:21,830
this, cuz I reckon I can give it a
couple minutes. I need to pee and I'll

5292
02:01:21,830 --> 02:01:21,840
couple minutes. I need to pee and I'll
 

5293
02:01:21,840 --> 02:02:36,629
couple minutes. I need to pee and I'll
be right back.

5294
02:02:36,629 --> 02:02:36,639

 

5295
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:41,510

No, [\h__\h]

5296
02:02:41,510 --> 02:02:41,520

 

5297
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:45,189

Oh, no way. No way. You [\h__\h] did it

5298
02:02:45,189 --> 02:02:45,199
Oh, no way. No way. You [\h__\h] did it
 

5299
02:02:45,199 --> 02:02:48,470
Oh, no way. No way. You [\h__\h] did it
when I used the bathroom.

5300
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:48,480
when I used the bathroom.
 

5301
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:58,390
when I used the bathroom.
All right. Hopefully some

5302
02:02:58,390 --> 02:02:58,400

 

5303
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:03,270

Oh god. Oh, you just got to laugh.

5304
02:03:03,270 --> 02:03:03,280
Oh god. Oh, you just got to laugh.
 

5305
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:05,350
Oh god. Oh, you just got to laugh.
You've just got to laugh. All right,

5306
02:03:05,350 --> 02:03:05,360
You've just got to laugh. All right,
 

5307
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:08,550
You've just got to laugh. All right,
guys.

5308
02:03:08,550 --> 02:03:08,560

 

5309
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:09,990

Hopefully you guys got it. I mean, I had

5310
02:03:09,990 --> 02:03:10,000
Hopefully you guys got it. I mean, I had
 

5311
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,629
Hopefully you guys got it. I mean, I had
it planned for you. Reclaim of 60s, held

5312
02:03:12,629 --> 02:03:12,639
it planned for you. Reclaim of 60s, held
 

5313
02:03:12,639 --> 02:03:14,550
it planned for you. Reclaim of 60s, held
above 80s. There's the squeeze back to

5314
02:03:14,550 --> 02:03:14,560
above 80s. There's the squeeze back to
 

5315
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,390
above 80s. There's the squeeze back to
the 40s. All right, there's your

5316
02:03:16,390 --> 02:03:16,400
the 40s. All right, there's your
 

5317
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:17,669
the 40s. All right, there's your
squeeze. All right, if they find

5318
02:03:17,669 --> 02:03:17,679
squeeze. All right, if they find
 

5319
02:03:17,679 --> 02:03:19,189
squeeze. All right, if they find
acceptance over here, they get going.

5320
02:03:19,189 --> 02:03:19,199
acceptance over here, they get going.
 

5321
02:03:19,199 --> 02:03:22,629
acceptance over here, they get going.
Oh, you absolute bastards getting that

5322
02:03:22,629 --> 02:03:22,639
Oh, you absolute bastards getting that
 

5323
02:03:22,639 --> 02:03:30,310
Oh, you absolute bastards getting that
without me.

5324
02:03:30,310 --> 02:03:30,320

 

5325
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:33,669

Was it literally as I walked away? Oh my

5326
02:03:33,669 --> 02:03:33,679
Was it literally as I walked away? Oh my
 

5327
02:03:33,679 --> 02:03:36,550
Was it literally as I walked away? Oh my
god. All right, so in here you can see

5328
02:03:36,550 --> 02:03:36,560
god. All right, so in here you can see
 

5329
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:38,709
god. All right, so in here you can see
this 60s level. How key is this 60s

5330
02:03:38,709 --> 02:03:38,719
this 60s level. How key is this 60s
 

5331
02:03:38,719 --> 02:03:39,990
this 60s level. How key is this 60s
level? They kept getting trapped

5332
02:03:39,990 --> 02:03:40,000
level? They kept getting trapped
 

5333
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,669
level? They kept getting trapped
underneath the 60s level. Look at the

5334
02:03:41,669 --> 02:03:41,679
underneath the 60s level. Look at the
 

5335
02:03:41,679 --> 02:03:44,070
underneath the 60s level. Look at the
sellers at the lows and once we reclaim

5336
02:03:44,070 --> 02:03:44,080
sellers at the lows and once we reclaim
 

5337
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:46,229
sellers at the lows and once we reclaim
the 80s, you can see this shelf, then we

5338
02:03:46,229 --> 02:03:46,239
the 80s, you can see this shelf, then we
 

5339
02:03:46,239 --> 02:03:48,149
the 80s, you can see this shelf, then we
squeeze right back up to the top side

5340
02:03:48,149 --> 02:03:48,159
squeeze right back up to the top side
 

5341
02:03:48,159 --> 02:03:50,629
squeeze right back up to the top side
towards 40. So that's your trade done.

5342
02:03:50,629 --> 02:03:50,639
towards 40. So that's your trade done.
 

5343
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:51,990
towards 40. So that's your trade done.
You should be locking in because your

5344
02:03:51,990 --> 02:03:52,000
You should be locking in because your
 

5345
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,830
You should be locking in because your
counter trend, right? You want to be

5346
02:03:53,830 --> 02:03:53,840
counter trend, right? You want to be
 

5347
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:56,310
counter trend, right? You want to be
aggressive with your stop. So if you

5348
02:03:56,310 --> 02:03:56,320
aggressive with your stop. So if you
 

5349
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:57,990
aggressive with your stop. So if you
come up here, you want to be taking a

5350
02:03:57,990 --> 02:03:58,000
come up here, you want to be taking a
 

5351
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,589
come up here, you want to be taking a
lot of this out. All right, if we start

5352
02:03:59,589 --> 02:03:59,599
lot of this out. All right, if we start
 

5353
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:01,669
lot of this out. All right, if we start
basing here, all right, you want to be

5354
02:04:01,669 --> 02:04:01,679
basing here, all right, you want to be
 

5355
02:04:01,679 --> 02:04:03,189
basing here, all right, you want to be
careful and then we can think about a

5356
02:04:03,189 --> 02:04:03,199
careful and then we can think about a
 

5357
02:04:03,199 --> 02:04:05,830
careful and then we can think about a
base above and and a lift. But remember,

5358
02:04:05,830 --> 02:04:05,840
base above and and a lift. But remember,
 

5359
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:08,229
base above and and a lift. But remember,
this can still be sold into, right? Can

5360
02:04:08,229 --> 02:04:08,239
this can still be sold into, right? Can
 

5361
02:04:08,239 --> 02:04:09,990
this can still be sold into, right? Can
build out liquidity be sold into. We're

5362
02:04:09,990 --> 02:04:10,000
build out liquidity be sold into. We're
 

5363
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,589
build out liquidity be sold into. We're
playing this leg here. You must take

5364
02:04:11,589 --> 02:04:11,599
playing this leg here. You must take
 

5365
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:12,870
playing this leg here. You must take
some profit into it. You can hold

5366
02:04:12,870 --> 02:04:12,880
some profit into it. You can hold
 

5367
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:14,310
some profit into it. You can hold
runners for all the way up here. If you

5368
02:04:14,310 --> 02:04:14,320
runners for all the way up here. If you
 

5369
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:16,229
runners for all the way up here. If you
get if it's a gift, you'll get all the

5370
02:04:16,229 --> 02:04:16,239
get if it's a gift, you'll get all the
 

5371
02:04:16,239 --> 02:04:17,510
get if it's a gift, you'll get all the
way up there for it. But it's too late

5372
02:04:17,510 --> 02:04:17,520
way up there for it. But it's too late
 

5373
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:19,830
way up there for it. But it's too late
for me now. Unfortunately, I've missed

5374
02:04:19,830 --> 02:04:19,840
for me now. Unfortunately, I've missed
 

5375
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:23,990
for me now. Unfortunately, I've missed
it. Used the bathroom at the wrong time.

5376
02:04:23,990 --> 02:04:24,000
it. Used the bathroom at the wrong time.
 

5377
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:28,950
it. Used the bathroom at the wrong time.
Yeah, lots of you getting it.

5378
02:04:28,950 --> 02:04:28,960

 

5379
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:31,589

So, this is why when you guys are like,

5380
02:04:31,589 --> 02:04:31,599
So, this is why when you guys are like,
 

5381
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:33,430
So, this is why when you guys are like,
"Oh, can you tell us when when when

5382
02:04:33,430 --> 02:04:33,440
"Oh, can you tell us when when when
 

5383
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:34,870
"Oh, can you tell us when when when
you're entering and you're telling us?"

5384
02:04:34,870 --> 02:04:34,880
you're entering and you're telling us?"
 

5385
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:36,629
you're entering and you're telling us?"
This is why I teach you. Because if I

5386
02:04:36,629 --> 02:04:36,639
This is why I teach you. Because if I
 

5387
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:38,390
This is why I teach you. Because if I
didn't tell you what was happening, you

5388
02:04:38,390 --> 02:04:38,400
didn't tell you what was happening, you
 

5389
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,229
didn't tell you what was happening, you
wouldn't know that we're looking for a

5390
02:04:40,229 --> 02:04:40,239
wouldn't know that we're looking for a
 

5391
02:04:40,239 --> 02:04:43,589
wouldn't know that we're looking for a
60s to 80s move and from 80s for squeeze

5392
02:04:43,589 --> 02:04:43,599
60s to 80s move and from 80s for squeeze
 

5393
02:04:43,599 --> 02:04:46,709
60s to 80s move and from 80s for squeeze
up to 40s. From 60s to 80s, from 80s

5394
02:04:46,709 --> 02:04:46,719
up to 40s. From 60s to 80s, from 80s
 

5395
02:04:46,719 --> 02:04:49,030
up to 40s. From 60s to 80s, from 80s
squeeze up to 40s. There you go. TP hit.

5396
02:04:49,030 --> 02:04:49,040
squeeze up to 40s. There you go. TP hit.
 

5397
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:50,790
squeeze up to 40s. There you go. TP hit.
And anything above that now is a bonus

5398
02:04:50,790 --> 02:04:50,800
And anything above that now is a bonus
 

5399
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:52,950
And anything above that now is a bonus
back inside. All right. So, if I just

5400
02:04:52,950 --> 02:04:52,960
back inside. All right. So, if I just
 

5401
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:54,310
back inside. All right. So, if I just
said, oh, I'm entering. You wouldn't

5402
02:04:54,310 --> 02:04:54,320
said, oh, I'm entering. You wouldn't
 

5403
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:55,910
said, oh, I'm entering. You wouldn't
understand when to take profit, when to

5404
02:04:55,910 --> 02:04:55,920
understand when to take profit, when to
 

5405
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:57,350
understand when to take profit, when to
do this, when to do that. That's why I

5406
02:04:57,350 --> 02:04:57,360
do this, when to do that. That's why I
 

5407
02:04:57,360 --> 02:05:03,910
do this, when to do that. That's why I
try and teach as I go.

5408
02:05:03,910 --> 02:05:03,920

 

5409
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:05,830

So, another winner on stream. Here you

5410
02:05:05,830 --> 02:05:05,840
So, another winner on stream. Here you
 

5411
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:07,350
So, another winner on stream. Here you
go. So, you might well get relief all

5412
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:07,360
go. So, you might well get relief all
 

5413
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:09,109
go. So, you might well get relief all
the way up here. It's very possible they

5414
02:05:09,109 --> 02:05:09,119
the way up here. It's very possible they
 

5415
02:05:09,119 --> 02:05:11,830
the way up here. It's very possible they
lift this aggressively now. It's very

5416
02:05:11,830 --> 02:05:11,840
lift this aggressively now. It's very
 

5417
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:13,589
lift this aggressively now. It's very
possible you get a giant squeeze in this

5418
02:05:13,589 --> 02:05:13,599
possible you get a giant squeeze in this
 

5419
02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:15,189
possible you get a giant squeeze in this
now. So, hopefully you're positioned

5420
02:05:15,189 --> 02:05:15,199
now. So, hopefully you're positioned
 

5421
02:05:15,199 --> 02:05:17,750
now. So, hopefully you're positioned
well from it from 60 or 80 and you

5422
02:05:17,750 --> 02:05:17,760
well from it from 60 or 80 and you
 

5423
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:24,149
well from it from 60 or 80 and you
should be up 100 points now already.

5424
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:24,159

 

5425
02:05:24,159 --> 02:05:34,470

How's your luck? How's your luck, Alex?

5426
02:05:34,470 --> 02:05:34,480

 

5427
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:36,229

Oh,

5428
02:05:36,229 --> 02:05:36,239
Oh,
 

5429
02:05:36,239 --> 02:05:39,750
Oh,
it's cruel. It's cruel.

5430
02:05:39,750 --> 02:05:39,760
it's cruel. It's cruel.
 

5431
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:52,790
it's cruel. It's cruel.
It's cruel.

5432
02:05:52,790 --> 02:05:52,800

 

5433
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:56,470

Nice. Nice work, Dave. Great work, mate.

5434
02:05:56,470 --> 02:05:56,480
Nice. Nice work, Dave. Great work, mate.
 

5435
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:58,470
Nice. Nice work, Dave. Great work, mate.
And just bit move your stop up. All

5436
02:05:58,470 --> 02:05:58,480
And just bit move your stop up. All
 

5437
02:05:58,480 --> 02:06:00,390
And just bit move your stop up. All
right. So, what you will want to see now

5438
02:06:00,390 --> 02:06:00,400
right. So, what you will want to see now
 

5439
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:03,350
right. So, what you will want to see now
is bulls base over this for a second

5440
02:06:03,350 --> 02:06:03,360
is bulls base over this for a second
 

5441
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:04,470
is bulls base over this for a second
leg. All right. If they're going to do a

5442
02:06:04,470 --> 02:06:04,480
leg. All right. If they're going to do a
 

5443
02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:06,149
leg. All right. If they're going to do a
second leg, bulls will need to base

5444
02:06:06,149 --> 02:06:06,159
second leg, bulls will need to base
 

5445
02:06:06,159 --> 02:06:08,709
second leg, bulls will need to base
here, right, for the next leg. And you

5446
02:06:08,709 --> 02:06:08,719
here, right, for the next leg. And you
 

5447
02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:11,910
here, right, for the next leg. And you
expect that will probably be sold. Um,

5448
02:06:11,910 --> 02:06:11,920
expect that will probably be sold. Um,
 

5449
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:13,589
expect that will probably be sold. Um,
but you know, we can afford to come all

5450
02:06:13,589 --> 02:06:13,599
but you know, we can afford to come all
 

5451
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:15,189
but you know, we can afford to come all
the way up here. You might get lucky on

5452
02:06:15,189 --> 02:06:15,199
the way up here. You might get lucky on
 

5453
02:06:15,199 --> 02:06:16,950
the way up here. You might get lucky on
your run out. There's lots of stops up

5454
02:06:16,950 --> 02:06:16,960
your run out. There's lots of stops up
 

5455
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:19,990
your run out. There's lots of stops up
here. You never know. You might get

5456
02:06:19,990 --> 02:06:20,000
here. You never know. You might get
 

5457
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,790
here. You never know. You might get
lucky and get that. You might. You very

5458
02:06:22,790 --> 02:06:22,800
lucky and get that. You might. You very
 

5459
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,310
lucky and get that. You might. You very
well might. We might have just had the

5460
02:06:24,310 --> 02:06:24,320
well might. We might have just had the
 

5461
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:27,270
well might. We might have just had the
perfect trade down there at that 60s.

5462
02:06:27,270 --> 02:06:27,280
perfect trade down there at that 60s.
 

5463
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:29,589
perfect trade down there at that 60s.
So the 60s call was good, wasn't it?

5464
02:06:29,589 --> 02:06:29,599
So the 60s call was good, wasn't it?
 

5465
02:06:29,599 --> 02:06:31,830
So the 60s call was good, wasn't it?
Like everything under 60s was excess. If

5466
02:06:31,830 --> 02:06:31,840
Like everything under 60s was excess. If
 

5467
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:33,830
Like everything under 60s was excess. If
we go to here,

5468
02:06:33,830 --> 02:06:33,840
we go to here,
 

5469
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:36,229
we go to here,
everything under 60s was excess. So if

5470
02:06:36,229 --> 02:06:36,239
everything under 60s was excess. So if
 

5471
02:06:36,239 --> 02:06:38,629
everything under 60s was excess. So if
we mark 60s out with a horizontal line,

5472
02:06:38,629 --> 02:06:38,639
we mark 60s out with a horizontal line,
 

5473
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:41,270
we mark 60s out with a horizontal line,
I've called 60s right here. All right,

5474
02:06:41,270 --> 02:06:41,280
I've called 60s right here. All right,
 

5475
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:43,109
I've called 60s right here. All right,
sellers kept getting trapped. Sellers

5476
02:06:43,109 --> 02:06:43,119
sellers kept getting trapped. Sellers
 

5477
02:06:43,119 --> 02:06:45,750
sellers kept getting trapped. Sellers
trapped underneath it

5478
02:06:45,750 --> 02:06:45,760
trapped underneath it
 

5479
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:47,750
trapped underneath it
here. And I kept telling you in here

5480
02:06:47,750 --> 02:06:47,760
here. And I kept telling you in here
 

5481
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:49,189
here. And I kept telling you in here
there is someone trying to absorb the

5482
02:06:49,189 --> 02:06:49,199
there is someone trying to absorb the
 

5483
02:06:49,199 --> 02:06:50,709
there is someone trying to absorb the
tape. I could see him trying to absorb

5484
02:06:50,709 --> 02:06:50,719
tape. I could see him trying to absorb
 

5485
02:06:50,719 --> 02:06:52,310
tape. I could see him trying to absorb
the tape and he didn't let it break

5486
02:06:52,310 --> 02:06:52,320
the tape and he didn't let it break
 

5487
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:53,830
the tape and he didn't let it break
down, which meant anyone who entered

5488
02:06:53,830 --> 02:06:53,840
down, which meant anyone who entered
 

5489
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:55,430
down, which meant anyone who entered
short here, remember their takeprofit is

5490
02:06:55,430 --> 02:06:55,440
short here, remember their takeprofit is
 

5491
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:57,830
short here, remember their takeprofit is
under here. they get squeezed and their

5492
02:06:57,830 --> 02:06:57,840
under here. they get squeezed and their
 

5493
02:06:57,840 --> 02:06:59,830
under here. they get squeezed and their
trigger for that squeeze is the 80s

5494
02:06:59,830 --> 02:06:59,840
trigger for that squeeze is the 80s
 

5495
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:02,229
trigger for that squeeze is the 80s
break and the 20's break to get you to

5496
02:07:02,229 --> 02:07:02,239
break and the 20's break to get you to
 

5497
02:07:02,239 --> 02:07:04,790
break and the 20's break to get you to
the 40s. The 40s break now is causing

5498
02:07:04,790 --> 02:07:04,800
the 40s. The 40s break now is causing
 

5499
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:06,310
the 40s. The 40s break now is causing
the squeeze ups. Think about the stops.

5500
02:07:06,310 --> 02:07:06,320
the squeeze ups. Think about the stops.
 

5501
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:08,470
the squeeze ups. Think about the stops.
You're running all the stops, filling

5502
02:07:08,470 --> 02:07:08,480
You're running all the stops, filling
 

5503
02:07:08,480 --> 02:07:10,550
You're running all the stops, filling
the imbalances, trying to probably get

5504
02:07:10,550 --> 02:07:10,560
the imbalances, trying to probably get
 

5505
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:12,149
the imbalances, trying to probably get
up into this next cluster. All right, so

5506
02:07:12,149 --> 02:07:12,159
up into this next cluster. All right, so
 

5507
02:07:12,159 --> 02:07:15,830
up into this next cluster. All right, so
that was the trade thesis.

5508
02:07:15,830 --> 02:07:15,840
that was the trade thesis.
 

5509
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:20,149
that was the trade thesis.
But again, what do I know?

5510
02:07:20,149 --> 02:07:20,159

 

5511
02:07:20,159 --> 02:07:22,149

What do I know? I'm a just a stupid

5512
02:07:22,149 --> 02:07:22,159
What do I know? I'm a just a stupid
 

5513
02:07:22,159 --> 02:07:33,270
What do I know? I'm a just a stupid
40-year-old with specs on on YouTube.

5514
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:33,280

 

5515
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:35,030

This is am I going to reenter? I mean,

5516
02:07:35,030 --> 02:07:35,040
This is am I going to reenter? I mean,
 

5517
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:36,390
This is am I going to reenter? I mean,
it's it's going to be very hard for me

5518
02:07:36,390 --> 02:07:36,400
it's it's going to be very hard for me
 

5519
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:38,069
it's it's going to be very hard for me
to get an entry now. All right. The the

5520
02:07:38,069 --> 02:07:38,079
to get an entry now. All right. The the
 

5521
02:07:38,079 --> 02:07:40,069
to get an entry now. All right. The the
optimal entry was down here. This gray

5522
02:07:40,069 --> 02:07:40,079
optimal entry was down here. This gray
 

5523
02:07:40,079 --> 02:07:42,550
optimal entry was down here. This gray
box, we kept talking about it. Gray box

5524
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:42,560
box, we kept talking about it. Gray box
 

5525
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:44,870
box, we kept talking about it. Gray box
and the 80s reclaim anywhere here was

5526
02:07:44,870 --> 02:07:44,880
and the 80s reclaim anywhere here was
 

5527
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:46,790
and the 80s reclaim anywhere here was
optimal entry. If it pulls back here and

5528
02:07:46,790 --> 02:07:46,800
optimal entry. If it pulls back here and
 

5529
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:49,270
optimal entry. If it pulls back here and
holds, yes, potentially, but you have to

5530
02:07:49,270 --> 02:07:49,280
holds, yes, potentially, but you have to
 

5531
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:51,589
holds, yes, potentially, but you have to
understand that this right, maybe we get

5532
02:07:51,589 --> 02:07:51,599
understand that this right, maybe we get
 

5533
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:53,589
understand that this right, maybe we get
one more leg out of it and then they can

5534
02:07:53,589 --> 02:07:53,599
one more leg out of it and then they can
 

5535
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:55,510
one more leg out of it and then they can
fade that. If we get lucky, we get that

5536
02:07:55,510 --> 02:07:55,520
fade that. If we get lucky, we get that
 

5537
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:57,189
fade that. If we get lucky, we get that
leg all the way up to here. But I've

5538
02:07:57,189 --> 02:07:57,199
leg all the way up to here. But I've
 

5539
02:07:57,199 --> 02:07:59,350
leg all the way up to here. But I've
lost optimal entry. All right. I hate

5540
02:07:59,350 --> 02:07:59,360
lost optimal entry. All right. I hate
 

5541
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:01,350
lost optimal entry. All right. I hate
entering after I've lost optimal.

5542
02:08:01,350 --> 02:08:01,360
entering after I've lost optimal.
 

5543
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:03,669
entering after I've lost optimal.
Optimal entry was here. You're up 110

5544
02:08:03,669 --> 02:08:03,679
Optimal entry was here. You're up 110
 

5545
02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:05,350
Optimal entry was here. You're up 110
points right now. And you just let it

5546
02:08:05,350 --> 02:08:05,360
points right now. And you just let it
 

5547
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:07,189
points right now. And you just let it
[\h__\h] squeeze. Let everyone get get

5548
02:08:07,189 --> 02:08:07,199
[\h__\h] squeeze. Let everyone get get
 

5549
02:08:07,199 --> 02:08:09,270
[\h__\h] squeeze. Let everyone get get
taken out. And you take your money, you

5550
02:08:09,270 --> 02:08:09,280
taken out. And you take your money, you
 

5551
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:10,870
taken out. And you take your money, you
risk off as you move up, and you hold

5552
02:08:10,870 --> 02:08:10,880
risk off as you move up, and you hold
 

5553
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:18,950
risk off as you move up, and you hold

How long did it take me to get here? Um,
 

5569
02:08:46,159 --> 02:08:49,189
How long did it take me to get here? Um,
quite a while to be honest. Like I it I

5570
02:08:49,189 --> 02:08:49,199
quite a while to be honest. Like I it I
 

5571
02:08:49,199 --> 02:08:51,270
quite a while to be honest. Like I it I

why I created the flow zones for for
 

5579
02:08:58,719 --> 02:09:02,470
why I created the flow zones for for
myself for a long time. Um, it took me

5580
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:02,480
myself for a long time. Um, it took me
 

5581
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:04,470

this huge node here. So don't expect too

5660
02:10:36,310 --> 02:10:36,320
this huge node here. So don't expect too
 

5661
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:38,069
this huge node here. So don't expect too
much. If we get over that node, then

5662
02:10:38,069 --> 02:10:38,079
much. If we get over that node, then
 

5663
02:10:38,079 --> 02:10:41,270
much. If we get over that node, then
yes. If if we start breaking over 700s,

5664
02:10:41,270 --> 02:10:41,280
yes. If if we start breaking over 700s,

02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:43,510
yes. If if we start breaking over 700s,
then yes, I think there's an argument

02:10:43,510 --> 02:10:43,520
then yes, I think there's an argument
 

5667
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:45,990
then yes, I think there's an argument
that we might trade up to 860s or

that we might trade up to 860s or

5789
02:13:12,079 --> 02:13:15,189
screen's too long and it's not great. I
want to be fresh as much as possible. If

I think there's a big trade setting up
 

5793
02:13:16,719 --> 02:13:19,910
I think there's a big trade setting up
in Asia or not London, I'm not awake,

in Asia or not London, I'm not awake,
 

5795
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:26,310
in Asia or not London, I'm not awake,
but Asia, then sometimes

5796
02:13:26,310 --> 02:13:26,320

 

5797
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:27,669

Alex, I'm new to your channel. Question

5798
02:13:27,669 --> 02:13:27,679
Alex, I'm new to your channel. Question
 

5799
02:13:27,679 --> 02:13:29,510
Alex, I'm new to your channel. Question
on the anchor volume profile. Is it

5800
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:29,520
on the anchor volume profile. Is it
 

5801
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:31,109
on the anchor volume profile. Is it
based on ticks or what settings are you

5802
02:13:31,109 --> 02:13:31,119
based on ticks or what settings are you
 

5803
02:13:31,119 --> 02:13:33,109
based on ticks or what settings are you
able to share? Yes, it's set to two

5804
02:13:33,109 --> 02:13:33,119
able to share? Yes, it's set to two
 

5805
02:13:33,119 --> 02:13:34,950
able to share? Yes, it's set to two
ticks. Two ticks. If you don't like

5806
02:13:34,950 --> 02:13:34,960
ticks. Two ticks. If you don't like
 

5807
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:36,870
ticks. Two ticks. If you don't like
using ticks, I would say use a th00and

5808
02:13:36,870 --> 02:13:36,880
using ticks, I would say use a th00and
 

5809
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:42,550
using ticks, I would say use a th00and
rows, but two ticks.

5810
02:13:42,550 --> 02:13:42,560

 

5811
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:45,109

Take care. Take care, mate. Have a good

5812
02:13:45,109 --> 02:13:45,119
Take care. Take care, mate. Have a good
 

5813
02:13:45,119 --> 02:13:46,470
Take care. Take care, mate. Have a good
day. All right. So, like I said, you

5814
02:13:46,470 --> 02:13:46,480
day. All right. So, like I said, you
 

5815
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:47,830
day. All right. So, like I said, you
should be locking most in into this

5816
02:13:47,830 --> 02:13:47,840
should be locking most in into this
 

5817
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:49,270
should be locking most in into this
initial balance. Like I said, this was

5818
02:13:49,270 --> 02:13:49,280
initial balance. Like I said, this was
 

5819
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:51,109
initial balance. Like I said, this was
target. So, we actually had like target

5820
02:13:51,109 --> 02:13:51,119
target. So, we actually had like target
 

5821
02:13:51,119 --> 02:13:54,069
target. So, we actually had like target
one hit, target two hit, target three is

5822
02:13:54,069 --> 02:13:54,079
one hit, target two hit, target three is
 

5823
02:13:54,079 --> 02:13:55,990
one hit, target two hit, target three is
all the way up here for a runner. But,

5824
02:13:55,990 --> 02:13:56,000
all the way up here for a runner. But,
 

5825
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,069
all the way up here for a runner. But,
you know, we might very well defend this

5826
02:13:58,069 --> 02:13:58,079
you know, we might very well defend this
 

5827
02:13:58,079 --> 02:13:59,830
you know, we might very well defend this
red box. That's why it's red because

5828
02:13:59,830 --> 02:13:59,840
red box. That's why it's red because
 

5829
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:02,069
red box. That's why it's red because
it's going to be supply. It's a big big

5830
02:14:02,069 --> 02:14:02,079
it's going to be supply. It's a big big
 

5831
02:14:02,079 --> 02:14:03,589
it's going to be supply. It's a big big
big level. It's not just the initial

5832
02:14:03,589 --> 02:14:03,599
big level. It's not just the initial
 

5833
02:14:03,599 --> 02:14:07,669
big level. It's not just the initial
balance. It is also the point of control

5834
02:14:07,669 --> 02:14:07,679
balance. It is also the point of control
 

5835
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:10,229
balance. It is also the point of control
dating back from last week, right?

5836
02:14:10,229 --> 02:14:10,239
dating back from last week, right?
 

5837
02:14:10,239 --> 02:14:12,310
dating back from last week, right?
That's why it's got that red line here.

5838
02:14:12,310 --> 02:14:12,320
That's why it's got that red line here.
 

5839
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:13,589
That's why it's got that red line here.
Previous week point control. Hard to

5840
02:14:13,589 --> 02:14:13,599
Previous week point control. Hard to
 

5841
02:14:13,599 --> 02:14:20,550
Previous week point control. Hard to
see, I know. And this is the thick area.

5842
02:14:20,550 --> 02:14:20,560

 

5843
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:22,390

and also the week before its value area

5844
02:14:22,390 --> 02:14:22,400
and also the week before its value area
 

5845
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:25,030
and also the week before its value area
low from the week of Monday the 12th of

5846
02:14:25,030 --> 02:14:25,040
low from the week of Monday the 12th of
 

5847
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:26,629
low from the week of Monday the 12th of
Jan

5848
02:14:26,629 --> 02:14:26,639
Jan
 

5849
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:28,069
Jan
Monday the 12th of Jan. So you can hold

5850
02:14:28,069 --> 02:14:28,079
Monday the 12th of Jan. So you can hold
 

5851
02:14:28,079 --> 02:14:29,030
Monday the 12th of Jan. So you can hold
runners if you're willing to hold

5852
02:14:29,030 --> 02:14:29,040
runners if you're willing to hold
 

5853
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:31,589
runners if you're willing to hold
runners looking for this. Starting to

5854
02:14:31,589 --> 02:14:31,599
runners looking for this. Starting to
 

5855
02:14:31,599 --> 02:14:33,430
runners looking for this. Starting to
hold flow zones, but you know this is

5856
02:14:33,430 --> 02:14:33,440
hold flow zones, but you know this is
 

5857
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:39,910
hold flow zones, but you know this is
the counter trend leg right now.

5858
02:14:39,910 --> 02:14:39,920

 

5859
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:42,069

Re-enter buy for me. There's no like I

5860
02:14:42,069 --> 02:14:42,079
Re-enter buy for me. There's no like I
 

5861
02:14:42,079 --> 02:14:43,669
Re-enter buy for me. There's no like I
wouldn't really want to reenter buy up

5862
02:14:43,669 --> 02:14:43,679
wouldn't really want to reenter buy up
 

5863
02:14:43,679 --> 02:14:45,189
wouldn't really want to reenter buy up
here.

5864
02:14:45,189 --> 02:14:45,199
here.
 

5865
02:14:45,199 --> 02:14:47,910
here.
Doesn't mean you can't. We are holding a

5866
02:14:47,910 --> 02:14:47,920
Doesn't mean you can't. We are holding a
 

5867
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:50,149
Doesn't mean you can't. We are holding a
shelf.

5868
02:14:50,149 --> 02:14:50,159
shelf.
 

5869
02:14:50,159 --> 02:14:52,470
shelf.
We are holding a shelf. But for me, like

5870
02:14:52,470 --> 02:14:52,480
We are holding a shelf. But for me, like
 

5871
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:57,589
We are holding a shelf. But for me, like
I prefer the buy down into this or this

5872
02:14:57,589 --> 02:14:57,599

 

5873
02:14:57,599 --> 02:14:59,430

somewhere into here if we're going to

5874
02:14:59,430 --> 02:14:59,440
somewhere into here if we're going to
 

5875
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:00,790
somewhere into here if we're going to
have another go because if you're buying

5876
02:15:00,790 --> 02:15:00,800
have another go because if you're buying
 

5877
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:02,390
have another go because if you're buying
here, you've got to understand that you

5878
02:15:02,390 --> 02:15:02,400
here, you've got to understand that you
 

5879
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:03,750
here, you've got to understand that you
might only get to here and fail and

5880
02:15:03,750 --> 02:15:03,760
might only get to here and fail and
 

5881
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:07,510
might only get to here and fail and
collapse. So the RR for me doesn't work

5882
02:15:07,510 --> 02:15:07,520
collapse. So the RR for me doesn't work
 

5883
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:09,750
collapse. So the RR for me doesn't work
out. If it continues to squeeze up, then

5884
02:15:09,750 --> 02:15:09,760
out. If it continues to squeeze up, then
 

5885
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:11,189
out. If it continues to squeeze up, then
it works out for you, but it's too high

5886
02:15:11,189 --> 02:15:11,199
it works out for you, but it's too high
 

5887
02:15:11,199 --> 02:15:13,350
it works out for you, but it's too high
a risk. I think this node here and down

5888
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:13,360
a risk. I think this node here and down
 

5889
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:15,830
a risk. I think this node here and down
here is more important. somewhere in

5890
02:15:15,830 --> 02:15:15,840
here is more important. somewhere in
 

5891
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:18,149
here is more important. somewhere in
here,

5892
02:15:18,149 --> 02:15:18,159
here,
 

5893
02:15:18,159 --> 02:15:20,390
here,
the edge of this, this 40s that we

5894
02:15:20,390 --> 02:15:20,400
the edge of this, this 40s that we
 

5895
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:23,510
the edge of this, this 40s that we
talked about, and even this down here,

5896
02:15:23,510 --> 02:15:23,520
talked about, and even this down here,
 

5897
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:24,950
talked about, and even this down here,
maybe one of these. But you have to

5898
02:15:24,950 --> 02:15:24,960
maybe one of these. But you have to
 

5899
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:27,109
maybe one of these. But you have to
understand that we've just tagged into

5900
02:15:27,109 --> 02:15:27,119
understand that we've just tagged into
 

5901
02:15:27,119 --> 02:15:28,950
understand that we've just tagged into
the key level. It might very well be

5902
02:15:28,950 --> 02:15:28,960
the key level. It might very well be
 

5903
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:30,310
the key level. It might very well be
that they do this for the rest of the

5904
02:15:30,310 --> 02:15:30,320
that they do this for the rest of the
 

5905
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:33,830
that they do this for the rest of the
day. It's very possible

5906
02:15:33,830 --> 02:15:33,840
day. It's very possible
 

5907
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:35,189
day. It's very possible
because we're counter trend, right? You

5908
02:15:35,189 --> 02:15:35,199
because we're counter trend, right? You
 

5909
02:15:35,199 --> 02:15:36,870
because we're counter trend, right? You
are on squeeze up counter trend right

5910
02:15:36,870 --> 02:15:36,880
are on squeeze up counter trend right
 

5911
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:40,149
are on squeeze up counter trend right
now.

5912
02:15:40,149 --> 02:15:40,159

 

5913
02:15:40,159 --> 02:15:42,790

What year did I start trading?

5914
02:15:42,790 --> 02:15:42,800
What year did I start trading?
 

5915
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:44,229
What year did I start trading?
I actually first started trading when I

5916
02:15:44,229 --> 02:15:44,239
I actually first started trading when I
 

5917
02:15:44,239 --> 02:15:45,589
I actually first started trading when I
first left university when I thought I

5918
02:15:45,589 --> 02:15:45,599
first left university when I thought I
 

5919
02:15:45,599 --> 02:15:47,109
first left university when I thought I
was going to do it as a job. So what's

5920
02:15:47,109 --> 02:15:47,119
was going to do it as a job. So what's
 

5921
02:15:47,119 --> 02:15:50,550
was going to do it as a job. So what's
that? And it's 20.

5922
02:15:50,550 --> 02:15:50,560
that? And it's 20.
 

5923
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:53,750
that? And it's 20.
Yeah. 20 years ago. 19 years ago. I

5924
02:15:53,750 --> 02:15:53,760
Yeah. 20 years ago. 19 years ago. I
 

5925
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:58,790
Yeah. 20 years ago. 19 years ago. I
graduate 18 19 21. Yeah. 19 years ago

5926
02:15:58,790 --> 02:15:58,800
graduate 18 19 21. Yeah. 19 years ago
 

5927
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:01,350
graduate 18 19 21. Yeah. 19 years ago
when I was interviewing everywhere to go

5928
02:16:01,350 --> 02:16:01,360
when I was interviewing everywhere to go
 

5929
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:06,709
when I was interviewing everywhere to go
and do it as a job.

5930
02:16:06,709 --> 02:16:06,719

 

5931
02:16:06,719 --> 02:16:08,149

But uh I didn't trade for a long time

5932
02:16:08,149 --> 02:16:08,159
But uh I didn't trade for a long time
 

5933
02:16:08,159 --> 02:16:09,750
But uh I didn't trade for a long time
after that. and just had like some

5934
02:16:09,750 --> 02:16:09,760
after that. and just had like some
 

5935
02:16:09,760 --> 02:16:13,830
after that. and just had like some
investment pieces.

5936
02:16:13,830 --> 02:16:13,840

 

5937
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:16,550

>> It came back to the markets uh probably

5938
02:16:16,550 --> 02:16:16,560
>> It came back to the markets uh probably
 

5939
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:19,109
>> It came back to the markets uh probably
a couple years before co

5940
02:16:19,109 --> 02:16:19,119
a couple years before co
 

5941
02:16:19,119 --> 02:16:20,870
a couple years before co
did we formed some kind of lower high

5942
02:16:20,870 --> 02:16:20,880
did we formed some kind of lower high
 

5943
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:24,470
did we formed some kind of lower high
for the alltime high?

5944
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:24,480
for the alltime high?
 

5945
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:27,669
for the alltime high?
Um I mean it's possible it's possible

5946
02:16:27,669 --> 02:16:27,679
Um I mean it's possible it's possible
 

5947
02:16:27,679 --> 02:16:31,669
Um I mean it's possible it's possible
but

5948
02:16:31,669 --> 02:16:31,679

 

5949
02:16:31,679 --> 02:16:33,429

we've swept the stops. We've filled the

5950
02:16:33,429 --> 02:16:33,439
we've swept the stops. We've filled the
 

5951
02:16:33,439 --> 02:16:35,349
we've swept the stops. We've filled the
gap.

5952
02:16:35,349 --> 02:16:35,359
gap.
 

5953
02:16:35,359 --> 02:16:36,870
gap.
It just now depends if there's

5954
02:16:36,870 --> 02:16:36,880
It just now depends if there's
 

5955
02:16:36,880 --> 02:16:38,389
It just now depends if there's
continuation,

5956
02:16:38,389 --> 02:16:38,399
continuation,
 

5957
02:16:38,399 --> 02:16:39,669
continuation,
right? So, we're just back into the

5958
02:16:39,669 --> 02:16:39,679
right? So, we're just back into the
 

5959
02:16:39,679 --> 02:16:41,910
right? So, we're just back into the
range. Depends if there's continuation.

5960
02:16:41,910 --> 02:16:41,920
range. Depends if there's continuation.
 

5961
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:43,990
range. Depends if there's continuation.
But yes, you could argue that we swept

5962
02:16:43,990 --> 02:16:44,000
But yes, you could argue that we swept
 

5963
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:45,509
But yes, you could argue that we swept
all the stops. If you joined me earlier

5964
02:16:45,509 --> 02:16:45,519
all the stops. If you joined me earlier
 

5965
02:16:45,519 --> 02:16:47,509
all the stops. If you joined me earlier
this week, we we talked about the gap

5966
02:16:47,509 --> 02:16:47,519
this week, we we talked about the gap
 

5967
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:50,230
this week, we we talked about the gap
fill on the QQQ especially. All right.

5968
02:16:50,230 --> 02:16:50,240
fill on the QQQ especially. All right.
 

5969
02:16:50,240 --> 02:16:53,030
fill on the QQQ especially. All right.
If we go to this, it's why so important

5970
02:16:53,030 --> 02:16:53,040
If we go to this, it's why so important
 

5971
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:54,870
If we go to this, it's why so important
to look at the cash gap markets. We go

5972
02:16:54,870 --> 02:16:54,880
to look at the cash gap markets. We go
 

5973
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:58,389
to look at the cash gap markets. We go
to like a one day on the QQQ. We had an

5974
02:16:58,389 --> 02:16:58,399
to like a one day on the QQQ. We had an
 

5975
02:16:58,399 --> 02:17:00,870
to like a one day on the QQQ. We had an
old gap which needed to be filled right

5976
02:17:00,870 --> 02:17:00,880
old gap which needed to be filled right
 

5977
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:03,030
old gap which needed to be filled right
into here, right? Which we have now

5978
02:17:03,030 --> 02:17:03,040
into here, right? Which we have now
 

5979
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:05,509
into here, right? Which we have now
successfully filled. That is job done.

5980
02:17:05,509 --> 02:17:05,519
successfully filled. That is job done.
 

5981
02:17:05,519 --> 02:17:12,709
successfully filled. That is job done.
Um that gap on the NQ

5982
02:17:12,709 --> 02:17:12,719

 

5983
02:17:12,719 --> 02:17:16,230

was into this block right right here.

5984
02:17:16,230 --> 02:17:16,240
was into this block right right here.
 

5985
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:18,790
was into this block right right here.
Right. We had to fill this right into

5986
02:17:18,790 --> 02:17:18,800
Right. We had to fill this right into
 

5987
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:20,870
Right. We had to fill this right into
this right because this was a gap down

5988
02:17:20,870 --> 02:17:20,880
this right because this was a gap down
 

5989
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:23,270
this right because this was a gap down
on this day here Tuesday. So we had New

5990
02:17:23,270 --> 02:17:23,280
on this day here Tuesday. So we had New
 

5991
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:24,790
on this day here Tuesday. So we had New
York session here. So all we've done run

5992
02:17:24,790 --> 02:17:24,800
York session here. So all we've done run
 

5993
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:26,389
York session here. So all we've done run
these stops, fill that gap, become

5994
02:17:26,389 --> 02:17:26,399
these stops, fill that gap, become
 

5995
02:17:26,399 --> 02:17:28,150
these stops, fill that gap, become
efficient, come back into the range.

5996
02:17:28,150 --> 02:17:28,160
efficient, come back into the range.
 

5997
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:30,070
efficient, come back into the range.
We're we're back into death chop, guys.

5998
02:17:30,070 --> 02:17:30,080
We're we're back into death chop, guys.
 

5999
02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:31,830
We're we're back into death chop, guys.
I know it looks really bad, right? We're

let it come back down here. So, if

6320
02:25:09,110 --> 02:25:09,120
let it come back down here. So, if
 

6321
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:10,469

probably are unwilling to sit through
 

6331
02:25:18,399 --> 02:25:32,070

Pivot. We tried to see someone hold it
 

6475
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:45,110
Pivot. We tried to see someone hold it
here. We squeeze through. We come back.

6476
02:28:45,110 --> 02:28:45,120
here. We squeeze through. We come back.
 

6477
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:47,270
here. We squeeze through. We come back.
We back test. We back test. Little flush

6478
02:28:47,270 --> 02:28:47,280
We back test. We back test. Little flush
 

6479
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:48,870
We back test. We back test. Little flush
over. Little flush. And then look what

6480
02:28:48,870 --> 02:28:48,880
over. Little flush. And then look what
 

6481
02:28:48,880 --> 02:28:52,469
over. Little flush. And then look what
happens. 118 lot. 173 lot. They come

6482
02:28:52,469 --> 02:28:52,479
happens. 118 lot. 173 lot. They come
 

6483
02:28:52,479 --> 02:28:57,030
happens. 118 lot. 173 lot. They come
piling in here. 106 lot. 41 lot. low of

6484
02:28:57,030 --> 02:28:57,040
piling in here. 106 lot. 41 lot. low of
 

6485
02:28:57,040 --> 02:29:00,150
piling in here. 106 lot. 41 lot. low of
day 139 lot. Then we instantly reclaim

6486
02:29:00,150 --> 02:29:00,160
day 139 lot. Then we instantly reclaim
 

6487
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:03,030
day 139 lot. Then we instantly reclaim
and then what? Everyone who's a seller

6488
02:29:03,030 --> 02:29:03,040
and then what? Everyone who's a seller
 

6489
02:29:03,040 --> 02:29:04,469
and then what? Everyone who's a seller
is now caught. And what do they get

6490
02:29:04,469 --> 02:29:04,479
is now caught. And what do they get
 

6491
02:29:04,479 --> 02:29:05,910
is now caught. And what do they get
forced to do? Well, their stops would be

6492
02:29:05,910 --> 02:29:05,920
forced to do? Well, their stops would be
 

6493
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:07,670
forced to do? Well, their stops would be
above each of these swing points and

6494
02:29:07,670 --> 02:29:07,680
above each of these swing points and
 

6495
02:29:07,680 --> 02:29:09,990
above each of these swing points and
boom. All right, that's the pain.

6496
02:29:09,990 --> 02:29:10,000
boom. All right, that's the pain.
 

6497
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,389
boom. All right, that's the pain.
There's the pain point. You're seeing

6498
02:29:12,389 --> 02:29:12,399
There's the pain point. You're seeing
 

6499
02:29:12,399 --> 02:29:15,910
There's the pain point. You're seeing
the same here now, right? Of liquidity

6500
02:29:15,910 --> 02:29:15,920

complete the rotation. I would not
 

6511
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:30,950
complete the rotation. I would not

personally be wanting to bid that. I
 

6513
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:34,150
personally be wanting to bid that. I
would be more willing to let them sell

6514
02:29:34,150 --> 02:29:34,160
would be more willing to let them sell
 

6515
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:36,389
would be more willing to let them sell

But it's counter trend. There's no doubt
about it. It's a counter trend trade.

6528

about it. It's a counter trend trade.
It's the hardest trade to have in the

It's the hardest trade to have in the
 

6531
02:29:50,479 --> 02:29:51,990
It's the hardest trade to have in the
book. I always talk about it. The best

02:29:51,990 --> 02:29:52,000
book. I always talk about it. The best
 

6533
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,070

trades, the easiest trades to master are
 

6535
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:55,349
trades, the easiest trades to master are
the protrend trades. When the higher

6536
02:29:55,349 --> 02:29:55,359
the protrend trades. When the higher
 

6537
02:29:55,359 --> 02:29:57,270
the protrend trades. When the higher
time frame and lower time frame want to

time frame and lower time frame want to
 

6539
02:29:57,280 --> 02:30:12,950

Matt. Thanks, Matt. Have your fingers
gone flat yet? I don't know. Like what

6550
02:30:22,790 --> 02:30:22,800
gone flat yet? I don't know. Like what
 

6551
02:30:22,800 --> 02:30:26,070
gone flat yet? I don't know. Like what
I'm struggling with is the

6552
02:30:26,070 --> 02:30:26,080
I'm struggling with is the
 

6553
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:27,429
I'm struggling with is the
you might get a squeeze on the flag

6554
02:30:27,429 --> 02:30:27,439
you might get a squeeze on the flag
 

6555
02:30:27,439 --> 02:30:29,190
you might get a squeeze on the flag
here. So leg two might be happening. So

6556
02:30:29,190 --> 02:30:29,200
here. So leg two might be happening. So
 

6557
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:31,670
here. So leg two might be happening. So
leg one, leg two. If we get a measured

6558
02:30:31,670 --> 02:30:31,680
leg one, leg two. If we get a measured
 

6559
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:35,750
leg one, leg two. If we get a measured
move here.

6560
02:30:35,750 --> 02:30:35,760

 

6561
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:41,270

How many points we looking at?

6562
02:30:41,270 --> 02:30:41,280

 

6563
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:44,790

Move that.

6564
02:30:44,790 --> 02:30:44,800

 

6565
02:30:44,800 --> 02:30:46,150

If you get lucky, you're going to get

6566
02:30:46,150 --> 02:30:46,160
If you get lucky, you're going to get
 

6567
02:30:46,160 --> 02:30:47,510
If you get lucky, you're going to get
this move. That would be the measured

6568
02:30:47,510 --> 02:30:47,520
this move. That would be the measured
 

6569
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:49,750
this move. That would be the measured
move. You might get this move to target.

6570
02:30:49,750 --> 02:30:49,760
move. You might get this move to target.
 

6571
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:51,910
move. You might get this move to target.
It is the correct measurement. So there

6572
02:30:51,910 --> 02:30:51,920
It is the correct measurement. So there
 

6573
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:54,309
It is the correct measurement. So there
is confluence right now for this to

6574
02:30:54,309 --> 02:30:54,319
is confluence right now for this to
 

6575
02:30:54,319 --> 02:30:56,870
is confluence right now for this to
happen. There is confluence right now

6576
02:30:56,870 --> 02:30:56,880
happen. There is confluence right now
 

6577
02:30:56,880 --> 02:30:58,389
happen. There is confluence right now
for this to happen. It doesn't have to

6578
02:30:58,389 --> 02:30:58,399
for this to happen. It doesn't have to
 

6579
02:30:58,399 --> 02:31:00,230
for this to happen. It doesn't have to
happen, but if they have caught enough

6580
02:31:00,230 --> 02:31:00,240
happen, but if they have caught enough
 

6581
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:01,750
happen, but if they have caught enough
shorts under here like we've talked

6582
02:31:01,750 --> 02:31:01,760
shorts under here like we've talked
 

6583
02:31:01,760 --> 02:31:03,190
shorts under here like we've talked
about, I would much rather it comes down

6584
02:31:03,190 --> 02:31:03,200
about, I would much rather it comes down
 

6585
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:04,710
about, I would much rather it comes down
into here for me to bid. But if they

6586
02:31:04,710 --> 02:31:04,720
into here for me to bid. But if they
 

6587
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:06,950
into here for me to bid. But if they
have and they can do this, the measured

6588
02:31:06,950 --> 02:31:06,960
have and they can do this, the measured
 

6589
02:31:06,960 --> 02:31:09,110
have and they can do this, the measured
move technically, if that is leg one,

6590
02:31:09,110 --> 02:31:09,120
move technically, if that is leg one,
 

6591
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:10,790
move technically, if that is leg one,
technically is leg two. I'd be very

6592
02:31:10,790 --> 02:31:10,800
technically is leg two. I'd be very
 

6593
02:31:10,800 --> 02:31:11,990
technically is leg two. I'd be very
cautious with it because it's counter

6594
02:31:11,990 --> 02:31:12,000
cautious with it because it's counter
 

6595
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:13,590
cautious with it because it's counter
trend. But if you are positioned long

6596
02:31:13,590 --> 02:31:13,600
trend. But if you are positioned long
 

6597
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:15,590
trend. But if you are positioned long
from here, you can try and hold a runner

6598
02:31:15,590 --> 02:31:15,600
from here, you can try and hold a runner
 

6599
02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:17,110
from here, you can try and hold a runner
to get up into here. That would be a big

6600
02:31:17,110 --> 02:31:17,120
to get up into here. That would be a big
 

6601
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:18,550
to get up into here. That would be a big
big big trade. How much would that be

6602
02:31:18,550 --> 02:31:18,560
big big trade. How much would that be
 

6603
02:31:18,560 --> 02:31:21,270
big big trade. How much would that be
for you? That would be 250 point trade.

6604
02:31:21,270 --> 02:31:21,280
for you? That would be 250 point trade.
 

6605
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:23,910
for you? That would be 250 point trade.
That would well at least I' I'd make up

That would well at least I' I'd make up
 

6607
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:27,429
That would well at least I' I'd make up
for the uh the 500 pointer that we

out of it.

6612
02:31:40,950 --> 02:31:40,960

02:32:00,720 --> 02:32:03,349
fret. I am struggling to do that. That
is killing my fingers. I'm really

6628
02:32:03,349 --> 02:32:03,359
is killing my fingers. I'm really
 

6629
02:32:03,359 --> 02:32:05,110
is killing my fingers. I'm really
struggling with that. If anyone plays

6630
02:32:05,110 --> 02:32:05,120
struggling with that. If anyone plays
 

6631
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:07,590
struggling with that. If anyone plays
guitar, they'll they'll know. And uh

6632
02:32:07,590 --> 02:32:07,600
guitar, they'll they'll know. And uh
 

6633
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:09,030
guitar, they'll they'll know. And uh
they'll probably be like, "Mate, you are

6634
02:32:09,030 --> 02:32:09,040
they'll probably be like, "Mate, you are
 

6635
02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:11,110
they'll probably be like, "Mate, you are
[\h__\h] if you can't play three fret on a

6636
02:32:11,110 --> 02:32:11,120

6637
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:12,790
[\h__\h] if you can't play three fret on a
C. What is wrong with you? But I'm only

6638
02:32:12,790 --> 02:32:12,800
C. What is wrong with you? But I'm only
 

6639
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:20,309
C. What is wrong with you? But I'm only
eight days in or something, guys.

6640
02:32:20,309 --> 02:32:20,319

 

6641
02:32:20,319 --> 02:32:23,270

I don't understand how the 2,500 trading

6642
02:32:23,270 --> 02:32:23,280
I don't understand how the 2,500 trading
 

6643
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:25,670
I don't understand how the 2,500 trading
draw down in Apex. If our position goes

6644
02:32:25,670 --> 02:32:25,680
draw down in Apex. If our position goes
 

6645
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:29,349
draw down in Apex. If our position goes
up 1K and then takes a stop loss at 500,

6646
02:32:29,349 --> 02:32:29,359
up 1K and then takes a stop loss at 500,
 

6647
02:32:29,359 --> 02:32:32,870
up 1K and then takes a stop loss at 500,
it counts 500 draw down. No, it it would

6648
02:32:32,870 --> 02:32:32,880
it counts 500 draw down. No, it it would
 

6649
02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:35,190
it counts 500 draw down. No, it it would
count more than that. So, it's a trail,

6650
02:32:35,190 --> 02:32:35,200
count more than that. So, it's a trail,
 

6651
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:37,590
count more than that. So, it's a trail,
Fernando. So,

6652
02:32:37,590 --> 02:32:37,600
Fernando. So,
 

6653
02:32:37,600 --> 02:32:41,349
Fernando. So,
right, let's say you're long here.

6654
02:32:41,349 --> 02:32:41,359
right, let's say you're long here.
 

6655
02:32:41,359 --> 02:32:44,389
right, let's say you're long here.
All right. And you're a,000 bucks up,

6656
02:32:44,389 --> 02:32:44,399
All right. And you're a,000 bucks up,
 

6657
02:32:44,399 --> 02:32:46,710
All right. And you're a,000 bucks up,
okay? And then you give 500 bucks back.

6658
02:32:46,710 --> 02:32:46,720
okay? And then you give 500 bucks back.
 

6659
02:32:46,720 --> 02:32:49,190
okay? And then you give 500 bucks back.
So you only lock 500 in. You've now

6660
02:32:49,190 --> 02:32:49,200
So you only lock 500 in. You've now
 

6661
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:52,230
So you only lock 500 in. You've now
eaten $500 of your draw down. If you

6662
02:32:52,230 --> 02:32:52,240
eaten $500 of your draw down. If you
 

6663
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:54,150
eaten $500 of your draw down. If you
were a,000 bucks up and it came all the

6664
02:32:54,150 --> 02:32:54,160
were a,000 bucks up and it came all the
 

6665
02:32:54,160 --> 02:32:56,150
were a,000 bucks up and it came all the
way back to break even, you have now

6666
02:32:56,150 --> 02:32:56,160
way back to break even, you have now
 

6667
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:58,550
way back to break even, you have now
eaten $1,000 of your draw down because

6668
02:32:58,550 --> 02:32:58,560
eaten $1,000 of your draw down because
 

6669
02:32:58,560 --> 02:33:00,710
eaten $1,000 of your draw down because
it's trailing draw down. So the best way

6670
02:33:00,710 --> 02:33:00,720
it's trailing draw down. So the best way
 

6671
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:02,309
it's trailing draw down. So the best way
to do it with Apex, there's two ways of

6672
02:33:02,309 --> 02:33:02,319
to do it with Apex, there's two ways of
 

6673
02:33:02,319 --> 02:33:05,270
to do it with Apex, there's two ways of
doing it. One is to size very small so

6674
02:33:05,270 --> 02:33:05,280
doing it. One is to size very small so
 

6675
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:06,950
doing it. One is to size very small so
that you can sit through the pullbacks

6676
02:33:06,950 --> 02:33:06,960
that you can sit through the pullbacks
 

6677
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:08,710
that you can sit through the pullbacks
and not worry. All right, which is what

6678
02:33:08,710 --> 02:33:08,720
and not worry. All right, which is what
 

6679
02:33:08,720 --> 02:33:10,070
and not worry. All right, which is what
you should definitely do on your PA

6680
02:33:10,070 --> 02:33:10,080
you should definitely do on your PA
 

6681
02:33:10,080 --> 02:33:12,950
you should definitely do on your PA
accounts. Two, which I do not advise

6682
02:33:12,950 --> 02:33:12,960
accounts. Two, which I do not advise
 

6683
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:16,230
accounts. Two, which I do not advise
doing, but I do do this if I need to get

6684
02:33:16,230 --> 02:33:16,240
doing, but I do do this if I need to get
 

6685
02:33:16,240 --> 02:33:17,910
doing, but I do do this if I need to get
more accounts. I will be aggressive with

6686
02:33:17,910 --> 02:33:17,920
more accounts. I will be aggressive with
 

6687
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:19,830
more accounts. I will be aggressive with
my evals because I do not want to take

6688
02:33:19,830 --> 02:33:19,840
my evals because I do not want to take
 

6689
02:33:19,840 --> 02:33:21,750
my evals because I do not want to take
long to do it, but I also know that I

6690
02:33:21,750 --> 02:33:21,760
long to do it, but I also know that I
 

6691
02:33:21,760 --> 02:33:23,990
long to do it, but I also know that I
have ability to do it. Is I will be more

6692
02:33:23,990 --> 02:33:24,000
have ability to do it. Is I will be more
 

6693
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:25,590
have ability to do it. Is I will be more
aggressive with the sizing so that I

6694
02:33:25,590 --> 02:33:25,600
aggressive with the sizing so that I
 

6695
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:27,349
aggressive with the sizing so that I
know when I hit my target, I'm making

6696
02:33:27,349 --> 02:33:27,359
know when I hit my target, I'm making
 

6697
02:33:27,359 --> 02:33:30,550
know when I hit my target, I'm making
sure that target takes a good chunk of

6698
02:33:30,550 --> 02:33:30,560
sure that target takes a good chunk of
 

6699
02:33:30,560 --> 02:33:32,790
sure that target takes a good chunk of
the change for me. Like, so I I want to

6700
02:33:32,790 --> 02:33:32,800
the change for me. Like, so I I want to
 

6701
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:35,110
the change for me. Like, so I I want to
try and pass it, not necessarily in one

6702
02:33:35,110 --> 02:33:35,120
try and pass it, not necessarily in one
 

6703
02:33:35,120 --> 02:33:36,550
try and pass it, not necessarily in one
move, but I want to get a good chunk of

6704
02:33:36,550 --> 02:33:36,560
move, but I want to get a good chunk of
 

6705
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:38,630
move, but I want to get a good chunk of
it done. I'm not looking to hold through

6706
02:33:38,630 --> 02:33:38,640
it done. I'm not looking to hold through
 

6707
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:39,990
it done. I'm not looking to hold through
the draw down. So, the other way of

6708
02:33:39,990 --> 02:33:40,000
the draw down. So, the other way of
 

6709
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,230
the draw down. So, the other way of
doing it is being more aggressive and

6710
02:33:42,230 --> 02:33:42,240
doing it is being more aggressive and
 

6711
02:33:42,240 --> 02:33:44,070
doing it is being more aggressive and
then trail your stop. All right? Move

6712
02:33:44,070 --> 02:33:44,080
then trail your stop. All right? Move
 

6713
02:33:44,080 --> 02:33:46,630
then trail your stop. All right? Move
your stop up up up and you're out. And

6714

your stop up up up and you're out. And
 

6715
02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:48,309
your stop up up up and you're out. And
then you wait for a reload on the second

6716
02:33:48,309 --> 02:33:48,319
then you wait for a reload on the second
 

6717
02:33:48,319 --> 02:33:51,030
then you wait for a reload on the second
trade. Move your stop up. Take some

02:33:52,469 --> 02:33:52,479
partials. Take So, you want to be taking
 

6721
02:33:52,479 --> 02:33:54,630
partials. Take So, you want to be taking
partials at the highs of each move,

6722
02:33:54,630 --> 02:33:54,640
partials at the highs of each move,
 

6723
02:33:54,640 --> 02:33:56,469
partials at the highs of each move,

6724
02:33:56,469 --> 02:33:56,479
right? You don't want to let it pull
 

6725
02:33:56,479 --> 02:33:58,150
right? You don't want to let it pull
back on you on Apex when you're dealing

6726
02:33:58,150 --> 02:33:58,160
back on you on Apex when you're dealing
 

6727
02:33:58,160 --> 02:34:03,830
back on you on Apex when you're dealing
with the trading draw down.

6728
02:34:03,830 --> 02:34:03,840

 

6729
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:06,230

Oh, really, mate? Yes, I might need some

help.
 

6733
02:34:08,479 --> 02:34:09,990
help.
First of all, I need these to stop

6734
02:34:09,990 --> 02:34:10,000
First of all, I need these to stop
 

6735
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,230
First of all, I need these to stop
hurting because I'm like a little [\h__\h]

first day I didn't play because they've
 

6741
02:34:16,160 --> 02:34:17,510
first day I didn't play because they've
been so sore. I think they are feeling

02:34:17,510 --> 02:34:17,520
been so sore. I think they are feeling

overplayed so much that even typing on

02:34:23,270 --> 02:34:23,280
overplayed so much that even typing on
 

6749
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:24,710
overplayed so much that even typing on
the keyboard was hurting. Here you go.

You might get the lift here, guys. I

me so happy, but also so jealous. Like,
 

6757
02:34:31,439 --> 02:34:33,190
me so happy, but also so jealous. Like,
talk about timing. Alex goes to the

6758
02:34:33,190 --> 02:34:33,200
talk about timing. Alex goes to the
 

6759
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:35,110
talk about timing. Alex goes to the
toilet. He tries the trade here. He goes

6760
02:34:35,110 --> 02:34:35,120
toilet. He tries the trade here. He goes
 

6761
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:36,790
toilet. He tries the trade here. He goes
to the toilet. He comes back. It's here.

6762
02:34:36,790 --> 02:34:36,800
to the toilet. He comes back. It's here.
 

6763
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:38,309
to the toilet. He comes back. It's here.
He's missed the trade and he doesn't

6764
02:34:38,309 --> 02:34:38,319
He's missed the trade and he doesn't
 

6765
02:34:38,319 --> 02:34:39,429
He's missed the trade and he doesn't
want to buy here because he wants a

6766
02:34:39,429 --> 02:34:39,439
want to buy here because he wants a
 

6767
02:34:39,439 --> 02:34:41,190
want to buy here because he wants a
deeper pullback and now he's probably

6768
02:34:41,190 --> 02:34:41,200
deeper pullback and now he's probably
 

6769
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:42,870
deeper pullback and now he's probably
going to watch it hit the target. Well,

6770
02:34:42,870 --> 02:34:42,880
going to watch it hit the target. Well,
 

6771
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:45,110
going to watch it hit the target. Well,
thank you very much, Mark. Aren't you

6772
02:34:45,110 --> 02:34:45,120
thank you very much, Mark. Aren't you

02:34:51,590 --> 02:34:51,600

 

6775
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:54,150

Do I have monthly P&L targets? No. I

6776
02:34:54,150 --> 02:34:54,160
Do I have monthly P&L targets? No. I
 

6777
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:56,230
Do I have monthly P&L targets? No. I
used to do that. I like really try not

6778
02:34:56,230 --> 02:34:56,240
used to do that. I like really try not
 

6779
02:34:56,240 --> 02:34:57,670
used to do that. I like really try not
to do that anymore because the problem

6780
02:34:57,670 --> 02:34:57,680
to do that anymore because the problem
 

6781
02:34:57,680 --> 02:35:00,710
to do that anymore because the problem
with doing that is conditions change.

6782
02:35:00,710 --> 02:35:00,720
with doing that is conditions change.
 

6783
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:02,710
with doing that is conditions change.
Um, this month will be a good month for

6784
02:35:02,710 --> 02:35:02,720
Um, this month will be a good month for
 

6785
02:35:02,720 --> 02:35:04,309
Um, this month will be a good month for
me. I can tell you it'll be a good month

6786
02:35:04,309 --> 02:35:04,319
me. I can tell you it'll be a good month
 

6787
02:35:04,319 --> 02:35:05,830
me. I can tell you it'll be a good month
for me. Why will it be a good month for

6788
02:35:05,830 --> 02:35:05,840
for me. Why will it be a good month for
 

6789
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:07,750
for me. Why will it be a good month for
me? Because the markets move from a

6790
02:35:07,750 --> 02:35:07,760
me? Because the markets move from a
 

6791
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:10,150
me? Because the markets move from a
rotation market to a breakout and even a

6792
02:35:10,150 --> 02:35:10,160
rotation market to a breakout and even a
 

6793
02:35:10,160 --> 02:35:11,670
rotation market to a breakout and even a
failed breakout. So that we have

6794
02:35:11,670 --> 02:35:11,680
failed breakout. So that we have
 

6795
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:14,150
failed breakout. So that we have
opportunities like today. So these are

6796
02:35:14,150 --> 02:35:14,160
opportunities like today. So these are
 

6797
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:16,550
opportunities like today. So these are
my A+ opportunities. When we start to

6798
02:35:16,550 --> 02:35:16,560
my A+ opportunities. When we start to
 

6799
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:18,309
my A+ opportunities. When we start to
leave volume trapped, right? When we

6800
02:35:18,309 --> 02:35:18,319
leave volume trapped, right? When we
 

6801
02:35:18,319 --> 02:35:20,710
leave volume trapped, right? When we
start to leave volume trapped and we

6802
02:35:20,710 --> 02:35:20,720
start to leave volume trapped and we
 

6803
02:35:20,720 --> 02:35:23,110
start to leave volume trapped and we
leave volume, we have an A+ opportunity.

6804
02:35:23,110 --> 02:35:23,120
leave volume, we have an A+ opportunity.
 

6805
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:24,790
leave volume, we have an A+ opportunity.
When we trade inside, which is what I

6806
02:35:24,790 --> 02:35:24,800
When we trade inside, which is what I
 

6807
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:27,590
When we trade inside, which is what I
thought we'd do today, that is very

6808
02:35:27,590 --> 02:35:27,600
thought we'd do today, that is very
 

6809
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:29,429
thought we'd do today, that is very
small amounts of trade for me. So, if

6810
02:35:29,429 --> 02:35:29,439
small amounts of trade for me. So, if
 

6811
02:35:29,439 --> 02:35:30,790
small amounts of trade for me. So, if
you think about the trades we've had all

6812
02:35:30,790 --> 02:35:30,800
you think about the trades we've had all
 

6813
02:35:30,800 --> 02:35:33,270
you think about the trades we've had all
week this week, uh they've pretty much

6814
02:35:33,270 --> 02:35:33,280
week this week, uh they've pretty much
 

6815
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:35,190
week this week, uh they've pretty much
all been in breakout, haven't they,

6816
02:35:35,190 --> 02:35:35,200
all been in breakout, haven't they,
 

6817
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:38,950
all been in breakout, haven't they,
which has been very, very good for us.

6818
02:35:38,950 --> 02:35:38,960
which has been very, very good for us.
 

6819
02:35:38,960 --> 02:35:40,710
which has been very, very good for us.
So, if we go back to the trades we've

6820
02:35:40,710 --> 02:35:40,720
So, if we go back to the trades we've
 

6821
02:35:40,720 --> 02:35:43,590
So, if we go back to the trades we've
had this week, yesterday was good, but

6822
02:35:43,590 --> 02:35:43,600
had this week, yesterday was good, but
 

6823
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:45,110
had this week, yesterday was good, but
it could have been better if they did

6824
02:35:45,110 --> 02:35:45,120
it could have been better if they did
 

6825
02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:47,030
it could have been better if they did
the move that they did in earnings for

6826
02:35:47,030 --> 02:35:47,040
the move that they did in earnings for
 

6827
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:51,590
the move that they did in earnings for
me during the day. So, yesterday

6828
02:35:51,590 --> 02:35:51,600

 

6829
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:54,230

is where is yesterday? So, yesterday we

6830
02:35:54,230 --> 02:35:54,240

to remember.

6834
02:35:59,910 --> 02:35:59,920

 

6835

here but it didn't happen until the
 

6847
02:36:14,399 --> 02:36:16,230
here but it didn't happen until the
earnings call. So lots of my Discord

bought that back up which is the right
 

6851
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:19,030
bought that back up which is the right
thing to do. That was the trap level.

6852
02:36:19,030 --> 02:36:19,040
thing to do. That was the trap level.
 

6853
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:20,230
thing to do. That was the trap level.

6868
02:36:36,309 --> 02:36:36,319
went in breakout from Monday. So, this
 

6869
02:36:36,319 --> 02:36:39,510
went in breakout from Monday. So, this
week's been good. Monday upside, Tuesday

6870
02:36:39,510 --> 02:36:39,520
week's been good. Monday upside, Tuesday
 

6871
02:36:39,520 --> 02:36:40,950
week's been good. Monday upside, Tuesday
upside, Wednesday, we played the

6872
02:36:40,950 --> 02:36:40,960
upside, Wednesday, we played the
 

6873
02:36:40,960 --> 02:36:42,630
upside, Wednesday, we played the
pullback leg. I wanted to buy the dip,

6874
02:36:42,630 --> 02:36:42,640
pullback leg. I wanted to buy the dip,
 

6875
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:44,630
pullback leg. I wanted to buy the dip,
but it happened in earnings. And then

6876
02:36:44,630 --> 02:36:44,640
but it happened in earnings. And then
 

6877
02:36:44,640 --> 02:36:46,309
but it happened in earnings. And then
today, we left all that volume. So, if

6878
02:36:46,309 --> 02:36:46,319
today, we left all that volume. So, if
 

6879
02:36:46,319 --> 02:36:48,550
today, we left all that volume. So, if
you just zoom out,

6880
02:36:48,550 --> 02:36:48,560
you just zoom out,
 

6881
02:36:48,560 --> 02:36:50,790
you just zoom out,
we go to like 15 minute here. We just

6882
02:36:50,790 --> 02:36:50,800
we go to like 15 minute here. We just
 

6883
02:36:50,800 --> 02:36:52,389
we go to like 15 minute here. We just
zoom out. I can take this off to make it

6884
02:36:52,389 --> 02:36:52,399
zoom out. I can take this off to make it
 

6885
02:36:52,399 --> 02:36:55,030
zoom out. I can take this off to make it
really easy. What have we done? Well,

6886
02:36:55,030 --> 02:36:55,040
really easy. What have we done? Well,
 

6887
02:36:55,040 --> 02:36:56,469
really easy. What have we done? Well,
we're coming back to where we broke out

6888
02:36:56,469 --> 02:36:56,479
we're coming back to where we broke out
 

6889
02:36:56,479 --> 02:36:58,150
we're coming back to where we broke out
from. It's where we broke out from. This

6890
02:36:58,150 --> 02:36:58,160
from. It's where we broke out from. This
 

6891
02:36:58,160 --> 02:36:59,750
from. It's where we broke out from. This
is where we started bidding this week.

6892
02:36:59,750 --> 02:36:59,760
is where we started bidding this week.
 

6893
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:03,830
is where we started bidding this week.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. We

6894
02:37:03,830 --> 02:37:03,840
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. We
 

6895
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:06,389
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. We
leave it. That's my A+. Leaving volume.

6896
02:37:06,389 --> 02:37:06,399
leave it. That's my A+. Leaving volume.
 

6897
02:37:06,399 --> 02:37:08,790
leave it. That's my A+. Leaving volume.
That is my A+ scenario. This was eight

6898
02:37:08,790 --> 02:37:08,800
That is my A+ scenario. This was eight
 

6899
02:37:08,800 --> 02:37:11,030
That is my A+ scenario. This was eight
on the way up because we're also leaving

6900
02:37:11,030 --> 02:37:11,040
on the way up because we're also leaving
 

6901
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:12,950
on the way up because we're also leaving
trap volume on the way up. Right? And

6902
02:37:12,950 --> 02:37:12,960
trap volume on the way up. Right? And
 

6903
02:37:12,960 --> 02:37:14,550
trap volume on the way up. Right? And
now we're coming back to repric it. If

6904
02:37:14,550 --> 02:37:14,560
now we're coming back to repric it. If
 

6905
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:17,190
now we're coming back to repric it. If
we do a dance in here next week, it will

6906
02:37:17,190 --> 02:37:17,200
we do a dance in here next week, it will
 

6907
02:37:17,200 --> 02:37:18,790
we do a dance in here next week, it will
not be an A+ week for me. It will be a

6908
02:37:18,790 --> 02:37:18,800
not be an A+ week for me. It will be a
 

6909
02:37:18,800 --> 02:37:21,190
not be an A+ week for me. It will be a
very boring week for me and how I trade.

6910
02:37:21,190 --> 02:37:21,200
very boring week for me and how I trade.
 

6911
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:23,190
very boring week for me and how I trade.
But I know what my edge is. I think

6912
02:37:23,190 --> 02:37:23,200
But I know what my edge is. I think
 

6913
02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:24,870
But I know what my edge is. I think
that's the other thing that a lot of

6914
02:37:24,870 --> 02:37:24,880
that's the other thing that a lot of
 

6915
02:37:24,880 --> 02:37:27,590
that's the other thing that a lot of
traders struggle with like uh

6916
02:37:27,590 --> 02:37:27,600
traders struggle with like uh
 

6917
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:29,190
traders struggle with like uh
identifying the trade that you're

6918
02:37:29,190 --> 02:37:29,200
identifying the trade that you're
 

6919
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:31,429
identifying the trade that you're
looking for, the prime

6920
02:37:31,429 --> 02:37:31,439
looking for, the prime
 

6921
02:37:31,439 --> 02:37:34,469
looking for, the prime
setup that you like to trade. Mine are

6922
02:37:34,469 --> 02:37:34,479
setup that you like to trade. Mine are
 

6923
02:37:34,479 --> 02:37:36,950
setup that you like to trade. Mine are
protrending markets, right? Which means

6924
02:37:36,950 --> 02:37:36,960
protrending markets, right? Which means
 

6925
02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:38,469
protrending markets, right? Which means
either in breakout or in a failed

6926
02:37:38,469 --> 02:37:38,479
either in breakout or in a failed
 

6927
02:37:38,479 --> 02:37:41,030
either in breakout or in a failed
breakout. We've had both this week. It's

6928
02:37:41,030 --> 02:37:41,040
breakout. We've had both this week. It's
 

6929
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:43,830
breakout. We've had both this week. It's
been fantastic. Um Tyson, for example,

6930
02:37:43,830 --> 02:37:43,840
been fantastic. Um Tyson, for example,
 

6931
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:47,910
been fantastic. Um Tyson, for example,
is an IB trader. So Tyson will be

6932
02:37:47,910 --> 02:37:47,920
is an IB trader. So Tyson will be
 

6933
02:37:47,920 --> 02:37:52,550
is an IB trader. So Tyson will be
looking for that or looking for this.

6934
02:37:52,550 --> 02:37:52,560
looking for that or looking for this.
 

6935
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:54,550
looking for that or looking for this.
Right. So, understanding we talk about

6936
02:37:54,550 --> 02:37:54,560
Right. So, understanding we talk about
 

6937
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:57,990
Right. So, understanding we talk about
all the time, one play at a time. So

6938
02:37:57,990 --> 02:37:58,000
all the time, one play at a time. So
 

6939
02:37:58,000 --> 02:37:59,510
all the time, one play at a time. So
many people come to the markets and they

6940
02:37:59,510 --> 02:37:59,520
many people come to the markets and they
 

6941
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:02,389
many people come to the markets and they
want to play every single candle, every

6942
02:38:02,389 --> 02:38:02,399
want to play every single candle, every
 

6943
02:38:02,399 --> 02:38:04,309
want to play every single candle, every
single setup in front of them. You can't

6944
02:38:04,309 --> 02:38:04,319
single setup in front of them. You can't
 

6945
02:38:04,319 --> 02:38:06,950
single setup in front of them. You can't
do that, guys. You can't do it. Like I

6946
02:38:06,950 --> 02:38:06,960
do that, guys. You can't do it. Like I
 

6947
02:38:06,960 --> 02:38:09,110
do that, guys. You can't do it. Like I
said, read golf is a is not a game of

6948
02:38:09,110 --> 02:38:09,120
said, read golf is a is not a game of

perfect. I think it's the best book for

6950
02:38:10,870 --> 02:38:10,880
perfect. I think it's the best book for
 

6951
02:38:10,880 --> 02:38:12,469
perfect. I think it's the best book for
traders to read. I know people will

6952
02:38:12,469 --> 02:38:12,479
traders to read. I know people will
 

6953
02:38:12,479 --> 02:38:14,469
traders to read. I know people will
laugh at that, but if you are new to

6954
02:38:14,469 --> 02:38:14,479
laugh at that, but if you are new to
 

6955
02:38:14,479 --> 02:38:18,550
laugh at that, but if you are new to
golf and you want to go and play an 18

6956
02:38:18,550 --> 02:38:18,560
golf and you want to go and play an 18
 

6957
02:38:18,560 --> 02:38:20,710
golf and you want to go and play an 18
hole with the pros and you get out your

6959
02:38:20,720 --> 02:38:24,309

6961
02:38:24,319 --> 02:38:25,990
driver on hole number one in front of
everyone watching in the stands, well,

6962
02:38:25,990 --> 02:38:26,000
everyone watching in the stands, well,
 

6963
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:27,190
everyone watching in the stands, well,
what are you going to do? You're going

6964
02:38:27,190 --> 02:38:27,200
what are you going to do? You're going
 

6965
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:30,150
what are you going to do? You're going
to absolutely [\h__\h] it up. The chances of

6966
02:38:30,150 --> 02:38:30,160
to absolutely [\h__\h] it up. The chances of
 

6967
02:38:30,160 --> 02:38:32,950
to absolutely [\h__\h] it up. The chances of
you driving 300 yards straight down the

6968
02:38:32,950 --> 02:38:32,960
you driving 300 yards straight down the
 

6969
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:36,309
you driving 300 yards straight down the
middle are probably 0.001%.

6970
02:38:36,309 --> 02:38:36,319
middle are probably 0.001%.
 

6971
02:38:36,319 --> 02:38:38,630
middle are probably 0.001%.
So why do you think coming to trade that

6972
02:38:38,630 --> 02:38:38,640
So why do you think coming to trade that
 

6973

6977
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:43,830
wonderful setup that you've never taken
before? What's the easiest setup? You

6978
02:38:43,830 --> 02:38:43,840
before? What's the easiest setup? You
 

6979

6987
02:38:51,600 --> 02:38:54,070
to that layup. That layup for you might
be IB to VW up, right? It might be IB

02:38:54,070 --> 02:38:54,080
be IB to VW up, right? It might be IB
 

6989
02:38:54,080 --> 02:38:56,950
be IB to VW up, right? It might be IB
expansion. It might be opening range,

6990
02:38:56,950 --> 02:38:56,960
expansion. It might be opening range,

02:39:02,950 --> 02:39:02,960
expansion. It might be flag breakout.
 

6995
02:39:02,960 --> 02:39:05,590
expansion. It might be flag breakout.
Flag breakout. might be a rotation of

6996
02:39:05,590 --> 02:39:05,600
Flag breakout. might be a rotation of
 

6997
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:07,670
Flag breakout. might be a rotation of
value. It's up to you to define what

6998
02:39:07,670 --> 02:39:07,680
value. It's up to you to define what
 

6999
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:09,270
value. It's up to you to define what
that is. Get good at that one trade,

7000
02:39:09,270 --> 02:39:09,280
that is. Get good at that one trade,
 

7001
02:39:09,280 --> 02:39:11,270
that is. Get good at that one trade,
then add a second trade in, then add a

7002
02:39:11,270 --> 02:39:11,280
then add a second trade in, then add a
 

7003
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:12,950
then add a second trade in, then add a
third trade in, then add a fourth trade

7004
02:39:12,950 --> 02:39:12,960
third trade in, then add a fourth trade
 

7005
02:39:12,960 --> 02:39:14,630
third trade in, then add a fourth trade
in. And once you've been trading for

in. And once you've been trading for
 

7007
02:39:14,640 --> 02:39:16,070
in. And once you've been trading for
years and years and years, you will have

7008
02:39:16,070 --> 02:39:16,080
years and years and years, you will have

a plethora of different clubs that you
 

7011
02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:20,630
a plethora of different clubs that you
can get out depending on the

can get out depending on the
 

7013
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:31,670
can get out depending on the
environment.

7014
02:39:31,670 --> 02:39:31,680

you play golf and love the analogy.

7018
02:39:35,990 --> 02:39:36,000
you play golf and love the analogy.
 

7019
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:37,429
you play golf and love the analogy.
Yeah. Well, which should make sense to

7020
02:39:37,429 --> 02:39:37,439
Yeah. Well, which should make sense to
 

7021
02:39:37,439 --> 02:39:40,550
Yeah. Well, which should make sense to
you.

7022
02:39:40,550 --> 02:39:40,560

 

7023
02:39:40,560 --> 02:39:42,950

How many moves are viable to play each

7024
02:39:42,950 --> 02:39:42,960
How many moves are viable to play each
 

7025
02:39:42,960 --> 02:39:45,270
How many moves are viable to play each
day?

7026
02:39:45,270 --> 02:39:45,280
day?
 

7027
02:39:45,280 --> 02:39:47,830
day?
Are there always usually always around

7028
02:39:47,830 --> 02:39:47,840
Are there always usually always around
 

7029
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:50,070
Are there always usually always around
the first hour of New York? Uh that is a

7030
02:39:50,070 --> 02:39:50,080
the first hour of New York? Uh that is a
 

7031
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:52,469
the first hour of New York? Uh that is a
good question and there is no answer to

7032
02:39:52,469 --> 02:39:52,479
good question and there is no answer to
 

7033
02:39:52,479 --> 02:39:54,870
good question and there is no answer to
that. Right? There is no answer to that

7034
02:39:54,870 --> 02:39:54,880
that. Right? There is no answer to that
 

7035
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:58,790
that. Right? There is no answer to that
I'm afraid. Um moves become dependent on

7036
02:39:58,790 --> 02:39:58,800
I'm afraid. Um moves become dependent on
 

7037
02:39:58,800 --> 02:40:01,510
I'm afraid. Um moves become dependent on
setups. setups they become dependent on

7038
02:40:01,510 --> 02:40:01,520
setups. setups they become dependent on
 

7039
02:40:01,520 --> 02:40:03,510
setups. setups they become dependent on
what's happened on the previous day,

7040
02:40:03,510 --> 02:40:03,520
what's happened on the previous day,
 

7041
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:06,309
what's happened on the previous day,
previous week, current week, previous

7042
02:40:06,309 --> 02:40:06,319
previous week, current week, previous
 

7043
02:40:06,319 --> 02:40:08,710

session, right? So, we we cannot

7044
02:40:08,710 --> 02:40:08,720
session, right? So, we we cannot
 

7045
02:40:08,720 --> 02:40:10,870
session, right? So, we we cannot
guarantee how many moves we're going to

7046
02:40:10,870 --> 02:40:10,880
guarantee how many moves we're going to
 

7047
02:40:10,880 --> 02:40:12,950
guarantee how many moves we're going to
get a day. It it really depends on what

7048
02:40:12,950 --> 02:40:12,960
get a day. It it really depends on what
 

7049
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:14,710
get a day. It it really depends on what
that setup is. Is there a catalyst? Is

7050
02:40:14,710 --> 02:40:14,720
that setup is. Is there a catalyst? Is
 

7051
02:40:14,720 --> 02:40:17,190
that setup is. Is there a catalyst? Is
the market moving? Is there someone

7052
02:40:17,190 --> 02:40:17,200
the market moving? Is there someone
 

7053
02:40:17,200 --> 02:40:19,030
the market moving? Is there someone
trapped in the market? I would love to

7054
02:40:19,030 --> 02:40:19,040
trapped in the market? I would love to
 

7055
02:40:19,040 --> 02:40:20,550
trapped in the market? I would love to
say to you, oh, I'm going to get three

7056
02:40:20,550 --> 02:40:20,560
say to you, oh, I'm going to get three
 

7057
02:40:20,560 --> 02:40:22,790
say to you, oh, I'm going to get three
set setups a day. Usually, the market

7058
02:40:22,790 --> 02:40:22,800
set setups a day. Usually, the market
 

7059
02:40:22,800 --> 02:40:25,030
set setups a day. Usually, the market
offers at least something, but it

7060
02:40:25,030 --> 02:40:25,040
offers at least something, but it
 

7061
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:27,110
offers at least something, but it
doesn't have to. And if you become rigid

7062
02:40:27,110 --> 02:40:27,120
doesn't have to. And if you become rigid
 

7063
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:29,429
doesn't have to. And if you become rigid
on that, that's another reason why lots

7064
02:40:29,429 --> 02:40:29,439
on that, that's another reason why lots
 

7065
02:40:29,439 --> 02:40:31,110
on that, that's another reason why lots
of traders fail. All right? They become

7066
02:40:31,110 --> 02:40:31,120
of traders fail. All right? They become
 

7067
02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:34,469
of traders fail. All right? They become
rigid on it and think that we have to do

7068
02:40:34,469 --> 02:40:34,479
rigid on it and think that we have to do
 

7069
02:40:34,479 --> 02:40:36,230
rigid on it and think that we have to do
something. We have to do something each

7070
02:40:36,230 --> 02:40:36,240
something. We have to do something each
 

7071
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:37,190
something. We have to do something each
day. I'm just going to take you to the

7072
02:40:37,190 --> 02:40:37,200
day. I'm just going to take you to the
 

7073
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:38,469
day. I'm just going to take you to the
higher time frame just so you can see

7074
02:40:38,469 --> 02:40:38,479
higher time frame just so you can see
 

7075
02:40:38,479 --> 02:40:40,070
higher time frame just so you can see
what we're doing now. You can see this

7076
02:40:40,070 --> 02:40:40,080
what we're doing now. You can see this
 

7077
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:42,710
what we're doing now. You can see this
hourly has rebalanced the last hour.

7078
02:40:42,710 --> 02:40:42,720
hourly has rebalanced the last hour.
 

7079
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:45,590
hourly has rebalanced the last hour.
We're coming into what's this right?

This red box, you can see we keep

7084
02:40:49,910 --> 02:40:49,920
This red box, you can see we keep
 

7085
02:40:49,920 --> 02:40:52,550
This red box, you can see we keep
getting stuck up here, folks. Like we

7086
02:40:52,550 --> 02:40:52,560
getting stuck up here, folks. Like we
 

7087
02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:54,790
getting stuck up here, folks. Like we
have not lifted into these 90s yet. So,

7088
02:40:54,790 --> 02:40:54,800
have not lifted into these 90s yet. So,
 

7089
02:40:54,800 --> 02:40:57,590
have not lifted into these 90s yet. So,
we've rebalanced. So, just be careful

7090
02:40:57,590 --> 02:40:57,600
we've rebalanced. So, just be careful
 

7091
02:40:57,600 --> 02:41:00,389
we've rebalanced. So, just be careful
here. Please be careful. Right. We will

7092
02:41:00,389 --> 02:41:00,399
here. Please be careful. Right. We will
 

7093
02:41:00,399 --> 02:41:02,630
here. Please be careful. Right. We will
have to flip this to do this move here.

7094
02:41:02,630 --> 02:41:02,640
have to flip this to do this move here.

We haven't got above the lower time
 

7097
02:41:04,399 --> 02:41:05,990
We haven't got above the lower time
frame yet enough to do it. That would

7098
02:41:05,990 --> 02:41:06,000
frame yet enough to do it. That would
 

7099
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,630
frame yet enough to do it. That would
mean doing something like this to do

7100
02:41:08,630 --> 02:41:08,640
mean doing something like this to do
 

7101
02:41:08,640 --> 02:41:10,710

give back this whole thing is what I'm

7202
02:43:05,510 --> 02:43:05,520
give back this whole thing is what I'm
 

7203
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:07,110
give back this whole thing is what I'm
saying. Make sure you've taken some

7204
02:43:07,110 --> 02:43:07,120
saying. Make sure you've taken some
 

7205
02:43:07,120 --> 02:43:09,190
saying. Make sure you've taken some
profits. You are looking for this move,

7206
02:43:09,190 --> 02:43:09,200
profits. You are looking for this move,
 

7207
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:10,469
profits. You are looking for this move,
right? That's what you're looking for.

7208
02:43:10,469 --> 02:43:10,479
right? That's what you're looking for.
 

7209
02:43:10,479 --> 02:43:11,830
right? That's what you're looking for.
You're looking for this move, but you're

7210
02:43:11,830 --> 02:43:11,840
You're looking for this move, but you're
 

7211
02:43:11,840 --> 02:43:13,990
You're looking for this move, but you're
along from here, right? You do not want

7212
02:43:13,990 --> 02:43:14,000
along from here, right? You do not want
 

7213
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:15,670
along from here, right? You do not want
to let this happen. It can happen into

7214
02:43:15,670 --> 02:43:15,680
to let this happen. It can happen into
 

7215
02:43:15,680 --> 02:43:16,950
to let this happen. It can happen into
lunch. They can absolutely come and

7216
02:43:16,950 --> 02:43:16,960
lunch. They can absolutely come and
 

7217
02:43:16,960 --> 02:43:18,389
lunch. They can absolutely come and
swipe this and then come back for this

7218
02:43:18,389 --> 02:43:18,399
swipe this and then come back for this
 

7219
02:43:18,399 --> 02:43:20,550
swipe this and then come back for this
later. So, all I'm would say is if

7220
02:43:20,550 --> 02:43:20,560
later. So, all I'm would say is if
 

7221
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:22,550
later. So, all I'm would say is if
you're positioned at 60 or 80s, you look

7222
02:43:22,550 --> 02:43:22,560
you're positioned at 60 or 80s, you look
 

7223
02:43:22,560 --> 02:43:25,110
you're positioned at 60 or 80s, you look
good, but I would not be letting this

7224
02:43:25,110 --> 02:43:25,120
good, but I would not be letting this
 

7225
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:26,710
good, but I would not be letting this
break down underneath and coming giving

7226
02:43:26,710 --> 02:43:26,720
break down underneath and coming giving
 

7227
02:43:26,720 --> 02:43:27,990
break down underneath and coming giving
all this back. All right? You'd be very

7228
02:43:27,990 --> 02:43:28,000
all this back. All right? You'd be very
 

7229
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,389
all this back. All right? You'd be very
upset if you have not locked in here and

7230
02:43:30,389 --> 02:43:30,399
upset if you have not locked in here and
 

7231
02:43:30,399 --> 02:43:31,990
upset if you have not locked in here and
it comes back down to here into

7232
02:43:31,990 --> 02:43:32,000
it comes back down to here into
 

7233
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,230
it comes back down to here into
lunchtime.

7234
02:43:34,230 --> 02:43:34,240
lunchtime.
 

7235
02:43:34,240 --> 02:43:35,990
lunchtime.
Don't let that do it. It's very possible

7236
02:43:35,990 --> 02:43:36,000
Don't let that do it. It's very possible
 

7237
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:37,349
Don't let that do it. It's very possible
to do it, especially how it's built that

7238
02:43:37,349 --> 02:43:37,359
to do it, especially how it's built that
 

7239
02:43:37,359 --> 02:43:38,870
to do it, especially how it's built that
liquidity right now. Very, very

7240
02:43:38,870 --> 02:43:38,880
liquidity right now. Very, very
 

7241
02:43:38,880 --> 02:43:40,950
liquidity right now. Very, very
possible. We haven't really run anyone

7242
02:43:40,950 --> 02:43:40,960
possible. We haven't really run anyone
 

7243
02:43:40,960 --> 02:43:42,469
possible. We haven't really run anyone
out. If they want to do this, they

7244
02:43:42,469 --> 02:43:42,479
out. If they want to do this, they
 

7245
02:43:42,479 --> 02:43:45,510
out. If they want to do this, they
absolutely will do that.

7246
02:43:45,510 --> 02:43:45,520
absolutely will do that.
 

7247
02:43:45,520 --> 02:43:49,269
absolutely will do that.
Okay.

7248
02:43:49,269 --> 02:43:49,279

 

7249
02:43:49,279 --> 02:43:50,950

Out of the long, JJ, nice work. Well,

7250
02:43:50,950 --> 02:43:50,960
Out of the long, JJ, nice work. Well,
 

7251
02:43:50,960 --> 02:43:53,510
Out of the long, JJ, nice work. Well,
it's a it was a great long. So, now you

7252
02:43:53,510 --> 02:43:53,520
it's a it was a great long. So, now you
 

7253
02:43:53,520 --> 02:43:57,750
it's a it was a great long. So, now you
probably got almost 150 points.

7254
02:43:57,750 --> 02:43:57,760
probably got almost 150 points.
 

7255
02:43:57,760 --> 02:44:00,150
probably got almost 150 points.
Great. Like, who's moaning about 150

7256
02:44:00,150 --> 02:44:00,160
Great. Like, who's moaning about 150
 

7257
02:44:00,160 --> 02:44:01,830
Great. Like, who's moaning about 150
points? There's YouTube is giving you

7258
02:44:01,830 --> 02:44:01,840
points? There's YouTube is giving you
 

7259
02:44:01,840 --> 02:44:02,950
points? There's YouTube is giving you
five point trades out there

7260
02:44:02,950 --> 02:44:02,960
five point trades out there
 

7261
02:44:02,960 --> 02:44:08,469
five point trades out there
consistently.

7262
02:44:08,469 --> 02:44:08,479

 

7263
02:44:08,479 --> 02:44:10,870

I trade mean reversions. No, definitely

7264
02:44:10,870 --> 02:44:10,880
I trade mean reversions. No, definitely
 

7265
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:13,349
I trade mean reversions. No, definitely
not. Only if it's a failed breakout

7266
02:44:13,349 --> 02:44:13,359
not. Only if it's a failed breakout
 

7267
02:44:13,359 --> 02:44:14,950
not. Only if it's a failed breakout
would it be a mean reversion. If it was

7268
02:44:14,950 --> 02:44:14,960
would it be a mean reversion. If it was
 

7269
02:44:14,960 --> 02:44:17,110
would it be a mean reversion. If it was
a continuation trade leaving balance,

7270
02:44:17,110 --> 02:44:17,120
a continuation trade leaving balance,
 

7271
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:18,230
a continuation trade leaving balance,
that doesn't necessarily mean it's a

7272
02:44:18,230 --> 02:44:18,240
that doesn't necessarily mean it's a
 

7273
02:44:18,240 --> 02:44:20,309
that doesn't necessarily mean it's a
mean reversion. If we've got balance

7274
02:44:20,309 --> 02:44:20,319
mean reversion. If we've got balance
 

7275
02:44:20,319 --> 02:44:22,309
mean reversion. If we've got balance
trapped, like weekly balance like we had

7276
02:44:22,309 --> 02:44:22,319
trapped, like weekly balance like we had
 

7277
02:44:22,319 --> 02:44:24,870
trapped, like weekly balance like we had
like four weeks balance trapped and we

7278
02:44:24,870 --> 02:44:24,880
like four weeks balance trapped and we
 

7279
02:44:24,880 --> 02:44:26,790
like four weeks balance trapped and we
break out upside and hold above, it's

7280
02:44:26,790 --> 02:44:26,800
break out upside and hold above, it's
 

7281
02:44:26,800 --> 02:44:27,990
break out upside and hold above, it's
not going to be a mean reversion. It's

7282
02:44:27,990 --> 02:44:28,000
not going to be a mean reversion. It's
 

7283
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,750
not going to be a mean reversion. It's
going to be expansion. Right? It only

7284
02:44:29,750 --> 02:44:29,760
going to be expansion. Right? It only
 

7285
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:32,070
going to be expansion. Right? It only
time is a mean reversion is like today

7286
02:44:32,070 --> 02:44:32,080
time is a mean reversion is like today
 

7287
02:44:32,080 --> 02:44:34,150
time is a mean reversion is like today
when we go above balance, we create

7288
02:44:34,150 --> 02:44:34,160
when we go above balance, we create
 

7289
02:44:34,160 --> 02:44:36,389
when we go above balance, we create
balance, we fail, we get stuck at the

balance, we fail, we get stuck at the
 

7291
02:44:36,399 --> 02:44:39,269
balance, we fail, we get stuck at the
top bowls, then yes, mean reversion.

7292
02:44:39,269 --> 02:44:39,279

7296
02:44:44,309 --> 02:44:44,319
or a fail breakout. It's a use of
 

7297
02:44:44,319 --> 02:44:46,790
or a fail breakout. It's a use of
liquidity.

7388
02:46:23,910 --> 02:46:23,920
private, but it's everyone in stream.
 

7389
02:46:23,920 --> 02:46:25,510
private, but it's everyone in stream.
You get my swing investments. So

7390
02:46:25,510 --> 02:46:25,520
You get my swing investments. So
 

7391
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:27,349
You get my swing investments. So
everything that I'm looking at on the

7392
02:46:27,349 --> 02:46:27,359
everything that I'm looking at on the
 

7393
02:46:27,359 --> 02:46:29,190
everything that I'm looking at on the
swings, what levels I'm looking to get

7394
02:46:29,190 --> 02:46:29,200
swings, what levels I'm looking to get
 

7395
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:31,830
swings, what levels I'm looking to get
uh entries on, what I'm looking for. Um

7396
02:46:31,830 --> 02:46:31,840
uh entries on, what I'm looking for. Um
 

7397
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:34,070
uh entries on, what I'm looking for. Um
we did very very well last year on the

7398
02:46:34,070 --> 02:46:34,080
we did very very well last year on the
 

7399
02:46:34,080 --> 02:46:36,389
we did very very well last year on the
swings. And then you get Coupe does a

7400
02:46:36,389 --> 02:46:36,399
swings. And then you get Coupe does a
 

7401
02:46:36,399 --> 02:46:38,710
swings. And then you get Coupe does a
twoe call every two weeks with everyone

7402
02:46:38,710 --> 02:46:38,720
twoe call every two weeks with everyone
 

7403
02:46:38,720 --> 02:46:40,870
twoe call every two weeks with everyone
trading that way. And then you get um

7404
02:46:40,870 --> 02:46:40,880
trading that way. And then you get um
 

7405
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:42,550
trading that way. And then you get um
lots of discounts which we don't do on

7406
02:46:42,550 --> 02:46:42,560
lots of discounts which we don't do on
 

7407
02:46:42,560 --> 02:46:44,309
lots of discounts which we don't do on
here and giveaways as well and a ton of

7408
02:46:44,309 --> 02:46:44,319
here and giveaways as well and a ton of
 

7409
02:46:44,319 --> 02:46:47,190
here and giveaways as well and a ton of
other stuff, right? But it does it's it

7410
02:46:47,190 --> 02:46:47,200
other stuff, right? But it does it's it
 

7411
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:49,030
other stuff, right? But it does it's it
comes for free when you do the 20our

7412
02:46:49,030 --> 02:46:49,040
comes for free when you do the 20our
 

7413
02:46:49,040 --> 02:46:51,349
comes for free when you do the 20our
course. There's no monthly sub on it,

7414
02:46:51,349 --> 02:46:51,359
course. There's no monthly sub on it,
 

7415
02:46:51,359 --> 02:46:56,630
course. There's no monthly sub on it,
right? No monthly sub on that.

7416
02:46:56,630 --> 02:46:56,640

 

7417
02:46:56,640 --> 02:46:59,030

Trump speaking. Is he really? Well,

7418
02:46:59,030 --> 02:46:59,040
Trump speaking. Is he really? Well,
 

7419
02:46:59,040 --> 02:47:00,710
Trump speaking. Is he really? Well,
that's good to know. I mean, I'm out and

7420
02:47:00,710 --> 02:47:00,720
that's good to know. I mean, I'm out and
 

7421
02:47:00,720 --> 02:47:02,389
that's good to know. I mean, I'm out and
we're done now anyway. Coming into

7422
02:47:02,389 --> 02:47:02,399
we're done now anyway. Coming into
 

7423
02:47:02,399 --> 02:47:13,429
we're done now anyway. Coming into
lunch.

7424
02:47:13,429 --> 02:47:13,439

 

7425
02:47:13,439 --> 02:47:15,190

The hard thing to realize that one big

7426
02:47:15,190 --> 02:47:15,200
The hard thing to realize that one big
 

7427
02:47:15,200 --> 02:47:16,790
The hard thing to realize that one big
runner basically guarantees your

7428
02:47:16,790 --> 02:47:16,800
runner basically guarantees your
 

7429
02:47:16,800 --> 02:47:19,349
runner basically guarantees your
profitability as long as you keep risk

7430
02:47:19,349 --> 02:47:19,359
profitability as long as you keep risk
 

7431
02:47:19,359 --> 02:47:21,110
profitability as long as you keep risk
in check unless you get really unlucky.

7432
02:47:21,110 --> 02:47:21,120
in check unless you get really unlucky.
 

7433
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:23,429
in check unless you get really unlucky.
Yeah. I mean, look, if you took this

7434
02:47:23,429 --> 02:47:23,439
Yeah. I mean, look, if you took this
 

7435
02:47:23,439 --> 02:47:26,950
Yeah. I mean, look, if you took this
here, any of these longs here, 1680,

7436
02:47:26,950 --> 02:47:26,960
here, any of these longs here, 1680,
 

7437
02:47:26,960 --> 02:47:29,590
here, any of these longs here, 1680,
right, and you got TP1, TP2, and you've

7438
02:47:29,590 --> 02:47:29,600
right, and you got TP1, TP2, and you've
 

7439
02:47:29,600 --> 02:47:32,150
right, and you got TP1, TP2, and you've
locked in like 80%.

7440
02:47:32,150 --> 02:47:32,160
locked in like 80%.
 

7441
02:47:32,160 --> 02:47:33,429
locked in like 80%.
All right, and even if you've just got

7442
02:47:33,429 --> 02:47:33,439
All right, and even if you've just got
 

7443
02:47:33,439 --> 02:47:36,469
All right, and even if you've just got
one left, right, that one left can do

7444
02:47:36,469 --> 02:47:36,479
one left, right, that one left can do
 

7445
02:47:36,479 --> 02:47:39,349
one left, right, that one left can do
another 100 plus points,

7446
02:47:39,349 --> 02:47:39,359
another 100 plus points,
 

7447
02:47:39,359 --> 02:47:41,590
another 100 plus points,
right? If that's a micro, it's another

7448
02:47:41,590 --> 02:47:41,600
right? If that's a micro, it's another
 

7449
02:47:41,600 --> 02:47:43,670
right? If that's a micro, it's another
$200. If that's a mini, that's another

7450
02:47:43,670 --> 02:47:43,680
$200. If that's a mini, that's another
 

7451
02:47:43,680 --> 02:47:46,790
$200. If that's a mini, that's another
$2,000 per account, right? On the

7452
02:47:46,790 --> 02:47:46,800
$2,000 per account, right? On the
 

7453
02:47:46,800 --> 02:47:48,550
$2,000 per account, right? On the
runner, and you've protected profits

7454
02:47:48,550 --> 02:47:48,560
runner, and you've protected profits
 

7455
02:47:48,560 --> 02:47:50,070
runner, and you've protected profits
anyway, and you can move your stop up,

7456
02:47:50,070 --> 02:47:50,080
anyway, and you can move your stop up,
 

7457
02:47:50,080 --> 02:47:51,830
anyway, and you can move your stop up,
right? So that's why trading in good

7458
02:47:51,830 --> 02:47:51,840
right? So that's why trading in good
 

7459
02:47:51,840 --> 02:47:54,230
right? So that's why trading in good
locations is key. It's why I'm like once

7460
02:47:54,230 --> 02:47:54,240
locations is key. It's why I'm like once
 

7461
02:47:54,240 --> 02:47:57,429
locations is key. It's why I'm like once
I lose location, I'm so less interested

7462
02:47:57,429 --> 02:47:57,439
I lose location, I'm so less interested
 

7463
02:47:57,439 --> 02:47:59,830
I lose location, I'm so less interested
in trading because I want to minimize my

7464
02:47:59,830 --> 02:47:59,840
in trading because I want to minimize my
 

7465
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:02,230
in trading because I want to minimize my
risk. Lock in. Then I'm playing with

7466
02:48:02,230 --> 02:48:02,240
risk. Lock in. Then I'm playing with
 

7467
02:48:02,240 --> 02:48:03,830
risk. Lock in. Then I'm playing with
house money. All right. If my risk is

7468
02:48:03,830 --> 02:48:03,840
house money. All right. If my risk is
 

7469
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:05,510
house money. All right. If my risk is
here and I lock in and I move my stop

7470
02:48:05,510 --> 02:48:05,520
here and I lock in and I move my stop
 

7471
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:06,550
here and I lock in and I move my stop
up. All right. Now I'm playing with

7472
02:48:06,550 --> 02:48:06,560
up. All right. Now I'm playing with
 

7473
02:48:06,560 --> 02:48:09,429
up. All right. Now I'm playing with
house money. If that goes, it goes. Bit

7474
02:48:09,429 --> 02:48:09,439
house money. If that goes, it goes. Bit
 

7475
02:48:09,439 --> 02:48:10,710
house money. If that goes, it goes. Bit
like the one this morning. So you can

7476
02:48:10,710 --> 02:48:10,720
like the one this morning. So you can
 

7477
02:48:10,720 --> 02:48:12,950
like the one this morning. So you can
see where I fluffed my lines on the

7478
02:48:12,950 --> 02:48:12,960
see where I fluffed my lines on the
 

7479
02:48:12,960 --> 02:48:14,389
see where I fluffed my lines on the
second trade this morning is because I'd

7480
02:48:14,389 --> 02:48:14,399
second trade this morning is because I'd
 

7481
02:48:14,399 --> 02:48:16,309
second trade this morning is because I'd
lost position. So that was first trade

7482
02:48:16,309 --> 02:48:16,319
lost position. So that was first trade
 

7483
02:48:16,319 --> 02:48:18,389
lost position. So that was first trade
this morning all the way down. Second

7484
02:48:18,389 --> 02:48:18,399
this morning all the way down. Second
 

7485
02:48:18,399 --> 02:48:20,230
this morning all the way down. Second
trade was the bounce short. So that was

7486
02:48:20,230 --> 02:48:20,240
trade was the bounce short. So that was
 

7487
02:48:20,240 --> 02:48:21,830
trade was the bounce short. So that was
the first bounce since the drop. So if

7488
02:48:21,830 --> 02:48:21,840
the first bounce since the drop. So if
 

7489
02:48:21,840 --> 02:48:23,830
the first bounce since the drop. So if
we think about how this looked, what

7490
02:48:23,830 --> 02:48:23,840
we think about how this looked, what
 

7491
02:48:23,840 --> 02:48:25,030
we think about how this looked, what
what we were talking about, you can

7492
02:48:25,030 --> 02:48:25,040
what we were talking about, you can
 

7493
02:48:25,040 --> 02:48:27,269
what we were talking about, you can
rewind the tape. Here's the fade. We're

7494
02:48:27,269 --> 02:48:27,279
rewind the tape. Here's the fade. We're
 

7495
02:48:27,279 --> 02:48:28,790
rewind the tape. Here's the fade. We're
looking to fade this. I wanted it up

7496
02:48:28,790 --> 02:48:28,800
looking to fade this. I wanted it up
 

7497
02:48:28,800 --> 02:48:30,309
looking to fade this. I wanted it up
here. Ideally, they trapped themselves

7498
02:48:30,309 --> 02:48:30,319
here. Ideally, they trapped themselves
 

7499
02:48:30,319 --> 02:48:32,230
here. Ideally, they trapped themselves
in here. So I play that short. If they

7500
02:48:32,230 --> 02:48:32,240
in here. So I play that short. If they
 

7501
02:48:32,240 --> 02:48:34,790
in here. So I play that short. If they
get caught here, I cover. I cover too

7502
02:48:34,790 --> 02:48:34,800
get caught here, I cover. I cover too
 

7503
02:48:34,800 --> 02:48:36,710
get caught here, I cover. I cover too
early. There's the continuation. That's

7504
02:48:36,710 --> 02:48:36,720
early. There's the continuation. That's
 

7505
02:48:36,720 --> 02:48:38,469
early. There's the continuation. That's
my fault. All right, that's my fault.

7506
02:48:38,469 --> 02:48:38,479
my fault. All right, that's my fault.
 

7507
02:48:38,479 --> 02:48:39,830
my fault. All right, that's my fault.
Bounce short. Should have held for

7508
02:48:39,830 --> 02:48:39,840
Bounce short. Should have held for
 

7509
02:48:39,840 --> 02:48:41,750
Bounce short. Should have held for
continuation. But this was a big demand

7510
02:48:41,750 --> 02:48:41,760
continuation. But this was a big demand
 

7511
02:48:41,760 --> 02:48:43,590
continuation. But this was a big demand
level, remember, at the time. So I was

7512
02:48:43,590 --> 02:48:43,600
level, remember, at the time. So I was
 

7513
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:45,429
level, remember, at the time. So I was
very, very proactive. But the reason I'm

7514
02:48:45,429 --> 02:48:45,439
very, very proactive. But the reason I'm
 

7515
02:48:45,439 --> 02:48:48,070
very, very proactive. But the reason I'm
more proactive on that than I am here is

7516
02:48:48,070 --> 02:48:48,080
more proactive on that than I am here is
 

7517
02:48:48,080 --> 02:48:49,750
more proactive on that than I am here is
because I understand we now have

7518
02:48:49,750 --> 02:48:49,760
because I understand we now have
 

7519
02:48:49,760 --> 02:48:51,750
because I understand we now have
structure. This can hold and do this if

7520
02:48:51,750 --> 02:48:51,760
structure. This can hold and do this if
 

7521
02:48:51,760 --> 02:48:53,670
structure. This can hold and do this if
it wants. All right. So, I've lost

7522
02:48:53,670 --> 02:48:53,680
it wants. All right. So, I've lost
 

7523
02:48:53,680 --> 02:48:56,630
it wants. All right. So, I've lost
positioning. What I should have done was

7524
02:48:56,630 --> 02:48:56,640
positioning. What I should have done was
 

7525
02:48:56,640 --> 02:48:58,870
positioning. What I should have done was
held some, added on, and left my core up

7526
02:48:58,870 --> 02:48:58,880
held some, added on, and left my core up
 

7527
02:48:58,880 --> 02:49:00,070
held some, added on, and left my core up
here. And then I could have sat through

7528
02:49:00,070 --> 02:49:00,080
here. And then I could have sat through
 

7529
02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:01,670
here. And then I could have sat through
that. And that's my fault. That needs a

7530
02:49:01,670 --> 02:49:01,680
that. And that's my fault. That needs a
 

7531
02:49:01,680 --> 02:49:04,469
that. And that's my fault. That needs a
review. That's where I'm can still

7532
02:49:04,469 --> 02:49:04,479
review. That's where I'm can still
 

7533
02:49:04,479 --> 02:49:07,349
review. That's where I'm can still
improve. Can still improve. But it's

7534
02:49:07,349 --> 02:49:07,359
improve. Can still improve. But it's
 

7535
02:49:07,359 --> 02:49:09,269
improve. Can still improve. But it's
hard when you've made 250 points on a

7536
02:49:09,269 --> 02:49:09,279
hard when you've made 250 points on a
 

7537
02:49:09,279 --> 02:49:10,550
hard when you've made 250 points on a

Where am I getting orderflow data from?
 

7613
02:50:35,920 --> 02:50:37,990
Where am I getting orderflow data from?
Well, all data is from CME. It's

7614
02:50:37,990 --> 02:50:38,000
Well, all data is from CME. It's
 

7615
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,070
Well, all data is from CME. It's
centralized exchange. But if you mean

7616
02:50:40,070 --> 02:50:40,080
centralized exchange. But if you mean
 

7617
02:50:40,080 --> 02:50:41,510
centralized exchange. But if you mean
footprints, I have footprint on my

TP2 would mean taking a partial, right?

7626
02:51:05,910 --> 02:51:05,920
TP2 would mean taking a partial, right?
 

7627
02:51:05,920 --> 02:51:08,070
TP2 would mean taking a partial, right?
So the way I would do it is that I I

7628
02:51:08,070 --> 02:51:08,080
So the way I would do it is that I I
 

7629
02:51:08,080 --> 02:51:09,910
So the way I would do it is that I I
have multiple contracts. The best way to

7630
02:51:09,910 --> 02:51:09,920
have multiple contracts. The best way to
 

7631
02:51:09,920 --> 02:51:11,349
have multiple contracts. The best way to
do that to start with is micros. So

7632
02:51:11,349 --> 02:51:11,359
do that to start with is micros. So
 

7633
02:51:11,359 --> 02:51:13,750
do that to start with is micros. So
let's say you enter

7634
02:51:13,750 --> 02:51:13,760
let's say you enter
 

7635
02:51:13,760 --> 02:51:17,269
let's say you enter
let's say you're on a 50k account and

7636
02:51:17,269 --> 02:51:17,279
let's say you're on a 50k account and
 

7637
02:51:17,279 --> 02:51:18,630
let's say you're on a 50k account and
can I draw this? There we go. And you

7638
02:51:18,630 --> 02:51:18,640
can I draw this? There we go. And you
 

7639
02:51:18,640 --> 02:51:21,269
can I draw this? There we go. And you
enter three micros long here, right? So

7640
02:51:21,269 --> 02:51:21,279
enter three micros long here, right? So
 

7641
02:51:21,279 --> 02:51:24,389
enter three micros long here, right? So
you take one off there. You take one off

7642
02:51:24,389 --> 02:51:24,399
you take one off there. You take one off
 

7643
02:51:24,399 --> 02:51:25,990
you take one off there. You take one off
there. All right? And now you're holding

7644
02:51:25,990 --> 02:51:26,000
there. All right? And now you're holding
 

7645
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:30,070
there. All right? And now you're holding
one for up here. Right? So you've locked

7646
02:51:30,070 --> 02:51:30,080
one for up here. Right? So you've locked
 

7647
02:51:30,080 --> 02:51:31,590
one for up here. Right? So you've locked
in profit. No matter what, you're going

7653
02:51:34,800 --> 02:51:44,469

Nice. Looking forward to working with
you

7660
02:51:49,190 --> 02:51:49,200
you
 

7661
02:51:49,200 --> 02:51:51,510
you
before that long took off. How do you

7662
02:51:51,510 --> 02:51:51,520
before that long took off. How do you
 

7663
02:51:51,520 --> 02:51:53,269
before that long took off. How do you
judge how long you need to wait while

7664
02:51:53,269 --> 02:51:53,279
judge how long you need to wait while
 

7665
02:51:53,279 --> 02:51:56,309
judge how long you need to wait while
the liquidity builds? Um, this long

7666
02:51:56,309 --> 02:51:56,319
the liquidity builds? Um, this long
 

7667
02:51:56,319 --> 02:51:58,630
the liquidity builds? Um, this long
here. Well, you can see I I had an

7668
02:51:58,630 --> 02:51:58,640
here. Well, you can see I I had an
 

7669
02:51:58,640 --> 02:52:00,469
here. Well, you can see I I had an
attempt straight away. I saw he was

7670
02:52:00,469 --> 02:52:00,479
attempt straight away. I saw he was
 

7671
02:52:00,479 --> 02:52:03,190
attempt straight away. I saw he was
trapped at 60 straight away. All right.

7672
02:52:03,190 --> 02:52:03,200
trapped at 60 straight away. All right.
 

7673
02:52:03,200 --> 02:52:05,349
trapped at 60 straight away. All right.
So, I did not wait long once I saw him

7674
02:52:05,349 --> 02:52:05,359
So, I did not wait long once I saw him
 

7675
02:52:05,359 --> 02:52:06,950
So, I did not wait long once I saw him
trapped and we got the relief instantly

7676
02:52:06,950 --> 02:52:06,960
trapped and we got the relief instantly
 

7677
02:52:06,960 --> 02:52:09,750
trapped and we got the relief instantly
and then I stopped out. I think I might

7678
02:52:09,750 --> 02:52:09,760
and then I stopped out. I think I might
 

7679
02:52:09,760 --> 02:52:11,110
and then I stopped out. I think I might
have had another go in here and stopped

7680
02:52:11,110 --> 02:52:11,120
have had another go in here and stopped
 

7681
02:52:11,120 --> 02:52:12,230
have had another go in here and stopped
out. I can't remember. I'll have to

7682
02:52:12,230 --> 02:52:12,240
out. I can't remember. I'll have to
 

7683
02:52:12,240 --> 02:52:14,870
out. I can't remember. I'll have to
review it. Um,

7684
02:52:14,870 --> 02:52:14,880
review it. Um,
 

7685
02:52:14,880 --> 02:52:17,030
review it. Um,
but

7686
02:52:17,030 --> 02:52:17,040
but
 

7687
02:52:17,040 --> 02:52:19,910
but
once we fail to break lower, you need to

7688
02:52:19,910 --> 02:52:19,920
once we fail to break lower, you need to
 

7689
02:52:19,920 --> 02:52:22,710
once we fail to break lower, you need to
understand this.

7690
02:52:22,710 --> 02:52:22,720
understand this.
 

7691
02:52:22,720 --> 02:52:25,830
understand this.

02:52:25,830 --> 02:52:25,840
Once sellers
 

7693
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:27,590
Once sellers
fail to break us lower, think about if

7694
02:52:27,590 --> 02:52:27,600
fail to break us lower, think about if
 

7695
02:52:27,600 --> 02:52:30,550
fail to break us lower, think about if
you're selling here, right, versus this,

7696
02:52:30,550 --> 02:52:30,560
you're selling here, right, versus this,
 

7697
02:52:30,560 --> 02:52:33,269
you're selling here, right, versus this,
what's your target? It's this, right? We

7698
02:52:33,269 --> 02:52:33,279
what's your target? It's this, right? We
 

7699
02:52:33,279 --> 02:52:35,269
what's your target? It's this, right? We
think about structure, right? If you're

7700
02:52:35,269 --> 02:52:35,279
think about structure, right? If you're
 

7701
02:52:35,279 --> 02:52:37,590
think about structure, right? If you're
the structure is this, right? The

7702
02:52:37,590 --> 02:52:37,600
the structure is this, right? The
 

7703
02:52:37,600 --> 02:52:40,230
the structure is this, right? The
expectation is this here. That's your

7704
02:52:40,230 --> 02:52:40,240
expectation is this here. That's your
 

7705
02:52:40,240 --> 02:52:41,830
expectation is this here. That's your
TP1. If you're smart, if you're a

7706
02:52:41,830 --> 02:52:41,840
TP1. If you're smart, if you're a
 

7707
02:52:41,840 --> 02:52:44,070
TP1. If you're smart, if you're a
pullback trader, that's your TP1. If

7708
02:52:44,070 --> 02:52:44,080
pullback trader, that's your TP1. If
 

7709
02:52:44,080 --> 02:52:45,269
pullback trader, that's your TP1. If
you're a breakout trader, you're

7710
02:52:45,269 --> 02:52:45,279
you're a breakout trader, you're
 

7711
02:52:45,279 --> 02:52:46,870
you're a breakout trader, you're
shorting the lows. We don't short the

7712
02:52:46,870 --> 02:52:46,880
shorting the lows. We don't short the
 

7713
02:52:46,880 --> 02:52:50,230
shorting the lows. We don't short the
lows, right? So, once they fail to go

7714
02:52:50,230 --> 02:52:50,240
lows, right? So, once they fail to go
 

7715
02:52:50,240 --> 02:52:52,230
lows, right? So, once they fail to go
lower, what does that mean? Well, no one

7716
02:52:52,230 --> 02:52:52,240
lower, what does that mean? Well, no one
 

7717
02:52:52,240 --> 02:52:54,469
lower, what does that mean? Well, no one
has got their TP. That's how I see it.

7718
02:52:54,469 --> 02:52:54,479
has got their TP. That's how I see it.
 

7719
02:52:54,479 --> 02:52:56,230
has got their TP. That's how I see it.
Also, by the way, at this point, ES had

7720
02:52:56,230 --> 02:52:56,240
Also, by the way, at this point, ES had
 

7721
02:52:56,240 --> 02:52:59,429
Also, by the way, at this point, ES had
divergence. ES did this. So ES did it

7722
02:52:59,429 --> 02:52:59,439
divergence. ES did this. So ES did it
 

7723
02:52:59,439 --> 02:53:01,269
divergence. ES did this. So ES did it
for you ICT people and you would call

7724
02:53:01,269 --> 02:53:01,279
for you ICT people and you would call
 

7725
02:53:01,279 --> 02:53:03,110
for you ICT people and you would call
that S&T for anyone normal. It's called

7726
02:53:03,110 --> 02:53:03,120
that S&T for anyone normal. It's called
 

7727
02:53:03,120 --> 02:53:06,230
that S&T for anyone normal. It's called
divergence. All right. So and we knew

7728
02:53:06,230 --> 02:53:06,240
divergence. All right. So and we knew
 

7729
02:53:06,240 --> 02:53:08,070
divergence. All right. So and we knew
60s was the level where we had them

7730
02:53:08,070 --> 02:53:08,080
60s was the level where we had them
 

7731
02:53:08,080 --> 02:53:09,910
60s was the level where we had them
trapped. 60s was the level where he was

7732
02:53:09,910 --> 02:53:09,920
trapped. 60s was the level where he was
 

7733
02:53:09,920 --> 02:53:12,630
trapped. 60s was the level where he was
trapped here and here and here. 60s was

7734
02:53:12,630 --> 02:53:12,640
trapped here and here and here. 60s was
 

7735
02:53:12,640 --> 02:53:15,670
trapped here and here and here. 60s was
his big order. And we can pull that up

7736
02:53:15,670 --> 02:53:15,680
his big order. And we can pull that up
 

7737
02:53:15,680 --> 02:53:18,389
his big order. And we can pull that up
for you guys.

7738
02:53:18,389 --> 02:53:18,399
for you guys.
 

7739
02:53:18,399 --> 02:53:21,190
for you guys.
Right. 60s right here. You can see this

7740
02:53:21,190 --> 02:53:21,200
Right. 60s right here. You can see this
 

7741
02:53:21,200 --> 02:53:24,070
Right. 60s right here. You can see this
big red outlying delta. Huge seller here

7742
02:53:24,070 --> 02:53:24,080
big red outlying delta. Huge seller here
 

7743
02:53:24,080 --> 02:53:26,469
big red outlying delta. Huge seller here
at 60. Right. So that was what I was

7744
02:53:26,469 --> 02:53:26,479
at 60. Right. So that was what I was
 

7745
02:53:26,479 --> 02:53:28,070
at 60. Right. So that was what I was
looking at. I knew that was the pain

7746
02:53:28,070 --> 02:53:28,080
looking at. I knew that was the pain
 

7747
02:53:28,080 --> 02:53:32,550
looking at. I knew that was the pain
point. So I used his pain point

7748
02:53:32,550 --> 02:53:32,560
point. So I used his pain point
 

7749
02:53:32,560 --> 02:53:33,990
point. So I used his pain point
here. I used his pain point for the

7750
02:53:33,990 --> 02:53:34,000
here. I used his pain point for the
 

7751
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:35,910
here. I used his pain point for the
relief. And if I was here and didn't go

7752
02:53:35,910 --> 02:53:35,920
relief. And if I was here and didn't go
 

7753
02:53:35,920 --> 02:53:37,269
relief. And if I was here and didn't go
to the toilet, I would have used his

7754
02:53:37,269 --> 02:53:37,279
to the toilet, I would have used his
 

7755
02:53:37,279 --> 02:53:38,950
to the toilet, I would have used his
pain point again. And we said 80s was

7756
02:53:38,950 --> 02:53:38,960
pain point again. And we said 80s was
 

7757
02:53:38,960 --> 02:53:41,110
pain point again. And we said 80s was
the pivot. All right, 80s. We had

7758
02:53:41,110 --> 02:53:41,120
the pivot. All right, 80s. We had
 

7759
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:43,269
the pivot. All right, 80s. We had
imbalance over 80s squeeze happens. And

7760
02:53:43,269 --> 02:53:43,279
imbalance over 80s squeeze happens. And
 

7761
02:53:43,279 --> 02:53:44,790
imbalance over 80s squeeze happens. And
then you go target one. And then you're

7762
02:53:44,790 --> 02:53:44,800
then you go target one. And then you're
 

7763
02:53:44,800 --> 02:53:46,469
then you go target one. And then you're
looking left for the squeeze trigger. So

7764
02:53:46,469 --> 02:53:46,479
looking left for the squeeze trigger. So
 

7765
02:53:46,479 --> 02:53:48,710
looking left for the squeeze trigger. So
if you were short in the hole, where

7766
02:53:48,710 --> 02:53:48,720
if you were short in the hole, where
 

7767
02:53:48,720 --> 02:53:50,150
if you were short in the hole, where
would your stops be? You would have

7768
02:53:50,150 --> 02:53:50,160
would your stops be? You would have
 

7769
02:53:50,160 --> 02:53:52,389
would your stops be? You would have
stops here and here. So guess what

7770
02:53:52,389 --> 02:53:52,399
stops here and here. So guess what
 

7771
02:53:52,399 --> 02:53:54,710
stops here and here. So guess what
happens? We run that over. They become a

7772
02:53:54,710 --> 02:53:54,720
happens? We run that over. They become a
 

7773
02:53:54,720 --> 02:53:56,230
happens? We run that over. They become a
market buyer. Squeeze. They run that

7774
02:53:56,230 --> 02:53:56,240
market buyer. Squeeze. They run that
 

7775
02:53:56,240 --> 02:53:57,670
market buyer. Squeeze. They run that
over. they become a market buyer

7776
02:53:57,670 --> 02:53:57,680
over. they become a market buyer
 

7777
02:53:57,680 --> 02:53:59,830
over. they become a market buyer
squeeze, right? And now you're into TP

7778
02:53:59,830 --> 02:53:59,840
squeeze, right? And now you're into TP
 

7779
02:53:59,840 --> 02:54:01,830
squeeze, right? And now you're into TP
and now it's just how far can you go?

7780
02:54:01,830 --> 02:54:01,840
and now it's just how far can you go?
 

7781
02:54:01,840 --> 02:54:04,150
and now it's just how far can you go?
Can you get the last lot of stops? Where

7782
02:54:04,150 --> 02:54:04,160
Can you get the last lot of stops? Where
 

7783
02:54:04,160 --> 02:54:06,150
Can you get the last lot of stops? Where
are the last lot of stops to aim for?

7784
02:54:06,150 --> 02:54:06,160
are the last lot of stops to aim for?
 

7785
02:54:06,160 --> 02:54:08,870
are the last lot of stops to aim for?
Right here. Think about all these stops,

7786
02:54:08,870 --> 02:54:08,880
Right here. Think about all these stops,
 

7787
02:54:08,880 --> 02:54:10,870
Right here. Think about all these stops,
right? If you were swing short up here,

7788
02:54:10,870 --> 02:54:10,880
right? If you were swing short up here,
 

7789
02:54:10,880 --> 02:54:12,950
right? If you were swing short up here,
where is your stop? It's right here at

7790
02:54:12,950 --> 02:54:12,960
where is your stop? It's right here at
 

7791
02:54:12,960 --> 02:54:15,510
where is your stop? It's right here at
825. So, if we lift up there, that's

7792
02:54:15,510 --> 02:54:15,520
825. So, if we lift up there, that's
 

7793
02:54:15,520 --> 02:54:18,230
825. So, if we lift up there, that's
your last target for your long,

7794
02:54:18,230 --> 02:54:18,240
your last target for your long,
 

7795
02:54:18,240 --> 02:54:20,550
your last target for your long,
right? That's how the market moves. It

7796
02:54:20,550 --> 02:54:20,560
right? That's how the market moves. It
 

7797
02:54:20,560 --> 02:54:22,389
right? That's how the market moves. It
hunts liquidity, then it creates

7798
02:54:22,389 --> 02:54:22,399
hunts liquidity, then it creates
 

7799
02:54:22,399 --> 02:54:23,990
hunts liquidity, then it creates
liquidity when there's no left nothing

7800
02:54:23,990 --> 02:54:24,000
liquidity when there's no left nothing
 

7801
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:25,590
liquidity when there's no left nothing
left to hunt, and then it goes and hunts

7802
02:54:25,590 --> 02:54:25,600
left to hunt, and then it goes and hunts
 

7803
02:54:25,600 --> 02:54:32,389
left to hunt, and then it goes and hunts
the other way. Right? So, it

7804
02:54:32,389 --> 02:54:32,399

 

7805
02:54:32,399 --> 02:54:35,429

it hunts liquidity, it creates

7806
02:54:35,429 --> 02:54:35,439
it hunts liquidity, it creates
 

7807
02:54:35,439 --> 02:54:37,590
it hunts liquidity, it creates
liquidity, then it uses liquidity to

7808
02:54:37,590 --> 02:54:37,600
liquidity, then it uses liquidity to
 

7809
02:54:37,600 --> 02:54:39,429
liquidity, then it uses liquidity to
hunt more liquidity. It creates

7810
02:54:39,429 --> 02:54:39,439
hunt more liquidity. It creates
 

7811
02:54:39,439 --> 02:54:41,670
hunt more liquidity. It creates
liquidity, then it uses this liquidity

7812
02:54:41,670 --> 02:54:41,680
liquidity, then it uses this liquidity
 

7813
02:54:41,680 --> 02:54:43,910
liquidity, then it uses this liquidity
to hunt more liquidity, then it creates

7814
02:54:43,910 --> 02:54:43,920
to hunt more liquidity, then it creates
 

7815
02:54:43,920 --> 02:54:45,990
to hunt more liquidity, then it creates
liquidity, and it's nothing else to

7816
02:54:45,990 --> 02:54:46,000
liquidity, and it's nothing else to
 

7817
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:47,670
liquidity, and it's nothing else to
search for down there. So, it goes the

7818
02:54:47,670 --> 02:54:47,680
search for down there. So, it goes the
 

7819
02:54:47,680 --> 02:54:50,469
search for down there. So, it goes the
other way. It hunts the liquidity. It

7820
02:54:50,469 --> 02:54:50,479
other way. It hunts the liquidity. It
 

7821
02:54:50,479 --> 02:54:52,630
other way. It hunts the liquidity. It
hunts the liquidity and then it will

7822
02:54:52,630 --> 02:54:52,640
hunts the liquidity and then it will
 

7823
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:54,070
hunts the liquidity and then it will
probably create some liquidity and then

7824
02:54:54,070 --> 02:54:54,080
probably create some liquidity and then
 

7825
02:54:54,080 --> 02:54:57,110
probably create some liquidity and then
it might come down into a range. Yeah.

7826
02:54:57,110 --> 02:54:57,120
it might come down into a range. Yeah.
 

7827
02:54:57,120 --> 02:55:00,230
it might come down into a range. Yeah.
What's another way of doing that?

7828
02:55:00,230 --> 02:55:00,240
What's another way of doing that?
 

7829
02:55:00,240 --> 02:55:01,830
What's another way of doing that?
What's another way of doing it? It goes

7830
02:55:01,830 --> 02:55:01,840
What's another way of doing it? It goes
 

7831
02:55:01,840 --> 02:55:05,670
What's another way of doing it? It goes
for looks for it auctions lower. It

7832
02:55:05,670 --> 02:55:05,680
for looks for it auctions lower. It
 

7833
02:55:05,680 --> 02:55:08,070
for looks for it auctions lower. It
finds an area of price acceptance for a

7834
02:55:08,070 --> 02:55:08,080
finds an area of price acceptance for a
 

7835
02:55:08,080 --> 02:55:11,190
finds an area of price acceptance for a
bit. It leaves that and auctions lower.

7836
02:55:11,190 --> 02:55:11,200
bit. It leaves that and auctions lower.
 

7837
02:55:11,200 --> 02:55:13,030
bit. It leaves that and auctions lower.
It finds acceptance. It leaves it at

7838
02:55:13,030 --> 02:55:13,040
It finds acceptance. It leaves it at
 

7839
02:55:13,040 --> 02:55:14,630
It finds acceptance. It leaves it at
auctions lower. It finds acceptance.

7840
02:55:14,630 --> 02:55:14,640
auctions lower. It finds acceptance.
 

7841
02:55:14,640 --> 02:55:16,230
auctions lower. It finds acceptance.
We're now too deep into discount which

7842
02:55:16,230 --> 02:55:16,240
We're now too deep into discount which
 

7843
02:55:16,240 --> 02:55:17,990
We're now too deep into discount which
is why I say don't short the lows. And

7844
02:55:17,990 --> 02:55:18,000
is why I say don't short the lows. And
 

7845
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,230
is why I say don't short the lows. And
now we're going to go back into fair

7846
02:55:20,230 --> 02:55:20,240
now we're going to go back into fair
 

7847
02:55:20,240 --> 02:55:22,230
now we're going to go back into fair
value. Fair value on the day is right

7848
02:55:22,230 --> 02:55:22,240
value. Fair value on the day is right
 

7849
02:55:22,240 --> 02:55:24,790
value. Fair value on the day is right
here. Right point of control. This is

7850
02:55:24,790 --> 02:55:24,800
here. Right point of control. This is
 

7851
02:55:24,800 --> 02:55:26,230
here. Right point of control. This is
fair value. So we're coming back to fair

7852
02:55:26,230 --> 02:55:26,240
fair value. So we're coming back to fair
 

7853
02:55:26,240 --> 02:55:28,950
fair value. So we're coming back to fair
value. This is deep in discount value

7854
02:55:28,950 --> 02:55:28,960
value. This is deep in discount value
 

7855
02:55:28,960 --> 02:55:30,790
value. This is deep in discount value
area low. We're coming back to fair

7856
02:55:30,790 --> 02:55:30,800
area low. We're coming back to fair
 

7857
02:55:30,800 --> 02:55:33,910
area low. We're coming back to fair
value.

7858
02:55:33,910 --> 02:55:33,920

 

7859
02:55:33,920 --> 02:55:35,670

So any way you want to look at it, it's

7860
02:55:35,670 --> 02:55:35,680
So any way you want to look at it, it's
 

7861
02:55:35,680 --> 02:55:37,750
So any way you want to look at it, it's
the same bloody thing. The market only

7862
02:55:37,750 --> 02:55:37,760
the same bloody thing. The market only
 

7863
02:55:37,760 --> 02:55:40,790
the same bloody thing. The market only
moves in uh does one thing really. So

7864
02:55:40,790 --> 02:55:40,800
moves in uh does one thing really. So
 

7865
02:55:40,800 --> 02:55:42,630
moves in uh does one thing really. So
we're trying to trade up into here. Now,

7866
02:55:42,630 --> 02:55:42,640
we're trying to trade up into here. Now,

Yeah. Four, four big monitors. So, here,
 

7897
02:56:28,080 --> 02:56:30,389

there for the stream.

7902
02:56:46,070 --> 02:56:46,080

 

7903
02:56:46,080 --> 02:56:49,190

I took a swing long from 25,500. You

7904
02:56:49,190 --> 02:56:49,200
I took a swing long from 25,500. You
 

7905
02:56:49,200 --> 02:56:50,790
I took a swing long from 25,500. You
would keep it open for a couple days or

7906
02:56:50,790 --> 02:56:50,800
would keep it open for a couple days or
 

7907
02:56:50,800 --> 02:56:52,309
would keep it open for a couple days or
close it later in the day before market

7908
02:56:52,309 --> 02:56:52,319
close it later in the day before market
 

7909
02:56:52,319 --> 02:56:55,670
close it later in the day before market
closes. All depends where we trade into.

7910
02:56:55,670 --> 02:56:55,680
closes. All depends where we trade into.
 

7911
02:56:55,680 --> 02:56:58,710
closes. All depends where we trade into.
I would be taking some of your size off.

7912
02:56:58,710 --> 02:56:58,720
I would be taking some of your size off.
 

7913
02:56:58,720 --> 02:57:02,469
I would be taking some of your size off.
If we can trade up into 87, like up into

7914
02:57:02,469 --> 02:57:02,479
If we can trade up into 87, like up into
 

7915
02:57:02,479 --> 02:57:04,710
If we can trade up into 87, like up into
here, I would be trimming some because

7916
02:57:04,710 --> 02:57:04,720
here, I would be trimming some because
 

7917
02:57:04,720 --> 02:57:06,230
here, I would be trimming some because
it's possible they put a lower high

7918
02:57:06,230 --> 02:57:06,240
it's possible they put a lower high
 

7919
02:57:06,240 --> 02:57:11,429
it's possible they put a lower high
there. If they find acceptance over 920,

7920
02:57:11,429 --> 02:57:11,439
there. If they find acceptance over 920,
 

7921
02:57:11,439 --> 02:57:13,110
there. If they find acceptance over 920,
then I think you will probably get

7922
02:57:13,110 --> 02:57:13,120
then I think you will probably get
 

7923
02:57:13,120 --> 02:57:15,750
then I think you will probably get
26,000. So, where would if you're long,

7924
02:57:15,750 --> 02:57:15,760
26,000. So, where would if you're long,
 

7925
02:57:15,760 --> 02:57:18,550
26,000. So, where would if you're long,
you said you're long 550s, I would be

7926
02:57:18,550 --> 02:57:18,560
you said you're long 550s, I would be
 

7927
02:57:18,560 --> 02:57:21,030
you said you're long 550s, I would be
probably taking some off or or

7928
02:57:21,030 --> 02:57:21,040
probably taking some off or or
 

7929
02:57:21,040 --> 02:57:22,870
probably taking some off or or
definitely move my stop break even for a

7930
02:57:22,870 --> 02:57:22,880
definitely move my stop break even for a
 

7931
02:57:22,880 --> 02:57:24,550
definitely move my stop break even for a
start because you've lifted well away

7932
02:57:24,550 --> 02:57:24,560
start because you've lifted well away
 

7933
02:57:24,560 --> 02:57:26,150
start because you've lifted well away
from that. So, make sure you're going to

7934
02:57:26,150 --> 02:57:26,160
from that. So, make sure you're going to
 

7935
02:57:26,160 --> 02:57:27,990
from that. So, make sure you're going to
be in the money. I'd be trying to trade

7936
02:57:27,990 --> 02:57:28,000
be in the money. I'd be trying to trade
 

7937
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:29,429
be in the money. I'd be trying to trade
some into here. Look, just go to an

7938
02:57:29,429 --> 02:57:29,439
some into here. Look, just go to an
 

7939
02:57:29,439 --> 02:57:31,110
some into here. Look, just go to an
hourly.

7940
02:57:31,110 --> 02:57:31,120
hourly.
 

7941
02:57:31,120 --> 02:57:32,630
hourly.
This makes sense for you, right? You've

7942
02:57:32,630 --> 02:57:32,640
This makes sense for you, right? You've
 

7943
02:57:32,640 --> 02:57:34,710
This makes sense for you, right? You've
just said you're swing long from here,

7944
02:57:34,710 --> 02:57:34,720
just said you're swing long from here,
 

7945
02:57:34,720 --> 02:57:36,469
just said you're swing long from here,
right? I like the level. Makes sense,

7946
02:57:36,469 --> 02:57:36,479
right? I like the level. Makes sense,
 

7947
02:57:36,479 --> 02:57:38,469
right? I like the level. Makes sense,
right? You need to find acceptance over

7948
02:57:38,469 --> 02:57:38,479
right? You need to find acceptance over
 

7949
02:57:38,479 --> 02:57:40,309
right? You need to find acceptance over
this to get to here. This is the big

7950
02:57:40,309 --> 02:57:40,319
this to get to here. This is the big
 

7951
02:57:40,319 --> 02:57:41,750
this to get to here. This is the big
level. All right. I'd be taking some

7952
02:57:41,750 --> 02:57:41,760
level. All right. I'd be taking some
 

7953
02:57:41,760 --> 02:57:43,830
level. All right. I'd be taking some
partial into there. If you're swing, if

7954
02:57:43,830 --> 02:57:43,840
partial into there. If you're swing, if
 

7955
02:57:43,840 --> 02:57:45,590
partial into there. If you're swing, if
you find acceptance over that, you're

7956
02:57:45,590 --> 02:57:45,600
you find acceptance over that, you're
 

7957
02:57:45,600 --> 02:57:47,030
you find acceptance over that, you're
going to trade into here. I would be

7958
02:57:47,030 --> 02:57:47,040
going to trade into here. I would be
 

7959
02:57:47,040 --> 02:57:48,950
going to trade into here. I would be
taking most my position off into that

7960
02:57:48,950 --> 02:57:48,960
taking most my position off into that
 

7961
02:57:48,960 --> 02:57:51,910
taking most my position off into that
because we now have trapped people up

7962
02:57:51,910 --> 02:57:51,920
because we now have trapped people up
 

7963
02:57:51,920 --> 02:57:54,309
because we now have trapped people up
here. The expectation is here or here

7964
02:57:54,309 --> 02:57:54,319
here. The expectation is here or here
 

7965
02:57:54,319 --> 02:57:56,150
here. The expectation is here or here
will probably fail, right? If you got

7966
02:57:56,150 --> 02:57:56,160
will probably fail, right? If you got
 

7967
02:57:56,160 --> 02:57:58,870
will probably fail, right? If you got
very lucky and you kept like 5% on on a

7968
02:57:58,870 --> 02:57:58,880
very lucky and you kept like 5% on on a
 

7969
02:57:58,880 --> 02:58:01,269
very lucky and you kept like 5% on on a
swing and we did this in for next week,

7970
02:58:01,269 --> 02:58:01,279
swing and we did this in for next week,
 

7971
02:58:01,279 --> 02:58:03,190
swing and we did this in for next week,
then you might get all-time highs. But

7972
02:58:03,190 --> 02:58:03,200
then you might get all-time highs. But
 

7973
02:58:03,200 --> 02:58:04,950
then you might get all-time highs. But
my expectation now would be like

7974
02:58:04,950 --> 02:58:04,960
my expectation now would be like
 

7975
02:58:04,960 --> 02:58:07,190
my expectation now would be like
probably drift into here and sell or

7976
02:58:07,190 --> 02:58:07,200
probably drift into here and sell or
 

7977
02:58:07,200 --> 02:58:08,950
probably drift into here and sell or
here and sell. Definitely one of these

7978
02:58:08,950 --> 02:58:08,960
here and sell. Definitely one of these
 

7979
02:58:08,960 --> 02:58:11,349
here and sell. Definitely one of these
will offer the pullback and then have to

7980
02:58:11,349 --> 02:58:11,359
will offer the pullback and then have to
 

7981
02:58:11,359 --> 02:58:13,349
will offer the pullback and then have to
see if they reby this for that move or

7982
02:58:13,349 --> 02:58:13,359
see if they reby this for that move or
 

7983
02:58:13,359 --> 02:58:17,030
see if they reby this for that move or
not.

7984
02:58:17,030 --> 02:58:17,040

 

7985
02:58:17,040 --> 02:58:18,790

Yeah, for me like I always talk about

7986
02:58:18,790 --> 02:58:18,800
Yeah, for me like I always talk about
 

7987
02:58:18,800 --> 02:58:21,990
Yeah, for me like I always talk about
hourly is what I call like god god for

7988
02:58:21,990 --> 02:58:22,000
hourly is what I call like god god for
 

7989
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:23,510
hourly is what I call like god god for
decision- making, right? God for

7990
02:58:23,510 --> 02:58:23,520
decision- making, right? God for
 

7991
02:58:23,520 --> 02:58:28,230
decision- making, right? God for
decision- making on charts.

7992
02:58:28,230 --> 02:58:28,240

 

7993
02:58:28,240 --> 02:58:30,790

Uh Joano, you purchased the course. Can

Here you go, guys. Here you go. Keep
moving this stop up. Here's point of

03:04:46,469 --> 03:04:46,479
moving this stop up. Here's point of
 

8213
03:04:46,479 --> 03:04:48,389
moving this stop up. Here's point of
control. This is fair value. I would

8214
03:04:48,389 --> 03:04:48,399
control. This is fair value. I would
 

8215
03:04:48,399 --> 03:04:50,550
control. This is fair value. I would
like to see you run these stops at 825,

8216
03:04:50,550 --> 03:04:50,560
like to see you run these stops at 825,
 

8217
03:04:50,560 --> 03:04:52,070
like to see you run these stops at 825,
but you are getting very aggressive here

8218
03:04:52,070 --> 03:04:52,080
but you are getting very aggressive here
 

8219
03:04:52,080 --> 03:04:54,230
but you are getting very aggressive here
on the squeeze. This is everything we

8220
03:04:54,230 --> 03:04:54,240
on the squeeze. This is everything we
 

8221
03:04:54,240 --> 03:04:57,349
on the squeeze. This is everything we
wanted to see. Oh my god. How How has it

8222
03:04:57,349 --> 03:04:57,359
wanted to see. Oh my god. How How has it
 

8223
03:04:57,359 --> 03:05:09,429
wanted to see. Oh my god. How How has it
done it the moment I go to the bathroom?

8224
03:05:09,429 --> 03:05:09,439

 

8225
03:05:09,439 --> 03:05:10,950

How close would I trail stops? I'd

8226
03:05:10,950 --> 03:05:10,960
How close would I trail stops? I'd
 

8227
03:05:10,960 --> 03:05:13,110
How close would I trail stops? I'd
certainly move it up to the 50s if not

8228
03:05:13,110 --> 03:05:13,120
certainly move it up to the 50s if not
 

8229
03:05:13,120 --> 03:05:15,030
certainly move it up to the 50s if not
into this shelf here at 87 at this point

8230
03:05:15,030 --> 03:05:15,040
into this shelf here at 87 at this point
 

8231
03:05:15,040 --> 03:05:16,790
into this shelf here at 87 at this point
because you're basically there. I'd

8232
03:05:16,790 --> 03:05:16,800
because you're basically there. I'd
 

8233
03:05:16,800 --> 03:05:19,190
because you're basically there. I'd
probably protect somewhere around here.

8234
03:05:19,190 --> 03:05:19,200
probably protect somewhere around here.
 

8235
03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:21,030
probably protect somewhere around here.
All right, because who cares if you

8236
03:05:21,030 --> 03:05:21,040
All right, because who cares if you
 

8237
03:05:21,040 --> 03:05:23,349
All right, because who cares if you
don't make an extra, you know, 10 20

8238
03:05:23,349 --> 03:05:23,359
don't make an extra, you know, 10 20
 

8239
03:05:23,359 --> 03:05:24,790
don't make an extra, you know, 10 20
points, but you'll be very upset if you

8240
03:05:24,790 --> 03:05:24,800
points, but you'll be very upset if you
 

8241
03:05:24,800 --> 03:05:26,469
points, but you'll be very upset if you
give back 50. So, I'd probably be moving

8242
03:05:26,469 --> 03:05:26,479
give back 50. So, I'd probably be moving
 

8243
03:05:26,479 --> 03:05:27,910
give back 50. So, I'd probably be moving
my stop to this shelf here at around

8244
03:05:27,910 --> 03:05:27,920
my stop to this shelf here at around
 

8245
03:05:27,920 --> 03:05:30,230
my stop to this shelf here at around
88.90. All right, I'd want it to protect

8246
03:05:30,230 --> 03:05:30,240
88.90. All right, I'd want it to protect
 

8247
03:05:30,240 --> 03:05:31,830
88.90. All right, I'd want it to protect
here. You're very, very close. I think

8248
03:05:31,830 --> 03:05:31,840
here. You're very, very close. I think
 

8249
03:05:31,840 --> 03:05:33,990
here. You're very, very close. I think
these will get run, right? I think these

8250
03:05:33,990 --> 03:05:34,000
these will get run, right? I think these
 

8251
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:35,349
these will get run, right? I think these
will get run. But it's possible it does

8252
03:05:35,349 --> 03:05:35,359
will get run. But it's possible it does
 

8253
03:05:35,359 --> 03:05:36,950
will get run. But it's possible it does
this before doing it. And you will not

8254
03:05:36,950 --> 03:05:36,960
this before doing it. And you will not
 

8255
03:05:36,960 --> 03:05:38,630
this before doing it. And you will not
want to give that back, right? You will

8256
03:05:38,630 --> 03:05:38,640
want to give that back, right? You will
 

8257
03:05:38,640 --> 03:05:40,950
want to give that back, right? You will
not want to give back 50 odd points,

8258
03:05:40,950 --> 03:05:40,960
not want to give back 50 odd points,
 

8259
03:05:40,960 --> 03:05:51,110
not want to give back 50 odd points,
will you? On your runner

8260
03:05:51,110 --> 03:05:51,120

 

8261
03:05:51,120 --> 03:05:53,830

03:10:05,920 --> 03:10:07,110
stop loss up? Yes, absolutely.
If you were long here, you don't want to

8460
03:10:07,110 --> 03:10:07,120
If you were long here, you don't want to
 

8461
03:10:07,120 --> 03:10:09,349
If you were long here, you don't want to
leave a stop loss there, do you? So TP1,

8462
03:10:09,349 --> 03:10:09,359
leave a stop loss there, do you? So TP1,
 

8463
03:10:09,359 --> 03:10:11,910
leave a stop loss there, do you? So TP1,
TP2, my stop now would be right under

8464
03:10:11,910 --> 03:10:11,920
TP2, my stop now would be right under
 

8465
03:10:11,920 --> 03:10:13,429
TP2, my stop now would be right under
this, somewhere under this. I'd want it

8466
03:10:13,429 --> 03:10:13,439
this, somewhere under this. I'd want it
 

8467
03:10:13,439 --> 03:10:15,190
this, somewhere under this. I'd want it
to protect this volume because my last

8468
03:10:15,190 --> 03:10:15,200
to protect this volume because my last
 

8469
03:10:15,200 --> 03:10:17,830
to protect this volume because my last
target is up here. Like you could hold a

8470
03:10:17,830 --> 03:10:17,840
target is up here. Like you could hold a
 

8471
03:10:17,840 --> 03:10:19,590
target is up here. Like you could hold a
tiny piece in case we go ballistic on

8472
03:10:19,590 --> 03:10:19,600
tiny piece in case we go ballistic on
 

8473
03:10:19,600 --> 03:10:22,070
tiny piece in case we go ballistic on
the day, but like really I'd like you

8474
03:10:22,070 --> 03:10:22,080
the day, but like really I'd like you
 

8475
03:10:22,080 --> 03:10:23,910
the day, but like really I'd like you
want it all most of it out into here.

8476
03:10:23,910 --> 03:10:23,920
want it all most of it out into here.
 

8477
03:10:23,920 --> 03:10:26,150
want it all most of it out into here.
You would not expect basically once we

8478
03:10:26,150 --> 03:10:26,160
You would not expect basically once we
 

8479
03:10:26,160 --> 03:10:27,590
You would not expect basically once we
run these stops there might be a little

8480
03:10:27,590 --> 03:10:27,600
run these stops there might be a little
 

8481
03:10:27,600 --> 03:10:30,309
run these stops there might be a little
spike. It's possible that if all these

8482
03:10:30,309 --> 03:10:30,319
spike. It's possible that if all these
 

8483
03:10:30,319 --> 03:10:32,150
spike. It's possible that if all these
shorts get stopped out, you get a little

8484
03:10:32,150 --> 03:10:32,160
shorts get stopped out, you get a little
 

8485
03:10:32,160 --> 03:10:34,630
shorts get stopped out, you get a little
swipe up, but you want to be selling

8486
03:10:34,630 --> 03:10:34,640
swipe up, but you want to be selling
 

8487
03:10:34,640 --> 03:10:36,630
swipe up, but you want to be selling
into that, right? You want to be selling

8488
03:10:36,630 --> 03:10:36,640
into that, right? You want to be selling
 

8489
03:10:36,640 --> 03:10:38,309
into that, right? You want to be selling
into that. This is the counter trend.

8490
03:10:38,309 --> 03:10:38,319
into that. This is the counter trend.
 

8491
03:10:38,319 --> 03:10:40,469
into that. This is the counter trend.
Remember, here's your leg down. This is

8492
03:10:40,469 --> 03:10:40,479
Remember, here's your leg down. This is
 

8493
03:10:40,479 --> 03:10:42,230
Remember, here's your leg down. This is
the counter trend. This is probably

8494
03:10:42,230 --> 03:10:42,240
the counter trend. This is probably
 

8495
03:10:42,240 --> 03:10:43,990
the counter trend. This is probably
going to get sold into and come back

8496
03:10:43,990 --> 03:10:44,000
going to get sold into and come back
 

8497
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:45,830
going to get sold into and come back
down into this range. All right. So, if

8498
03:10:45,830 --> 03:10:45,840
down into this range. All right. So, if
 

8499
03:10:45,840 --> 03:10:47,990
down into this range. All right. So, if
you you need to be taking profit into

8500
03:10:47,990 --> 03:10:48,000
you you need to be taking profit into
 

8501
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:50,309
you you need to be taking profit into
this drive, you get long up here, you

8502
03:10:50,309 --> 03:10:50,319
this drive, you get long up here, you
 

8503
03:10:50,319 --> 03:10:52,870
this drive, you get long up here, you
are asking to get absolutely murdered,

8504
03:10:52,870 --> 03:10:52,880
are asking to get absolutely murdered,
 

8505
03:10:52,880 --> 03:11:01,190
are asking to get absolutely murdered,
right? Absolutely murdered.

8506
03:11:01,190 --> 03:11:01,200

 

8507
03:11:01,200 --> 03:11:02,870

I watch your EMA videos and you

8508
03:11:02,870 --> 03:11:02,880
I watch your EMA videos and you
 

8509
03:11:02,880 --> 03:11:05,030
I watch your EMA videos and you
suggested a range of 35 to 50, but you

8510
03:11:05,030 --> 03:11:05,040
suggested a range of 35 to 50, but you
 

8511
03:11:05,040 --> 03:11:06,950
suggested a range of 35 to 50, but you
don't seem to use it any or was that

8512
03:11:06,950 --> 03:11:06,960
don't seem to use it any or was that
 

8513
03:11:06,960 --> 03:11:09,190
don't seem to use it any or was that
replaced with 21 to 34? They're all in

8514
03:11:09,190 --> 03:11:09,200
replaced with 21 to 34? They're all in
 

8515
03:11:09,200 --> 03:11:11,110
replaced with 21 to 34? They're all in
here. It's the same. It's the same

8516
03:11:11,110 --> 03:11:11,120
here. It's the same. It's the same
 

8517
03:11:11,120 --> 03:11:13,349
here. It's the same. It's the same
stuff. I might have like tweaked it

8518
03:11:13,349 --> 03:11:13,359
stuff. I might have like tweaked it
 

8519
03:11:13,359 --> 03:11:16,309
stuff. I might have like tweaked it
slightly, but I don't think so. Like 45.

8520
03:11:16,309 --> 03:11:16,319
slightly, but I don't think so. Like 45.
 

8521
03:11:16,319 --> 03:11:18,309
slightly, but I don't think so. Like 45.
I might have changed 50 to 45, but like

8522
03:11:18,309 --> 03:11:18,319
I might have changed 50 to 45, but like
 

8523
03:11:18,319 --> 03:11:23,990
I might have changed 50 to 45, but like
I still use a 50 on the day on a daily.

8524

03:12:52,630 --> 03:12:52,640
Three. If I count it down, will it do
 

8599
03:12:52,640 --> 03:12:56,150
Three. If I count it down, will it do
it? Literally tapped it. Tapped it to

it? Literally tapped it. Tapped it to
 

8601
03:12:56,160 --> 03:12:58,870

dick for a tick. Remember, I would like
 

8605
03:13:00,160 --> 03:13:01,830

to see them just run through it. One

03:13:01,830 --> 03:13:01,840
to see them just run through it. One
 

8607
03:13:01,840 --> 03:13:04,230
to see them just run through it. One
little spike and then be done. One

03:16:10,080 --> 03:16:11,349
What a monster day. All right, guys. I'm
gonna have to get out of here, take

8762
03:16:11,349 --> 03:16:11,359
gonna have to get out of here, take
 

8763
03:16:11,359 --> 03:16:13,590
gonna have to get out of here, take
myself to the gym.

8764
03:16:13,590 --> 03:16:13,600
myself to the gym.
 

8765
03:16:13,600 --> 03:16:15,190
myself to the gym.
What would my expectations for the rest

8766
03:16:15,190 --> 03:16:15,200
What would my expectations for the rest
 

8767
03:16:15,200 --> 03:16:17,590
What would my expectations for the rest
of the day be? Um, I'd be very careful

8768
03:16:17,590 --> 03:16:17,600
of the day be? Um, I'd be very careful
 

8769
03:16:17,600 --> 03:16:19,750
of the day be? Um, I'd be very careful
now. All right, we've been in a huge

8770
03:16:19,750 --> 03:16:19,760
now. All right, we've been in a huge
 

8771
03:16:19,760 --> 03:16:22,870
now. All right, we've been in a huge
sell, right? This is a pullback leg to

8772
03:16:22,870 --> 03:16:22,880
sell, right? This is a pullback leg to
 

8773
03:16:22,880 --> 03:16:24,950
sell, right? This is a pullback leg to
that huge sell. I would imagine we will

8774
03:16:24,950 --> 03:16:24,960
that huge sell. I would imagine we will
 

8775
03:16:24,960 --> 03:16:26,550
that huge sell. I would imagine we will
get a continuation. Let's just measure

8776
03:16:26,550 --> 03:16:26,560
get a continuation. Let's just measure
 

8777
03:16:26,560 --> 03:16:29,349
get a continuation. Let's just measure
New York out. We go I be high to low of

8778
03:16:29,349 --> 03:16:29,359
New York out. We go I be high to low of
 

8779
03:16:29,359 --> 03:16:31,750
New York out. We go I be high to low of
day. This is printing back to the 50%.

8780
03:16:31,750 --> 03:16:31,760
day. This is printing back to the 50%.
 

8781
03:16:31,760 --> 03:16:33,349
day. This is printing back to the 50%.
This is why you do not want to be long

8782
03:16:33,349 --> 03:16:33,359
This is why you do not want to be long
 

8783
03:16:33,359 --> 03:16:35,429
This is why you do not want to be long
anymore. I would imagine that that we

8784
03:16:35,429 --> 03:16:35,439
anymore. I would imagine that that we
 

8785
03:16:35,439 --> 03:16:37,269
anymore. I would imagine that that we
will now start to create a range down

8786
03:16:37,269 --> 03:16:37,279
will now start to create a range down
 

8787
03:16:37,279 --> 03:16:38,950
will now start to create a range down
here unless they're going to go risk on

8788
03:16:38,950 --> 03:16:38,960
here unless they're going to go risk on
 

8789
03:16:38,960 --> 03:16:40,550
here unless they're going to go risk on
into Apple earnings, which I cannot

8790
03:16:40,550 --> 03:16:40,560
into Apple earnings, which I cannot
 

8791
03:16:40,560 --> 03:16:42,150
into Apple earnings, which I cannot
imagine they're going to really push.

8792
03:16:42,150 --> 03:16:42,160
imagine they're going to really push.
 

8793
03:16:42,160 --> 03:16:43,830
imagine they're going to really push.
I'd imagine there'll probably be some

8794
03:16:43,830 --> 03:16:43,840
I'd imagine there'll probably be some
 

8795
03:16:43,840 --> 03:16:46,070
I'd imagine there'll probably be some
failed look above somewhere in here at

8796
03:16:46,070 --> 03:16:46,080
failed look above somewhere in here at
 

8797
03:16:46,080 --> 03:16:47,830
failed look above somewhere in here at
some point and they'll probably do a

8798
03:16:47,830 --> 03:16:47,840
some point and they'll probably do a
 

8799
03:16:47,840 --> 03:16:49,510
some point and they'll probably do a
little dunk back down into here and then

8800
03:16:49,510 --> 03:16:49,520
little dunk back down into here and then
 

8801
03:16:49,520 --> 03:16:51,670
little dunk back down into here and then
you probably get a build out in here for

8802
03:16:51,670 --> 03:16:51,680
you probably get a build out in here for
 

8803
03:16:51,680 --> 03:16:53,429
you probably get a build out in here for
the day. So, I doubt there's going to be

8804
03:16:53,429 --> 03:16:53,439
the day. So, I doubt there's going to be
 

8805
03:16:53,439 --> 03:16:55,030
the day. So, I doubt there's going to be
too much to play for the in the

8806
03:16:55,030 --> 03:16:55,040
too much to play for the in the
 

8807
03:16:55,040 --> 03:16:56,309
too much to play for the in the
afternoon unless you want to play these

8808
03:16:56,309 --> 03:16:56,319
afternoon unless you want to play these
 

8809
03:16:56,319 --> 03:16:57,750
afternoon unless you want to play these
rotations. I mean, there's plenty of

8810
03:16:57,750 --> 03:16:57,760
rotations. I mean, there's plenty of
 

8811
03:16:57,760 --> 03:17:00,389
rotations. I mean, there's plenty of
room. The rotations are 200 plus points.

8812
03:17:00,389 --> 03:17:00,399
room. The rotations are 200 plus points.
 

8813
03:17:00,399 --> 03:17:03,190
room. The rotations are 200 plus points.
Um, but seeing as we have absolutely

8814
03:17:03,190 --> 03:17:03,200
Um, but seeing as we have absolutely
 

8815
03:17:03,200 --> 03:17:05,269
Um, but seeing as we have absolutely
obliterated it, I don't think there's

8816
03:17:05,269 --> 03:17:05,279
obliterated it, I don't think there's
 

8817
03:17:05,279 --> 03:17:07,429
obliterated it, I don't think there's
much reason to hang around. Do you guys?

8818
03:17:07,429 --> 03:17:07,439
much reason to hang around. Do you guys?
 

8819
03:17:07,439 --> 03:17:14,229
much reason to hang around. Do you guys?
I don't think so.

8820
03:17:14,229 --> 03:17:14,239
