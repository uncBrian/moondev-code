00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
on the daily, well, last night we got
 

15
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,629
on the daily, well, last night we got
exactly what we wanted. And I did start

16
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
exactly what we wanted. And I did start
 

17
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,710
exactly what we wanted. And I did start
some relief longs last night. I will

18
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
some relief longs last night. I will
 

19
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,629
some relief longs last night. I will
tell you that. Uh both in swing accounts

20
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
tell you that. Uh both in swing accounts
 

21
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,590
tell you that. Uh both in swing accounts
and in uh in a couple props. But uh you

22
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
and in uh in a couple props. But uh you
 

23
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,110
and in uh in a couple props. But uh you
can see this is what we were looking

24
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
can see this is what we were looking
 

25
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,590
can see this is what we were looking
for, right? This is the exact moment we

26
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
for, right? This is the exact moment we
 

27
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,590
for, right? This is the exact moment we
were looking for. We talked about it in

28
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
were looking for. We talked about it in
 

29
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,749
were looking for. We talked about it in
the newsletter. We talked about it over

30
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
the newsletter. We talked about it over
 

31
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,029
the newsletter. We talked about it over
the last few days that if we left this

32
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
the last few days that if we left this
 

33
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,670
the last few days that if we left this
trapped volume from here, all right,

34
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
trapped volume from here, all right,
 

35
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,950
trapped volume from here, all right,
this trap volume here, once we left it

36
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
this trap volume here, once we left it
 

37
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,029
this trap volume here, once we left it
and we rejected it, we would expect that

38
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
and we rejected it, we would expect that
 

39
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,390
and we rejected it, we would expect that
move down to Mr. 200 day. Don't know why

40
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
move down to Mr. 200 day. Don't know why
 

41
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,150
move down to Mr. 200 day. Don't know why
I call him Mister, but in my mind it's

42
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
I call him Mister, but in my mind it's
 

43
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,070
I call him Mister, but in my mind it's
Mr. 200 day. All right. It's the first

44
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
Mr. 200 day. All right. It's the first
 

45
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,070
Mr. 200 day. All right. It's the first
time we've visited it in 9 months.

46
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
time we've visited it in 9 months.
 

47
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,430
time we've visited it in 9 months.

55
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,590
don't know what you're doing. The links
are down below in the chat. And this is

00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
are down below in the chat. And this is
 

57
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,710
are down below in the chat. And this is
exactly what we're looking for. All

58
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
exactly what we're looking for. All
 

59
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,950
exactly what we're looking for. All
right, so we've come into that 200 day

60
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
right, so we've come into that 200 day
 

61
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,550
right, so we've come into that 200 day
and we're getting very near this node

62
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
and we're getting very near this node
 

63
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,390
and we're getting very near this node
here, 24,000.

64
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
here, 24,000.
 

65
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,070
here, 24,000.
All right, so that's the next stop. Uh,

66
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
All right, so that's the next stop. Uh,
 

67
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,070
All right, so that's the next stop. Uh,
do I think we go there today? Probably

68
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
do I think we go there today? Probably
 

69
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,590
do I think we go there today? Probably
not. All right, we probably need some

70
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
not. All right, we probably need some
 

71
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,670
not. All right, we probably need some
relief. Like we talk about the mark, it

72
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
relief. Like we talk about the mark, it
 

73
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,430
relief. Like we talk about the mark, it
doesn't move straight down. All right,

74
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
doesn't move straight down. All right,
 

75
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,310
doesn't move straight down. All right,
it moves in waves and overnight we've

76
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,320
it moves in waves and overnight we've
 

77
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,749
it moves in waves and overnight we've
had that relief. All right, and we're

78
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
had that relief. All right, and we're
 

79
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,909
had that relief. All right, and we're
coming back towards this node here,

80
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
coming back towards this node here,
 

81
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,230
coming back towards this node here,
24800s

82
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
24800s
 

83
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,070
24800s
and then through that we can look at

84
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
and then through that we can look at
 

85
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,950
and then through that we can look at
25,000 again. All right, so really what

86
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
25,000 again. All right, so really what
 

87
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,710
25,000 again. All right, so really what
I'm trying to say is objective complete

88
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
I'm trying to say is objective complete
 

89
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,309
I'm trying to say is objective complete
for the week. All right, failed breakout

90
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
for the week. All right, failed breakout
 

91
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,110
for the week. All right, failed breakout
last week, failed to get back into that

92
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
last week, failed to get back into that
 

93
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,590
last week, failed to get back into that
high this week. Big dumperama, we just

94
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
high this week. Big dumperama, we just
 

95
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,309
high this week. Big dumperama, we just
hit our target. There's very unlikely to

96
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
hit our target. There's very unlikely to
 

97
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,990
hit our target. There's very unlikely to
see more downside in the immediate

98
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
see more downside in the immediate
 

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,350
see more downside in the immediate
future. Doesn't mean we can't come and

100
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
future. Doesn't mean we can't come and
 

101
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,230
future. Doesn't mean we can't come and
do one of these today. We can, but I

102
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
do one of these today. We can, but I
 

103
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,070
do one of these today. We can, but I
would find it unlikely that we break

104
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080
would find it unlikely that we break
 

105
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,990
would find it unlikely that we break
this low today. It's possible, but it's

106
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
this low today. It's possible, but it's
 

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,590
this low today. It's possible, but it's
unlikely. What's more likely to happen

108
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
unlikely. What's more likely to happen
 

109
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,790
unlikely. What's more likely to happen
now is that we're going to build out

110
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
now is that we're going to build out
 

111
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,670
now is that we're going to build out
liquidity today and next week, maybe

112
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
liquidity today and next week, maybe
 

113
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,350
liquidity today and next week, maybe
have a failed attempt to get back in,

114
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
have a failed attempt to get back in,
 

115
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,590
have a failed attempt to get back in,
maybe come back down, clean these out,

116
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
maybe come back down, clean these out,
 

117
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,950
maybe come back down, clean these out,
and maybe then we get a waterfall

118
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
and maybe then we get a waterfall
 

119
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,629
and maybe then we get a waterfall
moment. I don't know. Maybe they come up

120
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
moment. I don't know. Maybe they come up
 

121
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,150
moment. I don't know. Maybe they come up
for this, or maybe they just do one of

122
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
for this, or maybe they just do one of
 

123
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,670
for this, or maybe they just do one of
these. We'll find out over the next few

124
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
these. We'll find out over the next few
 

125
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,510
these. We'll find out over the next few
weeks. But right now, this is an

126
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
weeks. But right now, this is an
 

127
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,029
weeks. But right now, this is an
expected move that we're seeing on the

128
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
expected move that we're seeing on the
 

129
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,629
expected move that we're seeing on the
daily. So you guys should have been

130
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
daily. So you guys should have been
 

131
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,909
daily. So you guys should have been
prepared for that. You should have been

132
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
prepared for that. You should have been
 

133
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,629
prepared for that. You should have been
prepared. Okay. So when we now look at

134
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
prepared. Okay. So when we now look at
 

135
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,150
prepared. Okay. So when we now look at
the hourlys, we can think about the

136
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
the hourlys, we can think about the
 

137
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,430
the hourlys, we can think about the
volume that was trapped over the last

138
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
volume that was trapped over the last
 

139
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,390
volume that was trapped over the last
few days where we might move to, why we

140
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
few days where we might move to, why we
 

141
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,950
few days where we might move to, why we
might move. So here we come into the

142
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
might move. So here we come into the
 

143
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,550
might move. So here we come into the
hourly, right? Let's move this up so you

144
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
hourly, right? Let's move this up so you
 

145
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,950
hourly, right? Let's move this up so you
can see enough. You can see we're

146
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
can see enough. You can see we're
 

147
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,110
can see enough. You can see we're
stretching back up into the developing

148
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
stretching back up into the developing
 

149
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,950
stretching back up into the developing
week profile. All right. So this profile

150
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
week profile. All right. So this profile
 

151
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,350
week profile. All right. So this profile
here is from Sunday's open. And you'll

152
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
here is from Sunday's open. And you'll
 

153
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,950
here is from Sunday's open. And you'll
see we have a node here. We get thin. We

154
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
see we have a node here. We get thin. We
 

155
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,309
see we have a node here. We get thin. We
have a very thick node here. We get

156
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
have a very thick node here. We get
 

157
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,830
have a very thick node here. We get
thin. We have a little node here. We get

158
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840
thin. We have a little node here. We get
 

159
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,309
thin. We have a little node here. We get
thin. And we have a node here. And then

160
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
thin. And we have a node here. And then
 

161
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,230
thin. And we have a node here. And then
under here, well, we have had no

162
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
under here, well, we have had no
 

163
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,909
under here, well, we have had no
acceptance under there. All right. So,

164
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
acceptance under there. All right. So,
 

165
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,670
acceptance under there. All right. So,
this was the gap fill yesterday. This

166
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
this was the gap fill yesterday. This
 

167
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,270
this was the gap fill yesterday. This
was the drift into the higher time frame

168
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
was the drift into the higher time frame
 

169
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,510
was the drift into the higher time frame
level. This is the 200 day. We've bid

170
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
level. This is the 200 day. We've bid
 

171
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,070
level. This is the 200 day. We've bid
back off that 1 2 3. The question really

172
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080
back off that 1 2 3. The question really
 

173
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,909
back off that 1 2 3. The question really
is, do we pull back and hold? Now,

174
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
is, do we pull back and hold? Now,
 

175
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,589
is, do we pull back and hold? Now,
that's the question mark. If we're going

176
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599
that's the question mark. If we're going
 

177
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,589
that's the question mark. If we're going
to pull back and hold, that means we're

178
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
to pull back and hold, that means we're
 

179
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,629
to pull back and hold, that means we're
going to have no acceptance um to

180
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
going to have no acceptance um to
 

181
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,350
going to have no acceptance um to
increase value lower in the developing

182
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
increase value lower in the developing
 

183
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,350
increase value lower in the developing
week. So, if it is a big if right now,

184
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
week. So, if it is a big if right now,
 

185
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,510
week. So, if it is a big if right now,
but if we can pull back and hold

186
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
but if we can pull back and hold
 

187
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,990
but if we can pull back and hold
somewhere into these 700s, possibly even

188
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
somewhere into these 700s, possibly even
 

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,150
somewhere into these 700s, possibly even
down to 640s. All right, potentially

190
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,160
down to 640s. All right, potentially
 

191
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,589
down to 640s. All right, potentially
then they have a little bit of a

192
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
then they have a little bit of a
 

193
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,909
then they have a little bit of a
continuation move higher maybe if they

194
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:01,919
continuation move higher maybe if they
 

195
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,230
continuation move higher maybe if they
really want to turn it on. What you need

196
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
really want to turn it on. What you need
 

197
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,790
really want to turn it on. What you need
to be careful of is if we fail to hold

198
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
to be careful of is if we fail to hold
 

199
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,110
to be careful of is if we fail to hold
previous day value area high, these 780s

200
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
previous day value area high, these 780s
 

201
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,270
previous day value area high, these 780s
here, and we rotate down to what's 650s,

202
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
here, and we rotate down to what's 650s,
 

203
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,629
here, and we rotate down to what's 650s,
the previous day point of control, and

204
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
the previous day point of control, and
 

205
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,749
the previous day point of control, and
we lose that, we're going to come

206
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
we lose that, we're going to come
 

207
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,469
we lose that, we're going to come
straight back down to 530s. Now, this

208
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
straight back down to 530s. Now, this
 

209
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,790
straight back down to 530s. Now, this
might not seem like enough, like a lot.

210
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800
might not seem like enough, like a lot.
 

211
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,629
might not seem like enough, like a lot.
That's 800 to 500. 765. That's 300

212
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639
That's 800 to 500. 765. That's 300
 

213
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,790
That's 800 to 500. 765. That's 300
points in a rotation. And I tell you

214
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
points in a rotation. And I tell you
 

215
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,629
points in a rotation. And I tell you
what, overnight we were very thin up

216
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
what, overnight we were very thin up
 

217
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,309
what, overnight we were very thin up
there. All right. So, we got to be a

218
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
there. All right. So, we got to be a
 

219
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,550
there. All right. So, we got to be a
little bit careful of how we place this.

220
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
little bit careful of how we place this.
 

221
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,949
little bit careful of how we place this.
If we're going to be long today for a

222
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
If we're going to be long today for a
 

223
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,870
If we're going to be long today for a
relief, you have to be careful because I

224
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880
relief, you have to be careful because I
 

225
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,029
relief, you have to be careful because I
will remind you the main trend is still

226
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
will remind you the main trend is still
 

227
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,829
will remind you the main trend is still
down. All right, this is a relief,

228
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
down. All right, this is a relief,
 

229
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,910
down. All right, this is a relief,
right? The question is as we come into

230
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
right? The question is as we come into
 

231
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,470
right? The question is as we come into
some of these levels down here, do the

232
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
some of these levels down here, do the
 

233
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,389
some of these levels down here, do the
bids come back in and say, "Hey, enough.

234
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:50,399
bids come back in and say, "Hey, enough.
 

235
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,230
bids come back in and say, "Hey, enough.
We need a relief all the way back here."

236
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
We need a relief all the way back here."
 

237
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,150
We need a relief all the way back here."
Don't say they have to do it today. But

238
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,160
Don't say they have to do it today. But
 

239
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,509
Don't say they have to do it today. But
like this could be the start of what

240
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
like this could be the start of what
 

241
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,350
like this could be the start of what
we're looking for early next week.

242
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
we're looking for early next week.
 

243
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,269
we're looking for early next week.
something up into that unless this PC

244
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
something up into that unless this PC
 

245
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,790
something up into that unless this PC
shifts down here, which it's not too far

246
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
shifts down here, which it's not too far
 

247
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,790
shifts down here, which it's not too far
away from doing. All right, but if it

248
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
away from doing. All right, but if it
 

249
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,150
away from doing. All right, but if it
doesn't, then I'd be looking for that

250
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
doesn't, then I'd be looking for that
 

251
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,910
doesn't, then I'd be looking for that
move next week and then a resell back

252
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
move next week and then a resell back
 

253
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,990
move next week and then a resell back
down towards the lows. So, watching

254
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
down towards the lows. So, watching
 

255
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,829
down towards the lows. So, watching
these areas here, I'm I'm not going to

256
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
these areas here, I'm I'm not going to
 

257
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,190
these areas here, I'm I'm not going to
be too heavy here. The last thing we

258
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
be too heavy here. The last thing we
 

259
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,350
be too heavy here. The last thing we
want to do on a Friday after a massive

260
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
want to do on a Friday after a massive
 

261
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,190
want to do on a Friday after a massive
week, two weeks in a row of amazing

262
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
week, two weeks in a row of amazing
 

263
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,190
week, two weeks in a row of amazing
price action. The last thing we want to

264
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
price action. The last thing we want to
 

265
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,190
price action. The last thing we want to
do is something stupid, right? So we

266
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
do is something stupid, right? So we
 

267
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,870
do is something stupid, right? So we
will be watching if we hold previous day

268
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
will be watching if we hold previous day
 

269
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,509
will be watching if we hold previous day
value area high or this developing

270
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
value area high or this developing
 

271
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,070
value area high or this developing
profile this node here ideally if not

272
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
profile this node here ideally if not
 

273
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,750
profile this node here ideally if not
down here we will be thinking about if

274
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
down here we will be thinking about if
 

275
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,070
down here we will be thinking about if
this gets long if we do that and we

276
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,080
this gets long if we do that and we
 

277
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,829
this gets long if we do that and we
reject value area high I will be looking

278
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839
reject value area high I will be looking
 

279
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,590
reject value area high I will be looking
for a short back down into this and this

280
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
for a short back down into this and this
 

281
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,030
for a short back down into this and this
again and then I'll be thinking long

282
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
again and then I'll be thinking long
 

283
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,509
again and then I'll be thinking long
again I do not want to get long uh short

284
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
again I do not want to get long uh short
 

285
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,949
again I do not want to get long uh short
down here I really don't want to get

286
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
down here I really don't want to get
 

287
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,030
down here I really don't want to get
short down here right like we talked

288
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,040
short down here right like we talked
 

289
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,150
short down here right like we talked
about we don't want to be shortening

290
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
about we don't want to be shortening
 

291
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,070
about we don't want to be shortening
that 200 day even if it starts peaking

292
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
that 200 day even if it starts peaking
 

293
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,350
that 200 day even if it starts peaking
for the day that's all right it can go

294
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
for the day that's all right it can go
 

295
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,190
for the day that's all right it can go
without me okay let's have a look what

296
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
without me okay let's have a look what
 

297
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,030
without me okay let's have a look what
happened overnight

298
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040
happened overnight
 

299
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,949
happened overnight
So in the new session you can see we

300
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
So in the new session you can see we
 

301
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,630
So in the new session you can see we
lost previous day's value area low and

302
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
lost previous day's value area low and
 

303
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,949
lost previous day's value area low and
we drifted into the 200 day. Soon as we

304
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
we drifted into the 200 day. Soon as we
 

305
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,350
we drifted into the 200 day. Soon as we
hit that 200 day we found a bid right

306
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,360
hit that 200 day we found a bid right
 

307
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,910
hit that 200 day we found a bid right
higher low starting to bid up and we are

308
00:09:59,910 --> 00:09:59,920
higher low starting to bid up and we are
 

309
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,710
higher low starting to bid up and we are
in one of these repricing into here. We

310
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
in one of these repricing into here. We
 

311
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,790
in one of these repricing into here. We
need to build out liquidity somewhere in

312
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
need to build out liquidity somewhere in
 

313
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,190
need to build out liquidity somewhere in
here now to offer that relief. And if

314
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
here now to offer that relief. And if
 

315
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,710
here now to offer that relief. And if
they can't get that relief then these

316
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
they can't get that relief then these
 

317
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,150
they can't get that relief then these
guys will become trapped and we'll use

318
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160
guys will become trapped and we'll use
 

319
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,350
guys will become trapped and we'll use
it downside. All right. So, I'm

320
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
it downside. All right. So, I'm
 

321
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,870
it downside. All right. So, I'm
expecting a pullback ideally somewhere

322
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
expecting a pullback ideally somewhere
 

323
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,750
expecting a pullback ideally somewhere
into here to get long probably is going

324
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:15,760
into here to get long probably is going
 

325
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,150
into here to get long probably is going
to be the first thing I'd consider doing

326
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,160
to be the first thing I'd consider doing
 

327
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,230
to be the first thing I'd consider doing
and then we can readjust after that. All

328
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
and then we can readjust after that. All
 

329
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,430
and then we can readjust after that. All
right, we'll readjust after that.

330
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
right, we'll readjust after that.
 

331
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,829
right, we'll readjust after that.
Okay, so lower time frame. You can see

332
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
Okay, so lower time frame. You can see
 

333
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,509
Okay, so lower time frame. You can see
it's just a straight pump. Um, I'll tell

334
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
it's just a straight pump. Um, I'll tell
 

335
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,030
it's just a straight pump. Um, I'll tell
you what I can do. You can see some of

336
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
you what I can do. You can see some of
 

337
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,790
you what I can do. You can see some of
the nodes that I've marked out. If we go

338
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
the nodes that I've marked out. If we go
 

339
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,870
the nodes that I've marked out. If we go
to the Asia session, I rarely do this,

340
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
to the Asia session, I rarely do this,
 

341
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,710
to the Asia session, I rarely do this,
but the move has been big, so it's worth

342
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
but the move has been big, so it's worth
 

343
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,350
but the move has been big, so it's worth
doing right here.

344
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
doing right here.
 

345
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,509
doing right here.
Hello, mate. There we go. All right.

346
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
Hello, mate. There we go. All right.
 

347
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,670
Hello, mate. There we go. All right.
It's a big cluster developing here. I'm

348
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
It's a big cluster developing here. I'm
 

349
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,949
It's a big cluster developing here. I'm
watching the edge of this into previous

350
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:42,959
watching the edge of this into previous
 

351
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,509
watching the edge of this into previous
day value area high. If we lose this

352
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:45,519
day value area high. If we lose this
 

353
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,269
day value area high. If we lose this
cluster, like I talked about, if we lose

354
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
cluster, like I talked about, if we lose
 

355
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,509
cluster, like I talked about, if we lose
this cluster, all right, then really

356
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
this cluster, all right, then really
 

357
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,750
this cluster, all right, then really
we're very thin here, aren't we? So, I'd

358
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:51,760
we're very thin here, aren't we? So, I'd
 

359
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,590
we're very thin here, aren't we? So, I'd
be watching this from yesterday. And if

360
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
be watching this from yesterday. And if
 

361
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,110
be watching this from yesterday. And if
we lose that right down to here, it's

362
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
we lose that right down to here, it's
 

363
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,829
we lose that right down to here, it's
very, very possible right now we come

364
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:57,839
very, very possible right now we come
 

365
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,990
very, very possible right now we come
all the way back down to 500s. If we

366
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
all the way back down to 500s. If we
 

367
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,110
all the way back down to 500s. If we
lose sevens or what we call that, 790s.

368
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
lose sevens or what we call that, 790s.
 

369
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,829
lose sevens or what we call that, 790s.
Let's just call it 750s to be safe. We

370
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839
Let's just call it 750s to be safe. We
 

371
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,269
Let's just call it 750s to be safe. We
lose it under there, there's a chance

372
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279
lose it under there, there's a chance
 

373
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,030
lose it under there, there's a chance
we're going to move to 650s. If they

374
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
we're going to move to 650s. If they
 

375
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,630
we're going to move to 650s. If they
don't find a bid on yesterday's point of

376
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
don't find a bid on yesterday's point of
 

377
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,230
don't find a bid on yesterday's point of
control, then we will rotate down to the

378
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
control, then we will rotate down to the
 

379
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,310
control, then we will rotate down to the
yesterday's previous day value low,

380
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
yesterday's previous day value low,
 

381
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,230
yesterday's previous day value low,
which is overnight point of control. So

382
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
which is overnight point of control. So
 

383
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,710
which is overnight point of control. So
this area here is a big big zone. All

384
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
this area here is a big big zone. All
 

385
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,550
this area here is a big big zone. All
right? So if we don't bid here or here,

386
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,560
right? So if we don't bid here or here,
 

387
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,910
right? So if we don't bid here or here,
they will probably bid here, which means

388
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
they will probably bid here, which means
 

389
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,590
they will probably bid here, which means
there is a short down to that. And if

390
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
there is a short down to that. And if
 

391
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,870
there is a short down to that. And if
they lose that, there's another short

392
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
they lose that, there's another short
 

393
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,630
they lose that, there's another short
down to that. And there's a bid either

394
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:26,640
down to that. And there's a bid either
 

395
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,470
down to that. And there's a bid either
here or here or here. I don't want to

396
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
here or here or here. I don't want to
 

397
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,069
here or here or here. I don't want to
trade between these zones. Don't want to

398
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
trade between these zones. Don't want to
 

399
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,750
trade between these zones. Don't want to
trade between those zones in that thin

400
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
trade between those zones in that thin
 

401
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,509
trade between those zones in that thin
profile. No, thank you very much. All

402
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
profile. No, thank you very much. All
 

403
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,630
profile. No, thank you very much. All
right. So I'm going to stick to these

404
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
right. So I'm going to stick to these
 

405
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,949
right. So I'm going to stick to these
zones. One, two, three. That's where I

406
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
zones. One, two, three. That's where I
 

407
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,710
zones. One, two, three. That's where I
want to trade those locations. nowhere

408
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:38,720
want to trade those locations. nowhere
 

409
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,030
want to trade those locations. nowhere
else. All right, so wait for it to get

410
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040
else. All right, so wait for it to get
 

411
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,310
else. All right, so wait for it to get
into those and then see what the

412
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
into those and then see what the
 

413
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,389
into those and then see what the
reactions are. All right, let's have a

414
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:44,399
reactions are. All right, let's have a
 

415
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,590
reactions are. All right, let's have a
look at the ES.

416
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600
look at the ES.
 

417
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,670
look at the ES.
All right, look at that strength. Oh my

418
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
All right, look at that strength. Oh my
 

419
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,790
All right, look at that strength. Oh my
gosh, why so strong? Well, because it's

420
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
gosh, why so strong? Well, because it's
 

421
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,310
gosh, why so strong? Well, because it's
not had the relative weakness with

422
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
not had the relative weakness with
 

423
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,230
not had the relative weakness with
software selling off. All right, so if

424
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
software selling off. All right, so if
 

425
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,269
software selling off. All right, so if
we think about IGV, want to make sure I

426
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
we think about IGV, want to make sure I
 

427
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,310
we think about IGV, want to make sure I
got that right. IGV. All right, this has

428
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320
got that right. IGV. All right, this has
 

429
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,949
got that right. IGV. All right, this has
been the cell in tech. All right, this

430
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959
been the cell in tech. All right, this
 

431
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,269
been the cell in tech. All right, this
is your oracles and your Adobe's. We

432
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,279
is your oracles and your Adobe's. We
 

433
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,629
is your oracles and your Adobe's. We
went over this yesterday. All right,

434
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
went over this yesterday. All right,
 

435
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,110
went over this yesterday. All right,
cliff. All right, I did get long, right?

436
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
cliff. All right, I did get long, right?
 

437
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,110
cliff. All right, I did get long, right?
I started like nibbling long. I will get

438
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120
I started like nibbling long. I will get
 

439
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,949
I started like nibbling long. I will get
more long down here just for a little

440
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959
more long down here just for a little
 

441
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,310
more long down here just for a little
bit of relief. It might be that it

442
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
bit of relief. It might be that it
 

443
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,750
bit of relief. It might be that it
collapsed the whole thing, but I'm

444
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
collapsed the whole thing, but I'm
 

445
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,949
collapsed the whole thing, but I'm
looking for a little bit of relief

446
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
looking for a little bit of relief
 

447
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,430
looking for a little bit of relief
bounce. Whereas ES like we talked about,

448
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
bounce. Whereas ES like we talked about,
 

449
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,509
bounce. Whereas ES like we talked about,
all right, relative strength doesn't

450
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:23,519
all right, relative strength doesn't
 

451
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,509
all right, relative strength doesn't
have all of tech in it and we have some

452
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
have all of tech in it and we have some
 

453
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,190
have all of tech in it and we have some
of the broader market. That's a great

454
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
of the broader market. That's a great
 

455
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,550
of the broader market. That's a great
push. That is a fantastic push overnight

456
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
push. That is a fantastic push overnight
 

457
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,870
push. That is a fantastic push overnight
on ES starting to find a bid. So, you'll

458
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880
on ES starting to find a bid. So, you'll
 

459
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,790
on ES starting to find a bid. So, you'll
be watching for liquidity to be built in

460
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
be watching for liquidity to be built in
 

461
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,350
be watching for liquidity to be built in
here now. And if it is, then probably a

462
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
here now. And if it is, then probably a
 

463
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,269
here now. And if it is, then probably a
drive back up to here over the next few

464
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
drive back up to here over the next few
 

465
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,870
drive back up to here over the next few
days. So, it looks pretty good. Let's

466
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
days. So, it looks pretty good. Let's
 

467
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,150
days. So, it looks pretty good. Let's
have a look at the uh ETFs.

468
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
have a look at the uh ETFs.
 

469
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,910
have a look at the uh ETFs.
Spiders,

470
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
Spiders,
 

471
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,310
Spiders,
same story. All right. Right into our

472
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,320
same story. All right. Right into our
 

473
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,750
same story. All right. Right into our
green zone. Look at that. Right into the

474
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
green zone. Look at that. Right into the
 

475
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,949
green zone. Look at that. Right into the
70s and we've caught a bid off that. All

476
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
70s and we've caught a bid off that. All
 

477
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,509
70s and we've caught a bid off that. All
right. So, they lost 75 trading to 70s

478
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
right. So, they lost 75 trading to 70s
 

479
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,910
right. So, they lost 75 trading to 70s
after hours on Amazon earnings. Ripped

480
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:57,920
after hours on Amazon earnings. Ripped
 

481
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,230
after hours on Amazon earnings. Ripped
it. And you know what we have now? All

482
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
it. And you know what we have now? All
 

483
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,710
it. And you know what we have now? All
right. So, there they don't come back

484
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:02,720
right. So, there they don't come back
 

485
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,230
right. So, there they don't come back
down into this. If we build liquidity

486
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
down into this. If we build liquidity
 

487
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,470
down into this. If we build liquidity
out here, this can then be used for that

488
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,480
out here, this can then be used for that
 

489
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,470
out here, this can then be used for that
relief. Doesn't have to be today. I want

490
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,480
relief. Doesn't have to be today. I want
 

491
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,150
relief. Doesn't have to be today. I want
to really make that clear. It really

492
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
to really make that clear. It really
 

493
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,790
to really make that clear. It really
does not need to be today. Might be a

494
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
does not need to be today. Might be a
 

495
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,710
does not need to be today. Might be a
liquidity building day today given the

496
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
liquidity building day today given the
 

497
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,590
liquidity building day today given the
size of that push overnight. QQQ, same

498
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:17,600
size of that push overnight. QQQ, same
 

499
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,310
size of that push overnight. QQQ, same
story. All right, we lost these 600s and

500
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
story. All right, we lost these 600s and
 

501
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,389
story. All right, we lost these 600s and
we came Well, that is a big old wash in

502
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
we came Well, that is a big old wash in
 

503
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,069
we came Well, that is a big old wash in
the after hours on Amazon. Didn't

504
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
the after hours on Amazon. Didn't
 

505
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,750
the after hours on Amazon. Didn't
realize it was that big. All right, one

506
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
realize it was that big. All right, one
 

507
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,430
realize it was that big. All right, one
thing I would say there is divergence.

508
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:27,440
thing I would say there is divergence.
 

509
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,030
thing I would say there is divergence.
QQQ 200 day is a long long way down. All

510
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,040
QQQ 200 day is a long long way down. All
 

511
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,590
QQQ 200 day is a long long way down. All
right, it is at 77s. All right. So, if

512
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
right, it is at 77s. All right. So, if
 

513
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,910
right, it is at 77s. All right. So, if
the ETFs are going to catch up next week

514
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
the ETFs are going to catch up next week
 

515
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,069
the ETFs are going to catch up next week
and get to their 200 days, these are

516
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:38,079
and get to their 200 days, these are
 

517
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,629
and get to their 200 days, these are
going to have to trade right down into

518
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
going to have to trade right down into
 

519
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,629
going to have to trade right down into
here. All right. So, they've got a long

520
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
here. All right. So, they've got a long
 

521
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,430
here. All right. So, they've got a long
way to come or the 200 day tap, which

522
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
way to come or the 200 day tap, which
 

523
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,509
way to come or the 200 day tap, which
we've seen on NQ already if they're

524
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
we've seen on NQ already if they're
 

525
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,670
we've seen on NQ already if they're
going to play that catch-up trade. The

526
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680
going to play that catch-up trade. The
 

527
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,350
going to play that catch-up trade. The
same story right inside of initial

528
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
same story right inside of initial
 

529
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,910
same story right inside of initial
balance now. Uh gapping up and we have

530
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
balance now. Uh gapping up and we have
 

531
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,350
balance now. Uh gapping up and we have
an old gap fill which you didn't quite

532
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
an old gap fill which you didn't quite
 

533
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,790
an old gap fill which you didn't quite
fill. If we want to be efficient, we can

534
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,800
fill. If we want to be efficient, we can
 

535
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,949
fill. If we want to be efficient, we can
come into those 60580s. I will be

536
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
come into those 60580s. I will be
 

537
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,870
come into those 60580s. I will be
watching that. All right, let's get into

538
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
watching that. All right, let's get into
 

539
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,910
watching that. All right, let's get into
the MAG and everything else. Uh BTC and

540
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:03,920
the MAG and everything else. Uh BTC and
 

541
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,069
the MAG and everything else. Uh BTC and
all that good stuff. Dixie still trying

542
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,079
all that good stuff. Dixie still trying
 

543
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,509
all that good stuff. Dixie still trying
to find a bid. All right, it's coming

544
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
to find a bid. All right, it's coming
 

545
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,829
to find a bid. All right, it's coming
back down now, but it's coming back down

546
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:09,839
back down now, but it's coming back down
 

547
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,750
back down now, but it's coming back down
into a level that we last bid off. So,

548
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760
into a level that we last bid off. So,
 

549
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,389
into a level that we last bid off. So,
if this is an undercut, we'd want Dixie

550
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:14,399
if this is an undercut, we'd want Dixie
 

551
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,870
if this is an undercut, we'd want Dixie
to hold here for that drive up if it's

552
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:16,880
to hold here for that drive up if it's
 

553
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,069
to hold here for that drive up if it's
actually going to have a go at it. But

554
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
actually going to have a go at it. But
 

555
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,910
actually going to have a go at it. But
this is just building out a box if we

556
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
this is just building out a box if we
 

557
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,269
this is just building out a box if we
lose that new lows.

558
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279
lose that new lows.
 

559
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,949
lose that new lows.
Uh gold and silver did everything we

560
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:24,959
Uh gold and silver did everything we
 

561
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,710
Uh gold and silver did everything we
talked about. All right, there's your

562
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
talked about. All right, there's your
 

563
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,790
talked about. All right, there's your
fade back down. There's your cover. And

564
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
fade back down. There's your cover. And
 

565
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,550
fade back down. There's your cover. And
you'd have to see if it gets runners, if

566
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
you'd have to see if it gets runners, if
 

567
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,710
you'd have to see if it gets runners, if
not relief. Same story on silver. Silver

568
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720
not relief. Same story on silver. Silver
 

569
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,310
not relief. Same story on silver. Silver
was actually a better trade. All right,

570
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320
was actually a better trade. All right,
 

571
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,150
was actually a better trade. All right,
there's the pop back up which been faded

572
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
there's the pop back up which been faded
 

573
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,990
there's the pop back up which been faded
and they did it. All right, so there's

574
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
and they did it. All right, so there's
 

575
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,389
and they did it. All right, so there's
the bounce which you fade and there's

576
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
the bounce which you fade and there's
 

577
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,069
the bounce which you fade and there's
the undercut and then you'd be covering

578
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
the undercut and then you'd be covering
 

579
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,990
the undercut and then you'd be covering
there and you just be runners now cuz if

580
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
there and you just be runners now cuz if
 

581
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,430
there and you just be runners now cuz if
they reclaim this then they're going to

582
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
they reclaim this then they're going to
 

583
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,750
they reclaim this then they're going to
come back up here. Uh BTC we can go over

584
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
come back up here. Uh BTC we can go over
 

585
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,590
come back up here. Uh BTC we can go over
quickly. We talked about this. We have

586
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
quickly. We talked about this. We have
 

587
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,949
quickly. We talked about this. We have
talked about this extensively. I kept

588
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:50,959
talked about this extensively. I kept
 

589
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,389
talked about this extensively. I kept
warning you guys do not be long.

590
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,399
warning you guys do not be long.
 

591
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,829
warning you guys do not be long.
Everyone trying to long up here is just

592
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
Everyone trying to long up here is just
 

593
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,990
Everyone trying to long up here is just
like it doesn't make sense based on

594
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
like it doesn't make sense based on
 

595
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,230
like it doesn't make sense based on
history. All right, big wash last night.

596
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
history. All right, big wash last night.
 

597
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,550
history. All right, big wash last night.
I have got long some I bet. I will be

598
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
I have got long some I bet. I will be
 

599
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,990
I have got long some I bet. I will be
honest with you. I'm long just for a

600
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,000
honest with you. I'm long just for a
 

601
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,990
honest with you. I'm long just for a
relief, not a long-term hold. I don't

602
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,000
relief, not a long-term hold. I don't
 

603
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,389
relief, not a long-term hold. I don't
think this is necessarily the long-term

604
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:06,399
think this is necessarily the long-term
 

605
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,550
think this is necessarily the long-term
hold point. I think this is, you know,

606
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
hold point. I think this is, you know,
 

607
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,269
hold point. I think this is, you know,
measured move drift back up into here

608
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:11,279
measured move drift back up into here
 

609
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,189
measured move drift back up into here

Amazing strength in Apple. Starting to
 

623
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,750
Amazing strength in Apple. Starting to
build out here though. These are always

624
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:31,760
build out here though. These are always
 

625
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,189
build out here though. These are always
dangerous. If they don't break a new

626
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,199
dangerous. If they don't break a new
 

627
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,110
dangerous. If they don't break a new
high soon, then we will expect this. So,

628
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,120
high soon, then we will expect this. So,
 

629
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,629
high soon, then we will expect this. So,
we want to be careful, especially if the

we want to be careful, especially if the
 

631
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,990
we want to be careful, especially if the
market stays weak. If the market starts

632
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
market stays weak. If the market starts
 

633
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,350
market stays weak. If the market starts
to rally, we might see a resqueeze.

634
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
to rally, we might see a resqueeze.
 

635
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,230

701
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,949
still breaking down. I've got a feeler
on this. Uh just want to see if we come

702
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
on this. Uh just want to see if we come
 

703
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,230
on this. Uh just want to see if we come
back in here. This would be the look

704
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240
back in here. This would be the look
 

705
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,630
back in here. This would be the look
below and fail, but we we will see. This

706
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:10,640

707
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,870

is quite a way off the highs now, right?

708
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:12,880
is quite a way off the highs now, right?
 

709
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,309
is quite a way off the highs now, right?
We've already filled in this gap, which

710
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:14,319
We've already filled in this gap, which
 

711
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,669
We've already filled in this gap, which
is what I was looking for. So, I have

712
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:15,679
is what I was looking for. So, I have
 

713
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,909
is what I was looking for. So, I have
got a feeler long and this a swing long

714
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:17,919
got a feeler long and this a swing long
 

715
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,510
got a feeler long and this a swing long
feeler on this. looking for a reprice

716
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,520
feeler on this. looking for a reprice
 

717
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,510
feeler on this. looking for a reprice
towards 40s and I'll probably lock in

718
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:21,520
towards 40s and I'll probably lock in
 

719
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,230
towards 40s and I'll probably lock in
there because that is possible at 40s.

720
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
there because that is possible at 40s.
 

721
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,590
there because that is possible at 40s.
So, I'll probably lock in most of it

00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:25,600
So, I'll probably lock in most of it
 

723
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,029
So, I'll probably lock in most of it
there. And if we start to do this,

724
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:27,039
there. And if we start to do this,
 

725
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,630
there. And if we start to do this,
great. This is going to be this is a

If they start losing that shelf, then

744
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:46,480
If they start losing that shelf, then
 

745
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,669
If they start losing that shelf, then
we're going to probably have a new leg

746
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:47,679
we're going to probably have a new leg
 

747
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,510
we're going to probably have a new leg
down in the cues because that is the one

748
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,520
down in the cues because that is the one
 

749
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,590
down in the cues because that is the one
thing holding up. Okay. If we start

750
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
thing holding up. Okay. If we start
 

751
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,470
thing holding up. Okay. If we start
losing that, I'd be watch out time. In

752
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
losing that, I'd be watch out time. In
 

753
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,270
losing that, I'd be watch out time. In
fact, you know what? It's that

00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,280
fact, you know what? It's that
 

755
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,070
fact, you know what? It's that
important. Let's set a price alert. That

range to have any real strength. All
right, so same thing. There's just sort

766
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,160
right, so same thing. There's just sort
 

767
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,270
right, so same thing. There's just sort
of W. Can it bid above 400? If so, it's

768
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,280
of W. Can it bid above 400? If so, it's
 

769
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,630
of W. Can it bid above 400? If so, it's
looking to get into these sort of tens

770
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:16,640
looking to get into these sort of tens
 

771
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,230
looking to get into these sort of tens
and 15s. Acceptance back through that

772
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
and 15s. Acceptance back through that
 

773
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,590
and 15s. Acceptance back through that
and we can go back upside again.

774
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600
and we can go back upside again.

stuck. Same kind of thing we look at all
 

779
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,909

the time, right? Uh Oracle, I did start

780
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
the time, right? Uh Oracle, I did start
 

781
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,990
the time, right? Uh Oracle, I did start
a long last night, all right, on a

782
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,000
a long last night, all right, on a
 

783
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,190
a long last night, all right, on a
relief uh a tiny tiny tiny bit because

784
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
relief uh a tiny tiny tiny bit because
 

785
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,549
relief uh a tiny tiny tiny bit because
it's very high risk because it's got a

786
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:32,559
it's very high risk because it's got a
 

787
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,070
it's very high risk because it's got a
lot of debt that they might have to

788
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
lot of debt that they might have to
 

789
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,909
lot of debt that they might have to
raise. Uh but I do think this is

790
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:35,919
raise. Uh but I do think this is
 

791
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,510
raise. Uh but I do think this is
overextended now at this point. All

792
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:37,520
overextended now at this point. All
 

793
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,909
overextended now at this point. All
right, we filled the gap uh off this

794
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:39,919
right, we filled the gap uh off this
 

795
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,230
right, we filled the gap uh off this
high. We're down a huge amount, right?

796
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
high. We're down a huge amount, right?
 

797
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,630
high. We're down a huge amount, right?

00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,310
of retest towards uh previous day point
of control maybe even previous day value

Ninja Trader is Let's make sure this is

00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,200
Ninja Trader is Let's make sure this is

Oh, these are all wrong. I adjust all of

896
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
Oh, these are all wrong. I adjust all of
 

897
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,350
Oh, these are all wrong. I adjust all of
these. Give me a second. There we go.

898
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,360
these. Give me a second. There we go.
 

899
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,029
these. Give me a second. There we go.
That was all wrong. So, looking to see

900
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039
That was all wrong. So, looking to see
 

901
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,590
That was all wrong. So, looking to see
if we come into 50s for a bid at the

902
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600
if we come into 50s for a bid at the
 

903
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,190
if we come into 50s for a bid at the
moment. They're protecting that old gap.

904
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,200
moment. They're protecting that old gap.
 

905
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,190
moment. They're protecting that old gap.
Remember that old gap? We just protected

906
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,200
Remember that old gap? We just protected
 

907
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,190
Remember that old gap? We just protected
it.

908
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200
it.
 

909
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,870
it.
So, they can resqueeze above previous

910
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
So, they can resqueeze above previous
 

911
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,149
So, they can resqueeze above previous
day value area high if they want and

912
00:20:58,149 --> 00:20:58,159
day value area high if they want and
 

913
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,669
day value area high if they want and
kind of clear all this out. This is

914
00:20:59,669 --> 00:20:59,679
kind of clear all this out. This is
 

915
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,590
kind of clear all this out. This is
where I'd much feel much better about

916
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
where I'd much feel much better about
 

917
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,310
where I'd much feel much better about
bidding. If I was going to bid up today,

918
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
bidding. If I was going to bid up today,
 

919
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,149
bidding. If I was going to bid up today,
I'd rather we tested this naked level

920
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:06,159
I'd rather we tested this naked level
 

921
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,470
I'd rather we tested this naked level
and bid up or even down here and bid up

922
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:08,480
and bid up or even down here and bid up
 

923
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,909
and bid up or even down here and bid up
off that. That would be much much

924
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:09,919
off that. That would be much much
 

925
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,510
off that. That would be much much
better. Remember, the main trend is

926
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
better. Remember, the main trend is
 

927
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,190
better. Remember, the main trend is
lower. So, we want to be very careful.

928
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,200
lower. So, we want to be very careful.
 

929
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,270
lower. So, we want to be very careful.
We don't really want to buy value area

930
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:15,280
We don't really want to buy value area
 

931
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,190
We don't really want to buy value area
high from yesterday. It' be much better

932
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
high from yesterday. It' be much better
 

933
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,310
high from yesterday. It' be much better
if we can drift lower first. But we will

934
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,320
if we can drift lower first. But we will
 

935
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,630
if we can drift lower first. But we will
see, folks. We will see. They might just

936
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,640
see, folks. We will see. They might just
 

937
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,630
see, folks. We will see. They might just
uh set a squeeze and go. We'll see.

938
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:26,640
uh set a squeeze and go. We'll see.
 

939
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,230
uh set a squeeze and go. We'll see.
Zoom in on some of these. I didn't get

940
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,240
Zoom in on some of these. I didn't get
 

941
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,669
Zoom in on some of these. I didn't get
to go through VIX, did I? Sorry about

942
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:29,679
to go through VIX, did I? Sorry about
 

943
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,669
to go through VIX, did I? Sorry about
that. VIX is just basing around the 20s

944
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:31,679
that. VIX is just basing around the 20s
 

945
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,149
that. VIX is just basing around the 20s
right now. VIX just basing right back to

946
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:34,159
right now. VIX just basing right back to
 

947
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,750
right now. VIX just basing right back to
previous day value high here. Do they

948
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
previous day value high here. Do they
 

949
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,430
previous day value high here. Do they
find acceptance back through or not is

950
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:37,440
find acceptance back through or not is
 

951
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,870
find acceptance back through or not is
the question. If they do, then

952
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
the question. If they do, then
 

953
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,270
the question. If they do, then
potentially there is a squeeze on uh

954
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:41,280
potentially there is a squeeze on uh
 

955
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,029
potentially there is a squeeze on uh
back to take out these overnight highs,

956
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039
back to take out these overnight highs,
 

957
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:50,230
back to take out these overnight highs,
but it's not the best location.

958
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,240

 

959
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,990

Nice. I bet up 6%. Let's [\h__\h] go.

960
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000

 

961
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,149

Nice. these relief rallies starting to

962
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:58,159
Nice. these relief rallies starting to
 

963
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,029
Nice. these relief rallies starting to
take place today which is what we expect

964
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:01,039
take place today which is what we expect
 

965
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,750
take place today which is what we expect
right after a big big sell days is what

966
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:03,760
right after a big big sell days is what
 

967
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,669
right after a big big sell days is what
we expect. We expect some relief in the

968
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:05,679
we expect. We expect some relief in the
 

969
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:14,950
we expect. We expect some relief in the
market.

970
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:14,960

 

971
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,110

All right, let's see folks. Let's see.

972
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,120
All right, let's see folks. Let's see.
 

973
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,789
All right, let's see folks. Let's see.
And we come to this previous day point

974
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:20,799
And we come to this previous day point
 

975
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,350
And we come to this previous day point
of control. Can we get down there and

976
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
of control. Can we get down there and
 

977
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,590
of control. Can we get down there and
trap some people? His favorite. Can we

978
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:25,600
trap some people? His favorite. Can we
 

979
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,149
trap some people? His favorite. Can we
trap some people down there?

980
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159

 

981
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,390

Come on. Come down for us. Come down for

982
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
Come on. Come down for us. Come down for
 

983
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,310
Come on. Come down for us. Come down for
us. Let's get some vol here as well.

984
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,320

 

985
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,310

There we go. So, into that gap. I really

986
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:42,320
There we go. So, into that gap. I really
 

987
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,909
There we go. So, into that gap. I really
want to get this blue box if possible.

988
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:43,919
want to get this blue box if possible.
 

989
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,270
want to get this blue box if possible.
If they're going to be very kind, that's

990
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,280
If they're going to be very kind, that's
 

991
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,470
If they're going to be very kind, that's
where I'd like to go. I'd like to get

992
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,480
where I'd like to go. I'd like to get
 

993
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:54,470
where I'd like to go. I'd like to get
down into that blue box.

994
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480

 

995
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,070

already squeezing then right watching

996
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,080
already squeezing then right watching
 

997
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,590
already squeezing then right watching
this now for a trigger long through all

998
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:57,600
this now for a trigger long through all
 

999
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,830
this now for a trigger long through all
of this. Let's see if they're going to

1000
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840
of this. Let's see if they're going to
 

1001
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,710
of this. Let's see if they're going to
do it. Here we go. Here we go. So long

1002
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:02,720
do it. Here we go. Here we go. So long
 

1003
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,390
do it. Here we go. Here we go. So long
in this now for this squeeze back up for

1004
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
in this now for this squeeze back up for
 

1005
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,070
in this now for this squeeze back up for
this imbalance. Oh my god. This is too

1006
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,080
this imbalance. Oh my god. This is too
 

1007
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,070
this imbalance. Oh my god. This is too
much money. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my

1008
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,080
much money. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my
 

1009
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,190
much money. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my
god. Lock it. Locking some in. Jesus.

1010
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
god. Lock it. Locking some in. Jesus.
 

1011
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,870
god. Lock it. Locking some in. Jesus.
I'm getting too rich here. Stop. Stop.

1012
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:14,880
I'm getting too rich here. Stop. Stop.
 

1013
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,470
I'm getting too rich here. Stop. Stop.
Stop. Stop. Stop. There we go. All

1014
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
Stop. Stop. Stop. There we go. All
 

1015
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,990
Stop. Stop. Stop. There we go. All
right.

1016
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,000

 

1017
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,430

Too rich too quick. All right.

1018
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,440
Too rich too quick. All right.
 

1019
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,029
Too rich too quick. All right.
There was the trap. I would have much

1020
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:25,039
There was the trap. I would have much
 

1021
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,710
There was the trap. I would have much
rather that trap happened down here, but

1022
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:26,720
rather that trap happened down here, but
 

1023
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,470
rather that trap happened down here, but
they trapped into here. Reclaimed value

1024
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
they trapped into here. Reclaimed value
 

1025
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,710
they trapped into here. Reclaimed value
and up we go into here. Trimming some

1026
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:30,720
and up we go into here. Trimming some
 

1027
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,310
and up we go into here. Trimming some
off now. Had to trim some because I

1028
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,320
off now. Had to trim some because I
 

1029
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,149
off now. Had to trim some because I
sized, started adding into that

1030
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:34,159
sized, started adding into that
 

1031
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,669
sized, started adding into that
aggressively. And we see if we take out

1032
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679
aggressively. And we see if we take out
 

1033
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,270
aggressively. And we see if we take out
this high now and through that we have

1034
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:37,280
this high now and through that we have
 

1035
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,270
this high now and through that we have
this uh node here. So we'll be trimming

1036
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,280
this uh node here. So we'll be trimming
 

1037
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,830
this uh node here. So we'll be trimming
some into here. So it wasn't ideal.

1038
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:41,840
some into here. So it wasn't ideal.
 

1039
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,590
some into here. So it wasn't ideal.
Ideal would have been into this and then

1040
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:43,600
Ideal would have been into this and then
 

1041
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,430
Ideal would have been into this and then
do it. But we trapped here. Squeeze

1042
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
do it. But we trapped here. Squeeze
 

1043
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,430
do it. But we trapped here. Squeeze
through this into this. This is your

1044
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:47,440
through this into this. This is your
 

1045
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,029
through this into this. This is your
next block. So we're selling into here.

1046
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:49,039
next block. So we're selling into here.
 

1047
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,590
next block. So we're selling into here.
Watch this volume here, folks.

1048
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:51,600
Watch this volume here, folks.
 

1049
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,350
Watch this volume here, folks.
and we'll see the trap again. The same

1050
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,360
and we'll see the trap again. The same
 

1051
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,870
and we'll see the trap again. The same
play that we've had the last two days in

1052
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:54,880
play that we've had the last two days in
 

1053
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,750
play that we've had the last two days in
a row. Same play we've had the last two

1054
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
a row. Same play we've had the last two
 

1055
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,830
a row. Same play we've had the last two
days in a row. And this gray box above

1056
00:23:59,830 --> 00:23:59,840
days in a row. And this gray box above
 

1057
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,830
days in a row. And this gray box above
is where we're going into now. The edge

1058
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:01,840
is where we're going into now. The edge
 

1059
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,470
is where we're going into now. The edge
of this we're starting to trade into now

1060
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:04,480
of this we're starting to trade into now
 

1061
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,870
of this we're starting to trade into now
74s is going to be key. It's a big node

1062
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:06,880
74s is going to be key. It's a big node
 

1063
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,710
74s is going to be key. It's a big node
from the developing week. If we get

1064
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:08,720
from the developing week. If we get
 

1065
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,950
from the developing week. If we get
through that, then we can hit 963s

1066
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:10,960
through that, then we can hit 963s
 

1067
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,110
through that, then we can hit 963s
today. So, this is a huge node of the

1068
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,120
today. So, this is a huge node of the
 

1069
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,310
today. So, this is a huge node of the
developing week. So, you want to be

1070
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:14,320
developing week. So, you want to be
 

1071
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,230
developing week. So, you want to be
taking a big chunk of yours off into

1072
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:16,240
taking a big chunk of yours off into
 

1073
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,830
taking a big chunk of yours off into
this gray box. Here we go. Still

1074
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:17,840
this gray box. Here we go. Still
 

1075
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,070
this gray box. Here we go. Still
lifting. Still lifting. Next imbalance

1076
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,080
lifting. Still lifting. Next imbalance
 

1077
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,070
lifting. Still lifting. Next imbalance
is 910. So we've just filled a lot. You

1078
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,080
is 910. So we've just filled a lot. You
 

1079
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,510
is 910. So we've just filled a lot. You
do not want to be adding up here now.

1080
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:23,520
do not want to be adding up here now.
 

1081
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,590
do not want to be adding up here now.
Okay, this is a big squeeze. Look at

1082
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,600
Okay, this is a big squeeze. Look at
 

1083
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,390
Okay, this is a big squeeze. Look at
this. This is a 180 point squeeze here.

1084
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,400
this. This is a 180 point squeeze here.
 

1085
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,470
this. This is a 180 point squeeze here.
And we joined in probably from a little

1086
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:30,480
And we joined in probably from a little
 

1087
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,310
And we joined in probably from a little
bit around here 70. So we've got a good

1088
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,320
bit around here 70. So we've got a good
 

1089
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,950
bit around here 70. So we've got a good
100 points out of that straight away.

1090
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:34,960
100 points out of that straight away.
 

1091
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:42,070
100 points out of that straight away.
Alex made too much money. [\h__\h] hell.

1092
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080

 

1093
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,750

Alex made too much money there. I had to

1094
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:43,760
Alex made too much money there. I had to
 

1095
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,149
Alex made too much money there. I had to
join a little bit late, but it was so

1096
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:46,159
join a little bit late, but it was so
 

1097
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,310
join a little bit late, but it was so
aggressive on that rip through. It was

1098
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,320
aggressive on that rip through. It was
 

1099
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,710
aggressive on that rip through. It was
insane. So, I'll show you what I saw.

1100
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:50,720
insane. So, I'll show you what I saw.
 

1101
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,549
insane. So, I'll show you what I saw.
Look at this. Mr. Seller at the lows

1102
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:52,559
Look at this. Mr. Seller at the lows
 

1103
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,070
Look at this. Mr. Seller at the lows
getting stuck. Who'd have guessed? All

1104
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
getting stuck. Who'd have guessed? All
 

1105
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,750
getting stuck. Who'd have guessed? All
right. Same thing as yesterday at these

1106
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:55,760
right. Same thing as yesterday at these
 

1107
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,430
right. Same thing as yesterday at these
lows in this imbalance. They came flying

1108
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,440
lows in this imbalance. They came flying
 

1109
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,590
lows in this imbalance. They came flying
in and we turned around and then we went

1110
00:24:59,590 --> 00:24:59,600
in and we turned around and then we went
 

1111
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,350
in and we turned around and then we went
straight through value. Buyers stepped

1112
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,360
straight through value. Buyers stepped
 

1113
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,830
straight through value. Buyers stepped
in and then we've just absolutely ripped

1114
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:03,840
in and then we've just absolutely ripped
 

1115
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,830
in and then we've just absolutely ripped
faces filling all these old imbalances.

1116
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:05,840
faces filling all these old imbalances.
 

1117
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,909
faces filling all these old imbalances.
All right. So, the main move that I

1118
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:07,919
All right. So, the main move that I
 

1119
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,310
All right. So, the main move that I
wanted has happened in the opening what,

1120
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,320
wanted has happened in the opening what,
 

1121
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,029
wanted has happened in the opening what,
two, three, four minutes. Just wait now.

1122
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:13,039
two, three, four minutes. Just wait now.
 

1123
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,789
two, three, four minutes. Just wait now.
Be very careful of this shelf now. Okay.

1124
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:14,799
Be very careful of this shelf now. Okay.
 

1125
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,390
Be very careful of this shelf now. Okay.
If you're holding longs, if we lose this

1126
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:16,400
If you're holding longs, if we lose this
 

1127
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,590
If you're holding longs, if we lose this
shelf, you know what happens? We're

1128
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:17,600
shelf, you know what happens? We're
 

1129
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,549
shelf, you know what happens? We're
thin. we come right back down. So if we

1130
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:20,559
thin. we come right back down. So if we
 

1131
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,310
thin. we come right back down. So if we
lose this shelf on a retest, I will not

1132
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,320
lose this shelf on a retest, I will not
 

1133
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,830
lose this shelf on a retest, I will not
be trading this short up here. But if

1134
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:23,840
be trading this short up here. But if
 

1135
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,750
be trading this short up here. But if
you lose this shelf on a retest, this is

1136
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:25,760
you lose this shelf on a retest, this is
 

1137
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,830
you lose this shelf on a retest, this is
probable because this is very thin,

1138
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:27,840
probable because this is very thin,
 

1139
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,750
probable because this is very thin,
right? The other option is they do a

1140
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:29,760
right? The other option is they do a
 

1141
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,830
right? The other option is they do a
naughty and complete this move up into

1142
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:31,840
naughty and complete this move up into
 

1143
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,830
naughty and complete this move up into
here if they want to do some sort of

1144
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:33,840
here if they want to do some sort of
 

1145
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,269
here if they want to do some sort of
retrap up at the highs.

1146
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:39,279

 

1147
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,630

What indicators are that on the chart?

1148
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:40,640
What indicators are that on the chart?
 

1149
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,070
What indicators are that on the chart?
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

1150
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,080
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
 

1151
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,750
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
Okay, I'm not going to answer these

1152
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:43,760
Okay, I'm not going to answer these
 

1153
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,990
Okay, I'm not going to answer these
anymore. This is why I set up Nightbot.

1154
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,000
anymore. This is why I set up Nightbot.
 

1155
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,190
anymore. This is why I set up Nightbot.
Nightbot will tell you what all the

1156
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,200
Nightbot will tell you what all the
 

1157
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,430
Nightbot will tell you what all the
indicators are. Okay, Alex cannot keep

1158
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:49,440
indicators are. Okay, Alex cannot keep
 

1159
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,789
indicators are. Okay, Alex cannot keep
answering the same questions every day

1160
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:50,799
answering the same questions every day
 

1161
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,190
answering the same questions every day
100 times. I'm very patient to do it,

1162
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,200
100 times. I'm very patient to do it,
 

1163
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,710
100 times. I'm very patient to do it,
but just read in chat. All right,

1164
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:54,720
but just read in chat. All right,
 

1165
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,990
but just read in chat. All right,
Nightbot is telling you what's there.

1166
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,000
Nightbot is telling you what's there.
 

1167
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,830
Nightbot is telling you what's there.
Let us know when you take a trade. I I

1168
00:25:59,830 --> 00:25:59,840
Let us know when you take a trade. I I
 

1169
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,710
Let us know when you take a trade. I I
did I told you I made it very clear.

1170
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:02,720
did I told you I made it very clear.
 

1171
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,470
did I told you I made it very clear.
I'll be looking for a trap down here and

1172
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,480
I'll be looking for a trap down here and
 

1173
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,029
I'll be looking for a trap down here and
a reclaim of previous day value can

1174
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:07,039
a reclaim of previous day value can
 

1175
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,950
a reclaim of previous day value can
cause a squeeze. So, guess where I got

1176
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:08,960
cause a squeeze. So, guess where I got
 

1177
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,510
cause a squeeze. So, guess where I got
long. I told you. What do you want me to

1178
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:11,520
long. I told you. What do you want me to
 

1179
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,070
long. I told you. What do you want me to
do? Like I say all the time, I'll show

1180
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,080
do? Like I say all the time, I'll show
 

1181
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,269
do? Like I say all the time, I'll show
you where the toilet is. I'm not going

1182
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:15,279
you where the toilet is. I'm not going
 

1183
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:27,990
you where the toilet is. I'm not going
to hold your dick for you.

1184
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000

 

1185
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,430

At least tell you where you're taking a

1186
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:29,440
At least tell you where you're taking a
 

1187
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,789
At least tell you where you're taking a
trade. I don't know what is wrong with

1188
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:30,799
trade. I don't know what is wrong with
 

1189
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,230
trade. I don't know what is wrong with
you guys. You must have just joined the

1190
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:32,240
you guys. You must have just joined the
 

1191
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,870
you guys. You must have just joined the
channel for the first time. I made it so

1192
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:34,880
channel for the first time. I made it so
 

1193
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,029
channel for the first time. I made it so
clear, right? My preference for a long

1194
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039
clear, right? My preference for a long
 

1195
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,630
clear, right? My preference for a long
would have been down here. But we

1196
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:38,640
would have been down here. But we
 

1197
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,390
would have been down here. But we
trapped on this old gap. If you were

1198
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:40,400
trapped on this old gap. If you were
 

1199
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,510
trapped on this old gap. If you were
here yesterday, you would have known

1200
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:41,520
here yesterday, you would have known
 

1201
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,870
here yesterday, you would have known
that this is a gap. All right? We

1202
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:42,880
that this is a gap. All right? We
 

1203
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,950
that this is a gap. All right? We
trapped in this gap. We found a bid. We

1204
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:44,960
trapped in this gap. We found a bid. We
 

1205
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,470
trapped in this gap. We found a bid. We
saw sellers trapped. I've talked about

1206
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:46,480
saw sellers trapped. I've talked about
 

1207
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,230
saw sellers trapped. I've talked about
it. Sellers got trapped. I'll wait for

1208
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:48,240
it. Sellers got trapped. I'll wait for
 

1209
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,070
it. Sellers got trapped. I'll wait for
the reclaim. There's the reclaim of New

1210
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,080
the reclaim. There's the reclaim of New
 

1211
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,830
the reclaim. There's the reclaim of New
York open and previous day value high.

1212
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:51,840
York open and previous day value high.
 

1213
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,430
York open and previous day value high.
There was my trigger long. I'm long and

1214
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:53,440
There was my trigger long. I'm long and
 

1215
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,110
There was my trigger long. I'm long and
I'm selling into these gray boxes. All

1216
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,120
I'm selling into these gray boxes. All
 

1217
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,510
I'm selling into these gray boxes. All
right. If you are new here, you need to

1218
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:57,520
right. If you are new here, you need to
 

1219
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,470
right. If you are new here, you need to

1241
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,029
I'm telling you much more important
levels than that. All right. Still

1242
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:27,039
levels than that. All right. Still
 

1243
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,149
levels than that. All right. Still
holding this. Still have this level here

1244
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:30,159
holding this. Still have this level here
 

1245
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,990
holding this. Still have this level here
which we can go and fill. This is the

1246
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,000
which we can go and fill. This is the
 

1247
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,230
which we can go and fill. This is the
huge level. Remember, of the developing

1248
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:34,240
huge level. Remember, of the developing
 

1249
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,549
huge level. Remember, of the developing
weekly profile, if we start to hold bids

1250
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:36,559
weekly profile, if we start to hold bids
 

1251
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,390
weekly profile, if we start to hold bids
above this, we can start to get

1252
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:38,400
above this, we can start to get
 

1253
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,669
above this, we can start to get
aggressive. All right? We're talking

1254
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:39,679
aggressive. All right? We're talking
 

1255
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,950
aggressive. All right? We're talking
about this here. This node here is where

1256
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:42,960
about this here. This node here is where
 

1257
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,190
about this here. This node here is where
we've just traded into. If we hold above

1258
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,200
we've just traded into. If we hold above
 

1259
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,549
we've just traded into. If we hold above
this, we can run the stops into 9 950s.

1260
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:50,559
this, we can run the stops into 9 950s.
 

1261
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,789
this, we can run the stops into 9 950s.
All right. Into here. We have an old

1262
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:52,799
All right. Into here. We have an old
 

1263
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,990
All right. Into here. We have an old
point of control, I believe, untested.

1264
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,000
point of control, I believe, untested.
 

1265
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,110
point of control, I believe, untested.
And this guy here, 25162s,

And this guy here, 25162s,
PC now for the developing week has

1268
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:01,039
PC now for the developing week has
 

1269
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,710
PC now for the developing week has
shifted lower, which is one thing. So,

1270
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:02,720
shifted lower, which is one thing. So,
 

1271
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,710
shifted lower, which is one thing. So,
we've just shifted PC here for the

1272

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,789
we've just shifted PC here for the
developing week. So, this is fair value

1274
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:06,799
developing week. So, this is fair value
 

1275
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,470
developing week. So, this is fair value
since Sunday now. All right. And we're

1276
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:08,480
since Sunday now. All right. And we're
 

1277
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,710
since Sunday now. All right. And we're
holding bids above fair value since

1278
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:10,720
holding bids above fair value since
 

1279
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,669
holding bids above fair value since
Sunday and driving higher. Here you go.

So, let's see if they find acceptance
now.

1286
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:21,679

Ninja Trader right here.

1372
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:13,440
Ninja Trader right here.

Ninja Trader right here.
This is where the short got trapped this

1374
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:14,960
This is where the short got trapped this
 

1375
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,269
This is where the short got trapped this
morning. He got trapped at 14s. And then

1376
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,279
morning. He got trapped at 14s. And then
 

1377
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,669
morning. He got trapped at 14s. And then
the next level here is 46s. So all the

1378
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:19,679
the next level here is 46s. So all the
 

1379
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,070
the next level here is 46s. So all the
time we're above 46s that this big

1380
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,080
time we're above 46s that this big
 

1381
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,430
time we're above 46s that this big
player here is caught offside.

1382
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:25,440
player here is caught offside.
 

1383
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,710
player here is caught offside.
All right, so we're going to go from one

1384
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:26,720
All right, so we're going to go from one
 

1385
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,230
All right, so we're going to go from one
node to the other node. Like I said, you

1386
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,240
node to the other node. Like I said, you
 

1387
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,430
node to the other node. Like I said, you
want to be very careful here into the

1388
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:29,440
want to be very careful here into the
 

1389
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,350
want to be very careful here into the
900. So, we've just developed more here.

1390
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:31,360
900. So, we've just developed more here.
 

1391
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,269
900. So, we've just developed more here.
I'm going to put another gray box in

1392
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:33,279
I'm going to put another gray box in
 

1393
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,350
I'm going to put another gray box in
inside here. We're still bullish on this

1394
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:35,360
inside here. We're still bullish on this
 

1395
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,269
inside here. We're still bullish on this
squeeze. So, all the time we're holding

1396
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:37,279
squeeze. So, all the time we're holding
 

1397
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,830
squeeze. So, all the time we're holding
above this node. This is your rotation

1398
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:39,840
above this node. This is your rotation
 

1399
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,590
above this node. This is your rotation
right now between this node and this

1400
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:41,600
right now between this node and this
 

1401
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,269
right now between this node and this
node. If we find acceptance, they will

1402
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:43,279
node. If we find acceptance, they will
 

1403
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,350
node. If we find acceptance, they will
come for up here now. So, dips are

1404
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,360
come for up here now. So, dips are
 

1405
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,470
come for up here now. So, dips are
holding. There's your higher time frame

1406
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:46,480
holding. There's your higher time frame
 

1407
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,110
holding. There's your higher time frame
algo hold. Pretty positive there. If we

1408
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,120
algo hold. Pretty positive there. If we
 

1409
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,029
algo hold. Pretty positive there. If we
come up here, 960. And then we can think

1410
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:51,039
come up here, 960. And then we can think
 

1411
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,590
come up here, 960. And then we can think
about 25K. Be very, very careful if we

1412
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:53,600
about 25K. Be very, very careful if we
 

1413
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,430
about 25K. Be very, very careful if we
lift into 25K. I'm just going to check

1414
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:55,440
lift into 25K. I'm just going to check
 

1415
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,590
lift into 25K. I'm just going to check
the ETFs here while I'm watching. Right,

1416
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:57,600
the ETFs here while I'm watching. Right,
 

1417
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,750
the ETFs here while I'm watching. Right,
Q's getting very close to previous day

1418
00:30:59,750 --> 00:30:59,760
Q's getting very close to previous day
 

1419
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,230
Q's getting very close to previous day
high here. Be very careful here. Q's

1420
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:02,240
high here. Be very careful here. Q's
 

1421
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,710
high here. Be very careful here. Q's
going rip faces at 60480s. There will be

1422
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:04,720
going rip faces at 60480s. There will be
 

1423
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,789
going rip faces at 60480s. There will be
a stop hunt there. Is ES already done

1424
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:06,799
a stop hunt there. Is ES already done
 

1425
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,230
a stop hunt there. Is ES already done
it? Spiders have already done it.

1426
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,240
it? Spiders have already done it.
 

1427
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,549
it? Spiders have already done it.
Where's ES? ES not there yet. Right. So,

1428
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:10,559
Where's ES? ES not there yet. Right. So,
 

1429
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,470
Where's ES? ES not there yet. Right. So,
ETFs already coming up to previous day

1430
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:12,480
ETFs already coming up to previous day
 

1431
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,549
ETFs already coming up to previous day
high. VIX coming down to previous day

1432
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:14,559
high. VIX coming down to previous day
 

1433
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,870
high. VIX coming down to previous day
low. So, we are in a trimming position

1434
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:16,880
low. So, we are in a trimming position
 

1435
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,190
low. So, we are in a trimming position
here as in we're in a lock some profit

1436
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,200
here as in we're in a lock some profit
 

1437
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,230
here as in we're in a lock some profit
in position here on the ETFs especially.

1438
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:22,240
in position here on the ETFs especially.
 

1439
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,669
in position here on the ETFs especially.
Right. especially.

1440
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:25,679

 

1441
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,510

Let's have a quick look at Finnbiz here.

1442
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:27,520
Let's have a quick look at Finnbiz here.
 

1443
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,870
Let's have a quick look at Finnbiz here.
Let's have a look at the broader market.

1444
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:28,880
Let's have a look at the broader market.
 

1445
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,630
Let's have a look at the broader market.
All right, if you lose this, this level

1446
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:30,640
All right, if you lose this, this level
 

1447
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,230
All right, if you lose this, this level
here is key for bulls to hold. Right,

1448
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:32,240
here is key for bulls to hold. Right,
 

1449
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,070
here is key for bulls to hold. Right,
there's your PC on the day developing

1450
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,080
there's your PC on the day developing
 

1451
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,470
there's your PC on the day developing
PC. This level here, bulls must hold

1452
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:36,480
PC. This level here, bulls must hold
 

1453
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,669
PC. This level here, bulls must hold
this if they're going to complete this.

1454
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:37,679
this if they're going to complete this.
 

1455
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,830
this if they're going to complete this.
If they lose this, all right, then this

1456
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:39,840
If they lose this, all right, then this
 

1457
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,950
If they lose this, all right, then this
rotation here will happen. Oh, but he

1458
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:42,960
rotation here will happen. Oh, but he
 

1459
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,549
rotation here will happen. Oh, but he
doesn't tell me what to do. I literally

1460
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:44,559
doesn't tell me what to do. I literally
 

1461
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,149
doesn't tell me what to do. I literally
have just told you right now what I'd be

have just told you right now what I'd be
 

1463
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,909
have just told you right now what I'd be
looking at, right? I'm done with that

1464
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:47,919
looking at, right? I'm done with that
 

1465
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,789
looking at, right? I'm done with that
long now. Can always re-enter if I like

1466
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:50,799
long now. Can always re-enter if I like
 

1467

today? Why are you giving me a uh

1470
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:58,640

 

1471
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,190

see anything yet? Channel is so bad. All

1472
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,200
see anything yet? Channel is so bad. All
 

1473
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,110
see anything yet? Channel is so bad. All
right, back into this node. All right,

1474
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,120
right, back into this node. All right,
 

1475
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,350
right, back into this node. All right,
and VWOP. So, this is your overunder now

1476
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:05,360
and VWOP. So, this is your overunder now
 

1477
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,110
and VWOP. So, this is your overunder now
for sentiment for the day. Like we

1478
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,120
for sentiment for the day. Like we
 

1479
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,070
for sentiment for the day. Like we
talked about, if they lose this, you

1480
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,080
talked about, if they lose this, you
 

1481
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,669
talked about, if they lose this, you
will see this flush right back down to

1482
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:11,679
will see this flush right back down to
 

1483
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,590
will see this flush right back down to
here. If they do a little trap here,

1484
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:13,600
here. If they do a little trap here,
 

1485
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,110
here. If they do a little trap here,
we're going to rotate back to this high.

1486
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,120
we're going to rotate back to this high.
 

1487
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,630
we're going to rotate back to this high.
This is the rotation between here.

1488
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:16,640
This is the rotation between here.
 

1489
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,950
This is the rotation between here.
Acceptance over there, we come to 60s,

1490
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:18,960
Acceptance over there, we come to 60s,
 

1491
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,029
Acceptance over there, we come to 60s,
right? So, we will see. There is 100

1492
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:21,039
right? So, we will see. There is 100
 

1493
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:26,389
right? So, we will see. There is 100
points in here if they hold it.

1494
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:26,399

 

1495
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,990

Remember the seller got caught here at

1496
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,000
Remember the seller got caught here at
 

1497
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,789
Remember the seller got caught here at
45.

1498
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:30,799
45.
 

1499
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,389
45.
It got caught here at 45. So all the

1500
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:32,399
It got caught here at 45. So all the
 

1501
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,549
It got caught here at 45. So all the
time we're above that 45 that seller is

1502
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:34,559
time we're above that 45 that seller is
 

1503
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,509
time we're above that 45 that seller is
still stuck. If we get under 45s and

1504
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:37,519
still stuck. If we get under 45s and
 

1505
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,750
still stuck. If we get under 45s and
definitely under 30s, uh this is going

1506
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:39,760
definitely under 30s, uh this is going
 

1507
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,509
definitely under 30s, uh this is going
to get very very thin back down to 760

1508
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:43,519
to get very very thin back down to 760
 

1509
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,830
to get very very thin back down to 760
770s. Right? So if we lose this, you can

1510
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:45,840
770s. Right? So if we lose this, you can
 

1511
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,070
770s. Right? So if we lose this, you can
see we're so thin on this squeeze up

1512
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,080
see we're so thin on this squeeze up
 

1513
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,750
see we're so thin on this squeeze up
that we took. we can come right back

1514
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:49,760
that we took. we can come right back
 

1515
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,149
that we took. we can come right back
down into here. So, you do not want to

1516
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:52,159
down into here. So, you do not want to
 

1517
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,230
down into here. So, you do not want to
see this. If you're bullish, you do not

1518
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:54,240
see this. If you're bullish, you do not

Might
 

1573
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,589
Might
trim some today just to be smart.

1574
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:13,599

1579
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,109
Okay. So, held gray box well. So,
greater to great rotation. So, greater

1580
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:21,119
greater to great rotation. So, greater
 

1581
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,790
greater to great rotation. So, greater
great this rotation here starting to

1582
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:22,800
great this rotation here starting to
 

1583
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,950
great this rotation here starting to
take place. This will be a buildout of

1584
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:24,960
take place. This will be a buildout of
 

1585
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,550

liquidity. Acceptance above. They'll
 

1587
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,909
liquidity. Acceptance above. They'll
come for 65s and then 25k. And like we

1588
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:29,919
come for 65s and then 25k. And like we
 

1589
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:31,669
come for 65s and then 25k. And like we
talked about acceptance below and they

1590
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:31,679
talked about acceptance below and they
 

1591
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,430
talked about acceptance below and they
will wash this. Here we go. So, they're

1592
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:33,440
will wash this. Here we go. So, they're
 

1593
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,109
will wash this. Here we go. So, they're
holding well. Point of control. VWAP

1594
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:35,119
holding well. Point of control. VWAP
 

1595
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,349
holding well. Point of control. VWAP
held. If they do this, we will expect

1596
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:37,359
held. If they do this, we will expect
 

1597
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,669
held. If they do this, we will expect
this move here to 960s.

1598
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:39,679
this move here to 960s.
 

1599
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,990
this move here to 960s.

1609
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,629
Thursday, yesterday, that's what we're
looking at is can we run the stops up

1610
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:54,639
looking at is can we run the stops up
 

1611
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,790

Here
 

1621
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,390
Here
we go. So bids off here are holding

1622
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:08,400
we go. So bids off here are holding
 

1623
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,910
we go. So bids off here are holding
acceptance through here. Now here on

through 60s. We have room. There is a

1630
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,000
through 60s. We have room. There is a
 

1631
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,150
through 60s. We have room. There is a
low volume. 60 is a very low volume

1632

low volume. 60 is a very low volume
 

1633
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,270
low volume. 60 is a very low volume
node. All right. I'm looking at the

1634
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:23,280
node. All right. I'm looking at the
 

1635
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,190

developing week like I keep talking

1636
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,200
developing week like I keep talking
 

1637
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,390
developing week like I keep talking
about. I'm looking at this developing

1638

Where's my arrow? Mr. Arrow. Right. I'm
looking at this stop here and this low

1644
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:33,520
looking at this stop here and this low
 

1645
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,190
looking at this stop here and this low
volume node here. So, we know that this

1646
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:35,200
volume node here. So, we know that this
 

1647
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,870
volume node here. So, we know that this
is a big level. So, if we pop that, you

1648
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:36,880
is a big level. So, if we pop that, you
 

1649
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,150
is a big level. So, if we pop that, you
want to be taking some profit. If you

1650
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,160
want to be taking some profit. If you

get lucky, you'll get into this next
cluster. What's the edge of that?

1654
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:41,839
cluster. What's the edge of that?
 

1655
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,589

long or like I'd say, I'd have some wish
orders out because through this, you

1688
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:17,760
orders out because through this, you
 

1689

have wish orders out up here. So I'll be
 

1695
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,349
have wish orders out up here. So I'll be
trimming some now and having some limits

trimming some now and having some limits
 

1697
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,670
trimming some now and having some limits
just put in up here in case this from

just put in up here in case this from
 

1699
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,230
just put in up here in case this from
here you get a big boner candle and you

1700
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:30,240
here you get a big boner candle and you
 

1701
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,670
here you get a big boner candle and you
can come and fill some of you. Here we

1702
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:31,680
can come and fill some of you. Here we
 

1703
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,630
can come and fill some of you. Here we
go. So coming up for the 60s.

00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:37,440
So 50s on deck here. We got a 50 lot in
 

1707
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,310
So 50s on deck here. We got a 50 lot in
deck there and 60s we got 22s and then

1708
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:40,320
deck there and 60s we got 22s and then
 

1709
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,390
deck there and 60s we got 22s and then
975. So I'll be trimming some into this

1710
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:42,400
975. So I'll be trimming some into this
 

1711

1835
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,950
Starting to fill that 200 lot stacking
at 50s. Through that we should see a

1836
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:10,960

1837
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,310

now taking out previous day high. So

1844
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:21,440
now taking out previous day high. So
 

1845
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,270

completed that previous day high move
 

1849
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,270
completed that previous day high move
which is the 50s which is why there's a

1850
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:27,280
which is the 50s which is why there's a
 

1851
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,230
which is the 50s which is why there's a
200 lot here. So the ETFs cash have been

1852
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,240
200 lot here. So the ETFs cash have been
 

1853
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,230
200 lot here. So the ETFs cash have been
efficient. SPY is holding well over

1854
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:32,240

00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,000
that. And just be very careful here
 

1857
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,069
that. And just be very careful here
watching the QQQ.

You can see him on book lap book book
 

1863
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,390
You can see him on book lap book book
map 207 lot at 50s. Through that we

1864
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:42,400
map 207 lot at 50s. Through that we
 

1865
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,990
map 207 lot at 50s. Through that we
should see a little bit of a face

1866
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,000
should see a little bit of a face
 

1867
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:55,510
should see a little bit of a face
ripper. Come on.

1868
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:55,520

 

1869
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,430

Failing that 50. So that wall still

1870
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:57,440
Failing that 50. So that wall still
 

1871
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,950
Failing that 50. So that wall still
there. See if they bid back up to him

1872
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:58,960
there. See if they bid back up to him
 

1873
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,109
there. See if they bid back up to him
now. So still holding this light gray

1874
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:01,119
now. So still holding this light gray
 

1875
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,829
now. So still holding this light gray
box, this shelf.

1876
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:03,839
box, this shelf.
 

1877
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,910
box, this shelf.
You need to see this break the high now.

1878
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:05,920
You need to see this break the high now.
 

1879
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,190
You need to see this break the high now.
All right. So, we've just had a lot of

1880
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,200
All right. So, we've just had a lot of
 

1881
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,150
All right. So, we've just had a lot of
shorts chase. We had a 154 lot come in

1882
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,160
shorts chase. We had a 154 lot come in
 

1883
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,670
shorts chase. We had a 154 lot come in
at 40s, a 32 lot underneath him, 62 lot

1884
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:13,680
at 40s, a 32 lot underneath him, 62 lot
 

1885
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,510
at 40s, a 32 lot underneath him, 62 lot
underneath him, a 200 lot at the lows.

1886
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:15,520
underneath him, a 200 lot at the lows.
 

1887
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,150
underneath him, a 200 lot at the lows.
We should take this out now. Uh we have

1888
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:18,160
We should take this out now. Uh we have
 

1889
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,990
We should take this out now. Uh we have
had a huge amount of shorts chasing. We

1890
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,000
had a huge amount of shorts chasing. We
 

1891
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,589
had a huge amount of shorts chasing. We
have to take out the 50s now, otherwise

1892
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:21,599
have to take out the 50s now, otherwise
 

1893
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,270
have to take out the 50s now, otherwise
it's game over for these lot. Back to

1894
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:23,280
it's game over for these lot. Back to
 

1895
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,430
it's game over for these lot. Back to
this gray box again. Like I said, this

1896
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:25,440
this gray box again. Like I said, this
 

1897
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,750
this gray box again. Like I said, this
is third drive, which is why I would not

1898
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:27,760
is third drive, which is why I would not
 

1899
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,030
is third drive, which is why I would not
be adding long up here.

1900
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,040
be adding long up here.
 

1901
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,870
be adding long up here.
They're trying. If you get a 50 break,

1902
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:32,880
They're trying. If you get a 50 break,
 

1903
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,950
They're trying. If you get a 50 break,
you should get a pretty nice squeeze

1904
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:34,960
you should get a pretty nice squeeze
 

1905
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,790
you should get a pretty nice squeeze
because there's a lot of shorts who've

1906
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:36,800
because there's a lot of shorts who've
 

1907
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,750
because there's a lot of shorts who've
come in underneath that on that last

1908
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:39,760
come in underneath that on that last
 

1909
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,630
come in underneath that on that last
flush down to that gray box. So through

1910
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:42,640
flush down to that gray box. So through
 

1911
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,109
flush down to that gray box. So through
50s, you should get a move through 60s

1912
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:45,119
50s, you should get a move through 60s
 

1913
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,150
50s, you should get a move through 60s
to 75 pretty quickly. You got to get

1914
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
to 75 pretty quickly. You got to get
 

1915
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,990
to 75 pretty quickly. You got to get
through this 200 lot sat above us right

1916
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,000
through this 200 lot sat above us right
 

1917
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,990
through this 200 lot sat above us right
now. Like I said, QQQ is that previous

1918
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:52,000
now. Like I said, QQQ is that previous
 

1919
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,790
now. Like I said, QQQ is that previous
day high. So watching to see if the

1920
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:54,800
day high. So watching to see if the
 

1921
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,790
day high. So watching to see if the
options market wants to take that out or

1922
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:56,800
options market wants to take that out or
 

1923
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,790
options market wants to take that out or
not. And then you've got 605 above,

1924
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:58,800
not. And then you've got 605 above,
 

1925
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,309
not. And then you've got 605 above,
which I imagine would be a big big

1926
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:00,319
which I imagine would be a big big
 

1927
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,790
which I imagine would be a big big
level.

1928
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:02,800
level.
 

1929
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,550
level.
So I can show you on bookmap which I'm

1930
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:04,560
So I can show you on bookmap which I'm
 

1931
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,309
So I can show you on bookmap which I'm
looking at here. You can see right here

1932
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:06,319
looking at here. You can see right here
 

1933
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,870
looking at here. You can see right here
we've got a 200 lot wall. We sold

1934
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:08,880
we've got a 200 lot wall. We sold
 

1935
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,230
we've got a 200 lot wall. We sold
against it a couple times and you see

1936
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:10,240
against it a couple times and you see
 

1937
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,910
against it a couple times and you see
all these shorts chasing. Well, if we

1938
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:11,920
all these shorts chasing. Well, if we
 

1939
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,589
all these shorts chasing. Well, if we
get above them, they are all going to be

1940
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:13,599
get above them, they are all going to be
 

1941
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,670
get above them, they are all going to be
offside and we will use this guy to lift

1942
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:15,680
offside and we will use this guy to lift
 

1943
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,190
offside and we will use this guy to lift
up into here. We've got to get through

1944
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:17,200
up into here. We've got to get through
 

1945
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,270
up into here. We've got to get through
50s and then we'll use these guys pain

1946
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:19,280
50s and then we'll use these guys pain
 

1947
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,950
50s and then we'll use these guys pain
to move higher at that point. They've

1948
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:20,960
to move higher at that point. They've
 

1949
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,109
to move higher at that point. They've
got to get through this 950. Here's the

1950
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:23,119
got to get through this 950. Here's the
 

1951
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,589
got to get through this 950. Here's the
flush through it. So 915 to 60. Let's

1952
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:25,599
flush through it. So 915 to 60. Let's
 

1953
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,589
flush through it. So 915 to 60. Let's
see if they can turn this on to 75 for

1954
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:27,599
see if they can turn this on to 75 for
 

1955
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,710
see if they can turn this on to 75 for
you and then to 25k. Here you go. Boom.

1956
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:30,720
you and then to 25k. Here you go. Boom.
 

1957
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,910
you and then to 25k. Here you go. Boom.
Boom, boom, boom, boom. So, you want to

1958
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:31,920
Boom, boom, boom, boom. So, you want to
 

1959
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,670
Boom, boom, boom, boom. So, you want to
be locking some in here. Moving your

1960
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:33,680
be locking some in here. Moving your
 

1961
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,990
be locking some in here. Moving your
stop up. Here's 75. Here's the squeeze.

1962
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,000

say enough about how great it is to
 

2117
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,550
say enough about how great it is to
listen to your analysis. Thanks so much.

Yeah, everyone should be out now on that

2122
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:49,280
Yeah, everyone should be out now on that
 

2123
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,030
Yeah, everyone should be out now on that
on that expansion up. All right. If we

2124
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:51,040
on that expansion up. All right. If we
 

2125
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,630
on that expansion up. All right. If we
start losing here, what I'd imagine

2126
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:52,640
start losing here, what I'd imagine
 

2127
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,390
start losing here, what I'd imagine
here, unless they collapse it straight

2128
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:54,400
here, unless they collapse it straight
 

2129
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,270
here, unless they collapse it straight
down to PC, we probably get some sort of

2130
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:57,280
down to PC, we probably get some sort of
 

2131
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,349
down to PC, we probably get some sort of
buildout here now. All right. And if

2132
00:44:59,349 --> 00:44:59,359
buildout here now. All right. And if
 

2133
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,950
buildout here now. All right. And if
they fail to break this, we can have a

2134
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:00,960
they fail to break this, we can have a
 

2135
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,069
they fail to break this, we can have a
look at the high. I would imagine

2136
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:02,079
look at the high. I would imagine
 

2137
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,829
look at the high. I would imagine
there's some uh buyers caught at that

2138
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:03,839
there's some uh buyers caught at that
 

2139
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,270
there's some uh buyers caught at that
high. There you go. Buyers just got

2140
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:05,280
high. There you go. Buyers just got
 

2141
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,990
high. There you go. Buyers just got
trapped up here above 60 because they're

2142
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:08,000
trapped up here above 60 because they're
 

2143
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,349
trapped up here above 60 because they're
silly. They started entering

2144
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:09,359
silly. They started entering
 

2145
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,670
silly. They started entering
aggressively above 60 and right the way

2146
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:11,680
aggressively above 60 and right the way
 

2147
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,150
aggressively above 60 and right the way
up here into 80. And we know that's why

2148
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:14,160
up here into 80. And we know that's why
 

2149
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,790
up here into 80. And we know that's why
I said take profit. Everything above 60.

2150
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:16,800
I said take profit. Everything above 60.
 

2151
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,630
I said take profit. Everything above 60.
And now sellers are taking control. And

2152
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:18,640
And now sellers are taking control. And
 

2153
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,309
And now sellers are taking control. And
guess what we're going to do? probably

2154
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:20,319
guess what we're going to do? probably
 

2155
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:21,750
guess what we're going to do? probably
come right the way back down here when

2156
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:21,760
come right the way back down here when
 

2157
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,270
come right the way back down here when
it's ready for all these imbalances. All

2158
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:23,280
it's ready for all these imbalances. All
 

2159
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,190
it's ready for all these imbalances. All
right, so there's the trade. Here you

2160
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:25,200
right, so there's the trade. Here you
 

2161
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,390
right, so there's the trade. Here you
go. So, we're starting to let go of

2162
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:26,400
go. So, we're starting to let go of
 

2163
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,470
go. So, we're starting to let go of
these shelves. And we can if we start

2164
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:28,480
these shelves. And we can if we start
 

2165
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,710
these shelves. And we can if we start
letting go of this PC, right, we can

2166
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:30,720
letting go of this PC, right, we can
 

2167
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,230
letting go of this PC, right, we can
probably bounce between these for a bit.

2168
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:32,240
probably bounce between these for a bit.
 

2169
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,150
probably bounce between these for a bit.
We can see we've developed this now,

2170
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,160
We can see we've developed this now,
 

2171
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,670
We can see we've developed this now,
right? And if we let go of that, that

2172
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:35,680
right? And if we let go of that, that
 

2173
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,870
right? And if we let go of that, that
collapse can still happen because

2174
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:36,880
collapse can still happen because
 

2175
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,069
collapse can still happen because
remember the main trend is still

2176
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:38,079
remember the main trend is still
 

2177
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,190
remember the main trend is still
bearish. We just expected relief, right?

2178
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:41,200
bearish. We just expected relief, right?
 

2179
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,430
bearish. We just expected relief, right?
The main trend is bearish. We expected

2180
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:43,440
The main trend is bearish. We expected
 

2181
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,829
The main trend is bearish. We expected
relief to run these stops. And we can

2182
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:45,839
relief to run these stops. And we can
 

2183
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,069
relief to run these stops. And we can
come back into here now if it wants.

2184
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:48,079
come back into here now if it wants.
 

2185
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,230
come back into here now if it wants.

00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,950
morning came into the gap. We didn't
actually get down to the perfect level.

2266
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:26,960
actually get down to the perfect level.
 

2267
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,630
actually get down to the perfect level.
We trapped under here. We reclaimed.

2268
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:28,640
We trapped under here. We reclaimed.
 

2269
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,829
We trapped under here. We reclaimed.
That was the long. Boom, boom, boom,

2270
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:29,839
That was the long. Boom, boom, boom,
 

2271
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,349
That was the long. Boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom. Done with it. All right,

2272
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:31,359
boom, boom. Done with it. All right,
 

2273
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,109
boom, boom. Done with it. All right,
you're done with it. We can build out

2274
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:33,119
you're done with it. We can build out
 

2275
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,030
you're done with it. We can build out
here now. The question is on this build

2276
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:35,040
here now. The question is on this build
 

2277
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,630
here now. The question is on this build
out, right? If they fail to make a new

2278
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:36,640
out, right? If they fail to make a new
 

2279
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,470
out, right? If they fail to make a new
high and they lose this, then we're

2280
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:38,480
high and they lose this, then we're
 

2281
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,150
high and they lose this, then we're
backside back down into here if you

2282
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,160
backside back down into here if you
 

2283
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,309
backside back down into here if you
really want to trade that. But remember,

2284
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:42,319
really want to trade that. But remember,
 

2285
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,190
really want to trade that. But remember,
we are extended to the downside right

2286
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:45,200
we are extended to the downside right
 

2287
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,750
we are extended to the downside right
now. We've just this move back here. For

2288
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:47,760
now. We've just this move back here. For
 

2289
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,990
now. We've just this move back here. For
anyone who's done the course or joins me

2290
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:50,000
anyone who's done the course or joins me
 

2291
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,510
anyone who's done the course or joins me
regularly, guess what? That moved back

2292
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:51,520
regularly, guess what? That moved back
 

2293
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,270
regularly, guess what? That moved back
there tapped.

2294
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:53,280
there tapped.
 

2295
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,349
there tapped.
Yep, you're right. We just moved from

2296
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:55,359
Yep, you're right. We just moved from
 

2297
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,230
Yep, you're right. We just moved from
the 200 day back to the lower Ballinger

2298
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:58,240
the 200 day back to the lower Ballinger
 

2299
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,309
the 200 day back to the lower Ballinger
band. All right. Two sigma. This down

2300
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:00,319
band. All right. Two sigma. This down
 

2301
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,790
band. All right. Two sigma. This down
here was three standard deviation. That

2302
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:02,800
here was three standard deviation. That
 

2303
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,270
here was three standard deviation. That
was a spooking huge move down to that.

2304
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:05,280
was a spooking huge move down to that.
 

2305
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,270
was a spooking huge move down to that.
All right. to the 200 day where we found

2306
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:07,280
All right. to the 200 day where we found
 

2307
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,109
All right. to the 200 day where we found
that bid right back to two sigma now

2308
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:11,119
that bid right back to two sigma now
 

2309
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,550
that bid right back to two sigma now
question is can they lift all the way up

2310
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:12,560
question is can they lift all the way up
 

2311
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,870
question is can they lift all the way up
here not today I don't think I think we

2312
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:14,880
here not today I don't think I think we
 

2313
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,030
here not today I don't think I think we
will build out liquidity now and then

2314
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:17,040
will build out liquidity now and then
 

2315
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,710
will build out liquidity now and then
maybe Monday Tuesday we have that push

2316
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:18,720
maybe Monday Tuesday we have that push
 

2317
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,510
maybe Monday Tuesday we have that push
and then fail ideally we'll see though

2318
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:21,520
and then fail ideally we'll see though
 

2319
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,150
and then fail ideally we'll see though
folks we will see but we what I'm trying

this part out on a daily and then we

2414
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:17,040
this part out on a daily and then we
 

2415
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,190
this part out on a daily and then we
probably do this for a week or two and

Hi, Alex. Is reducing position by 50%
 

2449
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,950
Hi, Alex. Is reducing position by 50%
each TP a good rule in general? Uh well

2450
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:04,960
each TP a good rule in general? Uh well
 

2451
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,589
each TP a good rule in general? Uh well
it depends how much size you've got on

2452
00:51:07,589 --> 00:51:07,599
it depends how much size you've got on
 

2453
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,750
it depends how much size you've got on
really. That's a really uh interesting

2454
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:09,760
really. That's a really uh interesting
 

2455
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,910

just went over this. So, we just went
 

2477
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,470
just went over this. So, we just went
from gray box to gray box. There's your

2478
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:34,480
from gray box to gray box. There's your
 

2479
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,069
from gray box to gray box. There's your
bare [\h__\h] There's the collapse. Here's

2480
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:36,079

the news. Back down to previous day

2482
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:37,760
the news. Back down to previous day
 

2483
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,510
the news. Back down to previous day
value area high. And if they lose New

2484
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:39,520
value area high. And if they lose New
 

2485
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,270
value area high. And if they lose New
York open, we'll come back down to point

2486
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:41,280
York open, we'll come back down to point
 

2487
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,030
York open, we'll come back down to point
of control. Now, this is very similar to

2488
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:43,040
of control. Now, this is very similar to
 

2489
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,870
of control. Now, this is very similar to
yesterday. So, we ran the stops one

2490
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:44,880
yesterday. So, we ran the stops one
 

2491
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,589
yesterday. So, we ran the stops one
side. We failed to break out and hold.

2492
00:51:47,589 --> 00:51:47,599
side. We failed to break out and hold.
 

2493
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,589
side. We failed to break out and hold.
We put in a lower high. We're coming

2494
00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:49,599
We put in a lower high. We're coming
 

2495
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,430
We put in a lower high. We're coming
down to previous day value area high.

2496
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:51,440
down to previous day value area high.
 

2497
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,030
down to previous day value area high.
This is current week's developing uh

2498
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:55,040
This is current week's developing uh
 

2499
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,630
This is current week's developing uh
point of control. So, this is fair

2500
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:56,640
point of control. So, this is fair
 

2501
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,109
point of control. So, this is fair
value. So, the question now is can we

2502
00:51:59,109 --> 00:51:59,119
value. So, the question now is can we
 

2503
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,950
value. So, the question now is can we
find a bid here? All right. Because if

2504
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:00,960
find a bid here? All right. Because if
 

2505
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,470
find a bid here? All right. Because if
we can, it means we're not willing to

2506
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:02,480
we can, it means we're not willing to
 

2507
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,710
we can, it means we're not willing to
trade into yesterday's value. Right? If

2508
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:04,720
trade into yesterday's value. Right? If
 

2509
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,230
trade into yesterday's value. Right? If
we can't find a bid there, it means

2510
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:06,240
we can't find a bid there, it means
 

2511
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,549
we can't find a bid there, it means
we're going to do this move down here

2512
00:52:08,549 --> 00:52:08,559
we're going to do this move down here
 

2513
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,190
we're going to do this move down here
and retest this level.

2514
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:11,200
and retest this level.
 

2515
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,750
and retest this level.
Right? So, the auction now is deciding,

2516
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:13,760
Right? So, the auction now is deciding,
 

2517
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,829
Right? So, the auction now is deciding,
was yesterday too cheap or do we need to

2518
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:15,839
was yesterday too cheap or do we need to
 

2519
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,589
was yesterday too cheap or do we need to
retest this? If yesterday was too cheap,

2520
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:17,599
retest this? If yesterday was too cheap,
 

2521
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,589
retest this? If yesterday was too cheap,
they will hold above here and try and

2522
00:52:19,589 --> 00:52:19,599
they will hold above here and try and
 

2523
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,270
they will hold above here and try and
reclaim this and try and go back up. But

2524
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:21,280
reclaim this and try and go back up. But
 

2525
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,910
reclaim this and try and go back up. But
I am expecting a range rotation type of

2526
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:23,920
I am expecting a range rotation type of
 

2527

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,270
sometimes more, but really like I'm
looking for 100 point trades in in a

2568
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:15,280
looking for 100 point trades in in a
 

2569
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,710
looking for 100 point trades in in a
market with this much volatility.

2570
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:16,720
market with this much volatility.
 

2571
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,309
market with this much volatility.
Remember, we got the VIX up at like the

2572
00:53:18,309 --> 00:53:18,319
Remember, we got the VIX up at like the
 

2573
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,150
Remember, we got the VIX up at like the
20s, right? So, it's going to provide

2574
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:20,160
20s, right? So, it's going to provide
 

2575
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,829
20s, right? So, it's going to provide
huge opportunities for us right now. All

2576
00:53:21,829 --> 00:53:21,839
huge opportunities for us right now. All
 

2577
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,750
huge opportunities for us right now. All
right, VIX just undercut previous day

2578
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:23,760
right, VIX just undercut previous day
 

2579
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,670
right, VIX just undercut previous day
low and has found a bid. So, we might

2580
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:25,680
low and has found a bid. So, we might
 

2581
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,270
low and has found a bid. So, we might
start getting heavy here. VIX probably

2582
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:27,280
start getting heavy here. VIX probably
 

2583
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,990
start getting heavy here. VIX probably
going to come back and retest 1950

2584
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:30,000
going to come back and retest 1950
 

2585
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,230
going to come back and retest 1950
through that we're going to go 20s. So,

2586
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:32,240
through that we're going to go 20s. So,
 

2587
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,549
through that we're going to go 20s. So,
we're going to watch this area here to

2588
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:34,559
we're going to watch this area here to
 

2589
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,109
we're going to watch this area here to
see if they trap more sellers here and

2590
00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:37,119
see if they trap more sellers here and
 

2591
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,430
see if they trap more sellers here and
rebid. And if not, and if they stay

2592
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:39,440
rebid. And if not, and if they stay
 

2593
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,589
rebid. And if not, and if they stay
heavy here, right, we might go this this

2594
00:53:41,589 --> 00:53:41,599
heavy here, right, we might go this this
 

2595
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,309
heavy here, right, we might go this this
this this this is possible. So, either

2596
00:53:44,309 --> 00:53:44,319
this this this is possible. So, either
 

2597
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,670
this this this is possible. So, either
we're going to trap here for this drive

2598
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:45,680
we're going to trap here for this drive
 

2599
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,750
we're going to trap here for this drive
up and reclaim or they're going to start

2600
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:47,760
up and reclaim or they're going to start
 

2601
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,990
up and reclaim or they're going to start
washing this far more aggressively.

2602
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:50,000
washing this far more aggressively.
 

2603
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,670
washing this far more aggressively.
Remember, we did just take out the old

2604
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:51,680
Remember, we did just take out the old
 

2605
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,349
Remember, we did just take out the old
highs. SPY hit its 5day and 50-day which

2606
00:53:55,349 --> 00:53:55,359
highs. SPY hit its 5day and 50-day which
 

2607
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,950
highs. SPY hit its 5day and 50-day which
are together at the same point

2608
00:53:58,950 --> 00:53:58,960
are together at the same point
 

2609
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,190
are together at the same point
and Q's got a way to go to get there.

2610
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:01,200
and Q's got a way to go to get there.
 

2611
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,710
and Q's got a way to go to get there.
All right, starting to see heaviness

2612
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:02,720
All right, starting to see heaviness
 

2613
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,390
All right, starting to see heaviness
come back in. So, running the stops

2614
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:04,400
come back in. So, running the stops
 

2615
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,150
come back in. So, running the stops
coming back down. Funny that, isn't it

2616
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:06,160
coming back down. Funny that, isn't it
 

2617
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,589
coming back down. Funny that, isn't it
funny how that works.

2618
00:54:09,589 --> 00:54:09,599
funny how that works.
 

2619
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,430
funny how that works.
How do I size my stop? We go this all

2620
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:11,440
How do I size my stop? We go this all
 

2621
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,270
How do I size my stop? We go this all
the time. We size based on where the

2622
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:13,280
the time. We size based on where the
 

2623
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,470
the time. We size based on where the
trade is no longer valid.

2624
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:16,480
trade is no longer valid.
 

2625
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,390
trade is no longer valid.
Do I ever trade supply and demand? Well,

2626
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:18,400
Do I ever trade supply and demand? Well,
 

2627
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,150
Do I ever trade supply and demand? Well,
it's all the same. Yes, it's exactly

2628
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:20,160
it's all the same. Yes, it's exactly
 

2629
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,910
it's all the same. Yes, it's exactly
what I trade really. This is potential

2630
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:21,920
what I trade really. This is potential
 

2631
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,390
what I trade really. This is potential
demand. This is now potential supply.

2632
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:24,400
demand. This is now potential supply.
 

2633
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,470
demand. This is now potential supply.
This is potential supply. Intraday. It's

2634
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:26,480
This is potential supply. Intraday. It's
 

2635
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,109
This is potential supply. Intraday. It's
exactly what I trade. SNR supply and

2636
00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:29,119
exactly what I trade. SNR supply and
 

2637
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,549
exactly what I trade. SNR supply and
demand. Order blocks. Call it what the

man. People will tell you it's not. It

2642
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:34,400
man. People will tell you it's not. It
 

2643
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,230
man. People will tell you it's not. It
It is.

2644
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:36,240
It is.

It is.
Range rotation means Tyson's trade could

2646
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:38,960
Range rotation means Tyson's trade could
 

2647
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,950
Range rotation means Tyson's trade could
play better later. That's very true.

2648
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:40,960
play better later. That's very true.
 

2649
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,630
play better later. That's very true.
That is very true. All right. Into this

2650
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:42,640
That is very true. All right. Into this
 

2651
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,870
That is very true. All right. Into this
value area. You can see right now we're

2652
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:44,880
value area. You can see right now we're
 

2653
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,190
value area. You can see right now we're
trading right into this value area.

2654
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:47,200
trading right into this value area.
 

2655
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,870
trading right into this value area.
There is a big seller that came in at

2656
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:48,880
There is a big seller that came in at
 

2657
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,150
There is a big seller that came in at
the 800s. All right. So

2658
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:52,160
the 800s. All right. So
 

2659
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,309
the 800s. All right. So
if we get back above him, we might drift

2660
00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:54,319
if we get back above him, we might drift
 

2661
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:56,470
if we get back above him, we might drift
back into sort of 30s. There is a huge

2662
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:56,480
back into sort of 30s. There is a huge
 

2663
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,510
back into sort of 30s. There is a huge
node developed in into 56s. So if they

2664
00:54:59,510 --> 00:54:59,520
node developed in into 56s. So if they
 

2665
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,270
node developed in into 56s. So if they
hold 800s, we're probably going to come

2666
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:01,280
hold 800s, we're probably going to come
 

2667
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,870
hold 800s, we're probably going to come
and test 30s and then 58s, 56s somewhere

2668
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:04,880
and test 30s and then 58s, 56s somewhere
 

2669
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,510
and test 30s and then 58s, 56s somewhere
up there. If we lose 800s, they're going

2670
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:07,520
up there. If we lose 800s, they're going
 

2671
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,270
up there. If we lose 800s, they're going
to come and retest this seller down at

2672
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:09,280
to come and retest this seller down at
 

2673
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,230
to come and retest this seller down at
uh 714s.

2674
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:12,240
uh 714s.
 

2675
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,589
uh 714s.
So they're trying to bid off previous

2676
00:55:13,589 --> 00:55:13,599
So they're trying to bid off previous
 

2677
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,430
So they're trying to bid off previous
day value high, this area we just talked

2678
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:15,440
day value high, this area we just talked
 

2679
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,270
day value high, this area we just talked
about. Here we go. So they're lifting it

2680
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:17,280
about. Here we go. So they're lifting it
 

2681
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,670
about. Here we go. So they're lifting it
now back towards the 56s. Here you go.

2682
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:19,680
now back towards the 56s. Here you go.
 

2683
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,710
now back towards the 56s. Here you go.
Here's the lift. So 30s and then 56s.

2684
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:22,720
Here's the lift. So 30s and then 56s.
 

2685
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,470
Here's the lift. So 30s and then 56s.
There's imbalance here at 40. The next

2686
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:24,480
There's imbalance here at 40. The next
 

2687
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,030
There's imbalance here at 40. The next
imbalance is 50. Then you've got 60s.

2688
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:27,040
imbalance is 50. Then you've got 60s.
 

2689
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,190
imbalance is 50. Then you've got 60s.
All right. And then big node into 60s

2690
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:29,200
All right. And then big node into 60s
 

2691
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,870
All right. And then big node into 60s
like you can see right here. Here's

2692
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:30,880
like you can see right here. Here's
 

2693
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,710
like you can see right here. Here's
there you go. Super simple. Right.

2694
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:32,720
there you go. Super simple. Right.
 

2695
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,390
there you go. Super simple. Right.
Previous day value area high. Do they

2696
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:34,400
Previous day value area high. Do they
 

2697
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,829
Previous day value area high. Do they
find a bid here? If they do, we're going

2698
00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:35,839
find a bid here? If they do, we're going
 

2699
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,710
find a bid here? If they do, we're going
to rotate to gray box. Gray box to gray

2700
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:38,720
to rotate to gray box. Gray box to gray
 

2701
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,150
to rotate to gray box. Gray box to gray
box. All right. So if you wanted to

2702
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:40,160
box. All right. So if you wanted to
 

2703
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,069
box. All right. So if you wanted to
scalp that, that's your scalp. You

2704
00:55:42,069 --> 00:55:42,079
scalp that, that's your scalp. You
 

2705
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,190
scalp that, that's your scalp. You
should be trimming here because if

2706
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:43,200
should be trimming here because if
 

2707
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,790
should be trimming here because if
sellers step back in here, they're going

2708
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:44,800
sellers step back in here, they're going
 

2709
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,470
sellers step back in here, they're going
to rotate back down to here. And we can

2710
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:46,480
to rotate back down to here. And we can
 

2711
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,789
to rotate back down to here. And we can
build out here while they make their

2712
00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:48,799
build out here while they make their
 

2713
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:51,030
build out here while they make their

00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,710

What's up with Tops that always changing

2810
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:04,720
What's up with Tops that always changing
 

2811
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,230
What's up with Tops that always changing
the rules? Well, because they're losing

2812
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:06,240
the rules? Well, because they're losing
 

2813
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,829
the rules? Well, because they're losing
too much market share.

2814
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:09,839
too much market share.
 

2815
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,510
too much market share.
Why don't trade with them? They're

2816
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:11,520
Why don't trade with them? They're
 

2817
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,789
Why don't trade with them? They're
[\h__\h] All right. All right, like we

2818
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:12,799
[\h__\h] All right. All right, like we
 

2819
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:14,549
[\h__\h] All right. All right, like we
said, 800's where that big seller is.

2820
00:58:14,549 --> 00:58:14,559
said, 800's where that big seller is.
 

2821
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,230
said, 800's where that big seller is.
All right, 800's right here where that

2822
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:16,240
All right, 800's right here where that
 

2823
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,230
All right, 800's right here where that
big seller is. Under that previous day

2824
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:18,240
big seller is. Under that previous day
 

2825
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,750
big seller is. Under that previous day
value area high under that, we have this

2826
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:19,760
value area high under that, we have this
 

2827
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,990
value area high under that, we have this
trap seller down at 13. So if they lose

2828
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:22,000
trap seller down at 13. So if they lose
 

2829
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,030
trap seller down at 13. So if they lose
this, they can flush down towards 13s.

2830
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:25,040
this, they can flush down towards 13s.
 

2831
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,030
this, they can flush down towards 13s.
All right. So, and if they reclaim 800s,

2832
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:27,040
All right. So, and if they reclaim 800s,
 

2833
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,470
All right. So, and if they reclaim 800s,
we kind of retest this again. This is

2834
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:28,480
we kind of retest this again. This is
 

2835
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,990
we kind of retest this again. This is
the rotation that we've talked about a

2836
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:30,000
the rotation that we've talked about a
 

2837
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:37,670
the rotation that we've talked about a
few times.

2838
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:37,680

 

2839
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,670

I feel a bit blind without that hourly.

2840
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:39,680
I feel a bit blind without that hourly.
 

2841
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:44,789
I feel a bit blind without that hourly.

Let me see if I change time on it. Will
 

2845
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,270
Let me see if I change time on it. Will

2846
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:51,280

So, like we said, we're still bidding

2942
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:38,880
So, like we said, we're still bidding
 

2943
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,510
So, like we said, we're still bidding
value, right? We reclaimed 800 where

2944
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:41,520
value, right? We reclaimed 800 where
 

2945
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,910
value, right? We reclaimed 800 where
that trap seller is and we can lift now

2946
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:43,920
that trap seller is and we can lift now
 

2947
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,910
that trap seller is and we can lift now
back up to 60 again. So, they are

2948
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:45,920
back up to 60 again. So, they are
 

2949
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,670
back up to 60 again. So, they are
building liquidity out here like we

2950
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:47,680
building liquidity out here like we
 

2951
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,109
building liquidity out here like we
talked about. I'm not going to trade in

2952
01:00:49,109 --> 01:00:49,119
talked about. I'm not going to trade in
 

2953
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:50,309
talked about. I'm not going to trade in
the middle of this. Right, this is the

2954
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:50,319
the middle of this. Right, this is the
 

2955
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:51,750
the middle of this. Right, this is the
middle of the opening range. This is

2956
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:51,760
middle of the opening range. This is
 

2957
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,069
middle of the opening range. This is
between 24hour view up and New York view

2958
01:00:54,069 --> 01:00:54,079
between 24hour view up and New York view
 

2959
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:55,589
between 24hour view up and New York view
up. Like I told you, I do not want to

2960
01:00:55,589 --> 01:00:55,599
up. Like I told you, I do not want to
 

2961
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,069
up. Like I told you, I do not want to
trade in here. I have zero interest. If

2962
01:00:58,069 --> 01:00:58,079
trade in here. I have zero interest. If
 

2963
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:00,309
trade in here. I have zero interest. If
we find acceptance, right, if we find

2964
01:01:00,309 --> 01:01:00,319
we find acceptance, right, if we find
 

2965
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:02,390
we find acceptance, right, if we find
acceptance above here and they base,

2966
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:02,400
acceptance above here and they base,
 

2967
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,549
acceptance above here and they base,
there is a reshot back up here, maybe up

2968
01:01:04,549 --> 01:01:04,559
there is a reshot back up here, maybe up
 

2969
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,670
there is a reshot back up here, maybe up
to 25K50. So there is a trade there if

2970
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:07,680
to 25K50. So there is a trade there if
 

2971
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,349
to 25K50. So there is a trade there if
they want it. If they want to do this,

2972
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:09,359
they want it. If they want to do this,
 

2973
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:11,430
they want it. If they want to do this,
but you want to be very careful between

2974
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:11,440
but you want to be very careful between
 

2975
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,589
but you want to be very careful between
these two levels here now. All right.

2976
01:01:13,589 --> 01:01:13,599
these two levels here now. All right.
 

2977
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,950
these two levels here now. All right.

01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:43,270

Balance down there. Still into 20s. It's

3024
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:43,280
Balance down there. Still into 20s. It's
 

3025
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,630
Balance down there. Still into 20s. It's
still between these two. It feels like

3026
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:44,640
still between these two. It feels like
 

3027
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,069
still between these two. It feels like
they want to save it somewhere down here

3028
01:02:46,069 --> 01:02:46,079
they want to save it somewhere down here
 

3029
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:47,829
they want to save it somewhere down here
and then try and get back through that

3030
01:02:47,829 --> 01:02:47,839
and then try and get back through that
 

3031
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:50,630
and then try and get back through that
New York Vat. But we will see except I

3032
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:50,640
New York Vat. But we will see except I
 

3033
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,990
New York Vat. But we will see except I
don't want to trade in this area

3034
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:52,000
don't want to trade in this area
 

3035
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,069
don't want to trade in this area
particularly to test back down to the

3036
01:02:54,069 --> 01:02:54,079
particularly to test back down to the
 

3037
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:56,069
particularly to test back down to the
imbalance of 20s. There's a big node

3038
01:02:56,069 --> 01:02:56,079
imbalance of 20s. There's a big node
 

3039
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,950
imbalance of 20s. There's a big node
like we said that big seller is at 800.

3040
01:02:58,950 --> 01:02:58,960
like we said that big seller is at 800.
 

3041
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,589
like we said that big seller is at 800.
So here's the 20s test. Maybe 800 test.

3042
01:03:01,589 --> 01:03:01,599
So here's the 20s test. Maybe 800 test.
 

3043
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:03,430
So here's the 20s test. Maybe 800 test.
We'll see. I'm going to avoid this whole

3044
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:03,440
We'll see. I'm going to avoid this whole
 

3045
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,670
We'll see. I'm going to avoid this whole
area while they make their mind up what

3046
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:05,680
area while they make their mind up what
 

3047
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,030
area while they make their mind up what
they're doing. So they can set a lower

3048
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:07,040
they're doing. So they can set a lower
 

3049
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:10,150
they're doing. So they can set a lower
high here. And we can do that. We can

3050
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:10,160
high here. And we can do that. We can
 

3051
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,470
high here. And we can do that. We can
come back down for this. In fact, I'm

3052
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:12,480
come back down for this. In fact, I'm
 

3053
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,270
come back down for this. In fact, I'm
going to move this now. That old gap. We

3054
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:15,280
going to move this now. That old gap. We
 

3055
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,670
going to move this now. That old gap. We
filled it. Watching this New York open.

3056
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:17,680
filled it. Watching this New York open.
 

3057
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,349
filled it. Watching this New York open.
So, view up to view up again. Still,

3058
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:19,359
So, view up to view up again. Still,
 

3059
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:24,069
So, view up to view up again. Still,
they're just jumping over each other.

3060
01:03:24,069 --> 01:03:24,079
they're just jumping over each other.
 

3061
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:25,589
they're just jumping over each other.
They're trying to find a bid here again.

3062
01:03:25,589 --> 01:03:25,599
They're trying to find a bid here again.
 

3063
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,029
They're trying to find a bid here again.
If not, they're going to flush all the

3064
01:03:27,029 --> 01:03:27,039
If not, they're going to flush all the
 

3065
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:29,270
If not, they're going to flush all the
way down into this.

3066
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:29,280
way down into this.
 

3067
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,789
way down into this.
Cannot make their mind up. Vicks holding

3068
01:03:30,789 --> 01:03:30,799
Cannot make their mind up. Vicks holding
 

3069
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:32,309
Cannot make their mind up. Vicks holding
previous day low. Coming back up to that

3070
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:32,319
previous day low. Coming back up to that
 

3071
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:34,390
previous day low. Coming back up to that
1950 like we talked 1950. If we get

3072
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:34,400
1950 like we talked 1950. If we get
 

3073
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,109
1950 like we talked 1950. If we get
through 1950, then 20 is on the VIX is

3074
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:37,119
through 1950, then 20 is on the VIX is
 

3075
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:38,230
through 1950, then 20 is on the VIX is
possible. That's when the market will

3076
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:38,240
possible. That's when the market will
 

3077
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,390
possible. That's when the market will
get very, very weak.

3078
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:40,400
get very, very weak.
 

3079
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,390
get very, very weak.
We keep banging back into this 800. This

3080
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:42,400
We keep banging back into this 800. This
 

3081
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,190
We keep banging back into this 800. This
guy at 800. So, it's a big level here of

3082
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:45,200
guy at 800. So, it's a big level here of
 

3083
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,950
guy at 800. So, it's a big level here of
whether they are willing to push through

3084
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:46,960
whether they are willing to push through
 

3085
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,430
whether they are willing to push through
this guy or not.

3086
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:49,440
this guy or not.
 

3087
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,190
this guy or not.
Are they willing to lift it or do they

3088
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:51,200
Are they willing to lift it or do they
 

3089
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,910
Are they willing to lift it or do they
need now to wash down to 713s? I don't

3090
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:53,920
need now to wash down to 713s? I don't
 

3091
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,990
need now to wash down to 713s? I don't
know.

3092
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:56,000
know.
 

3093
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,789
know.
They are trying to decide, aren't they?

3094
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:02,799

 

3095
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:05,990

And they're bidding at 50, so

3096
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:06,000
And they're bidding at 50, so
 

3097
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,069
And they're bidding at 50, so
don't look too good.

3098
01:04:10,069 --> 01:04:10,079

 

3099
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,349

They snap this then you're going to get

3100
01:04:11,349 --> 01:04:11,359
They snap this then you're going to get
 

3101
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:17,990
They snap this then you're going to get
50s by the looks of it.

3102
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:18,000

 

3103
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,309

It's a bit of no man's land bidding 50s.

3104
01:04:20,309 --> 01:04:20,319
It's a bit of no man's land bidding 50s.
 

3105
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:28,150
It's a bit of no man's land bidding 50s.
Honestly,

3106
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:28,160

 

3107
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:34,549

what are you doing?

3108
01:04:34,549 --> 01:04:34,559

 

3109
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,470

Choppy chop chop. It's what we expect

3110
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:36,480
Choppy chop chop. It's what we expect
 

3111
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,270
Choppy chop chop. It's what we expect
today. Glad we got that first drive out.

3112
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:39,280
today. Glad we got that first drive out.
 

3113
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,910
today. Glad we got that first drive out.
Willing to play this uh either on a big

3114
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:41,920
Willing to play this uh either on a big
 

3115
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,150
Willing to play this uh either on a big
breakdown or on a reclaim and push. I'd

3116
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:44,160
breakdown or on a reclaim and push. I'd
 

3117
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,150
breakdown or on a reclaim and push. I'd
rather a reclaim and push, but we will

3118
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:46,160
rather a reclaim and push, but we will
 

3119
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,910
rather a reclaim and push, but we will
see. Just needs to be uh very very

3120
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:49,920
see. Just needs to be uh very very
 

3121
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,390
see. Just needs to be uh very very
patient now to just let it set up. A bit

3122
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:52,400
patient now to just let it set up. A bit
 

3123
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,990
patient now to just let it set up. A bit
like yesterday, right? Once we've used

3124
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:54,000
like yesterday, right? Once we've used
 

3125
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,349
like yesterday, right? Once we've used
all the liquidity, we now have to be

3126
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:55,359
all the liquidity, we now have to be
 

3127
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,190
all the liquidity, we now have to be
very patient. Let that liquidity start

3128
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:57,200
very patient. Let that liquidity start
 

3129
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,029
very patient. Let that liquidity start
to be built out before we make our next

3130
01:04:59,029 --> 01:04:59,039
to be built out before we make our next
 

3131
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:01,430
to be built out before we make our next
decision on what it is we might want to

3132
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:01,440
decision on what it is we might want to
 

3133
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:06,789
decision on what it is we might want to
do.

3134
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:06,799

 

3135
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:08,390

Like I said, they keep bidding 50s down

3136
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:08,400
Like I said, they keep bidding 50s down
 

3137
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,549
Like I said, they keep bidding 50s down
here. They might well look for a little

3138
01:05:10,549 --> 01:05:10,559
here. They might well look for a little
 

3139
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,029
here. They might well look for a little
tag underneath.

3140
01:05:13,029 --> 01:05:13,039
tag underneath.
 

3141
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:14,870
tag underneath.
It's be almost weird that they wouldn't

3142
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:14,880
It's be almost weird that they wouldn't
 

3143
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,109
It's be almost weird that they wouldn't
come and revisit 714s and they would

3144
01:05:17,109 --> 01:05:17,119
come and revisit 714s and they would
 

3145
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:19,430
come and revisit 714s and they would
just bid 50s, but we'll see. We'll see

3146
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:19,440
just bid 50s, but we'll see. We'll see
 

3147
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,510
just bid 50s, but we'll see. We'll see
what these guys what their intentions

3148
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:21,520
what these guys what their intentions
 

3149
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,829
what these guys what their intentions
are here.

3150
01:05:23,829 --> 01:05:23,839
are here.
 

3151
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:25,670
are here.
Lots of buyers stacking up down here and

3152
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:25,680
Lots of buyers stacking up down here and
 

3153
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,190
Lots of buyers stacking up down here and
they probably get washed out before they

3154
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:27,200
they probably get washed out before they
 

3155
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:31,349
they probably get washed out before they
do anything else.

3156
01:05:31,349 --> 01:05:31,359

 

3157
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:33,349

fix through that 1950. Might want that

3158
01:05:33,349 --> 01:05:33,359
fix through that 1950. Might want that
 

3159
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,829
fix through that 1950. Might want that
20 retest after taking out previous day

3160
01:05:35,829 --> 01:05:35,839
20 retest after taking out previous day
 

3161
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:40,150
20 retest after taking out previous day
low.

3162
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:40,160

 

3163
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,309

That 800's still a huge level, right?

3164
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:42,319
That 800's still a huge level, right?
 

3165
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:43,829
That 800's still a huge level, right?
800 is still a huge level where that

3166
01:05:43,829 --> 01:05:43,839
800 is still a huge level where that
 

3167
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,710
800 is still a huge level where that
seller came in. Big delta there. Look,

3168
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:46,720
seller came in. Big delta there. Look,
 

3169
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,470
seller came in. Big delta there. Look,
there's still bidding in front of 50s.

3170
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:48,480
there's still bidding in front of 50s.
 

3171
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,990
there's still bidding in front of 50s.
Why not just go and swipe it all out?

3172
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:50,000
Why not just go and swipe it all out?
 

3173
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,950
Why not just go and swipe it all out?
It's beyond me. Back towards the 800

3174
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:52,960

01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,710

Guy at 50s. And then remember down here

3182
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:14,720
Guy at 50s. And then remember down here
 

3183
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,910
Guy at 50s. And then remember down here
14s was the big level. And actually my

3184
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:17,920
14s was the big level. And actually my
 

3185
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,150
14s was the big level. And actually my
VWAP on Ninja Trader is way different to

3186
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:20,160
VWAP on Ninja Trader is way different to
 

3187
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,150
VWAP on Ninja Trader is way different to
this as well. My 24-hour VWAP is down at

3188
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:22,160
this as well. My 24-hour VWAP is down at
 

3189
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,630
this as well. My 24-hour VWAP is down at
09. Right, there's 50s filled. They're

3190
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:24,640
09. Right, there's 50s filled. They're
 

3191
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,069
09. Right, there's 50s filled. They're
going to add lower now and try and swipe

3192
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:26,079
going to add lower now and try and swipe
 

3193
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,510
going to add lower now and try and swipe
this by the looks of it like we talked

3194
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:27,520
this by the looks of it like we talked
 

3195
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,750
this by the looks of it like we talked
about. So big seller came in there at

3196
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:29,760
about. So big seller came in there at
 

3197
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,029
about. So big seller came in there at
50s again. So he might get trapped if

3198
01:06:33,029 --> 01:06:33,039
50s again. So he might get trapped if
 

3199
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:36,870
50s again. So he might get trapped if
they can't get down to the uh 14. So

3200
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:36,880
they can't get down to the uh 14. So
 

3201
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,190
they can't get down to the uh 14. So
that big seller at 50s might get trapped

3202
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:39,200
that big seller at 50s might get trapped
 

3203
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,190
that big seller at 50s might get trapped
now as well. Here's the lift. So

It's dirty what they've done, but

3322
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:12,480
It's dirty what they've done, but
 

3323
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,149
It's dirty what they've done, but
they've washed out 50s. Remember I said

3324
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:14,159
they've washed out 50s. Remember I said
 

3325
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:15,590
they've washed out 50s. Remember I said
they wanted to fill 50s. They trapped

3326
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:15,600
they wanted to fill 50s. They trapped
 

3327
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,590
they wanted to fill 50s. They trapped
the seller. They reclaimed. They've come

3328
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:17,600
the seller. They reclaimed. They've come
 

3329
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,510
the seller. They reclaimed. They've come
to here. If they reclaim here, the drift

3330
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:19,520
to here. If they reclaim here, the drift
 

3331
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,189
to here. If they reclaim here, the drift
will be between these two now. As long

3332
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:21,199
will be between these two now. As long
 

3333
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:23,189
will be between these two now. As long
as they can base above this, right? If

3334
01:09:23,189 --> 01:09:23,199
as they can base above this, right? If
 

3335
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:24,630
as they can base above this, right? If
they can't base above this, they can

3336
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:24,640
they can't base above this, they can
 

3337
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,390
they can't base above this, they can
keep rotating in here like they already

3338
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:26,400
keep rotating in here like they already
 

3339
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,910
keep rotating in here like they already
have. But if they can base above this,

3340
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:27,920
have. But if they can base above this,
 

3341
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,430
have. But if they can base above this,
this would be the next move. And we do

3342
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:29,440
this would be the next move. And we do
 

3343
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,030
this would be the next move. And we do
have unfinished business. They really

3344
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:31,040
have unfinished business. They really
 

3345
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:42,470
have unfinished business. They really
want to get up into there.

3346
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:42,480

 

3347
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,229

How do we know when you enter a trade

3348
01:09:44,229 --> 01:09:44,239
How do we know when you enter a trade
 

3349
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:45,990
How do we know when you enter a trade
besides the fact of you telling us

3350
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:46,000
besides the fact of you telling us
 

3351
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,669
besides the fact of you telling us
you're in the trade when you're taking

3352
01:09:47,669 --> 01:09:47,679
you're in the trade when you're taking
 

3353
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:49,349
you're in the trade when you're taking
profits?

3354
01:09:49,349 --> 01:09:49,359
profits?
 

3355
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:51,510
profits?
I don't know. Rewind Prodigy again.

3356
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:51,520
I don't know. Rewind Prodigy again.
 

3357
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,030
I don't know. Rewind Prodigy again.
You're just the same guy over and over

3358
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:53,040
You're just the same guy over and over
 

3359
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,709
You're just the same guy over and over
over again. Guy, dude, I'm not going to

3360
01:09:54,709 --> 01:09:54,719
over again. Guy, dude, I'm not going to
 

3361
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:57,590
over again. Guy, dude, I'm not going to
hold your dick. It might be ugly for all

3362
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:57,600
hold your dick. It might be ugly for all
 

3363
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,950
hold your dick. It might be ugly for all
I know. Why does it matter when I'm

3364
01:09:58,950 --> 01:09:58,960
I know. Why does it matter when I'm
 

3365
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,390
I know. Why does it matter when I'm
entering the trade when I'm telling you

3366
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:00,400
entering the trade when I'm telling you
 

3367
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,470
entering the trade when I'm telling you
what you want?

3368
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:02,480
what you want?
 

3369
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,709
what you want?
Why does it matter? So, what you're

3370
01:10:04,709 --> 01:10:04,719
Why does it matter? So, what you're
 

3371
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:06,709
Why does it matter? So, what you're
telling me is you don't know how to

3372
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:06,719
telling me is you don't know how to
 

3373
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,189
telling me is you don't know how to
trade and you want someone to just

3374
01:10:09,189 --> 01:10:09,199
trade and you want someone to just
 

3375
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:12,070
trade and you want someone to just
signal you and that's how you think

3376
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:12,080
signal you and that's how you think
 

3377
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,669
signal you and that's how you think
you're going to make a career trading.

3378
01:10:13,669 --> 01:10:13,679
you're going to make a career trading.
 

3379
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:15,510
you're going to make a career trading.
That's that's the truth of what you're

3380
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:15,520
That's that's the truth of what you're
 

3381

That's the the real truth of what you're

That's the the real truth of what you're
saying. When you digest everything

01:10:20,709 --> 01:10:20,719
saying. When you digest everything
 

3387
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:22,310

me saying I am getting long at this
 

3397
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,669
me saying I am getting long at this
level even though there's a lag and that

3398
01:10:37,669 --> 01:10:37,679
level even though there's a lag and that
 

3399
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:39,669
level even though there's a lag and that
you already don't know how to trade.

3400

you already don't know how to trade.
 

3401

3413
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:08,070
be reactionary, guys. Like you like
you don't understand. Like if I'm seeing

3414
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:08,080
you don't understand. Like if I'm seeing
 

3415
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,510
you don't understand. Like if I'm seeing
someone trapped there and I see the

3416
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:09,520
someone trapped there and I see the
 

3417
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,950
someone trapped there and I see the
reversal, I've got to take it then and

3418
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:10,960
reversal, I've got to take it then and
 

3419
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,270
reversal, I've got to take it then and
there, right? I can't be like, there's

3420
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:13,280
there, right? I can't be like, there's
 

3421
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,270
there, right? I can't be like, there's
going to be a guy trapped here for sure.

3422
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:15,280
going to be a guy trapped here for sure.
 

3423
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,709
going to be a guy trapped here for sure.
100%. I'm ICT. I know. No, we don't know

3424
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:18,719
100%. I'm ICT. I know. No, we don't know
 

3425
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:21,110
100%. I'm ICT. I know. No, we don't know
until he comes on the book. All right,

3426
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:21,120
until he comes on the book. All right,
 

3427
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,270
until he comes on the book. All right,
here we go. So, we just talked about

3428
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:23,280
here we go. So, we just talked about
 

3429
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,110
here we go. So, we just talked about
that for guy that wants me to spell

3430
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:25,120
that for guy that wants me to spell
 

3431
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,630
that for guy that wants me to spell
everything [\h__\h] out. All right,

3432
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:26,640
everything [\h__\h] out. All right,
 

3433
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,070
everything [\h__\h] out. All right,
there's the trap. If we get through

3434
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:28,080
there's the trap. If we get through
 

3435
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,910
there's the trap. If we get through
there, we're going to go gray to gray.

3436
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:29,920
there, we're going to go gray to gray.
 

3437
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,350
there, we're going to go gray to gray.
And if we lift here, there is a

3438
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:31,360
And if we lift here, there is a
 

3439
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,870
And if we lift here, there is a
potential to take out this high of day

3440
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:32,880
potential to take out this high of day
 

3441
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:36,149
potential to take out this high of day
and come up for 25,050. I like don't

3442
01:11:36,149 --> 01:11:36,159
and come up for 25,050. I like don't
 

3443
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,470
and come up for 25,050. I like don't
know. Maybe rewind the last 30 seconds.

3444
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:38,480
know. Maybe rewind the last 30 seconds.
 

3445
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,390
know. Maybe rewind the last 30 seconds.
Gray to gray. There's greater gray for

3446
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:40,400
Gray to gray. There's greater gray for
 

3447

3449
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,590
you. Do you want me to Shall I hold it?
Is it that big or that big? Two hands,

3450
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:45,600
Is it that big or that big? Two hands,
 

3451
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:57,350
Is it that big or that big? Two hands,
finger. I don't know. You tell me.

3452
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:57,360

 

3453

It's always like It's always something
 

3459

It's always like It's always something
like that.

3460
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:08,480
like that.
 

3461
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,030
like that.
Okay, back to value area high and if we

3462
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:11,040
Okay, back to value area high and if we
 

3463
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,350
Okay, back to value area high and if we
get acceptance through this uh potential

3464
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:13,360
get acceptance through this uh potential
 

3465
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,669
get acceptance through this uh potential
stop run. We know buyers got trapped at

3466
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:15,679
stop run. We know buyers got trapped at
 

3467
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:16,950

01:12:18,229 --> 01:12:18,239
where did those buyers start getting
 

3471
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:20,550

think it's quite as good, but it's
pretty good. All right, we're trying to

3694
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:08,400
pretty good. All right, we're trying to
 

3695
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,390
pretty good. All right, we're trying to
lift for these imbalances. You can see

3696

lift for these imbalances. You can see
 

3697
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,110
lift for these imbalances. You can see
like I said 40 44s is where they got

3698
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:13,120
like I said 40 44s is where they got
 

3699
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,790
like I said 40 44s is where they got
really stuck. They are trying to fill

3700
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:14,800
really stuck. They are trying to fill
 

3701
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,310
really stuck. They are trying to fill
some of these sell side. We can also

3702
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:16,320
some of these sell side. We can also
 

3703
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:20,310
some of these sell side. We can also
also think about you know this you're

3704
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:20,320
also think about you know this you're
 

3705
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:21,830
also think about you know this you're
coming into golden pocket. So if you get

3706
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:21,840
coming into golden pocket. So if you get
 

3707
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,750
coming into golden pocket. So if you get
lucky fill some of this but I would not

3708
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:23,760
lucky fill some of this but I would not
 

3709
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,390
lucky fill some of this but I would not
guarantee that you get over all of it

3710
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:26,400
guarantee that you get over all of it
 

3711
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,709
guarantee that you get over all of it
cuz we are in a rotation. And where's

01:17:30,149 --> 01:17:30,159
the top of the rotation? Well right now
 

3715
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:33,510
the top of the rotation? Well right now
it's right here to here. No acceptance

we're going to start doing this and
 

3721
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,590
we're going to start doing this and
moving value higher. It's possible.

3722
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:41,600
moving value higher. It's possible.

like here. Maybe I can show it to you on
 

3753
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,630
like here. Maybe I can show it to you on
the lower time frame and just put in an

3754

the lower time frame and just put in an
 

3755
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,149
the lower time frame and just put in an
hourly chart here and it won't be

hourly chart here and it won't be
 

3757
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:29,750
hourly chart here and it won't be
annoying. No, like I've got no data. I

how the market operates, right? We were

3776
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:52,400
how the market operates, right? We were
 

3777
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,709
how the market operates, right? We were
swing short or we were short here.

3778
01:18:54,709 --> 01:18:54,719
swing short or we were short here.
 

3779
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,910
swing short or we were short here.
Right? So, we left for yet another time.

3780
01:18:57,910 --> 01:18:57,920
Right? So, we left for yet another time.
 

3781
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,110
Right? So, we left for yet another time.
We left volume trapped, we drifted down,

3782
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:01,120
We left volume trapped, we drifted down,
 

3783
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,189
We left volume trapped, we drifted down,
we did a two-leg, and they got short

3784
01:19:03,189 --> 01:19:03,199
we did a two-leg, and they got short
 

3785
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:05,990
we did a two-leg, and they got short
here, right? And then we collapsed down

3786
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:06,000
here, right? And then we collapsed down
 

3787
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,229
here, right? And then we collapsed down
and we get the 200 day. So most people

3788
01:19:08,229 --> 01:19:08,239
and we get the 200 day. So most people
 

3789
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:10,149
and we get the 200 day. So most people
would cover like 80% of their position

3790
01:19:10,149 --> 01:19:10,159
would cover like 80% of their position
 

3791
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:12,390
would cover like 80% of their position
into that 200 day. All right, then we

3792
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:12,400
into that 200 day. All right, then we
 

3793
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,709
into that 200 day. All right, then we
start to recover. All right, so there we

3794
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:14,719
start to recover. All right, so there we
 

3795
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:17,430
start to recover. All right, so there we
start to recover, right? So where are

3796
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:17,440
start to recover, right? So where are
 

3797
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,950
start to recover, right? So where are
they going to run? They're going to run

3798
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:18,960
they going to run? They're going to run
 

3799
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,950
they going to run? They're going to run
the swing stops here. All right, so they

3800
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:20,960
the swing stops here. All right, so they
 

3801
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,630
the swing stops here. All right, so they
run the swing stops out, which means

3802
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:22,640
run the swing stops out, which means
 

3803
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,950
run the swing stops out, which means
what? Above that mark, retail starts

3804
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:24,960
what? Above that mark, retail starts
 

3805
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,510
what? Above that mark, retail starts
buying because they're silly. Also at

3806
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:27,520
buying because they're silly. Also at
 

3807
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,630
buying because they're silly. Also at
that mark, anyone who is short becomes

3808
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:30,640
that mark, anyone who is short becomes
 

3809
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,550
that mark, anyone who is short becomes
uh stops out and becomes a cover. That

3810
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:32,560
uh stops out and becomes a cover. That
 

3811
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,270
uh stops out and becomes a cover. That
cover is a market buy order, right? Once

3812
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:35,280
cover is a market buy order, right? Once
 

3813
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,910
cover is a market buy order, right? Once
we get enough market buy orders, right,

3814
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:37,920
we get enough market buy orders, right,
 

3815
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,709
we get enough market buy orders, right,
then it gives the opportunity for bigger

3816
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:40,719
then it gives the opportunity for bigger
 

3817
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:43,270
then it gives the opportunity for bigger
hedge funds to sell into because you

3818
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:43,280
hedge funds to sell into because you
 

3819
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,110
hedge funds to sell into because you
cannot just sell without someone the

3820
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:45,120
cannot just sell without someone the
 

3821
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,709
cannot just sell without someone the
other side. So I will give you an

3822
01:19:46,709 --> 01:19:46,719
other side. So I will give you an
 

3823
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:49,750
other side. So I will give you an
example here. Let's say someone

3824
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:49,760
example here. Let's say someone
 

3825
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,590
example here. Let's say someone
overnight bought 10,000 contracts down

3826
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:53,600
overnight bought 10,000 contracts down
 

3827
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,229
overnight bought 10,000 contracts down
here long, right, off the 200 day,

3828
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:56,239
here long, right, off the 200 day,
 

3829
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:57,669
here long, right, off the 200 day,
right? Let's just say someone bought

3830
01:19:57,669 --> 01:19:57,679
right? Let's just say someone bought
 

3831
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:00,070
right? Let's just say someone bought
10,000 contracts long, a hedge fund,

3832
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:00,080
10,000 contracts long, a hedge fund,
 

3833
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,430
10,000 contracts long, a hedge fund,
right? Where are they going to sell

3834
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:01,440
right? Where are they going to sell
 

3835
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,669
right? Where are they going to sell
that? they're going to need to sell that

3836
01:20:03,669 --> 01:20:03,679
that? they're going to need to sell that
 

3837
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:07,030
that? they're going to need to sell that
where there is going to be a seller

3838
01:20:07,030 --> 01:20:07,040
where there is going to be a seller
 

3839
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,790
where there is going to be a seller
uh sorry a buyer. So if they're going to

3840
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:08,800
uh sorry a buyer. So if they're going to
 

3841
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,709
uh sorry a buyer. So if they're going to
sell their 10,000 contracts long,

3842
01:20:10,709 --> 01:20:10,719
sell their 10,000 contracts long,
 

3843
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:12,550
sell their 10,000 contracts long,
they're going to need a buyer of 10,000

3844
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:12,560
they're going to need a buyer of 10,000
 

3845
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,310
they're going to need a buyer of 10,000
contracts long. The easiest place for

3846
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:14,320
contracts long. The easiest place for
 

3847
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,630
contracts long. The easiest place for
that to happen is in a swing point

3848
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:16,640
that to happen is in a swing point
 

3849
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:20,070
that to happen is in a swing point
because here, let's say we have 5,000

3850
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:20,080
because here, let's say we have 5,000
 

3851
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,229
because here, let's say we have 5,000
retail traders get long for the

3852
01:20:22,229 --> 01:20:22,239
retail traders get long for the
 

3853
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:25,189
retail traders get long for the
breakout. And let's say we have 5,000

3854
01:20:25,189 --> 01:20:25,199
breakout. And let's say we have 5,000
 

3855
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:28,709
breakout. And let's say we have 5,000
short swing traders stop out. 5,000,

3856
01:20:28,709 --> 01:20:28,719
short swing traders stop out. 5,000,
 

3857
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:31,830
short swing traders stop out. 5,000,
right? Right. plus 5,000 is 10,000

3858
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:31,840
right? Right. plus 5,000 is 10,000
 

3859
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,910
right? Right. plus 5,000 is 10,000
because we've got 5,000 market order

3860
01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:33,920
because we've got 5,000 market order
 

3861
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:37,270
because we've got 5,000 market order
buying for retail and we've got 5,000

3862
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:37,280
buying for retail and we've got 5,000
 

3863
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,270
buying for retail and we've got 5,000
uh sell stops which become market buy

3864
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:39,280
uh sell stops which become market buy
 

3865
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,669
uh sell stops which become market buy
orders which means this can pair off

3866
01:20:41,669 --> 01:20:41,679
orders which means this can pair off
 

3867
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:44,070
orders which means this can pair off
this without being seen on the book.

3868
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:44,080
this without being seen on the book.
 

3869
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:45,990
this without being seen on the book.
Boom. Perfect. All right. And that's how

3870
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:46,000
Boom. Perfect. All right. And that's how
 

3871
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,229
Boom. Perfect. All right. And that's how
the market operates with big size.

3872
01:20:48,229 --> 01:20:48,239
the market operates with big size.
 

3873
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,310
the market operates with big size.
That's why it hunt stops. When everyone

3874
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:50,320
That's why it hunt stops. When everyone
 

3875
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,990
That's why it hunt stops. When everyone
wants to know why does it hunt stops?

3876
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:52,000
wants to know why does it hunt stops?
 

3877
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,550
wants to know why does it hunt stops?
That's why it hunt stops. It's for the

3878
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:54,560
That's why it hunt stops. It's for the
 

3879
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,830
That's why it hunt stops. It's for the
auction for repairing because remember

3880
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:57,840
auction for repairing because remember
 

3881
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,350
auction for repairing because remember
we cannot complete an auction. We cannot

3882
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:01,360
we cannot complete an auction. We cannot
 

3883
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,990
we cannot complete an auction. We cannot
shake hands on anything unless there is

3884
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:04,000
shake hands on anything unless there is
 

3885
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,310
shake hands on anything unless there is
a buyer and a seller. And one has got to

3886
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:06,320
a buyer and a seller. And one has got to
 

3887
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,070
a buyer and a seller. And one has got to
be aggressive and one's got to be

3888
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:08,080
be aggressive and one's got to be
 

3889
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,870
be aggressive and one's got to be
passive. Right? What do I mean by that?

3890
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:10,880
passive. Right? What do I mean by that?
 

3891
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,350
passive. Right? What do I mean by that?
One's going to be market side and one's

3892
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:13,360
One's going to be market side and one's
 

3893
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,750
One's going to be market side and one's
going to be limit side. Right? So if we

3894
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:15,760
going to be limit side. Right? So if we
 

3895
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,630
going to be limit side. Right? So if we
have

3896
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:18,640
have
 

3897
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,590
have
up here, all right, if we have stops up

3898
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:21,600
up here, all right, if we have stops up
 

3899
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:26,070
up here, all right, if we have stops up
here, they are going to be market buy

3900
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:26,080
here, they are going to be market buy
 

3901
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,709
here, they are going to be market buy
orders. All right, a sell stop, a sell

3902
01:21:28,709 --> 01:21:28,719
orders. All right, a sell stop, a sell
 

3903
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,790
orders. All right, a sell stop, a sell
limit there will actually becomes a

3904
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:30,800
limit there will actually becomes a
 

3905
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:34,390
limit there will actually becomes a
market buy order. And if we were buying

3906
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:34,400
market buy order. And if we were buying
 

3907
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,229
market buy order. And if we were buying
here and we want to sell up there, we

3908
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:36,239
here and we want to sell up there, we
 

3909
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:38,310
here and we want to sell up there, we
can put a limit order. So we're going to

3910
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:38,320
can put a limit order. So we're going to
 

3911
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,229
can put a limit order. So we're going to
be a passive seller and we're going to

3912
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:40,239
be a passive seller and we're going to
 

3913
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:42,630
be a passive seller and we're going to
use the aggressive buyer and that is

3914
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:42,640
use the aggressive buyer and that is
 

3915
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,229
use the aggressive buyer and that is
where the auction is done. That's where

3916
01:21:44,229 --> 01:21:44,239
where the auction is done. That's where
 

3917
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:46,470
where the auction is done. That's where
we complete and shake hands. If you just

3918
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:46,480
we complete and shake hands. If you just
 

3919
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,310
we complete and shake hands. If you just
have two limit orders, right, on the

3920
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:48,320
have two limit orders, right, on the
 

3921
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,630
have two limit orders, right, on the
book, if someone's only willing to buy

3922
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:50,640
book, if someone's only willing to buy
 

3923
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,149
book, if someone's only willing to buy
down here and they're only willing to

3924
01:21:52,149 --> 01:21:52,159

guy says, "Do you know what? I'm now

3950
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:19,120

3953
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,709
willing to sell for $40,000." And Alex
says, "Do you know what? I'll meet you

3954
01:22:22,709 --> 01:22:22,719
says, "Do you know what? I'll meet you

01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:25,990
says, "Do you know what? I'll meet you

complete the auction and a deal is done.

complete the auction and a deal is done.
 

3959

Right? That is literally what's

3960
01:22:29,189 --> 01:22:29,199
Right? That is literally what's
 

3961
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:31,189
Right? That is literally what's
happening every second of every candle.

3962
01:22:31,189 --> 01:22:31,199
happening every second of every candle.
 

3963
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:32,709
happening every second of every candle.
So, when we look at the DOM, when you

3964
01:22:32,709 --> 01:22:32,719
So, when we look at the DOM, when you
 

3965
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:34,870
So, when we look at the DOM, when you
understand what's actually going on in

3966
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:34,880
understand what's actually going on in
 

3967
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,229
understand what's actually going on in
the auction, when someone says, "I'm

3968
01:22:36,229 --> 01:22:36,239
the auction, when someone says, "I'm
 

3969
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:37,750
the auction, when someone says, "I'm
reading the tape, it's not [\h__\h]

3970
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:37,760
reading the tape, it's not [\h__\h]
 

3971
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,629
reading the tape, it's not [\h__\h]
candles." That really pisses me off.

3972
01:22:40,629 --> 01:22:40,639
candles." That really pisses me off.
 

3973
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:42,390
candles." That really pisses me off.
This is the tape, the level two. Well,

3974
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:42,400
This is the tape, the level two. Well,
 

3975
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,669
This is the tape, the level two. Well,
technically the tape is the time in

3976
01:22:43,669 --> 01:22:43,679
technically the tape is the time in
 

3977
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:45,189
technically the tape is the time in
sales, right? And the way we're jumping

3978
01:22:45,189 --> 01:22:45,199
sales, right? And the way we're jumping
 

3979
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,270
sales, right? And the way we're jumping
up and down is we are filling orders.

3980
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:47,280
up and down is we are filling orders.
 

3981
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,790
up and down is we are filling orders.
So, these are market orders. These are

3982
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:48,800
So, these are market orders. These are
 

3983
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,709
So, these are market orders. These are
limit orders. This guy here is a passive

3984
01:22:50,709 --> 01:22:50,719
limit orders. This guy here is a passive
 

3985
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:53,910
limit orders. This guy here is a passive
seller at 9:15, right? 100 lot passive

3986
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:53,920
seller at 9:15, right? 100 lot passive
 

3987
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,470
seller at 9:15, right? 100 lot passive
seller at 9:15. To fill him, we're going

3988
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:56,480
seller at 9:15. To fill him, we're going
 

3989
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,629
seller at 9:15. To fill him, we're going
to need to have an aggressive buyer, a

3990
01:22:58,629 --> 01:22:58,639
to need to have an aggressive buyer, a
 

3991
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:01,030
to need to have an aggressive buyer, a
market buyer at 9:15. And it's going to

3992
01:23:01,030 --> 01:23:01,040
market buyer at 9:15. And it's going to
 

3993
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:05,270
market buyer at 9:15. And it's going to
have to be 102 lot size or more.

3994
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:05,280
have to be 102 lot size or more.
 

3995
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:15,270
have to be 102 lot size or more.
Hopefully, that makes sense.

3996
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:15,280

 

3997

4047
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:15,590
9:18 all the time we're above 918 we can
be bullish because that is a big buyer

01:24:40,149 --> 01:24:40,159
buyer stuck at 50. I'm going to give you
 

4073
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,590
buyer stuck at 50. I'm going to give you
the levels. There was a buyer stuck at

4074
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:41,600
the levels. There was a buyer stuck at
 

4075
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,990
the levels. There was a buyer stuck at
50 and then the next buyer is stuck at

4076
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:44,000
50 and then the next buyer is stuck at
 

4077
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,870
50 and then the next buyer is stuck at
73. All right. And we are starting to

4078
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:46,880
73. All right. And we are starting to
 

4079
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,030
73. All right. And we are starting to
lift. So if you want to mark these on

4080
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:49,040
lift. So if you want to mark these on
 

4081
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,830
lift. So if you want to mark these on
your chart, 18's a big level, 50 is a

4082
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:51,840
your chart, 18's a big level, 50 is a
 

4083
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:58,629
your chart, 18's a big level, 50 is a
big level, and 73 is a big level.

4084
01:24:58,629 --> 01:24:58,639

 

4085
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:00,470

That ain't that ain't guess work. That

4086
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:00,480
That ain't that ain't guess work. That
 

4087
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,830
That ain't that ain't guess work. That
ain't some [\h__\h] fair value gap or

4088
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:03,840
ain't some [\h__\h] fair value gap or
 

4089
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,430
ain't some [\h__\h] fair value gap or
anything like that. That is actual

4090
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:05,440
anything like that. That is actual
 

4091
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,950
anything like that. That is actual
orders which took place on the book

4092
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:06,960
orders which took place on the book
 

4093
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,110
orders which took place on the book
which you will only be able to see if

4094
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:09,120
which you will only be able to see if
 

4095
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:17,830
which you will only be able to see if
you are actually watching the book.

4096
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:17,840

 

4097
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,430

Sorry guys, catching up with what you're

4098
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:19,440
Sorry guys, catching up with what you're
 

4099
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:25,270
Sorry guys, catching up with what you're
saying now.

4100
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:25,280

 

4101
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:28,310

How am I seeing this? Uh what you what

4102
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:28,320
How am I seeing this? Uh what you what
 

4103
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,709
How am I seeing this? Uh what you what
do you mean? I'm seeing the thing the

4104
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:30,719
do you mean? I'm seeing the thing the
 

4105
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:32,870
do you mean? I'm seeing the thing the
the the chart I just showed you was

4106
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:32,880
the the chart I just showed you was
 

4107
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,110
the the chart I just showed you was
bookmap. Okay. So you can see it on

4108
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:35,120
bookmap. Okay. So you can see it on
 

4109
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,590
bookmap. Okay. So you can see it on
bookmap or you can use footprints. Uh

4110
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:37,600
bookmap or you can use footprints. Uh
 

4111
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,669
bookmap or you can use footprints. Uh
you will not get delta side reads of

4112
01:25:39,669 --> 01:25:39,679
you will not get delta side reads of
 

4113
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:41,270
you will not get delta side reads of
delta on footprint. All right. It's the

4114
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:41,280
delta on footprint. All right. It's the
 

4115
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,950
delta on footprint. All right. It's the
only thing I don't like. But on Ninja

4116
01:25:42,950 --> 01:25:42,960
only thing I don't like. But on Ninja
 

4117
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,790
only thing I don't like. But on Ninja
Trader, right? If you want to see how I

4118
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:44,800
Trader, right? If you want to see how I
 

4119
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,790
Trader, right? If you want to see how I
see it on Ninja Trader, I have a delta

4120
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:46,800
see it on Ninja Trader, I have a delta
 

4121
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,870
see it on Ninja Trader, I have a delta
footprint on the side. So this is a big

4122
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:48,880
footprint on the side. So this is a big
 

4123
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,709
footprint on the side. So this is a big
buyer here who came in. All right, at 18

4124
01:25:50,709 --> 01:25:50,719
buyer here who came in. All right, at 18
 

4125
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:52,629
buyer here who came in. All right, at 18
or 17, whatever I called it, there's a

4126
01:25:52,629 --> 01:25:52,639
or 17, whatever I called it, there's a
 

4127
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:54,550
or 17, whatever I called it, there's a
big buyer stuck at 50 and there's a big

4128
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:54,560
big buyer stuck at 50 and there's a big
 

4129
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,790
big buyer stuck at 50 and there's a big
buyer stuck at 72. There's a seller

4130
01:25:56,790 --> 01:25:56,800
buyer stuck at 72. There's a seller
 

4131
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,950
buyer stuck at 72. There's a seller
stuck underneath us at 88. And the big

4132
01:25:58,950 --> 01:25:58,960
stuck underneath us at 88. And the big
 

4133
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,110
stuck underneath us at 88. And the big
seller that we used to move higher today

4134
01:26:01,110 --> 01:26:01,120
seller that we used to move higher today
 

4135
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:02,870
seller that we used to move higher today
was right down here at 50. Right? See

4136
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:02,880
was right down here at 50. Right? See
 

4137
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,790
was right down here at 50. Right? See
this red line? Maybe you can see that.

4138
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:04,800
this red line? Maybe you can see that.
 

4139
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,510
this red line? Maybe you can see that.
Maybe I got to move this up. Right. This

4140
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:07,520
Maybe I got to move this up. Right. This
 

4141
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,110
Maybe I got to move this up. Right. This
is where these sellers are stuck. These

4142
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:09,120
is where these sellers are stuck. These
 

4143
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,470
is where these sellers are stuck. These
lows. Right. So we've got sellers stuck

4144
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:10,480
lows. Right. So we've got sellers stuck
 

4145
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,390
lows. Right. So we've got sellers stuck
at the lows down here. We've got a

4146
01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:12,400
at the lows down here. We've got a
 

4147
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,629
at the lows down here. We've got a
seller currently stuck at 87s, but we've

4148
01:26:14,629 --> 01:26:14,639
seller currently stuck at 87s, but we've
 

4149
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:17,270
seller currently stuck at 87s, but we've
got buyers stuck into 50. So a buyer

4150
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:17,280
got buyers stuck into 50. So a buyer
 

4151
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:21,030
got buyers stuck into 50. So a buyer
here 18, 50, and 72. So we want to be

4152
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:21,040
here 18, 50, and 72. So we want to be
 

4153
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,870
here 18, 50, and 72. So we want to be
aware of those guys because if they get

4154
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:22,880
aware of those guys because if they get
 

4155
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,550
aware of those guys because if they get
the chance to get out, break even or

4156
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:24,560
the chance to get out, break even or
 

4157
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,310
the chance to get out, break even or
near, there's a good chance they will,

4158
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:26,320
near, there's a good chance they will,
 

4159
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,910
near, there's a good chance they will,
right? Unless we see real aggression

4160
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:27,920
right? Unless we see real aggression
 

4161
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,310
right? Unless we see real aggression
stepping through. So if you got to think

4162
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:30,320
stepping through. So if you got to think
 

4163
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,149
stepping through. So if you got to think
about the psychology, imagine you bought

4164
01:26:32,149 --> 01:26:32,159
about the psychology, imagine you bought
 

4165
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:34,550
about the psychology, imagine you bought
up here in these levels and you didn't

4166
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:34,560
up here in these levels and you didn't
 

4167
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,669
up here in these levels and you didn't
stop out, right? And you held this whole

4168
01:26:37,669 --> 01:26:37,679
stop out, right? And you held this whole
 

4169
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:38,950
stop out, right? And you held this whole
thing. When it comes back up to that

4170
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:38,960
thing. When it comes back up to that
 

4171
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,070
thing. When it comes back up to that
level, what are you going to do?

4172
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:40,080
level, what are you going to do?
 

4173
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,990
level, what are you going to do?
Probably get out break even, right?

4174
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:42,000
Probably get out break even, right?
 

4175
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,830
Probably get out break even, right?
Probably just get out break even, right?

4176
01:26:43,830 --> 01:26:43,840
Probably just get out break even, right?
 

4177
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,430
Probably just get out break even, right?
So that's like the psychology of the

4178
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:45,440
So that's like the psychology of the
 

4179
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,189
So that's like the psychology of the
market. We trap buyers at the highs,

4180
01:26:47,189 --> 01:26:47,199
market. We trap buyers at the highs,
 

4181
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:48,870
market. We trap buyers at the highs,
which is what we sold into because we

4182
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:48,880
which is what we sold into because we
 

4183
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,310
which is what we sold into because we
weren't stupid. We weren't buying up

4184
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:50,320
weren't stupid. We weren't buying up
 

4185
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,310
weren't stupid. We weren't buying up
there. We bought here and sold here. You

4186
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:52,320
there. We bought here and sold here. You
 

4187
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,390
there. We bought here and sold here. You
could sell this low back down. Seller

4188
01:26:54,390 --> 01:26:54,400
could sell this low back down. Seller
 

4189
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,070
could sell this low back down. Seller
got stuck down here. We come back up to

4190
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:56,080
got stuck down here. We come back up to
 

4191
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,430
got stuck down here. We come back up to
these buyers. They probably get out

4192
01:26:57,430 --> 01:26:57,440
these buyers. They probably get out
 

4193
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,030
these buyers. They probably get out
break even. We might build liquidity.

4194
01:26:59,030 --> 01:26:59,040
break even. We might build liquidity.
 

4195
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,790
break even. We might build liquidity.
Maybe it does this, maybe it does this.

4196
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:00,800
Maybe it does this, maybe it does this.
 

4197
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,390
Maybe it does this, maybe it does this.
We're in a D-shape. We don't [\h__\h]

4198
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:02,400
We're in a D-shape. We don't [\h__\h]
 

4199
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,070
We're in a D-shape. We don't [\h__\h]
care. We make our money. We move on.

4200
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:04,080
care. We make our money. We move on.
 

4201
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,070
care. We make our money. We move on.
Right? But we always respect who's

4202
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:06,080
Right? But we always respect who's
 

4203
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,950
Right? But we always respect who's
trapped in the market. Always, always,

4204
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:08,960
trapped in the market. Always, always,
 

4205
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,350
trapped in the market. Always, always,
always on multiple time frames, we

4206
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:11,360
always on multiple time frames, we
 

4207
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:22,629
always on multiple time frames, we
respect who is trapped in the market.

4208
01:27:22,629 --> 01:27:22,639

 

4209
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:24,629

So, right now we build liquidity to the

4210
01:27:24,629 --> 01:27:24,639
So, right now we build liquidity to the
 

4211
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,870
So, right now we build liquidity to the
upside. It's It's possible. It's

4212
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:26,880
upside. It's It's possible. It's
 

4213
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,910
upside. It's It's possible. It's
possible. Um

4214
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:29,920
possible. Um
 

4215
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,830
possible. Um
I don't know if this profile's off. Now,

4216
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:31,840
I don't know if this profile's off. Now,
 

4217
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,430
I don't know if this profile's off. Now,
I kind of struggling to trust this

4218
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:33,440
I kind of struggling to trust this
 

4219
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,550
I kind of struggling to trust this
because I don't know if it's adjusted

4220
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:34,560
because I don't know if it's adjusted
 

4221
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,270
because I don't know if it's adjusted
with this gap or not. But yeah, like if

4222
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:37,280
with this gap or not. But yeah, like if
 

4223
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:38,790
with this gap or not. But yeah, like if
we think about this, right, remember we

4224
01:27:38,790 --> 01:27:38,800
we think about this, right, remember we
 

4225
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:39,990
we think about this, right, remember we
talked about the very beginning of the

4226
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:40,000
talked about the very beginning of the
 

4227
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:45,030
talked about the very beginning of the
day. This is the current week's volume.

4228
01:27:45,030 --> 01:27:45,040

 

4229
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,669

Okay, today we've had no acceptance

4230
01:27:47,669 --> 01:27:47,679
Okay, today we've had no acceptance
 

4231
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,350
Okay, today we've had no acceptance
under this, have we? So, all of this

4232
01:27:49,350 --> 01:27:49,360
under this, have we? So, all of this
 

4233
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,229
under this, have we? So, all of this
overnight, no acceptance. Trend is still

4234
01:27:52,229 --> 01:27:52,239
overnight, no acceptance. Trend is still
 

4235
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:55,510
overnight, no acceptance. Trend is still
very much down and we're coming into

4236
01:27:55,510 --> 01:27:55,520
very much down and we're coming into
 

4237
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,350
very much down and we're coming into
this area, right? If we find acceptance

4238
01:27:57,350 --> 01:27:57,360
this area, right? If we find acceptance
 

4239
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,629
this area, right? If we find acceptance
over this area, we're going to probably

4240
01:27:58,629 --> 01:27:58,639
over this area, we're going to probably
 

4241
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:01,430
over this area, we're going to probably
attack this area here, 25,50.

4242
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:01,440
attack this area here, 25,50.
 

4243
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:02,870
attack this area here, 25,50.
There is a node here. There's a big

4244
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:02,880
There is a node here. There's a big
 

4245
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,629
There is a node here. There's a big
reason to get up there. It's very

4246
01:28:04,629 --> 01:28:04,639
reason to get up there. It's very
 

4247
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:07,110
reason to get up there. It's very
possible we come up there. I would not

4248
01:28:07,110 --> 01:28:07,120
possible we come up there. I would not
 

4249
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:11,110
possible we come up there. I would not
uh through that you could say 25,140s

4250
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:11,120
uh through that you could say 25,140s
 

4251
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,750
uh through that you could say 25,140s
through that 25,266s

4252
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:13,760
through that 25,266s
 

4253
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,229
through that 25,266s
through that 25,400. Do I think we're

4254
01:28:16,229 --> 01:28:16,239
through that 25,400. Do I think we're
 

4255
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:17,830
through that 25,400. Do I think we're
going to do that today? No. Do I think

4256
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:17,840
going to do that today? No. Do I think
 

4257
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,110
going to do that today? No. Do I think
we're going to do that next week? Yeah.

4258
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:19,120
we're going to do that next week? Yeah.
 

4259
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,510
we're going to do that next week? Yeah.
I think probably next week. All right.

4260
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:21,520
I think probably next week. All right.
 

4261
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,070
I think probably next week. All right.
We might see something like this and

4262
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:24,080
We might see something like this and
 

4263
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,830
We might see something like this and
then a resell down into here. And then

4264
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:25,840
then a resell down into here. And then
 

4265
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,350
then a resell down into here. And then
the market will need to make a decision.

4266
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:27,360
the market will need to make a decision.
 

4267
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:30,229
the market will need to make a decision.
Are we going to have the 5day 200 day

4268
01:28:30,229 --> 01:28:30,239
Are we going to have the 5day 200 day
 

4269
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:31,750
Are we going to have the 5day 200 day
cross and then we're going to start

4270
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:31,760
cross and then we're going to start
 

4271
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,070
cross and then we're going to start
trend lower? I don't know. We can judge

4272
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:34,080
trend lower? I don't know. We can judge
 

4273
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,669
trend lower? I don't know. We can judge
that when it happens. Right. What I'm

4274
01:28:35,669 --> 01:28:35,679
that when it happens. Right. What I'm
 

4275
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:37,750
that when it happens. Right. What I'm
talking about there is when we see big

4276
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:37,760
talking about there is when we see big
 

4277
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,910
talking about there is when we see big
trades downside, remember we hit the 200

4278
01:28:39,910 --> 01:28:39,920
trades downside, remember we hit the 200
 

4279
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,830
trades downside, remember we hit the 200
day. If we're going to go trend down,

4280
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:41,840
day. If we're going to go trend down,
 

4281
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,590
day. If we're going to go trend down,
we're going to need, you know, liquidity

4282
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:43,600
we're going to need, you know, liquidity
 

4283
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,110
we're going to need, you know, liquidity
to be built out in here, we're going to

4284
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:45,120
to be built out in here, we're going to
 

4285
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,790
to be built out in here, we're going to
need the 5day to come down here. We're

4286
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:46,800
need the 5day to come down here. We're
 

4287
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,310
need the 5day to come down here. We're
going to need to sell that and get the

4288
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:48,320
going to need to sell that and get the
 

4289
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:51,669
going to need to sell that and get the
cross. And then, and only then, can we

4290
01:28:51,669 --> 01:28:51,679
cross. And then, and only then, can we
 

4291
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:54,629
cross. And then, and only then, can we
think about this node here

4292
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:54,639
think about this node here
 

4293
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:56,790
think about this node here
and trading under that to this node here

4294
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:56,800
and trading under that to this node here
 

4295
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,629
and trading under that to this node here
and this node here. And who knows if

4296
01:28:58,629 --> 01:28:58,639
and this node here. And who knows if
 

4297
01:28:58,639 --> 01:28:59,990
and this node here. And who knows if
they got really thin down here. I tell

4298
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:00,000
they got really thin down here. I tell
 

4299
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,229
they got really thin down here. I tell
you what, if we come down here, bucking

4300
01:29:02,229 --> 01:29:02,239
you what, if we come down here, bucking
 

4301
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:04,070
you what, if we come down here, bucking
out. Uh I'm buying everything that

4302
01:29:04,070 --> 01:29:04,080
out. Uh I'm buying everything that
 

4303
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,070
out. Uh I'm buying everything that
moves.

4304
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:06,080
moves.
 

4305
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,990
moves.
Everything that moves. Cuz that would be

4306
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:08,000
Everything that moves. Cuz that would be
 

4307
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,590
Everything that moves. Cuz that would be
what? 20 20% down off the highs.

4308
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:13,600
what? 20 20% down off the highs.
 

4309
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,030
what? 20 20% down off the highs.
Even that be that much. Might not even

4310
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:15,040
Even that be that much. Might not even
 

4311
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:18,310
Even that be that much. Might not even
be that much. 16% down. Yeah. If we come

4312
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:18,320
be that much. 16% down. Yeah. If we come
 

4313
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:21,750
be that much. 16% down. Yeah. If we come
down 12 12%, what are we now? We hit a

4314
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:21,760
down 12 12%, what are we now? We hit a
 

4315
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,430
down 12 12%, what are we now? We hit a
low of 9% down. It's not that much. If

4316
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:23,440
low of 9% down. It's not that much. If
 

4317
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,709
low of 9% down. It's not that much. If
we can get down there, I'd be a very

4318
01:29:24,709 --> 01:29:24,719
we can get down there, I'd be a very
 

4319
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:26,870
we can get down there, I'd be a very
happy man.

4320
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:26,880
happy man.
 

4321
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,709
happy man.
Very happy man for multiple reasons.

4322
01:29:28,709 --> 01:29:28,719
Very happy man for multiple reasons.
 

4323
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:30,390
Very happy man for multiple reasons.
Remember, the lower we go, the more

4324
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:30,400
Remember, the lower we go, the more
 

4325
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,149
Remember, the lower we go, the more
panic we get, the more opportunity we

4326
01:29:32,149 --> 01:29:32,159
panic we get, the more opportunity we
 

4327
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:34,550
panic we get, the more opportunity we
get to buy in discount

4328
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:34,560
get to buy in discount
 

4329
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,669
get to buy in discount

01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,430
privately for people but we don't really
do one-on- ones. I don't have the time.

4372
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:29,440
do one-on- ones. I don't have the time.
 

4373
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,590
do one-on- ones. I don't have the time.
But what we're trying to do this year is

4374
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:31,600
But what we're trying to do this year is
 

4375
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,550
But what we're trying to do this year is
a group lesson of an hour or more every

4376
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:34,560
a group lesson of an hour or more every
 

4377
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,629
a group lesson of an hour or more every
two weeks. So I do a group lesson every

4378
01:30:36,629 --> 01:30:36,639
two weeks. So I do a group lesson every
 

4379
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:38,629
two weeks. So I do a group lesson every
two weeks and that's the chance where

4380
01:30:38,629 --> 01:30:38,639
two weeks and that's the chance where
 

4381
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,470
two weeks and that's the chance where
students can ask any question that they

students can ask any question that they
 

4383

Hey chat, is the course worth buying for
 

4445

Hey chat, is the course worth buying for
$699? Well, it's actually only $649 at

4446
01:32:03,669 --> 01:32:03,679
$699? Well, it's actually only $649 at
 

4447

How do I put it on the right side? Right

4456
01:32:23,189 --> 01:32:23,199
How do I put it on the right side? Right
 

4457
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:25,910
How do I put it on the right side? Right
here. Anchored volume profile placement.

4458
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:25,920
here. Anchored volume profile placement.
 

4459
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,830
here. Anchored volume profile placement.
Right. So, if you go from input to style

4460
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:27,840
Right. So, if you go from input to style
 

4461
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:31,990
Right. So, if you go from input to style
placement, right?

4462
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:32,000

 

4463
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,430

When does the Tyson trade come into

4464
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:33,440
When does the Tyson trade come into
 

4465
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:34,870
When does the Tyson trade come into
effect? Well, at the moment, we're not

4466
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:34,880
effect? Well, at the moment, we're not
 

4467
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,470
effect? Well, at the moment, we're not
at either IB. So, E ES is is at the IB

4468
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:38,480
at either IB. So, E ES is is at the IB
 

4469
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,950
at either IB. So, E ES is is at the IB
high, right? ES is at the IB high. We're

4470
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:40,960
high, right? ES is at the IB high. We're
 

4471
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,189
high, right? ES is at the IB high. We're
not there. So, we would need to see

4472
01:32:43,189 --> 01:32:43,199
not there. So, we would need to see
 

4473
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:45,189
not there. So, we would need to see
remember 44s. What did we tell? I'm

4474
01:32:45,189 --> 01:32:45,199
remember 44s. What did we tell? I'm
 

4475
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:46,790
remember 44s. What did we tell? I'm
going to have to remember these levels

4476
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:46,800
going to have to remember these levels
 

4477
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,310
going to have to remember these levels
where those buyers were stuck, right?

4478
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:48,320
where those buyers were stuck, right?
 

4479
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:50,629
where those buyers were stuck, right?
We're tapping into one now. So, 50s and

4480
01:32:50,629 --> 01:32:50,639
We're tapping into one now. So, 50s and
 

4481
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:53,189
We're tapping into one now. So, 50s and
then 73s. So, the Tyson trade would come

4482
01:32:53,189 --> 01:32:53,199
then 73s. So, the Tyson trade would come
 

4483
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:56,070
then 73s. So, the Tyson trade would come
into effect if we get stuck either

4484
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:56,080
into effect if we get stuck either
 

4485
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,870
into effect if we get stuck either
inside the IB or ideally for an IB

4486
01:32:58,870 --> 01:32:58,880
inside the IB or ideally for an IB
 

4487
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,910
inside the IB or ideally for an IB
failure. So, ideally, it would be a

4488
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,920
failure. So, ideally, it would be a
 

4489
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,070
failure. So, ideally, it would be a
breakout and a failure back under and

4490
01:33:04,070 --> 01:33:04,080
breakout and a failure back under and
 

4491
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,669
breakout and a failure back under and
then you could trade back down to V1.

4492
01:33:05,669 --> 01:33:05,679
then you could trade back down to V1.
 

4493
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:07,189
then you could trade back down to V1.
But look at how everything's sloping

4494
01:33:07,189 --> 01:33:07,199
But look at how everything's sloping
 

4495
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:13,669
But look at how everything's sloping

right 44s is where I said 44s to 50s so

4500
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:20,480
right 44s is where I said 44s to 50s so
 

4501
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:23,990
right 44s is where I said 44s to 50s so
his actual level is 50.25 25. Right. So,

4502
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:24,000
his actual level is 50.25 25. Right. So,
 

4503
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,669
his actual level is 50.25 25. Right. So,
see this reaction? We just talked about

4504
01:33:25,669 --> 01:33:25,679
see this reaction? We just talked about
 

4505
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:28,149
see this reaction? We just talked about
this guy right here. See this guy right

4506
01:33:28,149 --> 01:33:28,159
this guy right here. See this guy right
 

4507
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:29,510
this guy right here. See this guy right
here? We've just come short of him. So,

4508
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:29,520
here? We've just come short of him. So,
 

4509
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:30,709
here? We've just come short of him. So,
he's probably starting to try and get

4510
01:33:30,709 --> 01:33:30,719
he's probably starting to try and get
 

4511
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:32,870
he's probably starting to try and get
out now. We had another buyer step in at

4512
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:32,880
out now. We had another buyer step in at
 

4513
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:35,350
out now. We had another buyer step in at
19s. All right. So, there could be a

4514
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:35,360
19s. All right. So, there could be a
 

4515
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,870
19s. All right. So, there could be a
failed push here. There could easily be

4516
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:36,880
failed push here. There could easily be
 

4517
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,149
failed push here. There could easily be
a failed push here, especially with the

4518
01:33:38,149 --> 01:33:38,159
a failed push here, especially with the
 

4519
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:41,270
a failed push here, especially with the
divergence with ES, right? ES taking out

4520
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:41,280
divergence with ES, right? ES taking out
 

4521
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,270
divergence with ES, right? ES taking out
the IB high. So, ES might offer that

4522
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:43,280
the IB high. So, ES might offer that
 

4523
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,430
the IB high. So, ES might offer that
trade potentially. It still hasn't taken

4524
01:33:45,430 --> 01:33:45,440
trade potentially. It still hasn't taken
 

4525
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:47,510
trade potentially. It still hasn't taken
out previous day high. has a reason to

4526
01:33:47,510 --> 01:33:47,520
out previous day high. has a reason to
 

4527
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,510
out previous day high. has a reason to
go higher the ES, but if they're going

4528
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:49,520
go higher the ES, but if they're going
 

4529
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,910
go higher the ES, but if they're going
to do a rotation on ES, you'd want to

4530
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:51,920
to do a rotation on ES, you'd want to
 

4531
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:54,310
to do a rotation on ES, you'd want to
see this sort of break and then fail and

4532
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:54,320
see this sort of break and then fail and
 

4533
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:57,030
see this sort of break and then fail and
then come down into these.

4534
01:33:57,030 --> 01:33:57,040
then come down into these.
 

4535
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,910
then come down into these.
But just lower your expectations today.

4536
01:33:59,910 --> 01:33:59,920
But just lower your expectations today.
 

4537
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,830
But just lower your expectations today.
All right, we're we're in a rotational

4538
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:01,840
All right, we're we're in a rotational
 

4539
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,830
All right, we're we're in a rotational
market today.

4540
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:03,840
market today.
 

4541
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,430
market today.
This is not like the last two days where

4542
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:05,440
This is not like the last two days where
 

4543
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:07,750
This is not like the last two days where
we've been like gunning for three, four,

4544
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:07,760
we've been like gunning for three, four,
 

4545
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,750
we've been like gunning for three, four,
500 point trades. All right, it's it's a

4546
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:09,760
500 point trades. All right, it's it's a
 

4547
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,510
500 point trades. All right, it's it's a
different market today. Understand like

4548
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:11,520
different market today. Understand like
 

4549
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,550
different market today. Understand like
when to attack, when not. Last few days,

4550
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:14,560
when to attack, when not. Last few days,
 

4551
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,629
when to attack, when not. Last few days,
A+ setup, right? A plus setup. We

4552
01:34:16,629 --> 01:34:16,639
A+ setup, right? A plus setup. We
 

4553
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:18,470
A+ setup, right? A plus setup. We
attack. We attack. We attack. We attack

4554
01:34:18,470 --> 01:34:18,480
attack. We attack. We attack. We attack
 

4555
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:28,310
attack. We attack. We attack. We attack
today. BC setups.

4556
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:28,320

 

4557
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,390

How long I've been traded? Full-time?

4558
01:34:30,390 --> 01:34:30,400
How long I've been traded? Full-time?
 

4559
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,149
How long I've been traded? Full-time?
Six or seven years. But like I said, I

4560
01:34:32,149 --> 01:34:32,159
Six or seven years. But like I said, I
 

4561
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:35,590
Six or seven years. But like I said, I
started about 20 years ago,

4562
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:35,600
started about 20 years ago,
 

4563
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,510
started about 20 years ago,
but then had had another career for a

4564
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:37,520
but then had had another career for a
 

4565
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,910
but then had had another career for a
while. You consider any rotation trades

4566
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:39,920
while. You consider any rotation trades
 

4567
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,229
while. You consider any rotation trades
with D-shape? Yeah, D-shaped rotation,

4568
01:34:42,229 --> 01:34:42,239
with D-shape? Yeah, D-shaped rotation,
 

4569
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:45,189
with D-shape? Yeah, D-shaped rotation,
but also think think about the daily,

4570
01:34:45,189 --> 01:34:45,199
but also think think about the daily,
 

4571
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:47,590
but also think think about the daily,
right? We we it's a pullback day, right?

4572
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:47,600
right? We we it's a pullback day, right?
 

4573
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,270
right? We we it's a pullback day, right?
So, it's a pullback day, but we already

4574
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:49,280
So, it's a pullback day, but we already
 

4575
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:52,070
So, it's a pullback day, but we already
did most of this happened overnight. All

4576
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:52,080
did most of this happened overnight. All
 

4577
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,590
did most of this happened overnight. All
right, so it's very possible we just

4578
01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:53,600
right, so it's very possible we just
 

4579
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,310
right, so it's very possible we just
sort of bugger about in here for a

4580
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:56,320
sort of bugger about in here for a
 

4581
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:59,110
sort of bugger about in here for a
while, right? Very, very possible we do

4582
01:34:59,110 --> 01:34:59,120
while, right? Very, very possible we do
 

4583
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:00,310
while, right? Very, very possible we do
that and then next week we can see

4584
01:35:00,310 --> 01:35:00,320
that and then next week we can see
 

4585
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,310
that and then next week we can see
what's what.

4586
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:02,320
what's what.
 

4587
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,229
what's what.
So, kind of like this is a fail. It's a

4588
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:04,239
So, kind of like this is a fail. It's a
 

4589
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:05,430
So, kind of like this is a fail. It's a
look below and fail, right? If you think

4590
01:35:05,430 --> 01:35:05,440
look below and fail, right? If you think
 

4591
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,030
look below and fail, right? If you think
about where we open, look below and fail

4592
01:35:07,030 --> 01:35:07,040
about where we open, look below and fail
 

4593
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,709
about where we open, look below and fail
back in inside bar, right? Look below

4594
01:35:08,709 --> 01:35:08,719
back in inside bar, right? Look below
 

4595
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:10,149
back in inside bar, right? Look below
and fail inside bar. So there's your

4596
01:35:10,149 --> 01:35:10,159
and fail inside bar. So there's your
 

4597
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:11,910
and fail inside bar. So there's your
first clue. Second clue is profile.

4598
01:35:11,910 --> 01:35:11,920
first clue. Second clue is profile.
 

4599
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:15,350
first clue. Second clue is profile.
Third clue initial balance, right? IB,

4600
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:15,360
Third clue initial balance, right? IB,
 

4601
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,870
Third clue initial balance, right? IB,
right? Lots of reasons, right? Where's

4602
01:35:16,870 --> 01:35:16,880
right? Lots of reasons, right? Where's
 

4603
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,790
right? Lots of reasons, right? Where's
previous day low down here, right? So

4604
01:35:20,790 --> 01:35:20,800
previous day low down here, right? So
 

4605
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:23,270
previous day low down here, right? So
look below and fail. Previous day low.

4606
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:23,280
look below and fail. Previous day low.
 

4607
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:25,189
look below and fail. Previous day low.
Look below and fail. You can see we

4608
01:35:25,189 --> 01:35:25,199
Look below and fail. You can see we
 

4609
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:27,189
Look below and fail. You can see we
looked below,

4610
01:35:27,189 --> 01:35:27,199
looked below,
 

4611
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:29,669
looked below,
rejected, rejected, failed, reclaimed,

4612
01:35:29,669 --> 01:35:29,679
rejected, rejected, failed, reclaimed,
 

4613
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:31,350
rejected, rejected, failed, reclaimed,
held. All right. There's your look below

4614
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:31,360
held. All right. There's your look below
 

4615
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,189
held. All right. There's your look below
and fail overnight. That's your cue to

4616
01:35:33,189 --> 01:35:33,199
and fail overnight. That's your cue to
 

4617
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:35,430
and fail overnight. That's your cue to
go long. All right. What's the ultimate

4618
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:35,440
go long. All right. What's the ultimate
 

4619
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,110
go long. All right. What's the ultimate
target? Ultimate target would be

4620
01:35:37,110 --> 01:35:37,120
target? Ultimate target would be
 

4621
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:38,790
target? Ultimate target would be
previous day high right the way up here

4622
01:35:38,790 --> 01:35:38,800
previous day high right the way up here
 

4623
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,950
previous day high right the way up here
because that's the high previous day

4624
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:40,960
because that's the high previous day
 

4625
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:43,830
because that's the high previous day
right. So we're in inside bar in here.

4626
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:43,840
right. So we're in inside bar in here.
 

4627
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,350
right. So we're in inside bar in here.
So that is your first clue that it's

4628
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:45,360
So that is your first clue that it's
 

4629
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,950
So that is your first clue that it's
probably going to be choppy. The New

4630
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:46,960
probably going to be choppy. The New
 

4631
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,830
probably going to be choppy. The New
York session opened up where like here

4632
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:49,840
York session opened up where like here
 

4633
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:52,550
York session opened up where like here
right. So here to here is what I'd be

4634
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:52,560
right. So here to here is what I'd be
 

4635
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,070
right. So here to here is what I'd be
looking at. Maybe just here to here. And

4636
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:54,080
looking at. Maybe just here to here. And
 

4637
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:56,550
looking at. Maybe just here to here. And
here's the profile. Right. So all of

4638
01:35:56,550 --> 01:35:56,560
here's the profile. Right. So all of
 

4639
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,229
here's the profile. Right. So all of
this can be chopped. I know that's a

4640
01:35:58,229 --> 01:35:58,239
this can be chopped. I know that's a
 

4641
01:35:58,239 --> 01:35:59,669
this can be chopped. I know that's a
huge range. It is a massive range.

4642
01:35:59,669 --> 01:35:59,679
huge range. It is a massive range.
 

4643
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:01,669
huge range. It is a massive range.
There's no way of denying it. But all

4644
01:36:01,669 --> 01:36:01,679
There's no way of denying it. But all
 

4645
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:04,870
There's no way of denying it. But all
this here can just chop all day long.

4646
01:36:04,870 --> 01:36:04,880
this here can just chop all day long.
 

4647
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,709
this here can just chop all day long.
And what will it also do by doing that

4648
01:36:06,709 --> 01:36:06,719
And what will it also do by doing that
 

4649
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:08,950
And what will it also do by doing that
on a Friday? It will burn the options

4650
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:08,960
on a Friday? It will burn the options
 

4651
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:13,510
on a Friday? It will burn the options
out, right? Burn all the premiums.

4652
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:13,520
out, right? Burn all the premiums.
 

4653
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,510
out, right? Burn all the premiums.
If they lift like we talked about, this

4654
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:15,520
If they lift like we talked about, this
 

4655
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:29,430
If they lift like we talked about, this
level is uh open to become attacked.

4656
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:29,440

 

4657
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,430

question, boss. Multiple dogeis backto

4658
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:31,440
question, boss. Multiple dogeis backto
 

4659
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,510
question, boss. Multiple dogeis backto
back signals uncertainty, but what else

4660
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:33,520
back signals uncertainty, but what else
 

4661
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,270
back signals uncertainty, but what else
can it signal? Um, that's kind of all

4662
01:36:37,270 --> 01:36:37,280
can it signal? Um, that's kind of all
 

4663
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,669
can it signal? Um, that's kind of all
you mean a dogee both sides or do you

4664
01:36:39,669 --> 01:36:39,679
you mean a dogee both sides or do you
 

4665
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:42,229
you mean a dogee both sides or do you
mean like a dogee high and then you mean

4666
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:42,239
mean like a dogee high and then you mean
 

4667
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:45,910
mean like a dogee high and then you mean
like a dogee low? I mean it just signals

4668
01:36:45,910 --> 01:36:45,920
like a dogee low? I mean it just signals
 

4669
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:48,550
like a dogee low? I mean it just signals
liquidity being trapped here, trapped

4670
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:48,560
liquidity being trapped here, trapped
 

4671
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,149
liquidity being trapped here, trapped
sellers here, trapped buyers. If you

4672
01:36:50,149 --> 01:36:50,159
sellers here, trapped buyers. If you
 

4673
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:51,590
sellers here, trapped buyers. If you
looked inside those wicks, that's what

4674
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:51,600
looked inside those wicks, that's what
 

4675
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,270
looked inside those wicks, that's what
you would see on multiple dogeis here.

4676
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:53,280
you would see on multiple dogeis here.
 

4677
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:55,030
you would see on multiple dogeis here.
Fair value basically. And you have to

4678
01:36:55,030 --> 01:36:55,040
Fair value basically. And you have to
 

4679
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:59,189
Fair value basically. And you have to
wait for them to make a decision.

4680
01:36:59,189 --> 01:36:59,199

 

4681
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:02,310

when I check MSTR.

4682
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:02,320
when I check MSTR.
 

4683
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,629

4685
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:06,070
Yeah, I'll check MSTR and Microsoft view
shortly. Let's just see if this gets

4686
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:06,080
shortly. Let's just see if this gets
 

4687
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,990
shortly. Let's just see if this gets
going here. So, there is a player up at

4688
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:08,000
going here. So, there is a player up at
 

4689
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,189
going here. So, there is a player up at
25,000 right now. ES through its IB. Can

4690
01:37:11,189 --> 01:37:11,199
25,000 right now. ES through its IB. Can
 

4691
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:12,870
25,000 right now. ES through its IB. Can
we get up to the IB? So, we're through

4692
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:12,880
we get up to the IB? So, we're through
 

4693
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,709
we get up to the IB? So, we're through
that first guy. Remember, we're through

4694
01:37:14,709 --> 01:37:14,719
that first guy. Remember, we're through
 

4695
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:16,310
that first guy. Remember, we're through
that first buyer. The next buyer that

4696
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:16,320
that first buyer. The next buyer that
 

4697
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:19,109
that first buyer. The next buyer that
got stuck was at 73.

4698
01:37:19,109 --> 01:37:19,119
got stuck was at 73.
 

4699
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:20,709
got stuck was at 73.
So, if we think about what we did, this

4700
01:37:20,709 --> 01:37:20,719
So, if we think about what we did, this
 

4701
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:22,709
So, if we think about what we did, this
seller down here caused the pain. This

4702
01:37:22,709 --> 01:37:22,719
seller down here caused the pain. This
 

4703
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:25,109
seller down here caused the pain. This
is your higher low. This is bullish

4704
01:37:25,109 --> 01:37:25,119
is your higher low. This is bullish
 

4705
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:27,189
is your higher low. This is bullish
right now. reclaimed gray box into next

4707
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:30,229
right now. reclaimed gray box into next
gray box held gray box 73 would be the

01:37:30,229 --> 01:37:30,239
gray box held gray box 73 would be the
 

4709
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:32,070
gray box held gray box 73 would be the
next target because of that's where the

4710
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:32,080

when we leave liquidity. And it's a
 

4827
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:43,830

4843
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:08,870

How do we get a chance to give away?

4862
01:40:29,669 --> 01:40:29,679
How do we get a chance to give away?
 

4863
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:31,189
How do we get a chance to give away?
We'll do maybe we'll do a giveaway in

We'll do maybe we'll do a giveaway in
 

4865
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:32,870
We'll do maybe we'll do a giveaway in
the next 10 minutes. So, failed that

4866
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:32,880
the next 10 minutes. So, failed that
 

4867
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:35,430
the next 10 minutes. So, failed that
high. So, never got to the 73s.

4868
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:35,440
high. So, never got to the 73s.

Trading back down to this gray box

4870
01:40:37,030 --> 01:40:37,040
Trading back down to this gray box
 

4871
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:41,189
Trading back down to this gray box
again. Okay. And you can see, so we

4872
01:40:41,189 --> 01:40:41,199
again. Okay. And you can see, so we
 

4873
01:40:41,199 --> 01:40:43,350
again. Okay. And you can see, so we
cleared out this buyer who was stuck. We

4874
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:43,360
cleared out this buyer who was stuck. We
 

4875
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:44,629
cleared out this buyer who was stuck. We
never got up to this buyer and we're

4876
01:40:44,629 --> 01:40:44,639
never got up to this buyer and we're
 

4877
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:46,390
never got up to this buyer and we're
trading right back down to this shelf

4878
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:46,400
trading right back down to this shelf
 

4879
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,709
trading right back down to this shelf
here at 60s with an imbalance here. This

4880
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:48,719
here at 60s with an imbalance here. This
 

4881
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:50,870
here at 60s with an imbalance here. This
is why I don't trade rotation. I do not

4882
01:40:50,870 --> 01:40:50,880
is why I don't trade rotation. I do not
 

4883
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,669
is why I don't trade rotation. I do not
enjoy these moves. But if you guys like

4884
01:40:53,669 --> 01:40:53,679
enjoy these moves. But if you guys like
 

4885
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:55,510
enjoy these moves. But if you guys like
edges, those of you who like rotation,

4886
01:40:55,510 --> 01:40:55,520
edges, those of you who like rotation,
 

4887
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:58,470
edges, those of you who like rotation,
well, that is a failure again of the

4888
01:40:58,470 --> 01:40:58,480
well, that is a failure again of the
 

4889
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,550
well, that is a failure again of the
high. We didn't quite make the IB high,

4890
01:41:00,550 --> 01:41:00,560
high. We didn't quite make the IB high,
 

4891
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,590
high. We didn't quite make the IB high,
but ES has just done the IB high to VWAP

4892
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:03,600
but ES has just done the IB high to VWAP
 

4893
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,109
but ES has just done the IB high to VWAP
trade. We've missed it. We're almost

4894
01:41:05,109 --> 01:41:05,119
trade. We've missed it. We're almost
 

4895
01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:06,390
trade. We've missed it. We're almost
there. Like we said, might do a lower

4896
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:06,400
there. Like we said, might do a lower
 

4897
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,390
there. Like we said, might do a lower
high and come. There's There it is. If

4898
01:41:08,390 --> 01:41:08,400
high and come. There's There it is. If
 

4899
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,229
high and come. There's There it is. If
we look at ES, it's done it very well.

4900
01:41:10,229 --> 01:41:10,239
we look at ES, it's done it very well.
 

4901
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:13,030
we look at ES, it's done it very well.
The Tyson trade as we call it, right? IB

4902
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:13,040
The Tyson trade as we call it, right? IB
 

4903
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:15,669
The Tyson trade as we call it, right? IB
high clear out.

4904
01:41:15,669 --> 01:41:15,679
high clear out.
 

4905
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:19,910
high clear out.
IB high clear out. And there's B1.

4906
01:41:19,910 --> 01:41:19,920
IB high clear out. And there's B1.
 

4907
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:26,709
IB high clear out. And there's B1.
Bingo. Bango.

4908
01:41:26,709 --> 01:41:26,719

 

4909
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:29,189

Gray box to gray box again. So this

4910
01:41:29,189 --> 01:41:29,199
Gray box to gray box again. So this
 

4911
01:41:29,199 --> 01:41:31,270
Gray box to gray box again. So this
node, we can thin this out a bit here

4912
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:31,280
node, we can thin this out a bit here
 

4913
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:34,870
node, we can thin this out a bit here
now. Starting to become a bit cleaner.

4914
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:34,880
now. Starting to become a bit cleaner.
 

4915
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,470
now. Starting to become a bit cleaner.
And if we lose this again, we'll

4916
01:41:36,470 --> 01:41:36,480
And if we lose this again, we'll
 

4917
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:37,669
And if we lose this again, we'll
probably drift all the way back down

4918
01:41:37,669 --> 01:41:37,679
probably drift all the way back down
 

4919
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:39,669
probably drift all the way back down
here again

4920
01:41:39,669 --> 01:41:39,679
here again
 

4921
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:41,750
here again
as we just continue to rotate all day.

4922
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:41,760
as we just continue to rotate all day.
 

4923
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,830
as we just continue to rotate all day.
That is the objective of today remember

4924
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:43,840
That is the objective of today remember
 

4925
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:57,910
That is the objective of today remember
is to rotate and build out liquidity.

4926
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:57,920

 

4927
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,669

Norton's blocking my link. Yes, someone
 

4929
01:41:59,679 --> 01:42:02,310
Norton's blocking my link. Yes, someone
else said that. Um, all right. Let me

4930
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:02,320
else said that. Um, all right. Let me
 

4931
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:07,669
else said that. Um, all right. Let me
just try this.

4932
01:42:07,669 --> 01:42:07,679

 

4933
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:10,149

It's an order block
also known as supply where where a buyer

4952

also known as supply where where a buyer
 

4953

4954
01:42:54,470 --> 01:42:54,480

 

4955
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,470

How do I would I determine we lost a

4956
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:56,480
How do I would I determine we lost a
 

4957
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,149
How do I would I determine we lost a
shelf for entry? Well, this was very

4958
01:42:58,149 --> 01:42:58,159
shelf for entry? Well, this was very
 

4959
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:00,470
shelf for entry? Well, this was very
ugly. This was this was not an easy I

4960
01:43:00,470 --> 01:43:00,480
ugly. This was this was not an easy I
 

4961
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:03,430
ugly. This was this was not an easy I
wouldn't call this an easy trade, but uh

4962
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:03,440
wouldn't call this an easy trade, but uh
 

4963
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:04,870
wouldn't call this an easy trade, but uh
if we came to the order flow, you'd

4964
01:43:04,870 --> 01:43:04,880
if we came to the order flow, you'd
 

4965
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,229
if we came to the order flow, you'd
probably see buyers getting caught up

4966
01:43:06,229 --> 01:43:06,239
probably see buyers getting caught up
 

4967
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:09,430
probably see buyers getting caught up
there again. There you go. So, here. So,

4968
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:09,440
there again. There you go. So, here. So,
 

4969
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:12,790
there again. There you go. So, here. So,
I'd say under here was the trigger,

4970
01:43:12,790 --> 01:43:12,800
I'd say under here was the trigger,
 

4971
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:15,510
I'd say under here was the trigger,
right? Aggressive buyers, sellers paired

4972
01:43:15,510 --> 01:43:15,520
right? Aggressive buyers, sellers paired
 

4973
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:17,669
right? Aggressive buyers, sellers paired
off. There's your trigger. Failed to

4974
01:43:17,669 --> 01:43:17,679
off. There's your trigger. Failed to
 

4975
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:19,590
off. There's your trigger. Failed to
reclaim. There's more trigger. That's

4976
01:43:19,590 --> 01:43:19,600
reclaim. There's more trigger. That's
 

4977
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,950
reclaim. There's more trigger. That's
probably it. Shift of delta positive to

4978
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:22,960
probably it. Shift of delta positive to
 

4979
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:30,950
probably it. Shift of delta positive to
negative.

4980
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:30,960

 

4981
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:33,430

And back down potentially down to 820s.

4982
01:43:33,430 --> 01:43:33,440
And back down potentially down to 820s.
 

4983
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:35,910
And back down potentially down to 820s.
Now, if they lose this gray box, we can

4984
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:35,920
Now, if they lose this gray box, we can
 

4985
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,149
Now, if they lose this gray box, we can
keep fading all the way back down. I've

4986
01:43:38,149 --> 01:43:38,159
keep fading all the way back down. I've
 

4987
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:40,550
keep fading all the way back down. I've
got value low at 26es on here. We have

4988
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:40,560
got value low at 26es on here. We have
 

4989
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:43,109
got value low at 26es on here. We have
it at 20. So, we'll see this area here

4990
01:43:43,109 --> 01:43:43,119
it at 20. So, we'll see this area here
 

4991
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:47,830
it at 20. So, we'll see this area here
now a big node. And like I said, we

4992
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:47,840
now a big node. And like I said, we
 

4993
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:50,950
now a big node. And like I said, we
still have that player. 800 was a big

4994
01:43:50,950 --> 01:43:50,960
still have that player. 800 was a big
 

4995
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,830
still have that player. 800 was a big
volume level. It's less of a big level

4996
01:43:53,830 --> 01:43:53,840
volume level. It's less of a big level
 

4997
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:56,310
volume level. It's less of a big level
now because we paired off that delta,

4998
01:43:56,310 --> 01:43:56,320
now because we paired off that delta,
 

4999
01:43:56,320 --> 01:44:00,229
now because we paired off that delta,
but it was a big volume level.

5000
01:44:00,229 --> 01:44:00,239
but it was a big volume level.
 

5001
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:01,910
but it was a big volume level.
I just think we're just going to chop

5002
01:44:01,910 --> 01:44:01,920
I just think we're just going to chop
 

5003
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:04,390
I just think we're just going to chop
all day long here, folks. We're just

5004
01:44:04,390 --> 01:44:04,400
all day long here, folks. We're just
 

5005
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:10,790
all day long here, folks. We're just
going to keep chopping.

5006
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:10,800

 

5007
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,870

Sorry for anyone normal. Yeah, it's me

5008
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:12,880
Sorry for anyone normal. Yeah, it's me
 

5009
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,390
Sorry for anyone normal. Yeah, it's me
being an [\h__\h] Doesn't matter what

5010
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:14,400
being an [\h__\h] Doesn't matter what
 

5011
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,390
being an [\h__\h] Doesn't matter what
what you call it. Doesn't really doesn't

5012
01:44:16,390 --> 01:44:16,400
what you call it. Doesn't really doesn't
 

5013
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:17,510
what you call it. Doesn't really doesn't
matter. All right, this is developing

5014
01:44:17,510 --> 01:44:17,520
matter. All right, this is developing
 

5015
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:18,790
matter. All right, this is developing
point of control. So, we're coming down

5016
01:44:18,790 --> 01:44:18,800
point of control. So, we're coming down
 

5017
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,950
point of control. So, we're coming down
to these 820s. Like I said, here's the

5018
01:44:20,950 --> 01:44:20,960
to these 820s. Like I said, here's the
 

5019
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,229
to these 820s. Like I said, here's the
edge of value again. So, they're trying

5020
01:44:22,229 --> 01:44:22,239
edge of value again. So, they're trying
 

5021
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:24,149
edge of value again. So, they're trying
to bid off the edge of value because

5022
01:44:24,149 --> 01:44:24,159
to bid off the edge of value because
 

5023
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:25,669
to bid off the edge of value because
we're in a D-shape. So, we're just

5024
01:44:25,669 --> 01:44:25,679
we're in a D-shape. So, we're just
 

5025
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:36,310
we're in a D-shape. So, we're just
rotating that D-shape.

5026
01:44:36,310 --> 01:44:36,320

 

5027
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:39,430

Uh for me, Miles, I look at both, but

5028
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:39,440
Uh for me, Miles, I look at both, but
 

5029
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,350
Uh for me, Miles, I look at both, but
one minute one minute when I'm looking

5030
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:41,360
one minute one minute when I'm looking
 

5031
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:45,030
one minute one minute when I'm looking
to execute, right? If I'm if I'm looking

5032
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:45,040
to execute, right? If I'm if I'm looking
 

5033
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:47,350
to execute, right? If I'm if I'm looking
if I'm looking to execute like down

5034
01:44:47,350 --> 01:44:47,360
if I'm looking to execute like down
 

5035
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,189
if I'm looking to execute like down
here, I'm looking on the one minute. All

5036
01:44:49,189 --> 01:44:49,199
here, I'm looking on the one minute. All
 

5037
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:51,270
here, I'm looking on the one minute. All
right. If I'm just looking to see where

5038
01:44:51,270 --> 01:44:51,280
right. If I'm just looking to see where
 

5039
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:53,109
right. If I'm just looking to see where
where players have built up, I can look

5040
01:44:53,109 --> 01:44:53,119
where players have built up, I can look
 

5041
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:54,470
where players have built up, I can look
on the five minute. But when I'm

5042
01:44:54,470 --> 01:44:54,480
on the five minute. But when I'm
 

5043
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:56,470
on the five minute. But when I'm
executing, I'm going down into lower

5044
01:44:56,470 --> 01:44:56,480
executing, I'm going down into lower
 

5045
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:59,910
executing, I'm going down into lower
time frame.

5046
01:44:59,910 --> 01:44:59,920

 

5047
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:02,950

Yeah. 820. Beautiful here. Right into

5048
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:02,960
Yeah. 820. Beautiful here. Right into
 

5049
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:05,109
Yeah. 820. Beautiful here. Right into
that node. Right. Right into value area

5050
01:45:05,109 --> 01:45:05,119
that node. Right. Right into value area
 

5051
01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:06,870
that node. Right. Right into value area
low. Back to gray box. So the question

5052
01:45:06,870 --> 01:45:06,880
low. Back to gray box. So the question
 

5053
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:09,430
low. Back to gray box. So the question
now is this. Right. Back to gray box. If

5054
01:45:09,430 --> 01:45:09,440
now is this. Right. Back to gray box. If
 

5055
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:11,109
now is this. Right. Back to gray box. If
they sell gray box and they come under

5056
01:45:11,109 --> 01:45:11,119
they sell gray box and they come under
 

5057
01:45:11,119 --> 01:45:12,790
they sell gray box and they come under
820, do we come back to previous day

5058
01:45:12,790 --> 01:45:12,800
820, do we come back to previous day
 

5059
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,189
820, do we come back to previous day
value area high? We know there is a

5060
01:45:15,189 --> 01:45:15,199
value area high? We know there is a
 

5061
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:17,830
value area high? We know there is a
participant who got stuck today down at

5062
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:17,840
participant who got stuck today down at
 

5063
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,709
participant who got stuck today down at
750s. Right. So they come back down into

5064
01:45:20,709 --> 01:45:20,719
750s. Right. So they come back down into
 

5065
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:22,790
750s. Right. So they come back down into
here. And do they come back down to 750

5066
01:45:22,790 --> 01:45:22,800
here. And do they come back down to 750
 

5067
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,550
here. And do they come back down to 750
and let him out where that VWAP would

5068
01:45:24,550 --> 01:45:24,560
and let him out where that VWAP would
 

5069
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:26,550
and let him out where that VWAP would
be?

5070
01:45:26,550 --> 01:45:26,560
be?
 

5071
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:29,830
be?
Right. 750s

5072
01:45:29,830 --> 01:45:29,840
Right. 750s
 

5073
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:31,910
Right. 750s
possibly. Possibly doesn't there's

5074
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:31,920
possibly. Possibly doesn't there's
 

5075
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,270
possibly. Possibly doesn't there's
there's lots of levels to get through

5076
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:33,280
there's lots of levels to get through
 

5077
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:36,390
there's lots of levels to get through
first, right? 20s previous day uh

5078
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:36,400
first, right? 20s previous day uh
 

5079
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,229
first, right? 20s previous day uh
current point of control. All right. So,

5080
01:45:38,229 --> 01:45:38,239
current point of control. All right. So,
 

5081
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:40,149
current point of control. All right. So,
this can still be a very deep pullback.

5082
01:45:40,149 --> 01:45:40,159
this can still be a very deep pullback.
 

5083
01:45:40,159 --> 01:45:41,430
this can still be a very deep pullback.
Could be a very deep pullback. Could be

5084
01:45:41,430 --> 01:45:41,440
Could be a very deep pullback. Could be
 

5085
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:43,109
Could be a very deep pullback. Could be
a very deep pullback. It could reclaim

5086
01:45:43,109 --> 01:45:43,119
a very deep pullback. It could reclaim
 

5087
01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:45,109
a very deep pullback. It could reclaim
and have another go at it again. Right?

5088
01:45:45,109 --> 01:45:45,119
and have another go at it again. Right?
 

5089
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:47,910
and have another go at it again. Right?
Because we're in this. We're not in a

5090
01:45:47,910 --> 01:45:47,920
Because we're in this. We're not in a
 

5091
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:49,830
Because we're in this. We're not in a
trend. We are not in a trend. There you

5092
01:45:49,830 --> 01:45:49,840
trend. We are not in a trend. There you
 

5093
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,510
trend. We are not in a trend. There you
go. So, they're still bidding 20s back

5094
01:45:51,510 --> 01:45:51,520
go. So, they're still bidding 20s back
 

5095
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:53,350
go. So, they're still bidding 20s back
to gray box. If they reclaim gray box,

5096
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:53,360
to gray box. If they reclaim gray box,
 

5097
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:54,709
to gray box. If they reclaim gray box,
they're going to go next gray box. They

5098
01:45:54,709 --> 01:45:54,719
they're going to go next gray box. They
 

5099
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:56,229
they're going to go next gray box. They
reject this gray box. They're going to

5100
01:45:56,229 --> 01:45:56,239
reject this gray box. They're going to
 

5101
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:57,990
reject this gray box. They're going to
try 20s again. Then they're going to try

5102
01:45:57,990 --> 01:45:58,000
try 20s again. Then they're going to try
 

5103
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,550
try 20s again. Then they're going to try
800s. Then they're going to try 80s. And

5104
01:46:00,550 --> 01:46:00,560
800s. Then they're going to try 80s. And
 

5105
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,790
800s. Then they're going to try 80s. And
then the player is stuck at 50s.

5106
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:02,800
then the player is stuck at 50s.
 

5107
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:05,030
then the player is stuck at 50s.
Remember down here, right? So, rotation,

5108
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:05,040
Remember down here, right? So, rotation,
 

5109

why I don't like it? Yes, my hourly

5112
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:08,960
why I don't like it? Yes, my hourly
 

5113
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:11,270

charts have just come back.

5114
01:46:11,270 --> 01:46:11,280
charts have just come back.
 

5115
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:13,669
charts have just come back.
Wow. CME,

5116
01:46:13,669 --> 01:46:13,679
Wow. CME,
 

5117
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:15,350
Wow. CME,
they just realized that they'd turned

5118
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:15,360
they just realized that they'd turned
 

5119
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:17,669
they just realized that they'd turned
data off for Trading View, had they? It

5120
01:46:17,669 --> 01:46:17,679
data off for Trading View, had they? It
 

5121
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:26,310
data off for Trading View, had they? It
was nice of them to turn it back on.

5122
01:46:26,310 --> 01:46:26,320

 

5123
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,149

There you go. So, Sam just took $300

5124
01:46:28,149 --> 01:46:28,159
There you go. So, Sam just took $300
 

5125
01:46:28,159 --> 01:46:29,910
There you go. So, Sam just took $300
trade off using the D-shape and trap

5126
01:46:29,910 --> 01:46:29,920

01:46:48,070 --> 01:46:48,080
how to make good money here by trading
 

5145
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:50,629
how to make good money here by trading
good areas. So, gray box reclaimed now.

5146
01:46:50,629 --> 01:46:50,639
good areas. So, gray box reclaimed now.
 

5147
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:52,229
good areas. So, gray box reclaimed now.
So, we're watching this node and through

5148
01:46:52,229 --> 01:46:52,239
So, we're watching this node and through
 

5149
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:53,910
So, we're watching this node and through
that back up to where we just came from.

5150
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:53,920
that back up to where we just came from.
 

5151
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:55,109
that back up to where we just came from.
And I will have a look if there's some

5152
01:46:55,109 --> 01:46:55,119
And I will have a look if there's some
 

5153
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:57,109
And I will have a look if there's some
imbalances up there. There are. So, a

5154
01:46:57,109 --> 01:46:57,119
imbalances up there. There are. So, a
 

5155
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,990
imbalances up there. There are. So, a
seller came in here at 87. A buyer came

5156
01:46:59,990 --> 01:47:00,000
seller came in here at 87. A buyer came
 

5157
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,629
seller came in here at 87. A buyer came
in here at 80. If they lift through 87

5158
01:47:02,629 --> 01:47:02,639
in here at 80. If they lift through 87
 

5159
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:05,109
in here at 80. If they lift through 87
and 80, we will look for 900 and then

5160
01:47:05,109 --> 01:47:05,119
and 80, we will look for 900 and then
 

5161
01:47:05,119 --> 01:47:08,870
and 80, we will look for 900 and then
914. A big buyer is at 918. All right.

5162
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:08,880
914. A big buyer is at 918. All right.
 

5163
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:12,310
914. A big buyer is at 918. All right.
So, a big buyer is offside in 918 in

5164
01:47:12,310 --> 01:47:12,320
So, a big buyer is offside in 918 in
 

5165
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:13,910
So, a big buyer is offside in 918 in
here. This is where a big buyer is

5166
01:47:13,910 --> 01:47:13,920
here. This is where a big buyer is
 

5167
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:16,870
here. This is where a big buyer is
offside. Right. So, he's out of position

5168
01:47:16,870 --> 01:47:16,880
offside. Right. So, he's out of position
 

5169
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:19,350
offside. Right. So, he's out of position
right now.

5170
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:19,360
right now.
 

5171
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:20,870
right now.
So

5172
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:20,880
So
 

5173
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:22,870
So
this move here, we'll have to see how we

5174
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:22,880
this move here, we'll have to see how we
 

5175
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,030
this move here, we'll have to see how we
react. If we do not get through that,

5176
01:47:25,030 --> 01:47:25,040
react. If we do not get through that,
 

5177
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:26,470
react. If we do not get through that,
right, then he will remain out of

5178
01:47:26,470 --> 01:47:26,480
right, then he will remain out of
 

5179
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,229
right, then he will remain out of
position. We can use that back down

5180
01:47:28,229 --> 01:47:28,239
position. We can use that back down
 

5181
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:30,870
position. We can use that back down
again. If you're going to scout, like I

5182
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:30,880
again. If you're going to scout, like I
 

5183
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:33,030
again. If you're going to scout, like I
said, I'm avoiding all of this [\h__\h] I

5184
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:33,040
said, I'm avoiding all of this [\h__\h] I
 

5185
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:35,030
said, I'm avoiding all of this [\h__\h] I
This is not a market I like. But I can

5186
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:35,040
This is not a market I like. But I can
 

5187
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,310
This is not a market I like. But I can
read it for you. I just don't like

5188
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:36,320
read it for you. I just don't like
 

5189
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:39,270
read it for you. I just don't like
trading it. Don't enjoy it. Do not enjoy

5190
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:39,280
trading it. Don't enjoy it. Do not enjoy
 

5191
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:41,750
trading it. Don't enjoy it. Do not enjoy
it.

5192
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:41,760
it.
 

5193
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:44,149
it.
So I'll be watching here through 88.

5194
01:47:44,149 --> 01:47:44,159
So I'll be watching here through 88.
 

5195
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:46,070
So I'll be watching here through 88.
Then I'll be watching 900. And then that

5196
01:47:46,070 --> 01:47:46,080
Then I'll be watching 900. And then that
 

5197
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,149
Then I'll be watching 900. And then that
buyer who's stuck at 918. They're going

5198
01:47:48,149 --> 01:47:48,159
buyer who's stuck at 918. They're going
 

5199
01:47:48,159 --> 01:47:49,590
buyer who's stuck at 918. They're going
to try and lift towards him at the

5200
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:49,600
to try and lift towards him at the
 

5201
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:55,669
to try and lift towards him at the
moment.

5202
01:47:55,669 --> 01:47:55,679

5219

now. Maybe we'd do one giveaway now and
one giveaway in another hour.

5220
01:48:24,229 --> 01:48:24,239

 

5221
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:26,870

I know it's it's crazy the growth of the

5222
01:48:26,870 --> 01:48:26,880
I know it's it's crazy the growth of the
 

5223
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,030
I know it's it's crazy the growth of the
channel at the moment. It's insane. I'm

5224
01:48:29,030 --> 01:48:29,040
channel at the moment. It's insane. I'm
 

5225
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:31,030
channel at the moment. It's insane. I'm
very very grateful for it. But I think

5226
01:48:31,030 --> 01:48:31,040
very very grateful for it. But I think
 

5227
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:33,590
very very grateful for it. But I think
it's a mix of two things. Uh YouTube has

5228
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:33,600
it's a mix of two things. Uh YouTube has
 

5229
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:36,950
it's a mix of two things. Uh YouTube has
suddenly noticed me. And uh I think I'm

5230
01:48:36,950 --> 01:48:36,960
suddenly noticed me. And uh I think I'm
 

5231
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:39,270
suddenly noticed me. And uh I think I'm
trading pretty well and that probably

5232
01:48:39,270 --> 01:48:39,280
trading pretty well and that probably
 

5233
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,709
trading pretty well and that probably
helps you guys make more money and then

5234
01:48:40,709 --> 01:48:40,719
helps you guys make more money and then
 

5235
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:42,149
helps you guys make more money and then
you tell your friends and then they make

5236
01:48:42,149 --> 01:48:42,159
you tell your friends and then they make
 

5237
01:48:42,159 --> 01:48:43,430
you tell your friends and then they make
more money and then they tell their

5238
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:43,440
more money and then they tell their
 

5239
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:46,390
more money and then they tell their
friends and it's one of those things.

5240
01:48:46,390 --> 01:48:46,400
friends and it's one of those things.
 

5241
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,990
friends and it's one of those things.
All right, so back up to this level we

5242
01:48:47,990 --> 01:48:48,000
All right, so back up to this level we
 

5243
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,229
All right, so back up to this level we
just talked about. All right, so 900's

5244
01:48:50,229 --> 01:48:50,239
just talked about. All right, so 900's
 

5245
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:53,030
just talked about. All right, so 900's
coming up here. So 900 through that.

5246
01:48:53,030 --> 01:48:53,040
coming up here. So 900 through that.
 

5247
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:54,709
coming up here. So 900 through that.
You're looking for that trapped trader.

5248
01:48:54,709 --> 01:48:54,719
You're looking for that trapped trader.
 

5249
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:56,550
You're looking for that trapped trader.
If you're long, right, you want to trim

5250
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:56,560
If you're long, right, you want to trim
 

5251
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:59,189
If you're long, right, you want to trim
some into 900s, trim some into 918s and

5252
01:48:59,189 --> 01:48:59,199
some into 900s, trim some into 918s and
 

5253
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:00,390
some into 900s, trim some into 918s and
then see if you get acceptance.

5254
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:00,400
then see if you get acceptance.
 

5255
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:02,149
then see if you get acceptance.
Otherwise, this can be another lower

5256
01:49:02,149 --> 01:49:02,159
Otherwise, this can be another lower
 

5257
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:04,229
Otherwise, this can be another lower
high and come right down to Vpo, which

5258
01:49:04,229 --> 01:49:04,239
high and come right down to Vpo, which
 

5259
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:06,790
high and come right down to Vpo, which
is at 60s right now. Right, right down

5260
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:06,800
is at 60s right now. Right, right down
 

5261
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:09,270
is at 60s right now. Right, right down
here. And if they fail 60s, they will

5262
01:49:09,270 --> 01:49:09,280
here. And if they fail 60s, they will
 

5263
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:10,790
here. And if they fail 60s, they will
rotate back down here again. So, you're

5264
01:49:10,790 --> 01:49:10,800
rotate back down here again. So, you're
 

5265
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,310
rotate back down here again. So, you're
going to need this gray box to hold. For

5266
01:49:12,310 --> 01:49:12,320
going to need this gray box to hold. For
 

5267
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,390
going to need this gray box to hold. For
any of you who bought the edge of this,

5268
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:14,400
any of you who bought the edge of this,
 

5269
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,790
any of you who bought the edge of this,
if you bought the edge,

5270
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:16,800
if you bought the edge,
 

5271
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,550
if you bought the edge,
if you bought that, you need this to

5272
01:49:18,550 --> 01:49:18,560
if you bought that, you need this to
 

5273
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:20,950
if you bought that, you need this to
hold. You want 900s and then that. And

5274
01:49:20,950 --> 01:49:20,960
hold. You want 900s and then that. And
 

5275
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:22,470
hold. You want 900s and then that. And
then you're holding runners above that.

5276
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:22,480
then you're holding runners above that.
 

5277
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:24,629
then you're holding runners above that.
Above this, you will get going. Nice

5278
01:49:24,629 --> 01:49:24,639
Above this, you will get going. Nice
 

5279

01:49:26,709 --> 01:49:26,719
hold there of that level. Beautiful. So
 

5281
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:29,030
hold there of that level. Beautiful. So
watching this now, if you're long on

5282

watching this now, if you're long on
 

5283
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:30,390
watching this now, if you're long on
this, you're watching this to take some

5284
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:30,400
this, you're watching this to take some
 

5285
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,950
this, you're watching this to take some
profits into 918s. All right, 918s is

5286
01:49:32,950 --> 01:49:32,960
profits into 918s. All right, 918s is
 

5287
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:35,030
profits into 918s. All right, 918s is
where he's stuck. Keep telling you 900

5288
01:49:35,030 --> 01:49:35,040
where he's stuck. Keep telling you 900
 

5289
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,430
where he's stuck. Keep telling you 900
and then 918s is where he's stuck. Then

5290
01:49:37,430 --> 01:49:37,440
and then 918s is where he's stuck. Then
 

5291
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:38,870
and then 918s is where he's stuck. Then
if you can start printing above this

5292
01:49:38,870 --> 01:49:38,880
if you can start printing above this
 

5293
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,189
if you can start printing above this
gray box, then like I said, this can

5294
01:49:41,189 --> 01:49:41,199
gray box, then like I said, this can
 

5295
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:43,590
gray box, then like I said, this can
just be one of these and you might have

5296
01:49:43,590 --> 01:49:43,600
just be one of these and you might have
 

5297
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:46,390
just be one of these and you might have
a shot at that. You might have a shot.

5298
01:49:46,390 --> 01:49:46,400
a shot at that. You might have a shot.
 

5299
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:49,350
a shot at that. You might have a shot.

How do you know there'll be

5328
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:21,760
How do you know there'll be
 

5329
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:23,350
How do you know there'll be
consolidation before it starts? How did

5330
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:23,360
consolidation before it starts? How did
 

5331
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:24,790
consolidation before it starts? How did
you know the market was about to go into

5332
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:24,800
you know the market was about to go into
 

5333
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:27,270
you know the market was about to go into
balance? How can you catch it early?

5334
01:50:27,270 --> 01:50:27,280
balance? How can you catch it early?
 

5335
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:29,109
balance? How can you catch it early?
It's about like we talked about, it's

5336
01:50:29,109 --> 01:50:29,119
It's about like we talked about, it's
 

5337
01:50:29,119 --> 01:50:30,950
It's about like we talked about, it's
about understanding like what the higher

5338
01:50:30,950 --> 01:50:30,960
about understanding like what the higher
 

5339
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:32,709
about understanding like what the higher
time frame has done. So, if you think

5340
01:50:32,709 --> 01:50:32,719
time frame has done. So, if you think
 

5341
01:50:32,719 --> 01:50:34,790
time frame has done. So, if you think
about this week, if we think about this

5342
01:50:34,790 --> 01:50:34,800
about this week, if we think about this
 

5343
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:39,590
about this week, if we think about this
week, I'm going to go daily, right? What

5344
01:50:39,590 --> 01:50:39,600
week, I'm going to go daily, right? What
 

5345
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:41,510
week, I'm going to go daily, right? What
did we set up? Anyone who's been with me

5346
01:50:41,510 --> 01:50:41,520
did we set up? Anyone who's been with me
 

5347
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:42,629
did we set up? Anyone who's been with me
for the last few weeks, well, there's

5348
01:50:42,629 --> 01:50:42,639
for the last few weeks, well, there's
 

5349
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:44,310
for the last few weeks, well, there's
your gap fill. That's the efficient

5350
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:44,320
your gap fill. That's the efficient
 

5351
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,070
your gap fill. That's the efficient
market. That's your failed breakout of

average. We're going to bid off that. We
 

5385
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,709
average. We're going to bid off that. We
opened up the session here. So, GlobeEx

5386
01:51:22,709 --> 01:51:22,719
opened up the session here. So, GlobeEx
 

5387
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:25,270
opened up the session here. So, GlobeEx
bid off the 200 day and we bid up to

5388
01:51:25,270 --> 01:51:25,280
bid off the 200 day and we bid up to
 

5389
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:28,550
bid off the 200 day and we bid up to

5390
01:51:28,550 --> 01:51:28,560
here. When we're here, are we expecting
 

5391
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:30,470
here. When we're here, are we expecting
continuation right now when we've just

5392
01:51:30,470 --> 01:51:30,480
continuation right now when we've just
 

5393
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:33,109
continuation right now when we've just
done a [\h__\h] ginormous straight down

5394
01:51:33,109 --> 01:51:33,119
done a [\h__\h] ginormous straight down
 

5395
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:34,629
done a [\h__\h] ginormous straight down
move?

5396
01:51:34,629 --> 01:51:34,639
move?
 

5397
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:37,589
move?
No, we're not. Are we expecting relief

5398
01:51:37,589 --> 01:51:37,599
No, we're not. Are we expecting relief
 

5399
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:41,430
No, we're not. Are we expecting relief
to come too much higher in out of when

5400
01:51:41,430 --> 01:51:41,440
to come too much higher in out of when
 

5401
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:44,070
to come too much higher in out of when
we've done this huge move in GloEx? No.

5402
01:51:44,070 --> 01:51:44,080
we've done this huge move in GloEx? No.
 

5403
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:46,149
we've done this huge move in GloEx? No.
What are we expecting? Probably an

5404
01:51:46,149 --> 01:51:46,159
What are we expecting? Probably an
 

5405
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:48,950
What are we expecting? Probably an
inside bar. Look below and fail. All

5406
01:51:48,950 --> 01:51:48,960
inside bar. Look below and fail. All
 

5407
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:50,550
inside bar. Look below and fail. All
right. probably that we're going to

5408
01:51:50,550 --> 01:51:50,560
right. probably that we're going to
 

5409
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:52,390
right. probably that we're going to
respect the nodes on the developing

5410
01:51:52,390 --> 01:51:52,400
respect the nodes on the developing
 

5411
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:54,550
respect the nodes on the developing
week. All right. And then we can zoom

5412
01:51:54,550 --> 01:51:54,560
week. All right. And then we can zoom
 

5413
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:56,550
week. All right. And then we can zoom
into the lower time frames hourly and

5414
01:51:56,550 --> 01:51:56,560
into the lower time frames hourly and
 

5415
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,950
into the lower time frames hourly and
stuff to get get some edge. So when we

5416
01:51:58,950 --> 01:51:58,960
stuff to get get some edge. So when we
 

5417
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:02,070
stuff to get get some edge. So when we
moved into the hourly, we knew right

5418
01:52:02,070 --> 01:52:02,080
moved into the hourly, we knew right
 

5419
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,750
moved into the hourly, we knew right
that we had look below. We already

5420
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:03,760
that we had look below. We already
 

5421
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:05,350
that we had look below. We already
talked about it. Look below and fail.

5422
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:05,360
talked about it. Look below and fail.
 

5423
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:07,109
talked about it. Look below and fail.
We're probably going to see a drift up

5424
01:52:07,109 --> 01:52:07,119
We're probably going to see a drift up
 

5425
01:52:07,119 --> 01:52:09,030
We're probably going to see a drift up
into some of this consolidation. We know

5426
01:52:09,030 --> 01:52:09,040
into some of this consolidation. We know
 

5427
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:11,990
into some of this consolidation. We know
this node here is absolutely massive.

5428
01:52:11,990 --> 01:52:12,000
this node here is absolutely massive.
 

5429
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,510
this node here is absolutely massive.
And we have a low volume node in the

5430
01:52:13,510 --> 01:52:13,520
And we have a low volume node in the
 

5431
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:14,870
And we have a low volume node in the
edge of shelf here. This is where we

5432
01:52:14,870 --> 01:52:14,880
edge of shelf here. This is where we
 

5433
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,229
edge of shelf here. This is where we
keep getting stuck. So we're driving

5434
01:52:16,229 --> 01:52:16,239
keep getting stuck. So we're driving
 

5435
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:18,790
keep getting stuck. So we're driving
into this. If we find acceptance over

5436
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:18,800
into this. If we find acceptance over
 

5437
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:20,790
into this. If we find acceptance over
this shelf, that's when we can get that

5438
01:52:20,790 --> 01:52:20,800
this shelf, that's when we can get that
 

5439
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:24,629
this shelf, that's when we can get that
950 25,50s into here. If they're going

5440
01:52:24,629 --> 01:52:24,639
950 25,50s into here. If they're going
 

5441
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:26,149
950 25,50s into here. If they're going
to keep going, then we can run these

5442
01:52:26,149 --> 01:52:26,159
to keep going, then we can run these
 

5443
01:52:26,159 --> 01:52:28,229
to keep going, then we can run these
stops up here. But we don't expect it to

5444
01:52:28,229 --> 01:52:28,239
stops up here. But we don't expect it to
 

5445
01:52:28,239 --> 01:52:32,070
stops up here. But we don't expect it to
be too big because here is the move

5446
01:52:32,070 --> 01:52:32,080
be too big because here is the move
 

5447
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:34,950
be too big because here is the move
down. We expect this, we expect this,

5448
01:52:34,950 --> 01:52:34,960
down. We expect this, we expect this,
 

5449
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:37,350
down. We expect this, we expect this,
right? And after that, they will decide

5450
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:37,360
right? And after that, they will decide
 

5451
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:39,669
right? And after that, they will decide
what they do with it. All right? So,

5452
01:52:39,669 --> 01:52:39,679
what they do with it. All right? So,
 

5453
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:41,910
what they do with it. All right? So,
it's more about understanding what's

5454
01:52:41,910 --> 01:52:41,920
it's more about understanding what's
 

5455
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:44,149
it's more about understanding what's
gone before us, like what what's

5456
01:52:44,149 --> 01:52:44,159
gone before us, like what what's
 

5457
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:46,870
gone before us, like what what's
happened just before. Okay? So still

5458
01:52:46,870 --> 01:52:46,880
happened just before. Okay? So still
 

5459
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:49,109
happened just before. Okay? So still
you're starting to drift higher now. So

5460
01:52:49,109 --> 01:52:49,119
you're starting to drift higher now. So
 

5461
01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:51,189
you're starting to drift higher now. So
we are through a big buyer and seller

5462
01:52:51,189 --> 01:52:51,199
we are through a big buyer and seller
 

5463
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:52,950
we are through a big buyer and seller
just came in and paired off at 18. So

5464
01:52:52,950 --> 01:52:52,960
just came in and paired off at 18. So
 

5465
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:54,709
just came in and paired off at 18. So
you're still watching for that 50s,

5466
01:52:54,709 --> 01:52:54,719
you're still watching for that 50s,
 

5467
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:56,950
you're still watching for that 50s,
right? You're still watching for 50s.

5468
01:52:56,950 --> 01:52:56,960
right? You're still watching for 50s.
 

5469
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:59,030
right? You're still watching for 50s.
You even 40s now. You got to respect cuz

5470
01:52:59,030 --> 01:52:59,040
You even 40s now. You got to respect cuz
 

5471
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:01,430
You even 40s now. You got to respect cuz
it's the edge of value. But I think you

5472
01:53:01,430 --> 01:53:01,440
it's the edge of value. But I think you
 

5473
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,350
it's the edge of value. But I think you
have a chance to drift higher here.

5474
01:53:03,350 --> 01:53:03,360
have a chance to drift higher here.
 

5475
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:05,270
have a chance to drift higher here.
There is a buyer stuck at 50. So you

5476
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:05,280
There is a buyer stuck at 50. So you
 

5477
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,430
There is a buyer stuck at 50. So you
need to make sure you take some profits.

5478
01:53:07,430 --> 01:53:07,440
need to make sure you take some profits.
 

5479
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:09,510
need to make sure you take some profits.
And if we start closing above 50s, you

5480
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:09,520
And if we start closing above 50s, you
 

5481
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:12,149
And if we start closing above 50s, you
will probably get a new high of day.

5482
01:53:12,149 --> 01:53:12,159
will probably get a new high of day.
 

5483
01:53:12,159 --> 01:53:14,629
will probably get a new high of day.
So here's the edge of value 40s. We've

5484
01:53:14,629 --> 01:53:14,639
So here's the edge of value 40s. We've
 

5485
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:16,870
So here's the edge of value 40s. We've
got 50s next.

5486
01:53:16,870 --> 01:53:16,880
got 50s next.
 

5487
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:18,149
got 50s next.
Show you what I'm looking at. We've got

5488
01:53:18,149 --> 01:53:18,159
Show you what I'm looking at. We've got
 

5489
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:19,990
Show you what I'm looking at. We've got
50s next. We've got this buyer here

5490
01:53:19,990 --> 01:53:20,000
50s next. We've got this buyer here
 

5491
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,350
50s next. We've got this buyer here
who's stuck. We're going to come and tag

5492
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:21,360
who's stuck. We're going to come and tag
 

5493
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:23,750
who's stuck. We're going to come and tag
into him. See, there you go. Tapping

5494
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:23,760
into him. See, there you go. Tapping
 

5495
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,270
into him. See, there you go. Tapping
into him. He's probably front running a

5496
01:53:25,270 --> 01:53:25,280
into him. He's probably front running a
 

5497
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:26,470
into him. He's probably front running a
little bit of that. We have an imbalance

5498
01:53:26,470 --> 01:53:26,480
little bit of that. We have an imbalance
 

5499
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:27,990
little bit of that. We have an imbalance
through that. So, the question is now,

5500
01:53:27,990 --> 01:53:28,000
through that. So, the question is now,
 

5501
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,830
through that. So, the question is now,
do they end this auction here or are

5502
01:53:29,830 --> 01:53:29,840
do they end this auction here or are
 

5503
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,510
do they end this auction here or are
they going to start to base out here and

5504
01:53:31,510 --> 01:53:31,520
they going to start to base out here and
 

5505
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:37,669
they going to start to base out here and
attack up here into 70s again?

5506
01:53:37,669 --> 01:53:37,679

 

5507
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:39,189

What was that high there? We just hit

5508
01:53:39,189 --> 01:53:39,199
What was that high there? We just hit
 

5509
01:53:39,199 --> 01:53:41,430
What was that high there? We just hit
47.

5510
01:53:41,430 --> 01:53:41,440
47.
 

5511
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:42,790
47.
I think they're going to resqueeze this

5512
01:53:42,790 --> 01:53:42,800
I think they're going to resqueeze this
 

5513
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:44,550
I think they're going to resqueeze this
and try and get into this 50 and see if

5514
01:53:44,550 --> 01:53:44,560
and try and get into this 50 and see if
 

5515
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:47,589
and try and get into this 50 and see if
they get going here.

5516
01:53:47,589 --> 01:53:47,599
they get going here.
 

5517
01:53:47,599 --> 01:53:49,030
they get going here.
Hopefully you guys are learning with me

5561
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:07,030

What are the gray boxes, guys? Gray

5562
01:55:07,030 --> 01:55:07,040
What are the gray boxes, guys? Gray
 

5563
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:08,629
What are the gray boxes, guys? Gray
again. I I'm pretty sure I put it in

5564
01:55:08,629 --> 01:55:08,639
again. I I'm pretty sure I put it in
 

5565
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:10,229
again. I I'm pretty sure I put it in
nightbot. Gray boxes are my volume

5566
01:55:10,229 --> 01:55:10,239
nightbot. Gray boxes are my volume
 

5567
01:55:10,239 --> 01:55:11,830
nightbot. Gray boxes are my volume
areas. All right. Are there areas of

5568
01:55:11,830 --> 01:55:11,840
areas. All right. Are there areas of
 

5569
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:13,189
areas. All right. Are there areas of
volume where I know it's important?

5570
01:55:13,189 --> 01:55:13,199
volume where I know it's important?
 

5571
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:14,629
volume where I know it's important?
Okay, here you go, guys. So, you've just

5572
01:55:14,629 --> 01:55:14,639
Okay, here you go, guys. So, you've just
 

5573
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:16,470
Okay, here you go, guys. So, you've just
cleared out 50. So, you have to see if

5574
01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:16,480
cleared out 50. So, you have to see if
 

5575
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:17,910
cleared out 50. So, you have to see if
you find acceptance now. You would want

5576
01:55:17,910 --> 01:55:17,920
you find acceptance now. You would want
 

5577
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:20,629
you find acceptance now. You would want
dips to hold 50 down to 44s. The next

5578
01:55:20,629 --> 01:55:20,639
dips to hold 50 down to 44s. The next
 

5579
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:22,790
dips to hold 50 down to 44s. The next
buyer who's trapped is at 74. Through

5580
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:22,800
buyer who's trapped is at 74. Through
 

5581
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:24,229
buyer who's trapped is at 74. Through
that, you are going to get a higher day

5582
01:55:24,229 --> 01:55:24,239
that, you are going to get a higher day
 

5583
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:27,189
that, you are going to get a higher day
squeeze. All right. So, now this is

5584
01:55:27,189 --> 01:55:27,199
squeeze. All right. So, now this is
 

5585
01:55:27,199 --> 01:55:28,950
squeeze. All right. So, now this is
looking more and more possible. All

5586
01:55:28,950 --> 01:55:28,960
looking more and more possible. All
 

5587
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:31,109
looking more and more possible. All
right. So, we just think about what

5588
01:55:31,109 --> 01:55:31,119
right. So, we just think about what
 

5589
01:55:31,119 --> 01:55:34,070
right. So, we just think about what
happened. They trapped down here again,

5590
01:55:34,070 --> 01:55:34,080
happened. They trapped down here again,
 

5591
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:37,030
happened. They trapped down here again,
right into value, into rotation. They've

5592
01:55:37,030 --> 01:55:37,040
right into value, into rotation. They've
 

5593
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:40,709
right into value, into rotation. They've
now thinned down, thin back up. If they

5594
01:55:40,709 --> 01:55:40,719
now thinned down, thin back up. If they
 

5595
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:43,990
now thinned down, thin back up. If they
hold bids here now, this is possible,

5596
01:55:43,990 --> 01:55:44,000
hold bids here now, this is possible,
 

5597
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,470
hold bids here now, this is possible,
right? Anything above this is a takerit

5598
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:46,480
right? Anything above this is a takerit
 

5599
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:48,470
right? Anything above this is a takerit
area into this. If they if you got very

5600
01:55:48,470 --> 01:55:48,480
area into this. If they if you got very
 

5601
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:49,750
area into this. If they if you got very
lucky, they come up here. I don't think

5602
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:49,760
lucky, they come up here. I don't think
 

5603
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:51,430
lucky, they come up here. I don't think
we're going to do it today, but possibly

5604
01:55:51,430 --> 01:55:51,440
we're going to do it today, but possibly
 

5605
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:53,750
we're going to do it today, but possibly
into here. Once we get above that, all

5606
01:55:53,750 --> 01:55:53,760
into here. Once we get above that, all
 

5607
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:55,430
into here. Once we get above that, all
right, if they fail back underneath it,

5608
01:55:55,430 --> 01:55:55,440
right, if they fail back underneath it,
 

5609
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:57,030
right, if they fail back underneath it,
guess what? that trade back down might

5610
01:55:57,030 --> 01:55:57,040
guess what? that trade back down might
 

5611
01:55:57,040 --> 01:55:58,629
guess what? that trade back down might
happen especially if we move value up

5612
01:55:58,629 --> 01:55:58,639
happen especially if we move value up
 

5613
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:00,629
happen especially if we move value up
here and then we lose value and we can

5614
01:56:00,629 --> 01:56:00,639
here and then we lose value and we can
 

5615
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:06,470
here and then we lose value and we can
rotate it again back to PC and VW up.

5616
01:56:06,470 --> 01:56:06,480

 

5617
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:09,189

So you need to hold sort of 50s down to

5618
01:56:09,189 --> 01:56:09,199
So you need to hold sort of 50s down to
 

5619
01:56:09,199 --> 01:56:12,070
So you need to hold sort of 50s down to
sort of 40s here. 50s to 40s need to

5620
01:56:12,070 --> 01:56:12,080
sort of 40s here. 50s to 40s need to
 

5621
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:13,589
sort of 40s here. 50s to 40s need to
hold bullish hold need to be there. If

5622
01:56:13,589 --> 01:56:13,599
hold bullish hold need to be there. If
 

5623
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:14,629
hold bullish hold need to be there. If
they let go of that you're going to get

5624
01:56:14,629 --> 01:56:14,639
they let go of that you're going to get
 

5625
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:16,950
they let go of that you're going to get
a move to 18 very very quickly. So if

5626
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:16,960
a move to 18 very very quickly. So if
 

5627
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:19,189
a move to 18 very very quickly. So if
you're still long you want 50s and 40s

5628
01:56:19,189 --> 01:56:19,199
you're still long you want 50s and 40s
 

5629
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:21,030
you're still long you want 50s and 40s
to hold here. You do not want it

5630
01:56:21,030 --> 01:56:21,040
to hold here. You do not want it
 

5631
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:23,350
to hold here. You do not want it
underneath 40s. It will drift down to

5632
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:23,360
underneath 40s. It will drift down to
 

5633
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:25,750
underneath 40s. It will drift down to
20s very quickly if they are going to be

5634
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:25,760
20s very quickly if they are going to be
 

5635
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:31,430
20s very quickly if they are going to be
nasty with it.

5636
01:56:31,430 --> 01:56:31,440

 

5637
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:37,990

Is the 40s back into the 40s here.

5638
01:56:37,990 --> 01:56:38,000

 

5639
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,350

Sorry. Every time it flicks like that,

5640
01:56:39,350 --> 01:56:39,360
Sorry. Every time it flicks like that,

five day. So, potentially now 2550s.

5662
01:57:16,310 --> 01:57:16,320
five day. So, potentially now 2550s.
 

5663
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:18,390
five day. So, potentially now 2550s.
So, big delta there. All right. That was

5664
01:57:18,390 --> 01:57:18,400
So, big delta there. All right. That was
 

5665
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:20,550
So, big delta there. All right. That was
a six. Was that 600 lot? who just came

5666
01:57:20,550 --> 01:57:20,560
a six. Was that 600 lot? who just came
 

5667
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:25,030
a six. Was that 600 lot? who just came
in there. 789 lot buy side at at 980.

5668
01:57:25,030 --> 01:57:25,040
in there. 789 lot buy side at at 980.
 

5669
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:27,589
in there. 789 lot buy side at at 980.
All right, that's [\h__\h] huge, guys.

5670
01:57:27,589 --> 01:57:27,599
All right, that's [\h__\h] huge, guys.
 

5671
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:30,709
All right, that's [\h__\h] huge, guys.
All right, so 789

5672
01:57:30,709 --> 01:57:30,719
All right, so 789
 

5673
01:57:30,719 --> 01:57:33,270
All right, so 789
lot just came in by side at 980. So if

5674
01:57:33,270 --> 01:57:33,280
lot just came in by side at 980. So if
 

5675
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:35,669
lot just came in by side at 980. So if
we come back underneath 980, we know

5676
01:57:35,669 --> 01:57:35,679
we come back underneath 980, we know
 

5677
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:37,669
we come back underneath 980, we know
there is a 700. We're just going to call

5678
01:57:37,669 --> 01:57:37,679
there is a 700. We're just going to call
 

5679
01:57:37,679 --> 01:57:40,390
there is a 700. We're just going to call
him an 800 lot. Will be stuck there.

5680
01:57:40,390 --> 01:57:40,400
him an 800 lot. Will be stuck there.
 

5681
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:42,870
him an 800 lot. Will be stuck there.
Okay, here you go. On this screen, it

5682
01:57:42,870 --> 01:57:42,880
Okay, here you go. On this screen, it
 

5683
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:45,750
Okay, here you go. On this screen, it
only shows a 500, but it was uh on bookm

5684
01:57:45,750 --> 01:57:45,760
only shows a 500, but it was uh on bookm
 

5685
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:47,270
only shows a 500, but it was uh on bookm
I can tell you right now it was

5686
01:57:47,270 --> 01:57:47,280
I can tell you right now it was
 

5687
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:49,430
I can tell you right now it was
considerably more. Right. So potentially

5688
01:57:49,430 --> 01:57:49,440
considerably more. Right. So potentially
 

5689
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,950
considerably more. Right. So potentially
I'll be locking in some profits here and

5690
01:57:50,950 --> 01:57:50,960
I'll be locking in some profits here and
 

5691
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:52,229
I'll be locking in some profits here and
holding to see if you get a squeeze out

5692
01:57:52,229 --> 01:57:52,239
holding to see if you get a squeeze out
 

5693
01:57:52,239 --> 01:57:54,149
holding to see if you get a squeeze out
into here now. Right. So they set that

5694
01:57:54,149 --> 01:57:54,159
into here now. Right. So they set that
 

5695
01:57:54,159 --> 01:57:56,870
into here now. Right. So they set that
lower higher low sorry. So they've set

5696
01:57:56,870 --> 01:57:56,880
lower higher low sorry. So they've set
 

5697
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:59,510
lower higher low sorry. So they've set
the higher low higher low held this base

5698
01:57:59,510 --> 01:57:59,520
the higher low higher low held this base
 

5699
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:01,750
the higher low higher low held this base
rotated TP into here and then if you get

5700
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:01,760
rotated TP into here and then if you get
 

5701
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:03,189
rotated TP into here and then if you get
lucky you get these moves. Very lucky

5702
01:58:03,189 --> 01:58:03,199
lucky you get these moves. Very lucky
 

5703
01:58:03,199 --> 01:58:04,470
lucky you get these moves. Very lucky
would be up there. I don't think we will

5704
01:58:04,470 --> 01:58:04,480
would be up there. I don't think we will
 

5705
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:07,669
would be up there. I don't think we will
do that today but we will see. Again

5706
01:58:07,669 --> 01:58:07,679
do that today but we will see. Again
 

5707
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:09,669
do that today but we will see. Again
using orderflow here we now know where

5708
01:58:09,669 --> 01:58:09,679
using orderflow here we now know where
 

5709
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:11,189
using orderflow here we now know where
people's pain points is. Look at this

5710
01:58:11,189 --> 01:58:11,199
people's pain points is. Look at this
 

5711
01:58:11,199 --> 01:58:13,669
people's pain points is. Look at this
guy on bookmap with me. This guy right

5712
01:58:13,669 --> 01:58:13,679
guy on bookmap with me. This guy right
 

5713
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:17,430
guy on bookmap with me. This guy right
here 789 lot market buyer. That is a

5714
01:58:17,430 --> 01:58:17,440
here 789 lot market buyer. That is a
 

5715
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:19,910
here 789 lot market buyer. That is a
huge buy order. Price will need to stay

5716
01:58:19,910 --> 01:58:19,920
huge buy order. Price will need to stay
 

5717
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:21,350
huge buy order. Price will need to stay
above that. They might let it drift a

5718
01:58:21,350 --> 01:58:21,360
above that. They might let it drift a
 

5719
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:22,950
above that. They might let it drift a
little bit lower, but if they start

5720
01:58:22,950 --> 01:58:22,960
little bit lower, but if they start
 

5721
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:24,629
little bit lower, but if they start
losing this guy and he starts becoming

5722
01:58:24,629 --> 01:58:24,639
losing this guy and he starts becoming
 

5723
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:26,229
losing this guy and he starts becoming
stuck, you will see a big sell. So,

5724
01:58:26,229 --> 01:58:26,239
stuck, you will see a big sell. So,
 

5725
01:58:26,239 --> 01:58:28,070
stuck, you will see a big sell. So,
we're coming back to test that level,

5726
01:58:28,070 --> 01:58:28,080
we're coming back to test that level,
 

5727
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:29,669
we're coming back to test that level,
right? So, we're watching these now. If

5728
01:58:29,669 --> 01:58:29,679
right? So, we're watching these now. If
 

5729
01:58:29,679 --> 01:58:31,270
right? So, we're watching these now. If
these start to stay heavy, you will see

5730
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:31,280
these start to stay heavy, you will see
 

5731
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:38,950
these start to stay heavy, you will see
an IB collapse.

5732
01:58:38,950 --> 01:58:38,960

 

5733
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:40,870

So, remember, you can mark out 80s,

5734
01:58:40,870 --> 01:58:40,880
So, remember, you can mark out 80s,
 

5735
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:43,189
So, remember, you can mark out 80s,
basically IB, right? Just under IB. 80

5736
01:58:43,189 --> 01:58:43,199
basically IB, right? Just under IB. 80
 

5737
01:58:43,199 --> 01:58:44,790
basically IB, right? Just under IB. 80
is the big level. If we start rejecting

5738
01:58:44,790 --> 01:58:44,800
is the big level. If we start rejecting
 

5739
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:46,149
is the big level. If we start rejecting
this, we can come right back down here.

5740
01:58:46,149 --> 01:58:46,159
this, we can come right back down here.
 

5741
01:58:46,159 --> 01:58:48,310
this, we can come right back down here.
So, we've just cleared this out. I'll be

5742
01:58:48,310 --> 01:58:48,320
So, we've just cleared this out. I'll be
 

5743
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,149
So, we've just cleared this out. I'll be
watching these notes here and they can

5744
01:58:50,149 --> 01:58:50,159
watching these notes here and they can
 

5745
01:58:50,159 --> 01:58:51,830
watching these notes here and they can
let go this whole thing. That big buyer

5746
01:58:51,830 --> 01:58:51,840
let go this whole thing. That big buyer
 

5747
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:53,109
let go this whole thing. That big buyer
came, the other big buyer came in at

5748
01:58:53,109 --> 01:58:53,119
came, the other big buyer came in at
 

5749
01:58:53,119 --> 01:58:54,390
came, the other big buyer came in at
50s. So, here you go. They're starting

5750
01:58:54,390 --> 01:58:54,400
50s. So, here you go. They're starting
 

5751
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:56,070
50s. So, here you go. They're starting
to sell back down. They're going to test

5752
01:58:56,070 --> 01:58:56,080
to sell back down. They're going to test
 

5753
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:58,870
to sell back down. They're going to test
this here into 50s. If they fail to

5754
01:58:58,870 --> 01:58:58,880
this here into 50s. If they fail to
 

5755
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:00,550
this here into 50s. If they fail to
reclaim 80s, there's a sell. If they

5756
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:00,560
reclaim 80s, there's a sell. If they
 

5757
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:04,229
reclaim 80s, there's a sell. If they
reclaim 80s, there's a resqueeze.

5758
01:59:04,229 --> 01:59:04,239
reclaim 80s, there's a resqueeze.
 

5759
01:59:04,239 --> 01:59:05,669
reclaim 80s, there's a resqueeze.
It's just based on order flow. I'm

5760
01:59:05,669 --> 01:59:05,679
It's just based on order flow. I'm
 

5761
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:06,790
It's just based on order flow. I'm
telling you what I'm seeing based on

5762
01:59:06,790 --> 01:59:06,800
telling you what I'm seeing based on
 

5763
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:08,229
telling you what I'm seeing based on
order flow. All right. I know that

5764
01:59:08,229 --> 01:59:08,239
order flow. All right. I know that
 

5765
01:59:08,239 --> 01:59:10,149
order flow. All right. I know that
there's a huge player at 80s. So, that's

5766
01:59:10,149 --> 01:59:10,159
there's a huge player at 80s. So, that's
 

5767
01:59:10,159 --> 01:59:11,750
there's a huge player at 80s. So, that's
the big level here. Whether they reject

5768
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:11,760
the big level here. Whether they reject
 

5769
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:14,790
the big level here. Whether they reject
that or not, does he get comfortable or

5770
01:59:14,790 --> 01:59:14,800
that or not, does he get comfortable or
 

5771
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:19,589
that or not, does he get comfortable or
not?

5772
01:59:19,589 --> 01:59:19,599

 

5773
01:59:19,599 --> 01:59:21,350

So, this is like the Tyson trade. It

5774
01:59:21,350 --> 01:59:21,360
So, this is like the Tyson trade. It
 

5775
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:23,109
So, this is like the Tyson trade. It
might well set up here. There's lots of

5776
01:59:23,109 --> 01:59:23,119
might well set up here. There's lots of
 

5777
01:59:23,119 --> 01:59:24,629
might well set up here. There's lots of
buyers at the high. It just depends how

5778
01:59:24,629 --> 01:59:24,639
buyers at the high. It just depends how
 

5779
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:26,070
buyers at the high. It just depends how
much further they want to squeeze this

5780
01:59:26,070 --> 01:59:26,080
much further they want to squeeze this
 

5781
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:28,070
much further they want to squeeze this
or if they're done with it. Right. There

5782
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:28,080
or if they're done with it. Right. There
 

5783
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:29,990
or if they're done with it. Right. There
is a target up here if they really want

5784
01:59:29,990 --> 01:59:30,000
is a target up here if they really want
 

5785
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,109
is a target up here if they really want
to come for it.

5786
01:59:33,109 --> 01:59:33,119
to come for it.
 

5787
01:59:33,119 --> 01:59:36,070
to come for it.
Here's 75s. Do they test 80s here? And

5788
01:59:36,070 --> 01:59:36,080
Here's 75s. Do they test 80s here? And
 

5789
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:37,910
Here's 75s. Do they test 80s here? And
then does that buyer get out and become

5790
01:59:37,910 --> 01:59:37,920
then does that buyer get out and become
 

5791
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:39,910
then does that buyer get out and become
a seller at 80 or does he just reclaim

5792
01:59:39,910 --> 01:59:39,920
a seller at 80 or does he just reclaim
 

5793
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:58,790
a seller at 80 or does he just reclaim
and resqueeze?

5794
01:59:58,790 --> 01:59:58,800

 

5795
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:01,189

There's 80 test. They're stacking here.

5796
02:00:01,189 --> 02:00:01,199
There's 80 test. They're stacking here.
 

5797
02:00:01,199 --> 02:00:03,669
There's 80 test. They're stacking here.
95 now has a 500 lot in it. We're

5798
02:00:03,669 --> 02:00:03,679
95 now has a 500 lot in it. We're
 

5799
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:05,030
95 now has a 500 lot in it. We're
starting to see some big size. We're

5800
02:00:05,030 --> 02:00:05,040
starting to see some big size. We're
 

5801
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:06,950
starting to see some big size. We're
back to 80s. They're they're putting

5802
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:06,960
back to 80s. They're they're putting
 

5803
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:08,550
back to 80s. They're they're putting
more liquidity higher here. So, if we

5804
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:08,560
more liquidity higher here. So, if we
 

5805
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:09,830
more liquidity higher here. So, if we
lift through 80s, we're probably going

5806
02:00:09,830 --> 02:00:09,840
lift through 80s, we're probably going
 

5807
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:12,550
lift through 80s, we're probably going
to come to 995. getting starting to get

5808
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:12,560
to come to 995. getting starting to get
 

5809
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:14,070
to come to 995. getting starting to get
stuck here a little bit. 80s. They're

5810
02:00:14,070 --> 02:00:14,080
stuck here a little bit. 80s. They're
 

5811
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:16,790
stuck here a little bit. 80s. They're
looking for 995 here on a lift. So,

5812
02:00:16,790 --> 02:00:16,800
looking for 995 here on a lift. So,
 

5813
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:19,430
looking for 995 here on a lift. So,
reclaiming 80s. This is a big sensitive

5814
02:00:19,430 --> 02:00:19,440
reclaiming 80s. This is a big sensitive
 

5815
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:23,030
reclaiming 80s. This is a big sensitive
area here now. Huge huge level now. This

5816
02:00:23,030 --> 02:00:23,040
area here now. Huge huge level now. This
 

5817
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:25,109
area here now. Huge huge level now. This
is the most uh volume we've seen for

5818
02:00:25,109 --> 02:00:25,119
is the most uh volume we've seen for
 

5819
02:00:25,119 --> 02:00:28,390
is the most uh volume we've seen for
quite some time. Some big big players.

5820
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:28,400
quite some time. Some big big players.
 

5821
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:30,310
quite some time. Some big big players.
Big players. This is not retail. This is

5822
02:00:30,310 --> 02:00:30,320
Big players. This is not retail. This is
 

5823
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:31,830
Big players. This is not retail. This is
big players deciding what we're doing

5824
02:00:31,830 --> 02:00:31,840
big players deciding what we're doing
 

5825
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:33,270
big players deciding what we're doing
next, whether we're going to squeeze up

5826
02:00:33,270 --> 02:00:33,280
next, whether we're going to squeeze up
 

5827
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:35,270
next, whether we're going to squeeze up
to 2550 or not. They're going to look

5828
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:35,280
to 2550 or not. They're going to look
 

5829
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:39,510
to 2550 or not. They're going to look
for 995 here where there's a 500 lot.

5830
02:00:39,510 --> 02:00:39,520
for 995 here where there's a 500 lot.
 

5831
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:44,790
for 995 here where there's a 500 lot.
Here

5832
02:00:44,790 --> 02:00:44,800

 

5833
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,950

we go. Try and lift to that 995. You can

5834
02:00:46,950 --> 02:00:46,960
we go. Try and lift to that 995. You can
 

5835
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:49,189
we go. Try and lift to that 995. You can
see him on bit map above me. They just

5836
02:00:49,189 --> 02:00:49,199
see him on bit map above me. They just
 

5837
02:00:49,199 --> 02:00:51,030
see him on bit map above me. They just
fell short of him. Still 500 lot there.

5838
02:00:51,030 --> 02:00:51,040
fell short of him. Still 500 lot there.
 

5839
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:53,589
fell short of him. Still 500 lot there.
Looking to get filled. A seller at 995

5840
02:00:53,589 --> 02:00:53,599
Looking to get filled. A seller at 995
 

5841
02:00:53,599 --> 02:00:55,430
Looking to get filled. A seller at 995
and then through that 25,000 and then

5842
02:00:55,430 --> 02:00:55,440
and then through that 25,000 and then
 

5843
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:58,550
and then through that 25,000 and then
we'll probably get going to 25,50.

5844
02:00:58,550 --> 02:00:58,560
we'll probably get going to 25,50.
 

5845
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:01,750
we'll probably get going to 25,50.
So 95. Let's see if they fill this guy.

5846
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:01,760
So 95. Let's see if they fill this guy.
 

5847
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:03,189
So 95. Let's see if they fill this guy.
Still not filled. He's legit. He's

5848
02:01:03,189 --> 02:01:03,199
Still not filled. He's legit. He's
 

5849
02:01:03,199 --> 02:01:05,430
Still not filled. He's legit. He's
staying on the tape. He's legit. 510 lot

5850
02:01:05,430 --> 02:01:05,440
staying on the tape. He's legit. 510 lot
 

5851
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:10,070
staying on the tape. He's legit. 510 lot
here. He's moved up. He pulled. spoofer

5852
02:01:10,070 --> 02:01:10,080
here. He's moved up. He pulled. spoofer
 

5853
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:12,470
here. He's moved up. He pulled. spoofer
spoofed it. Literally the moment he went

5854
02:01:12,470 --> 02:01:12,480
spoofed it. Literally the moment he went
 

5855
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:15,990
spoofed it. Literally the moment he went
to get tapped, he pulled it.

5856
02:01:15,990 --> 02:01:16,000
to get tapped, he pulled it.
 

5857
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,510
to get tapped, he pulled it.
Right back. What a nasty bastard. Right.

5858
02:01:19,510 --> 02:01:19,520
Right back. What a nasty bastard. Right.
 

5859
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:21,750
Right back. What a nasty bastard. Right.
Back down to the 80s then. So, we've got

5860
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:21,760
Back down to the 80s then. So, we've got
 

5861
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:24,229
Back down to the 80s then. So, we've got
a big buyer who has been there at 80s.

5862
02:01:24,229 --> 02:01:24,239
a big buyer who has been there at 80s.
 

5863
02:01:24,239 --> 02:01:25,589
a big buyer who has been there at 80s.
All the time he's in position, he's

5864
02:01:25,589 --> 02:01:25,599
All the time he's in position, he's
 

5865
02:01:25,599 --> 02:01:27,910
All the time he's in position, he's
okay. If you start to see drifts under

5866
02:01:27,910 --> 02:01:27,920
okay. If you start to see drifts under
 

5867
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:29,750
okay. If you start to see drifts under
this, it can get very, very nasty. Back

5868
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:29,760
this, it can get very, very nasty. Back
 

5869
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:31,589
this, it can get very, very nasty. Back
down to value area high potentially. But

5870
02:01:31,589 --> 02:01:31,599
down to value area high potentially. But
 

5871
02:01:31,599 --> 02:01:34,870
down to value area high potentially. But
that player so far is okay. That player

5872
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:34,880
that player so far is okay. That player
 

5873
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:36,870
that player so far is okay. That player
so far is okay. And they can drift up

5874
02:01:36,870 --> 02:01:36,880
so far is okay. And they can drift up
 

5875
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:38,550
so far is okay. And they can drift up
here.

5876
02:01:38,550 --> 02:01:38,560
here.
 

5877
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,950
here.
So if they put on a big old squeeze,

5878
02:01:40,950 --> 02:01:40,960
So if they put on a big old squeeze,
 

5879
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:42,550
So if they put on a big old squeeze,
they can drift up here if they want to

5880
02:01:42,550 --> 02:01:42,560
they can drift up here if they want to
 

5881
02:01:42,560 --> 02:02:00,229
they can drift up here if they want to
put on a big old squeeze.

5882
02:02:00,229 --> 02:02:00,239

 

5883
02:02:00,239 --> 02:02:01,830

How much is bookmap monthly? I'm not

5884
02:02:01,830 --> 02:02:01,840
How much is bookmap monthly? I'm not
 

5885
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:06,550
How much is bookmap monthly? I'm not
even sure. It's not very expensive.

5886
02:02:06,550 --> 02:02:06,560

 

5887
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:08,149

No, I'm not currently in, guys. I'm not

5888
02:02:08,149 --> 02:02:08,159
No, I'm not currently in, guys. I'm not
 

5889
02:02:08,159 --> 02:02:09,589
No, I'm not currently in, guys. I'm not
currently in. I'm I'm watching. I'll

5890
02:02:09,589 --> 02:02:09,599
currently in. I'm I'm watching. I'll
 

5891
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:11,189
currently in. I'm I'm watching. I'll
consider a fade if we come up here and

5892
02:02:11,189 --> 02:02:11,199
consider a fade if we come up here and
 

5893
02:02:11,199 --> 02:02:13,270
consider a fade if we come up here and
we start failing. I will consider a

5894
02:02:13,270 --> 02:02:13,280
we start failing. I will consider a
 

5895
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:15,669
we start failing. I will consider a
fade, but I don't want to be front side

5896
02:02:15,669 --> 02:02:15,679
fade, but I don't want to be front side
 

5897
02:02:15,679 --> 02:02:17,589
fade, but I don't want to be front side
on it. I want it to perk out if we're

5898
02:02:17,589 --> 02:02:17,599
on it. I want it to perk out if we're
 

5899
02:02:17,599 --> 02:02:18,950
on it. I want it to perk out if we're
going to do that because it's possible

5900
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:18,960
going to do that because it's possible
 

5901
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:21,350
going to do that because it's possible
they want to be really dirty that they

5902
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:21,360
they want to be really dirty that they
 

5903
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:22,629
they want to be really dirty that they
come all the way up for previous day

5904
02:02:22,629 --> 02:02:22,639
come all the way up for previous day
 

5905
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:24,310
come all the way up for previous day
high. So, I don't want to be front side

5906
02:02:24,310 --> 02:02:24,320
high. So, I don't want to be front side
 

5907
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:26,550
high. So, I don't want to be front side
on something above IB, right? But if we

5908
02:02:26,550 --> 02:02:26,560
on something above IB, right? But if we
 

5909
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:28,390
on something above IB, right? But if we
leave trap volume, if we come up here,

5910
02:02:28,390 --> 02:02:28,400
leave trap volume, if we come up here,
 

5911
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:29,750
leave trap volume, if we come up here,
or even if we do this, this, this, and

5912
02:02:29,750 --> 02:02:29,760
or even if we do this, this, this, and
 

5913
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:32,229
or even if we do this, this, this, and
this, there's a fade back down to there.

5914
02:02:32,229 --> 02:02:32,239
this, there's a fade back down to there.
 

5915
02:02:32,239 --> 02:02:34,790
this, there's a fade back down to there.
So, I will consider that move if we

5916
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:34,800
So, I will consider that move if we
 

5917
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,669
So, I will consider that move if we
leave this or if we poke through that

5918
02:02:37,669 --> 02:02:37,679
leave this or if we poke through that
 

5919
02:02:37,679 --> 02:02:41,109
leave this or if we poke through that
and we leave excess up here

5920
02:02:41,109 --> 02:02:41,119
and we leave excess up here
 

5921
02:02:41,119 --> 02:02:42,629
and we leave excess up here
and then we collapse back down. I'd

5922
02:02:42,629 --> 02:02:42,639
and then we collapse back down. I'd
 

5923
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:43,750
and then we collapse back down. I'd
consider that. Otherwise, I'm not

5924
02:02:43,750 --> 02:02:43,760
consider that. Otherwise, I'm not
 

5925
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:48,310
consider that. Otherwise, I'm not
touching it.

5926
02:02:48,310 --> 02:02:48,320

 

5927
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:52,709

Where's that next node?

5928
02:02:52,709 --> 02:02:52,719

 

5929
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:56,149

70s. Where's this?

5930
02:02:56,149 --> 02:02:56,159
70s. Where's this?
 

5931
02:02:56,159 --> 02:02:59,589
70s. Where's this?
2540s. Yeah, same level.

5932
02:02:59,589 --> 02:02:59,599
2540s. Yeah, same level.
 

5933
02:02:59,599 --> 02:03:00,950
2540s. Yeah, same level.
Okay. Okay, some buyers starting to get

5934
02:03:00,950 --> 02:03:00,960
Okay. Okay, some buyers starting to get
 

5935
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:02,709
Okay. Okay, some buyers starting to get
caught at these highs a little bit, but

5936
02:03:02,709 --> 02:03:02,719
caught at these highs a little bit, but
 

5937
02:03:02,719 --> 02:03:04,629
caught at these highs a little bit, but
still no collapse back down. We're still

5938
02:03:04,629 --> 02:03:04,639
still no collapse back down. We're still
 

5939
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:06,470
still no collapse back down. We're still
that 80s is still the big level, right?

5940
02:03:06,470 --> 02:03:06,480
that 80s is still the big level, right?
 

5941
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:19,990
that 80s is still the big level, right?
980s is your big level.

5942
02:03:19,990 --> 02:03:20,000

 

5943
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,870

Back to these 80s, back to this IB high.

5944
02:03:24,870 --> 02:03:24,880
Back to these 80s, back to this IB high.
 

5945
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:26,550
Back to these 80s, back to this IB high.
We still have this big player. You can

5946
02:03:26,550 --> 02:03:26,560
We still have this big player. You can
 

5947
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:28,070
We still have this big player. You can
see this big buy. Still comfortable

5948
02:03:28,070 --> 02:03:28,080
see this big buy. Still comfortable
 

5949
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:29,510
see this big buy. Still comfortable
right now. So they tried to sell through

5950
02:03:29,510 --> 02:03:29,520
right now. So they tried to sell through
 

5951
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:30,629
right now. So they tried to sell through
him. Couldn't get through him. He's

5952
02:03:30,629 --> 02:03:30,639
him. Couldn't get through him. He's
 

5953
02:03:30,639 --> 02:03:33,270
him. Couldn't get through him. He's
still comfortable until he's out of

5954
02:03:33,270 --> 02:03:33,280
still comfortable until he's out of
 

5955
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:35,189
still comfortable until he's out of
position. There's no short trade here

5956
02:03:35,189 --> 02:03:35,199
position. There's no short trade here
 

5957
02:03:35,199 --> 02:03:37,189
position. There's no short trade here
because we can still lift. We have to

5958
02:03:37,189 --> 02:03:37,199
because we can still lift. We have to
 

5959
02:03:37,199 --> 02:03:39,030
because we can still lift. We have to
wait for it to be backside and him to be

5960
02:03:39,030 --> 02:03:39,040
wait for it to be backside and him to be
 

5961
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:50,629
wait for it to be backside and him to be
out of position.

5962
02:03:50,629 --> 02:03:50,639

 

5963
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:53,830

CBD still very very very strong. Very

Patient. Just patient, guys. Patient. If

Patient. Just patient, guys. Patient. If
 

5969

Patient. Just patient, guys. Patient. If
you're long, it's no reason to sell.

5970
02:04:01,830 --> 02:04:01,840
you're long, it's no reason to sell.
 

5971
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:03,430
you're long, it's no reason to sell.
You've taken a partial. You can try and

5972
02:04:03,430 --> 02:04:03,440
You've taken a partial. You can try and
 

5973
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:06,390
You've taken a partial. You can try and
get up into that red box above you. But

5974
02:04:06,390 --> 02:04:06,400
get up into that red box above you. But
 

5975
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:09,030
get up into that red box above you. But
I would not want it underneath this if

5976
02:04:09,030 --> 02:04:09,040
I would not want it underneath this if
 

5977
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:10,950
I would not want it underneath this if
you were long. I will wait to see if a

5978
02:04:10,950 --> 02:04:10,960
you were long. I will wait to see if a
 

5979
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:12,790
you were long. I will wait to see if a
short sets up for a rotation. You would

5980
02:04:12,790 --> 02:04:12,800
short sets up for a rotation. You would
 

5981
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:29,589
short sets up for a rotation. You would
not want it under this if you're long.

5982
02:04:29,589 --> 02:04:29,599

 

5983
02:04:29,599 --> 02:04:31,350

How far do we need it down under? We

5984
02:04:31,350 --> 02:04:31,360
How far do we need it down under? We
 

5985
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:33,350
How far do we need it down under? We
need a break of 80 and a and either a

5986
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:33,360
need a break of 80 and a and either a
 

5987
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:35,830
need a break of 80 and a and either a
retest of 18 to see sellers step in,

5988
02:04:35,830 --> 02:04:35,840
retest of 18 to see sellers step in,
 

5989
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:37,510
retest of 18 to see sellers step in,
right? Or we just need a break and lots

5990
02:04:37,510 --> 02:04:37,520
right? Or we just need a break and lots
 

5991
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:39,750
right? Or we just need a break and lots
of aggressive sellers start to step in,

5992
02:04:39,750 --> 02:04:39,760
of aggressive sellers start to step in,
 

5993
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:41,830
of aggressive sellers start to step in,
right? It's not so much how far we go

5994
02:04:41,830 --> 02:04:41,840
right? It's not so much how far we go
 

5995
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:43,350
right? It's not so much how far we go
underneath him. It's more like what

5996
02:04:43,350 --> 02:04:43,360
underneath him. It's more like what
 

5997
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:45,270
underneath him. It's more like what
happens on the tape. Does he become a

5998
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:45,280
happens on the tape. Does he become a
 

5999
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:48,870
happens on the tape. Does he become a
seller? Does he become a seller?

6000
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:48,880
seller? Does he become a seller?
 

6001
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:51,030
seller? Does he become a seller?
You know, we can

6002
02:04:51,030 --> 02:04:51,040
You know, we can
 

6003
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:52,790
You know, we can
They want to be really aggressive here.

6004
02:04:52,790 --> 02:04:52,800
They want to be really aggressive here.
 

6005
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:55,910
They want to be really aggressive here.
Let me just do

6006
02:04:55,910 --> 02:04:55,920
Let me just do
 

6007
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:58,790
Let me just do
projection on this. Give me a second

6008
02:04:58,790 --> 02:04:58,800
projection on this. Give me a second
 

6009
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:03,430
projection on this. Give me a second
back. Measured move would also be to 40.

6010
02:05:03,430 --> 02:05:03,440
back. Measured move would also be to 40.
 

6011
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:04,950
back. Measured move would also be to 40.
All right. A port a measured move is

6012
02:05:04,950 --> 02:05:04,960
All right. A port a measured move is
 

6013
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:08,310
All right. A port a measured move is
also into 40s and 50s. So I think

6014
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:08,320
also into 40s and 50s. So I think
 

6015
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:09,669
also into 40s and 50s. So I think
there's a good chance we actually get

6016
02:05:09,669 --> 02:05:09,679
there's a good chance we actually get
 

6017
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:11,109
there's a good chance we actually get
into here right now. It's also a

6018
02:05:11,109 --> 02:05:11,119
into here right now. It's also a
 

6019
02:05:11,119 --> 02:05:13,510
into here right now. It's also a
measured move on an hourly. There's a

6020
02:05:13,510 --> 02:05:13,520
measured move on an hourly. There's a
 

6021
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:15,510
measured move on an hourly. There's a
good chance we get up into that right

6022
02:05:15,510 --> 02:05:15,520
good chance we get up into that right
 

6023
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:28,550
good chance we get up into that right
now.

6024
02:05:28,550 --> 02:05:28,560

 

6025
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:29,750

Oh, it's got a little caught there into

6026
02:05:29,750 --> 02:05:29,760
Oh, it's got a little caught there into
 

6027
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:31,990
Oh, it's got a little caught there into
tens, but still buyers are comfortable

6028
02:05:31,990 --> 02:05:32,000
tens, but still buyers are comfortable
 

6029
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,430
tens, but still buyers are comfortable
underneath. Right. So, we need the big

6030
02:05:33,430 --> 02:05:33,440
underneath. Right. So, we need the big
 

6031
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:37,109
underneath. Right. So, we need the big
players out of position.

6032
02:05:37,109 --> 02:05:37,119

 

6033
02:05:37,119 --> 02:05:39,669

Why don't I like ranging days? I just

6034
02:05:39,669 --> 02:05:39,679
Why don't I like ranging days? I just
 

6035
02:05:39,679 --> 02:05:41,669
Why don't I like ranging days? I just
think they provide less opportunity.

6036
02:05:41,669 --> 02:05:41,679
think they provide less opportunity.
 

6037
02:05:41,679 --> 02:05:43,430
think they provide less opportunity.
It's just it's not my bread and butter.

6038
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:43,440
It's just it's not my bread and butter.
 

6039
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:44,709
It's just it's not my bread and butter.
I'll still make money from them like we

6040
02:05:44,709 --> 02:05:44,719
I'll still make money from them like we
 

6041
02:05:44,719 --> 02:05:46,709
I'll still make money from them like we
have this morning, but I'm not going to

6042
02:05:46,709 --> 02:05:46,719
have this morning, but I'm not going to
 

6043
02:05:46,719 --> 02:05:48,550
have this morning, but I'm not going to
size and be aggressive on a ranging day.

6044
02:05:48,550 --> 02:05:48,560
size and be aggressive on a ranging day.
 

6045
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:50,070
size and be aggressive on a ranging day.
I am going to size and being aggressive

6046
02:05:50,070 --> 02:05:50,080
I am going to size and being aggressive
 

6047
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:52,390
I am going to size and being aggressive
when we leave a range, especially a

6048
02:05:52,390 --> 02:05:52,400
when we leave a range, especially a
 

6049
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:54,790
when we leave a range, especially a
multi-time frame range like a weekly or

6050
02:05:54,790 --> 02:05:54,800
multi-time frame range like a weekly or
 

6051
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:56,870
multi-time frame range like a weekly or
a monthly,

6052
02:05:56,870 --> 02:05:56,880
a monthly,
 

6053
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:58,310
a monthly,
which is why the last two weeks have

6054
02:05:58,310 --> 02:05:58,320
which is why the last two weeks have
 

6055
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:05,830
which is why the last two weeks have
been so good. So, so good.

6056
02:06:05,830 --> 02:06:05,840

little bit of excess there at 10. Still

little bit of excess there at 10. Still
 

6075
02:06:23,119 --> 02:06:29,589
little bit of excess there at 10. Still
not underneath this key level, though.

6076
02:06:29,589 --> 02:06:29,599

 

6077
02:06:29,599 --> 02:06:31,270

We'll consider a short under this gray

6078
02:06:31,270 --> 02:06:31,280
We'll consider a short under this gray
 

6079
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:33,350
We'll consider a short under this gray
box. I want to be very careful of traps,

6080
02:06:33,350 --> 02:06:33,360
box. I want to be very careful of traps,
 

6081
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:35,430
box. I want to be very careful of traps,
but I will consider this play here under

6082
02:06:35,430 --> 02:06:35,440
but I will consider this play here under
 

6083
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:37,350
but I will consider this play here under

6084
02:06:37,350 --> 02:06:37,360

here.
Starting to like maybe come in now.

Starting to like maybe come in now.
We'll see. See if they defend it or not.

6088
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:43,760
We'll see. See if they defend it or not.
 

6089
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:46,310
We'll see. See if they defend it or not.
Here we go. Sellers at these lows. It's

6090
02:06:46,310 --> 02:06:46,320
Here we go. Sellers at these lows. It's
 

6091
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:48,149
Here we go. Sellers at these lows. It's
all about how we react now down here.

6092
02:06:48,149 --> 02:06:48,159
all about how we react now down here.
 

6093
02:06:48,159 --> 02:06:56,870
all about how we react now down here.
Whether they get caught again.

6094
02:06:56,870 --> 02:06:56,880

 

6095
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:58,470

Trying to bid up here. We might swipe to

6096
02:06:58,470 --> 02:06:58,480
Trying to bid up here. We might swipe to
 

6097
02:06:58,480 --> 02:07:02,390
Trying to bid up here. We might swipe to
60 here. Here's 80s. Watching this now.

6098
02:07:02,390 --> 02:07:02,400
60 here. Here's 80s. Watching this now.
 

6099
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:04,149
60 here. Here's 80s. Watching this now.
Reaction here is key. What we do now is

6100
02:07:04,149 --> 02:07:04,159
Reaction here is key. What we do now is
 

6101
02:07:04,159 --> 02:07:06,069
Reaction here is key. What we do now is
key. We're at the level. It's what we do

6102
02:07:06,069 --> 02:07:06,079
key. We're at the level. It's what we do
 

6103
02:07:06,079 --> 02:07:07,669
key. We're at the level. It's what we do
now is key. They're out of position. Do

6104
02:07:07,669 --> 02:07:07,679
now is key. They're out of position. Do
 

6105
02:07:07,679 --> 02:07:11,990
now is key. They're out of position. Do
we swipe to 60s or do we pump to 95s?

6106
02:07:11,990 --> 02:07:12,000
we swipe to 60s or do we pump to 95s?
 

6107
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,189
we swipe to 60s or do we pump to 95s?
Want to see us leave this box?

6108
02:07:15,189 --> 02:07:15,199
Want to see us leave this box?
 

6109
02:07:15,199 --> 02:07:16,790
Want to see us leave this box?
See us leave this box. Ideally, we leave

6110
02:07:16,790 --> 02:07:16,800
See us leave this box. Ideally, we leave
 

6111
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,229
See us leave this box. Ideally, we leave
and retest it because that's going to

6112
02:07:18,229 --> 02:07:18,239
and retest it because that's going to
 

6113
02:07:18,239 --> 02:07:23,350
and retest it because that's going to
make it a little bit cleaner to trade.

6114
02:07:23,350 --> 02:07:23,360

 

6115
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:25,430

If they come up to 90s and reject it and

6116
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:25,440
If they come up to 90s and reject it and
 

6117
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,350
If they come up to 90s and reject it and
come back under 80s, I'm also interested

6118
02:07:27,350 --> 02:07:27,360
come back under 80s, I'm also interested
 

6119
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:29,589
come back under 80s, I'm also interested
at that point. They're stacking down at

6120
02:07:29,589 --> 02:07:29,599
at that point. They're stacking down at
 

6121
02:07:29,599 --> 02:07:32,310
at that point. They're stacking down at
60s and 57. So, they come up to 90s,

6122
02:07:32,310 --> 02:07:32,320
60s and 57. So, they come up to 90s,
 

6123
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:34,709
60s and 57. So, they come up to 90s,
reject, snap 80s. They're starting to

6124
02:07:34,709 --> 02:07:34,719
reject, snap 80s. They're starting to
 

6125
02:07:34,719 --> 02:07:36,390
reject, snap 80s. They're starting to
stack at 70s. So there might be a swipe

6126
02:07:36,390 --> 02:07:36,400
stack at 70s. So there might be a swipe
 

6127
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:37,990
stack at 70s. So there might be a swipe
coming here for at least like a 10 20

6128
02:07:37,990 --> 02:07:38,000
coming here for at least like a 10 20
 

6129
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,149
coming here for at least like a 10 20
point fill. Not a lot. Ideally, we'd

6130
02:07:40,149 --> 02:07:40,159
point fill. Not a lot. Ideally, we'd
 

6131
02:07:40,159 --> 02:07:42,390
point fill. Not a lot. Ideally, we'd
love it all the way down into here.

6132
02:07:42,390 --> 02:07:42,400
love it all the way down into here.
 

6133
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:47,510
love it all the way down into here.
Could be like a 40 point trade.

6134
02:07:47,510 --> 02:07:47,520

 

6135
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:49,430

Okay, that guy at 70's just lifted and

6136
02:07:49,430 --> 02:07:49,440
Okay, that guy at 70's just lifted and
 

6137
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:51,270
Okay, that guy at 70's just lifted and
moved to 55. So I'm still watching to

6138
02:07:51,270 --> 02:07:51,280
moved to 55. So I'm still watching to
 

6139
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:53,030
moved to 55. So I'm still watching to
see if they reject 90 and then snap 80

6140
02:07:53,030 --> 02:07:53,040
see if they reject 90 and then snap 80
 

6141
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:54,870
see if they reject 90 and then snap 80
for a trade here. That's my going to be

6142
02:07:54,870 --> 02:07:54,880
for a trade here. That's my going to be
 

6143
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:56,550
for a trade here. That's my going to be
my entry. For those who don't

6144
02:07:56,550 --> 02:07:56,560
my entry. For those who don't
 

6145
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:59,750
my entry. For those who don't
understand, if we reject 90 and break

6146
02:07:59,750 --> 02:07:59,760
understand, if we reject 90 and break
 

6147
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:02,790
understand, if we reject 90 and break
80, I will consider a short entry. In

6148
02:08:02,790 --> 02:08:02,800
80, I will consider a short entry. In
 

6149
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:05,270
80, I will consider a short entry. In
case I haven't made that really, really,

6150
02:08:05,270 --> 02:08:05,280
case I haven't made that really, really,
 

6151
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:08,550
case I haven't made that really, really,
really clear. Until that point, I will

6152
02:08:08,550 --> 02:08:08,560
really clear. Until that point, I will
 

6153
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:11,350
really clear. Until that point, I will
not consider an entry

6154
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:11,360
not consider an entry
 

6155
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:15,990
not consider an entry
for chat tells me off.

6156
02:08:15,990 --> 02:08:16,000

 

6157
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,390

We don't do that, I will not be entering

6158
02:08:18,390 --> 02:08:18,400
We don't do that, I will not be entering
 

6159
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:21,990
We don't do that, I will not be entering
the trade.

6160
02:08:21,990 --> 02:08:22,000

 

6161
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:25,510

Here's

6162
02:08:25,510 --> 02:08:25,520

 

6163
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:28,629

the test of 90

6164
02:08:28,629 --> 02:08:28,639
the test of 90
 

6165
02:08:28,639 --> 02:08:30,709
the test of 90
through 90s. No trade yet then. So, we

6166
02:08:30,709 --> 02:08:30,719
through 90s. No trade yet then. So, we
 

6167
02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:32,390
through 90s. No trade yet then. So, we
have to come back under 80s now and stay

6168
02:08:32,390 --> 02:08:32,400
have to come back under 80s now and stay
 

6169
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:34,229
have to come back under 80s now and stay
heavy. Otherwise, there is no short side

6170
02:08:34,229 --> 02:08:34,239
heavy. Otherwise, there is no short side
 

6171
02:08:34,239 --> 02:08:36,229
heavy. Otherwise, there is no short side
setup. They still have unfinished

6172
02:08:36,229 --> 02:08:36,239
setup. They still have unfinished
 

6173
02:08:36,239 --> 02:08:37,750
setup. They still have unfinished
business if they want to run up.

6174
02:08:37,750 --> 02:08:37,760
business if they want to run up.
 

6175
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:40,149
business if they want to run up.
Remember, there is a little imbalance to

6176
02:08:40,149 --> 02:08:40,159
Remember, there is a little imbalance to
 

6177
02:08:40,159 --> 02:08:41,750
Remember, there is a little imbalance to
98. I wouldn't really want to see that

6178
02:08:41,750 --> 02:08:41,760
98. I wouldn't really want to see that
 

6179
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:42,709
98. I wouldn't really want to see that
filled though. There is a little

6180
02:08:42,709 --> 02:08:42,719
filled though. There is a little
 

6181
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:46,069
filled though. There is a little
imbalance to 98. Let's uh have not

6182
02:08:46,069 --> 02:08:46,079
imbalance to 98. Let's uh have not
 

6183
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:47,589
imbalance to 98. Let's uh have not
closed through 90s. That's good. More

6184
02:08:47,589 --> 02:08:47,599
closed through 90s. That's good. More
 

6185
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:49,109
closed through 90s. That's good. More
buyers just got a little bit caught

6186
02:08:49,109 --> 02:08:49,119
buyers just got a little bit caught
 

6187
02:08:49,119 --> 02:08:51,589
buyers just got a little bit caught
there. Didn't feel the imbalance, but

6188
02:08:51,589 --> 02:08:51,599
there. Didn't feel the imbalance, but
 

6189
02:08:51,599 --> 02:08:53,589
there. Didn't feel the imbalance, but
let's see if we get back under 80s and

6190
02:08:53,589 --> 02:08:53,599
let's see if we get back under 80s and
 

6191
02:08:53,599 --> 02:08:56,790
let's see if we get back under 80s and
start letting go.

6192
02:08:56,790 --> 02:08:56,800
start letting go.
 

6193
02:08:56,800 --> 02:09:08,870
start letting go.
We will see. Vi

6194
02:09:08,870 --> 02:09:08,880

 

6195
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:10,709

must not be front side, right? Because

6196
02:09:10,709 --> 02:09:10,719
must not be front side, right? Because
 

6197
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:12,550
must not be front side, right? Because
if they have not finished yet, they're

6198
02:09:12,550 --> 02:09:12,560
if they have not finished yet, they're
 

6199
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:14,069
if they have not finished yet, they're
going to move 50 points higher. So,

6200
02:09:14,069 --> 02:09:14,079
going to move 50 points higher. So,
 

6201
02:09:14,079 --> 02:09:15,830
going to move 50 points higher. So,
let's just see. Come on. But that might

6202
02:09:15,830 --> 02:09:15,840
let's just see. Come on. But that might
 

6203
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:24,470
let's just see. Come on. But that might
be pausing me again.

6204
02:09:24,470 --> 02:09:24,480

 

6205
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,390

Once we get out of this, we're going to

6206
02:09:26,390 --> 02:09:26,400
Once we get out of this, we're going to
 

6207
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:28,709
Once we get out of this, we're going to
do the do the giveaway because I almost

6208
02:09:28,709 --> 02:09:28,719
do the do the giveaway because I almost
 

6209
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:37,990
do the do the giveaway because I almost
forgot there. Almost forgot.

6210
02:09:37,990 --> 02:09:38,000

 

6211
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,390

What option for Butmat? Uh just start

6212
02:09:40,390 --> 02:09:40,400
What option for Butmat? Uh just start
 

6213
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:43,430
What option for Butmat? Uh just start
with global global CME data assuming

6214
02:09:43,430 --> 02:09:43,440
with global global CME data assuming
 

6215
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:48,310
with global global CME data assuming
you're just trading uh uh ES or NQ.

6216
02:09:48,310 --> 02:09:48,320
you're just trading uh uh ES or NQ.
 

6217
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:49,990
you're just trading uh uh ES or NQ.
If you're trading metals, then you're

6218
02:09:49,990 --> 02:09:50,000
If you're trading metals, then you're
 

6219
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:56,790
If you're trading metals, then you're
going to need Comx data.

6220
02:09:56,790 --> 02:09:56,800

 

6221
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:58,550

So you're Yeah, big gamma level. You're

6222
02:09:58,550 --> 02:09:58,560
So you're Yeah, big gamma level. You're
 

6223
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:01,030
So you're Yeah, big gamma level. You're
saying SPX 6900. So we're not quite

6224
02:10:01,030 --> 02:10:01,040
saying SPX 6900. So we're not quite
 

6225
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:03,750
saying SPX 6900. So we're not quite
there yet. SPX is at 892. So not too

6226
02:10:03,750 --> 02:10:03,760
there yet. SPX is at 892. So not too
 

6227
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:05,750
there yet. SPX is at 892. So not too
far.

6228
02:10:05,750 --> 02:10:05,760
far.
 

6229
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:07,669
far.
Very slow day. I mean, it's not too bad.

6230
02:10:07,669 --> 02:10:07,679
Very slow day. I mean, it's not too bad.
 

6231
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:10,390
Very slow day. I mean, it's not too bad.
The range hasn't been too bad, you know,

6232
02:10:10,390 --> 02:10:10,400
The range hasn't been too bad, you know,
 

6233
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:15,030
The range hasn't been too bad, you know,
off the uh low seven. Still 300 points.

6234
02:10:15,030 --> 02:10:15,040
off the uh low seven. Still 300 points.
 

6235
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:17,510
off the uh low seven. Still 300 points.
It seems slow, but it's still 300

6236
02:10:17,510 --> 02:10:17,520
It seems slow, but it's still 300
 

6237
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:19,030
It seems slow, but it's still 300
points, but remember, we did a lot of

6238
02:10:19,030 --> 02:10:19,040
points, but remember, we did a lot of
 

6239
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:21,350
points, but remember, we did a lot of
the damage overnight. We did a lot of

6240
02:10:21,350 --> 02:10:21,360
the damage overnight. We did a lot of
 

6241
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:22,390
the damage overnight. We did a lot of
the damage over the night, right?

6242
02:10:22,390 --> 02:10:22,400
the damage over the night, right?
 

6243
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:24,310
the damage over the night, right?
They're back through. So, no no short

6244
02:10:24,310 --> 02:10:24,320
They're back through. So, no no short
 

6245
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:25,430
They're back through. So, no no short
trade. They're probably going to come up

6246
02:10:25,430 --> 02:10:25,440
trade. They're probably going to come up
 

6247
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:27,750
trade. They're probably going to come up
for these 25s. This is why we why we're

6248
02:10:27,750 --> 02:10:27,760
for these 25s. This is why we why we're
 

6249
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:30,629
for these 25s. This is why we why we're
patient, right? Did we see this? Did we

6250
02:10:30,629 --> 02:10:30,639
patient, right? Did we see this? Did we
 

6251
02:10:30,639 --> 02:10:32,790
patient, right? Did we see this? Did we
see this? No, we didn't. All right. So,

6252
02:10:32,790 --> 02:10:32,800
see this? No, we didn't. All right. So,
 

6253
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:33,910
see this? No, we didn't. All right. So,
they're going to clear out and try and

6254
02:10:33,910 --> 02:10:33,920
they're going to clear out and try and
 

6255
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:35,270
they're going to clear out and try and
come up to that. So, anyone who's long

6256
02:10:35,270 --> 02:10:35,280
come up to that. So, anyone who's long
 

6257
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:37,189
come up to that. So, anyone who's long
still from here, you still held this

6258
02:10:37,189 --> 02:10:37,199
still from here, you still held this
 

6259
02:10:37,199 --> 02:10:39,189
still from here, you still held this
gray shelf. You can still look you get

6260
02:10:39,189 --> 02:10:39,199
gray shelf. You can still look you get
 

6261
02:10:39,199 --> 02:10:41,510
gray shelf. You can still look you get
up into here. This is why I say until we

6262
02:10:41,510 --> 02:10:41,520
up into here. This is why I say until we
 

6263
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:42,870
up into here. This is why I say until we
see this, we don't do anything. All

6264
02:10:42,870 --> 02:10:42,880
see this, we don't do anything. All
 

6265
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:45,430
see this, we don't do anything. All
right? We don't front. We do not guess,

6266
02:10:45,430 --> 02:10:45,440
right? We don't front. We do not guess,
 

6267
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:49,109
right? We don't front. We do not guess,
right? We wait to see participants be

6268
02:10:49,109 --> 02:10:49,119
right? We wait to see participants be
 

6269
02:10:49,119 --> 02:10:51,350
right? We wait to see participants be
stuck. No one was stuck, right? So,

6270
02:10:51,350 --> 02:10:51,360
stuck. No one was stuck, right? So,
 

6271
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:53,510
stuck. No one was stuck, right? So,
they're going to lift.

6272
02:10:53,510 --> 02:10:53,520
they're going to lift.
 

6273
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:55,830
they're going to lift.

6335
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:14,709
talking about that level on SPX. So,

6340
02:12:19,270 --> 02:12:19,280
they leave excess and track these
 

6341
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:20,629
they leave excess and track these
buyers, there's going to be a short back

6342
02:12:20,629 --> 02:12:20,639
buyers, there's going to be a short back
 

6343
02:12:20,639 --> 02:12:25,910
buyers, there's going to be a short back
down. If they hit those levels,

6344
02:12:25,910 --> 02:12:25,920

 

6345
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:27,830

sellers coming in here at 24s, this is

6346
02:12:27,830 --> 02:12:27,840
sellers coming in here at 24s, this is
 

6347
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:30,310
sellers coming in here at 24s, this is
starting to be interesting here. This is

6348
02:12:30,310 --> 02:12:30,320
starting to be interesting here. This is
 

6349
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:35,189
starting to be interesting here. This is
where we get excess.

6350
02:12:35,189 --> 02:12:35,199

 

6351
02:12:35,199 --> 02:12:39,350

What was that? level 10 and 25K.

6352
02:12:39,350 --> 02:12:39,360
What was that? level 10 and 25K.
 

6353
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:41,510
What was that? level 10 and 25K.
So buyers came in at 10 and 25K. If we

6354
02:12:41,510 --> 02:12:41,520
So buyers came in at 10 and 25K. If we
 

6355
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:43,030
So buyers came in at 10 and 25K. If we
start losing that, it might be a good

6356
02:12:43,030 --> 02:12:43,040
start losing that, it might be a good
 

6357
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:49,189
start losing that, it might be a good
sign that this thing's ready.

6358
02:12:49,189 --> 02:12:49,199

 

6359
02:12:49,199 --> 02:12:51,189

Transition here from buy to sell. So you

6360
02:12:51,189 --> 02:12:51,199
Transition here from buy to sell. So you
 

6361
02:12:51,199 --> 02:12:52,550
Transition here from buy to sell. So you
can see it on the book. Look at the high

6362
02:12:52,550 --> 02:12:52,560
can see it on the book. Look at the high
 

6363
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:54,390
can see it on the book. Look at the high
of day. We didn't quite make this red

6364
02:12:54,390 --> 02:12:54,400

6365
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:57,830
of day. We didn't quite make this red
box. We got very very very close. Uh

6366
02:12:57,830 --> 02:12:57,840

6394
02:13:54,310 --> 02:13:54,320

 

6395
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:56,390

Why did I put the gray box at 980?

6396
02:13:56,390 --> 02:13:56,400
Why did I put the gray box at 980?
 

6397
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:58,550
Why did I put the gray box at 980?
Because of the volume we built out. The

6398
02:13:58,550 --> 02:13:58,560
Because of the volume we built out. The
 

6399
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:00,629
Because of the volume we built out. The
volume. You see how we go? We think

6400
02:14:00,629 --> 02:14:00,639
volume. You see how we go? We think
 

6401
02:14:00,639 --> 02:14:01,910
volume. You see how we go? We think
about this. Where where's the gray

6402
02:14:01,910 --> 02:14:01,920
about this. Where where's the gray
 

6403
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:06,310
about this. Where where's the gray
boxes? All right. So, here gray box. All

6404
02:14:06,310 --> 02:14:06,320
boxes? All right. So, here gray box. All
 

6405
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:08,310
boxes? All right. So, here gray box. All
right. And we know like I talked about

6406
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:08,320
right. And we know like I talked about
 

6407
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:10,229
right. And we know like I talked about
there was a huge buyer there, wasn't

6408
02:14:10,229 --> 02:14:10,239
there was a huge buyer there, wasn't
 

6409
02:14:10,239 --> 02:14:12,470
there was a huge buyer there, wasn't
there? We talked about him. Huge buy

6410
02:14:12,470 --> 02:14:12,480
there? We talked about him. Huge buy
 

6411
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:14,870
there? We talked about him. Huge buy
there.

6412
02:14:14,870 --> 02:14:14,880
there.
 

6413
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:17,270
there.
Huge buy there right here. Look how big.

6414
02:14:17,270 --> 02:14:17,280
Huge buy there right here. Look how big.
 

6415
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:19,589
Huge buy there right here. Look how big.
Huge buyer. 600 lot market. I think it

6416
02:14:19,589 --> 02:14:19,599
Huge buyer. 600 lot market. I think it
 

6417
02:14:19,599 --> 02:14:20,709
Huge buyer. 600 lot market. I think it
was bigger than that according to

6418
02:14:20,709 --> 02:14:20,719
was bigger than that according to
 

6419
02:14:20,719 --> 02:14:22,950
was bigger than that according to
bookmat. But you know it was a lot. It

6420
02:14:22,950 --> 02:14:22,960
bookmat. But you know it was a lot. It
 

6421
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:24,629
bookmat. But you know it was a lot. It
was a lot. So that's the pain point

6422
02:14:24,629 --> 02:14:24,639
was a lot. So that's the pain point
 

6423
02:14:24,639 --> 02:14:26,950
was a lot. So that's the pain point
underneath there. That buyer will become

6424
02:14:26,950 --> 02:14:26,960
underneath there. That buyer will become
 

6425
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:28,709
underneath there. That buyer will become
a seller. If he's probably if he's

6426
02:14:28,709 --> 02:14:28,719
a seller. If he's probably if he's
 

6427
02:14:28,719 --> 02:14:30,149
a seller. If he's probably if he's
smart, he would have sold into some of

6428
02:14:30,149 --> 02:14:30,159
smart, he would have sold into some of
 

6429
02:14:30,159 --> 02:14:32,950
smart, he would have sold into some of
this push already.

6430
02:14:32,950 --> 02:14:32,960
this push already.
 

6431
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:34,709
this push already.
This is the measured move on the hourly

6432
02:14:34,709 --> 02:14:34,719
This is the measured move on the hourly
 

6433
02:14:34,719 --> 02:14:37,430
This is the measured move on the hourly
as well that we talked about.

6434
02:14:37,430 --> 02:14:37,440
as well that we talked about.
 

6435
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:38,950
as well that we talked about.
I can take you down to show you what I

6436
02:14:38,950 --> 02:14:38,960
I can take you down to show you what I
 

6437
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:40,310
I can take you down to show you what I
was talking about. If we think about a

6438
02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:40,320
was talking about. If we think about a
 

6439
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:42,310
was talking about. If we think about a
measured move on an hourly from this

6440
02:14:42,310 --> 02:14:42,320
measured move on an hourly from this
 

6441
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:44,390
measured move on an hourly from this
pullback, if we think about this as a

6442
02:14:44,390 --> 02:14:44,400
pullback, if we think about this as a
 

6443
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:46,550
pullback, if we think about this as a
hourly bull flag from this high to this

6444
02:14:46,550 --> 02:14:46,560
hourly bull flag from this high to this
 

6445
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:49,430
hourly bull flag from this high to this
low, we're into this measured move 47.

6446
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:49,440
low, we're into this measured move 47.
 

6447
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:50,950
low, we're into this measured move 47.
So you can call it 50. All right, into

6448
02:14:50,950 --> 02:14:50,960
So you can call it 50. All right, into
 

6449
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:52,950
So you can call it 50. All right, into
that red block, right? So we're

6450
02:14:52,950 --> 02:14:52,960
that red block, right? So we're
 

6451
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:54,310
that red block, right? So we're
completing a measured move as well. So

6452
02:14:54,310 --> 02:14:54,320
completing a measured move as well. So
 

6453
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:55,990
completing a measured move as well. So
we've got confluence that up here the

6454
02:14:55,990 --> 02:14:56,000
we've got confluence that up here the
 

6455
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,069
we've got confluence that up here the
auction might start failing. We don't

6456
02:14:58,069 --> 02:14:58,079
auction might start failing. We don't
 

6457
02:14:58,079 --> 02:15:00,069
auction might start failing. We don't
want to be front side on it, though.

6458
02:15:00,069 --> 02:15:00,079
want to be front side on it, though.
 

6459
02:15:00,079 --> 02:15:01,589
want to be front side on it, though.

70s which we can fill. If we push up,

6608
02:18:29,349 --> 02:18:29,359
70s which we can fill. If we push up,
 

6609
02:18:29,359 --> 02:18:30,629
70s which we can fill. If we push up,
fail this imbalance and then sell

6610
02:18:30,629 --> 02:18:30,639
fail this imbalance and then sell
 

6611
02:18:30,639 --> 02:18:33,750

02:18:52,559 --> 02:18:54,150
So 90s and 25k have to reject here and
then we have to come under 80s and then

6628
02:18:54,150 --> 02:18:54,160
then we have to come under 80s and then
 

6629
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:56,790
then we have to come under 80s and then
we get the sell

6630
02:18:56,790 --> 02:18:56,800
we get the sell
 

6631
02:18:56,800 --> 02:19:00,870
we get the sell
otherwise no trade. No trade. If they

6632
02:19:00,870 --> 02:19:00,880
otherwise no trade. No trade. If they
 

6633
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:02,950
otherwise no trade. No trade. If they
start bidding back above this and 25k

6634
02:19:02,950 --> 02:19:02,960
start bidding back above this and 25k
 

6635
02:19:02,960 --> 02:19:04,070
start bidding back above this and 25k
obviously we're going to come back up

6636
02:19:04,070 --> 02:19:04,080
obviously we're going to come back up
 

6637
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:06,070
obviously we're going to come back up
all the way up to here again. So it mean

6638
02:19:06,070 --> 02:19:06,080
all the way up to here again. So it mean
 

6639
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:07,750
all the way up to here again. So it mean
the shelf is held at 80s right? You can

6640
02:19:07,750 --> 02:19:07,760
the shelf is held at 80s right? You can
 

6641
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:09,990
the shelf is held at 80s right? You can
see the 80 level massive level. So back

6642
02:19:09,990 --> 02:19:10,000
see the 80 level massive level. So back
 

6643
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,549
see the 80 level massive level. So back
above here 25k retest here. Big big big

6644
02:19:12,549 --> 02:19:12,559
above here 25k retest here. Big big big
 

6645
02:19:12,559 --> 02:19:14,070
above here 25k retest here. Big big big
level.

6646
02:19:14,070 --> 02:19:14,080
level.
 

6647
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:15,349
level.
Not just because it's a whole number.

6648
02:19:15,349 --> 02:19:15,359
Not just because it's a whole number.
 

6649
02:19:15,359 --> 02:19:16,790
Not just because it's a whole number.
There was quite legitimately a big

6650
02:19:16,790 --> 02:19:16,800
There was quite legitimately a big
 

6651
02:19:16,800 --> 02:19:22,950
There was quite legitimately a big
player up here.

6652
02:19:22,950 --> 02:19:22,960

 

6653
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:24,709

Yes, still holding his IB as well. So,

6654
02:19:24,709 --> 02:19:24,719
Yes, still holding his IB as well. So,
 

6655
02:19:24,719 --> 02:19:27,270
Yes, still holding his IB as well. So,
we're in sync. Vick's found a bid yet?

6656
02:19:27,270 --> 02:19:27,280
we're in sync. Vick's found a bid yet?
 

6657
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:29,750
we're in sync. Vick's found a bid yet?
Not really.

6658
02:19:29,750 --> 02:19:29,760
Not really.

6661
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:42,950

It's trying at the 1850s

6662
02:19:42,950 --> 02:19:42,960

 

6663
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:45,349

at 25s. Is he? Yeah, that 700 lot back

6664
02:19:45,349 --> 02:19:45,359
at 25s. Is he? Yeah, that 700 lot back
 

6665
02:19:45,359 --> 02:19:46,950
at 25s. Is he? Yeah, that 700 lot back
up there again. He's playing games, that

6666
02:19:46,950 --> 02:19:46,960
up there again. He's playing games, that
 

6667
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:49,349
up there again. He's playing games, that
guy.

6668
02:19:49,349 --> 02:19:49,359
guy.
 

6669
02:19:49,359 --> 02:19:50,870
guy.
I mean, he'll get filled if they start

6670
02:19:50,870 --> 02:19:50,880
I mean, he'll get filled if they start
 

6671
02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:53,270
I mean, he'll get filled if they start
getting above 25,000. There's an

6672
02:19:53,270 --> 02:19:53,280
getting above 25,000. There's an
 

6673
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:55,190
getting above 25,000. There's an
imbalance up there. So, the imbalances

6674
02:19:55,190 --> 02:19:55,200
imbalance up there. So, the imbalances
 

6675
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:58,150
imbalance up there. So, the imbalances
are at 14 and 25. So, he's trying to

6676
02:19:58,150 --> 02:19:58,160
are at 14 and 25. So, he's trying to
 

6677
02:19:58,160 --> 02:20:00,309
are at 14 and 25. So, he's trying to
sell sell into the imbalance. So, we

6678
02:20:00,309 --> 02:20:00,319
sell sell into the imbalance. So, we
 

6679
02:20:00,319 --> 02:20:02,230
sell sell into the imbalance. So, we
still got to wait for the 80s break

6680
02:20:02,230 --> 02:20:02,240
still got to wait for the 80s break
 

6681
02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:03,750
still got to wait for the 80s break
otherwise nothing. So, still above

6682
02:20:03,750 --> 02:20:03,760
otherwise nothing. So, still above
 

6683
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:06,469
otherwise nothing. So, still above
25,000 now. Value area high for me on

6684
02:20:06,469 --> 02:20:06,479
25,000 now. Value area high for me on
 

6685

6694
02:20:17,750 --> 02:20:17,760
and they might lift this into this red
 

6695
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:19,670
and they might lift this into this red
box again. And if they get through the

box again. And if they get through the
 

6697
02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:22,469

red box maybe up there. It's asking a

6698
02:20:22,469 --> 02:20:22,479

It's getting tight here. It's going to
 

6737
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:41,590
It's getting tight here. It's going to
make a decision soon. Don't care which

6738
02:21:41,590 --> 02:21:41,600
make a decision soon. Don't care which
 

6739
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:43,270
make a decision soon. Don't care which
way. I'm not going to play the long. I

6740
02:21:43,270 --> 02:21:43,280
way. I'm not going to play the long. I
 

6741
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:44,950
way. I'm not going to play the long. I
will play the short if we let go. I want

6742
02:21:44,950 --> 02:21:44,960
will play the short if we let go. I want
 

6743
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:47,190
will play the short if we let go. I want
to be very careful of a trap short now.

6744
02:21:47,190 --> 02:21:47,200
to be very careful of a trap short now.
 

6745
02:21:47,200 --> 02:21:49,590
to be very careful of a trap short now.
But if we get one, two, three drives and

6746
02:21:49,590 --> 02:21:49,600
But if we get one, two, three drives and
 

6747
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:51,510
But if we get one, two, three drives and
a failure a bit like we did here. It

6748
02:21:51,510 --> 02:21:51,520
a failure a bit like we did here. It
 

6749
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:53,190
a failure a bit like we did here. It
would be nice for this move back down to

6750
02:21:53,190 --> 02:21:53,200
would be nice for this move back down to
 

6751
02:21:53,200 --> 02:21:54,630
would be nice for this move back down to
here. We're not going to get that many

6752
02:21:54,630 --> 02:21:54,640
here. We're not going to get that many
 

6753
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:55,830
here. We're not going to get that many
points out of it though. So, I have to

6754
02:21:55,830 --> 02:21:55,840
points out of it though. So, I have to
 

6755
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:57,270
points out of it though. So, I have to
think about is it actually worth it.

6756
02:21:57,270 --> 02:21:57,280
think about is it actually worth it.
 

6757
02:21:57,280 --> 02:22:02,790
think about is it actually worth it.
It's not bad though, is it?

6758
02:22:02,790 --> 02:22:02,800

 

6759
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:05,990

see. We'll see.

02:27:41,270 --> 02:27:41,280

 

6935
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:43,670

that just got absolutely wrecked in the

6936
02:27:43,670 --> 02:27:43,680
that just got absolutely wrecked in the
 

6937
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:49,510
that just got absolutely wrecked in the
last 10 minutes. Let go of those uh 50s.

6938
02:27:49,510 --> 02:27:49,520
last 10 minutes. Let go of those uh 50s.
 

6939
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:52,630
last 10 minutes. Let go of those uh 50s.
So, definitely supply zone up here

6940
02:27:52,630 --> 02:27:52,640
So, definitely supply zone up here
 

6941
02:27:52,640 --> 02:27:53,990
So, definitely supply zone up here
and we're starting to develop a bit of

6942
02:27:53,990 --> 02:27:54,000
and we're starting to develop a bit of
 

6943
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,510
and we're starting to develop a bit of
node here. It's a bit early. There might

6944
02:27:55,510 --> 02:27:55,520
node here. It's a bit early. There might
 

6945
02:27:55,520 --> 02:27:57,830
node here. It's a bit early. There might
be a trade down to here starting to

6946
02:27:57,830 --> 02:27:57,840
be a trade down to here starting to
 

6947
02:27:57,840 --> 02:27:59,910
be a trade down to here starting to
develop, but under there is where I get

6948
02:27:59,910 --> 02:27:59,920
develop, but under there is where I get
 

6949
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:02,150
develop, but under there is where I get
way more interested if we let go of it.

6950
02:28:02,150 --> 02:28:02,160
way more interested if we let go of it.
 

6951
02:28:02,160 --> 02:28:03,910
way more interested if we let go of it.
So, starting to see this. They can come

6952
02:28:03,910 --> 02:28:03,920
So, starting to see this. They can come
 

6953
02:28:03,920 --> 02:28:05,990
So, starting to see this. They can come
up here if they really want. Might be a

6954
02:28:05,990 --> 02:28:06,000
up here if they really want. Might be a
 

6955
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:07,030
up here if they really want. Might be a
trade down to here. That would be

6956
02:28:07,030 --> 02:28:07,040
trade down to here. That would be
 

6957
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:09,110
trade down to here. That would be
counter trend though. uh the rotation

6958
02:28:09,110 --> 02:28:09,120
counter trend though. uh the rotation
 

6959
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:10,950
counter trend though. uh the rotation
would be underneath this and you can see

6960
02:28:10,950 --> 02:28:10,960
would be underneath this and you can see
 

6961
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:12,950
would be underneath this and you can see
we keep moving

6962
02:28:12,950 --> 02:28:12,960
we keep moving
 

6963
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:15,110
we keep moving
value higher at the moment so you'll be

6964
02:28:15,110 --> 02:28:15,120
value higher at the moment so you'll be
 

6965
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:17,510
value higher at the moment so you'll be
very careful but this I would consider

6966
02:28:17,510 --> 02:28:17,520
very careful but this I would consider
 

6967
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:20,630
very careful but this I would consider
three drive kind of territory so it will

6968
02:28:20,630 --> 02:28:20,640
three drive kind of territory so it will
 

6969
02:28:20,640 --> 02:28:22,870
three drive kind of territory so it will
probably perk out sooner rather than

6970
02:28:22,870 --> 02:28:22,880
probably perk out sooner rather than
 

6971
02:28:22,880 --> 02:28:24,950
probably perk out sooner rather than
later unless they want to do something

6972
02:28:24,950 --> 02:28:24,960
later unless they want to do something
 

6973
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:27,030
later unless they want to do something
absolutely mental with it and go for

6974
02:28:27,030 --> 02:28:27,040
absolutely mental with it and go for

buyers got caught. I will not hold it
above 33s. It will be a resqueeze for a

7240
02:34:48,070 --> 02:34:48,080
above 33s. It will be a resqueeze for a
 

7241
02:34:48,080 --> 02:34:50,790
above 33s. It will be a resqueeze for a
new high of day. So, all we did there is

7242
02:34:50,790 --> 02:34:50,800
new high of day. So, all we did there is
 

7243
02:34:50,800 --> 02:34:53,429
new high of day. So, all we did there is
trade their pain from here to this

7244
02:34:53,429 --> 02:34:53,439
trade their pain from here to this
 

7245
02:34:53,439 --> 02:34:55,349
trade their pain from here to this
imbalance. We're coming back to their

7246
02:34:55,349 --> 02:34:55,359
imbalance. We're coming back to their
 

7247
02:34:55,359 --> 02:34:57,670
imbalance. We're coming back to their
pain. We need to reject this. We reject

7248
02:34:57,670 --> 02:34:57,680
pain. We need to reject this. We reject
 

7249
02:34:57,680 --> 02:34:59,510
pain. We need to reject this. We reject
this. I'm going to look for lower all

7250
02:34:59,510 --> 02:34:59,520
this. I'm going to look for lower all
 

7251
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:03,750
this. I'm going to look for lower all
the way down into uh 25K and 2580. Okay?

7252
02:35:03,750 --> 02:35:03,760
the way down into uh 25K and 2580. Okay?
 

7253
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:05,030
the way down into uh 25K and 2580. Okay?
It's what I'm looking for. Hopefully

7254
02:35:05,030 --> 02:35:05,040
It's what I'm looking for. Hopefully
 

7255
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:07,750
It's what I'm looking for. Hopefully
that's making sense to you. Just being

7256
02:35:07,750 --> 02:35:07,760
that's making sense to you. Just being
 

7257
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:09,670
that's making sense to you. Just being
patient here for this trade. Really want

7258
02:35:09,670 --> 02:35:09,680
patient here for this trade. Really want
 

7259
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:12,630
patient here for this trade. Really want
it to reject 33s, come down to 25K, and

7260
02:35:12,630 --> 02:35:12,640
it to reject 33s, come down to 25K, and
 

7261
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:25,590
it to reject 33s, come down to 25K, and
then wash to 79. Be a nice trade.

7262
02:35:25,590 --> 02:35:25,600

 

7263
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:30,309

Don't knock me out here, you [\h__\h]

7264
02:35:30,309 --> 02:35:30,319

 

7265
02:35:30,319 --> 02:35:34,550

35's being tested.

7266
02:35:34,550 --> 02:35:34,560

 

7267
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:42,230

Come on.

7268
02:35:42,230 --> 02:35:42,240

 

7269
02:35:42,240 --> 02:35:44,550

Don't want it back above 35s. Above 35s,

7270
02:35:44,550 --> 02:35:44,560
Don't want it back above 35s. Above 35s,
 

7271
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:47,030
Don't want it back above 35s. Above 35s,
I'm out. Like base above 35s is the

7272
02:35:47,030 --> 02:35:47,040
I'm out. Like base above 35s is the
 

7273
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:48,870
I'm out. Like base above 35s is the
imbalance being tested here at 38. If

7274
02:35:48,870 --> 02:35:48,880
imbalance being tested here at 38. If
 

7275
02:35:48,880 --> 02:35:50,550
imbalance being tested here at 38. If
they close this candle up here, I will

7276
02:35:50,550 --> 02:35:50,560
they close this candle up here, I will
 

7277
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:52,710
they close this candle up here, I will
close the position. They have just

7278
02:35:52,710 --> 02:35:52,720
close the position. They have just
 

7279
02:35:52,720 --> 02:35:54,389
close the position. They have just
removed all the liquidity higher above

7280
02:35:54,389 --> 02:35:54,399
removed all the liquidity higher above
 

7281
02:35:54,399 --> 02:35:58,790
removed all the liquidity higher above
apart from 45. So, I think

7282
02:35:58,790 --> 02:35:58,800
apart from 45. So, I think
 

7283
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:01,590
apart from 45. So, I think
still look okay here. Still no close

7284
02:36:01,590 --> 02:36:01,600
still look okay here. Still no close
 

7285
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:03,510
still look okay here. Still no close
above 35. So we've poked the imbalance

7286
02:36:03,510 --> 02:36:03,520
above 35. So we've poked the imbalance
 

7287
02:36:03,520 --> 02:36:07,510
above 35. So we've poked the imbalance
and that's it. Come on, wash this. Come

7288
02:36:07,510 --> 02:36:07,520
and that's it. Come on, wash this. Come
 

7289
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:09,750
and that's it. Come on, wash this. Come
back down to 25K.

7290
02:36:09,750 --> 02:36:09,760
back down to 25K.
 

7291
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:11,590
back down to 25K.
I tell you what, my stop is now going to

7292
02:36:11,590 --> 02:36:11,600
I tell you what, my stop is now going to
 

7293
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:17,429
I tell you what, my stop is now going to
38 on the money. On the money or 3825,

7294
02:36:17,429 --> 02:36:17,439
38 on the money. On the money or 3825,
 

7295
02:36:17,439 --> 02:36:19,510
38 on the money. On the money or 3825,
that's my stop. Now I'm playing for this

7296
02:36:19,510 --> 02:36:19,520
that's my stop. Now I'm playing for this
 

7297
02:36:19,520 --> 02:36:21,190
that's my stop. Now I'm playing for this
gray box to reject to go down to the

7298
02:36:21,190 --> 02:36:21,200
gray box to reject to go down to the
 

7299
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:23,510
gray box to reject to go down to the
next gray box. If they don't do it, they

7300
02:36:23,510 --> 02:36:23,520
next gray box. If they don't do it, they
 

7301
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:25,510
next gray box. If they don't do it, they
don't do it. That would be me done for

7302
02:36:25,510 --> 02:36:25,520
don't do it. That would be me done for
 

7303
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:28,790
don't do it. That would be me done for
the day if they don't do it.

7304
02:36:28,790 --> 02:36:28,800
the day if they don't do it.
 

7305
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:30,870
the day if they don't do it.
So there's an imbalance here at 10 down

7306
02:36:30,870 --> 02:36:30,880
So there's an imbalance here at 10 down
 

7307
02:36:30,880 --> 02:36:32,870
So there's an imbalance here at 10 down
to 98s

7308
02:36:32,870 --> 02:36:32,880
to 98s
 

7309
02:36:32,880 --> 02:36:36,309
to 98s
and then under that we can trade to 84s.

7310
02:36:36,309 --> 02:36:36,319
and then under that we can trade to 84s.
 

7311
02:36:36,319 --> 02:36:38,230
and then under that we can trade to 84s.
Come on. One big trade. One big trade to

7312
02:36:38,230 --> 02:36:38,240
Come on. One big trade. One big trade to
 

7313
02:36:38,240 --> 02:36:39,670
Come on. One big trade. One big trade to
end the day. Collapse this [\h__\h] thing

7314
02:36:39,670 --> 02:36:39,680
end the day. Collapse this [\h__\h] thing
 

7315
02:36:39,680 --> 02:36:41,590
end the day. Collapse this [\h__\h] thing
for me. I'm going to cover some into

7316
02:36:41,590 --> 02:36:41,600
for me. I'm going to cover some into
 

7317
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:43,270
for me. I'm going to cover some into
here if I can. I've already taken a

7318
02:36:43,270 --> 02:36:43,280
here if I can. I've already taken a
 

7319
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:45,110
here if I can. I've already taken a
partial here. We've rejected gray box.

7320
02:36:45,110 --> 02:36:45,120
partial here. We've rejected gray box.
 

7321
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:46,710
partial here. We've rejected gray box.
I'm looking for here. And if we collapse

7322
02:36:46,710 --> 02:36:46,720
I'm looking for here. And if we collapse
 

7323
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:49,750
I'm looking for here. And if we collapse
this, I will look for 54s and down. So

7324
02:36:49,750 --> 02:36:49,760
this, I will look for 54s and down. So
 

7325
02:36:49,760 --> 02:36:51,349
this, I will look for 54s and down. So
you guys always want this drawn on,

7326
02:36:51,349 --> 02:36:51,359
you guys always want this drawn on,
 

7327
02:36:51,359 --> 02:36:54,550
you guys always want this drawn on,
don't you?

7328
02:36:54,550 --> 02:36:54,560

 

7329
02:36:54,560 --> 02:36:58,070

I'm short here. I'm partial into this

7330
02:36:58,070 --> 02:36:58,080
I'm short here. I'm partial into this
 

7331
02:36:58,080 --> 02:36:59,990
I'm short here. I'm partial into this
because it's an imbalance and I would

7332
02:36:59,990 --> 02:37:00,000
because it's an imbalance and I would
 

7333
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,550
because it's an imbalance and I would
like a cover here. All right. And if I

7334
02:37:02,550 --> 02:37:02,560
like a cover here. All right. And if I
 

7335
02:37:02,560 --> 02:37:04,710
like a cover here. All right. And if I
get lucky, I'll get this and this. This

7336
02:37:04,710 --> 02:37:04,720
get lucky, I'll get this and this. This
 

7337
02:37:04,720 --> 02:37:08,150
get lucky, I'll get this and this. This
would be ideal. If we reclaim 38, my

7338
02:37:08,150 --> 02:37:08,160
would be ideal. If we reclaim 38, my
 

7339
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:10,950
would be ideal. If we reclaim 38, my
stop is at 38.25 right now. We have an

7340
02:37:10,950 --> 02:37:10,960
stop is at 38.25 right now. We have an
 

7341
02:37:10,960 --> 02:37:12,389
stop is at 38.25 right now. We have an
imbalance there. I do not want it to

7342
02:37:12,389 --> 02:37:12,399
imbalance there. I do not want it to
 

7343
02:37:12,399 --> 02:37:15,190
imbalance there. I do not want it to
trade through that imbalance. Make that

7344
02:37:15,190 --> 02:37:15,200
trade through that imbalance. Make that
 

7345
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:19,349
trade through that imbalance. Make that
as obvious as I can.

7346
02:37:19,349 --> 02:37:19,359
as obvious as I can.
 

7347
02:37:19,359 --> 02:37:22,230
as obvious as I can.
So, three drives happened. One, two,

7348
02:37:22,230 --> 02:37:22,240
So, three drives happened. One, two,
 

7349
02:37:22,240 --> 02:37:23,830
So, three drives happened. One, two,
three. Looking for the backside fade

7350
02:37:23,830 --> 02:37:23,840
three. Looking for the backside fade
 

7351
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:25,830
three. Looking for the backside fade
back down into here. So first T next TP

7352
02:37:25,830 --> 02:37:25,840
back down into here. So first T next TP
 

7353
02:37:25,840 --> 02:37:29,190
back down into here. So first T next TP
will be here towards 25,000 and then

7354
02:37:29,190 --> 02:37:29,200
will be here towards 25,000 and then
 

7355
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:31,349
will be here towards 25,000 and then
underneath 80 remember I think we can

7356
02:37:31,349 --> 02:37:31,359
underneath 80 remember I think we can
 

7357
02:37:31,359 --> 02:37:34,309
underneath 80 remember I think we can
have some fun and I will consider an ad

7358
02:37:34,309 --> 02:37:34,319
have some fun and I will consider an ad
 

7359
02:37:34,319 --> 02:37:46,230
have some fun and I will consider an ad
under 80 if we stay heavy.

7360
02:37:46,230 --> 02:37:46,240

 

7361
02:37:46,240 --> 02:37:47,670

Going to flip this the other side just

7362
02:37:47,670 --> 02:37:47,680
Going to flip this the other side just
 

7363
02:37:47,680 --> 02:37:49,190
Going to flip this the other side just
so you can see price action better.

7364
02:37:49,190 --> 02:37:49,200
so you can see price action better.
 

7365
02:37:49,200 --> 02:37:52,230
so you can see price action better.
Okay, so TP1 is top of this gray box.

7366
02:37:52,230 --> 02:37:52,240
Okay, so TP1 is top of this gray box.
 

7367
02:37:52,240 --> 02:37:53,830
Okay, so TP1 is top of this gray box.
We've already taken a little bit, but

7368
02:37:53,830 --> 02:37:53,840
We've already taken a little bit, but
 

7369
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:55,429
We've already taken a little bit, but
really I want to get top of this gray

7370
02:37:55,429 --> 02:37:55,439
really I want to get top of this gray
 

7371
02:37:55,439 --> 02:37:58,550
really I want to get top of this gray
box. Want this move here. I want to kind

7372
02:37:58,550 --> 02:37:58,560
box. Want this move here. I want to kind
 

7373
02:37:58,560 --> 02:38:00,230
box. Want this move here. I want to kind
of wash these imbalances. Do not want

7374
02:38:00,230 --> 02:38:00,240
of wash these imbalances. Do not want
 

7375
02:38:00,240 --> 02:38:01,910

02:38:06,150 --> 02:38:06,160

 

7379
02:38:06,160 --> 02:38:08,790

Come on, baby. Get under those tens and

7497
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:06,150

How is your luck? Well, we had a go at

it. We had a go at it. I don't want to

7500
02:41:08,150 --> 02:41:08,160

7501
02:41:08,160 --> 02:41:10,790
it. We had a go at it. I don't want to
sit through this lift.

7502
02:41:10,790 --> 02:41:10,800
sit through this lift.
 

7503
02:41:10,800 --> 02:41:12,070
sit through this lift.
Yeah, they're trying to lift. There's a

7504
02:41:12,070 --> 02:41:12,080
Yeah, they're trying to lift. There's a
 

7505
02:41:12,080 --> 02:41:15,110
Yeah, they're trying to lift. There's a
little imbalance here.

7506
02:41:15,110 --> 02:41:15,120
little imbalance here.
 

7507
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:17,910
little imbalance here.
37 38. Here they come. They're going to

7508
02:41:17,910 --> 02:41:17,920
37 38. Here they come. They're going to
 

7509
02:41:17,920 --> 02:41:19,830
37 38. Here they come. They're going to
lift and test these guys who were stuck

7510
02:41:19,830 --> 02:41:19,840
lift and test these guys who were stuck
 

7511
02:41:19,840 --> 02:41:22,950
lift and test these guys who were stuck
above. I'm probably done.

7512
02:41:22,950 --> 02:41:22,960
above. I'm probably done.
 

7513
02:41:22,960 --> 02:41:24,389
above. I'm probably done.
I'm not going to have another crack at

7514
02:41:24,389 --> 02:41:24,399
I'm not going to have another crack at
 

7515
02:41:24,399 --> 02:41:25,910
I'm not going to have another crack at
it.

7516
02:41:25,910 --> 02:41:25,920
it.
 

7517
02:41:25,920 --> 02:41:29,670
it.
That was it for me.

7518
02:41:29,670 --> 02:41:29,680

 

7519
02:41:29,680 --> 02:41:32,309

Been a really good week. Been a really

7520
02:41:32,309 --> 02:41:32,319
Been a really good week. Been a really
 

7521
02:41:32,319 --> 02:41:39,830
Been a really good week. Been a really
good week. Really good day.

7522
02:41:39,830 --> 02:41:39,840

 

7523
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:41,429

I think the auction at the high looks

7524
02:41:41,429 --> 02:41:41,439
I think the auction at the high looks
 

7525
02:41:41,439 --> 02:41:44,790
I think the auction at the high looks
good. Honestly, that is it's just this

7526
02:41:44,790 --> 02:41:44,800
good. Honestly, that is it's just this
 

7527
02:41:44,800 --> 02:41:46,309
good. Honestly, that is it's just this
guy keeps stepping in and now we've

7528
02:41:46,309 --> 02:41:46,319
guy keeps stepping in and now we've
 

7529
02:41:46,319 --> 02:41:49,590
guy keeps stepping in and now we've
reprices 34s and holding if we let go of

7530
02:41:49,590 --> 02:41:49,600
reprices 34s and holding if we let go of
 

7531
02:41:49,600 --> 02:41:51,190
reprices 34s and holding if we let go of
that because they've just developed a

7532
02:41:51,190 --> 02:41:51,200
that because they've just developed a
 

7533
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:53,750
that because they've just developed a
node here, but I don't think I'm going

7534
02:41:53,750 --> 02:41:53,760
node here, but I don't think I'm going
 

7535
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:55,110
node here, but I don't think I'm going
to have another shot. This is trade

7536
02:41:55,110 --> 02:41:55,120
to have another shot. This is trade
 

7537
02:41:55,120 --> 02:41:56,630
to have another shot. This is trade
three for the day. So, I'm three for

7538
02:41:56,630 --> 02:41:56,640
three for the day. So, I'm three for

02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:21,830
can always read on if we stay heavy
under 80. So this was the position of

7794
02:48:21,830 --> 02:48:21,840
under 80. So this was the position of

under 80. So this was the position of
that big buyer. We've just tapped into

him at 80. If you stay heavy here now

7798
02:48:25,510 --> 02:48:25,520
him at 80. If you stay heavy here now
 

7799
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:26,710
him at 80. If you stay heavy here now
you're going to look for a trade all the

you're going to look for a trade all the
 

7801
02:48:26,720 --> 02:48:29,349
you're going to look for a trade all the
way down to 928. So maybe you can peel

7802
02:48:29,349 --> 02:48:29,359
way down to 928. So maybe you can peel
 

7803
02:48:29,359 --> 02:48:31,670
way down to 928. So maybe you can peel
some at value 57s. But under this gray

7804
02:48:31,670 --> 02:48:31,680
some at value 57s. But under this gray
 

7805
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:33,750
some at value 57s. But under this gray
box, ideally you're going to get 27s,

box, ideally you're going to get 27s,
 

7807
02:48:33,760 --> 02:48:38,790

7809
02:48:38,800 --> 02:48:40,550

All right, so this is what I mean. So,

7810
02:48:40,550 --> 02:48:40,560
All right, so this is what I mean. So,
 

7811
02:48:40,560 --> 02:48:42,870
All right, so this is what I mean. So,
whoever [\h__\h] moaned and bitched

whoever [\h__\h] moaned and bitched
 

7813
02:48:42,880 --> 02:48:45,190
whoever [\h__\h] moaned and bitched
earlier about I don't call stuff, like I

7814
02:48:45,190 --> 02:48:45,200
earlier about I don't call stuff, like I
 

7815
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:47,750
earlier about I don't call stuff, like I
really do. I call so much stuff for you

really do. I call so much stuff for you
ahead of time, and I give you the

02:48:49,190 --> 02:48:49,200
ahead of time, and I give you the
 

7819
02:48:49,200 --> 02:48:50,469
ahead of time, and I give you the
reasons. And that's the difference

7820
02:48:50,469 --> 02:48:50,479
reasons. And that's the difference
 

7821
02:48:50,479 --> 02:48:53,190
reasons. And that's the difference
between staying with me on this stream

7822
02:48:53,190 --> 02:48:53,200
between staying with me on this stream
 

7823

between staying with me on this stream

02:54:47,040 --> 02:54:50,389
So, we partial out into him. So, we're
using these buyers who are caught to

8134
02:54:50,389 --> 02:54:50,399
using these buyers who are caught to
 

8135
02:54:50,399 --> 02:54:52,469
using these buyers who are caught to
these buyers here over a thousand lots

8136
02:54:52,469 --> 02:54:52,479
these buyers here over a thousand lots
 

8137
02:54:52,479 --> 02:54:54,550
these buyers here over a thousand lots
caught from 45 and above. All right?

8138
02:54:54,550 --> 02:54:54,560
caught from 45 and above. All right?
 

8139
02:54:54,560 --> 02:54:56,790
caught from 45 and above. All right?
We're using them to trade down fill some

8140
02:54:56,790 --> 02:54:56,800
We're using them to trade down fill some
 

8141
02:54:56,800 --> 02:54:58,630
We're using them to trade down fill some
imbalances down to this buyer. Now, if

8142
02:54:58,630 --> 02:54:58,640
imbalances down to this buyer. Now, if
 

8143
02:54:58,640 --> 02:55:00,870
imbalances down to this buyer. Now, if
this buyer is still there and willing to

8144
02:55:00,870 --> 02:55:00,880
this buyer is still there and willing to
 

8145
02:55:00,880 --> 02:55:02,710
this buyer is still there and willing to
absorb the tape, the answer right now is

8146
02:55:02,710 --> 02:55:02,720
absorb the tape, the answer right now is
 

8147
02:55:02,720 --> 02:55:04,469
absorb the tape, the answer right now is
yes, then we're going to expect the lift

8148
02:55:04,469 --> 02:55:04,479
yes, then we're going to expect the lift
 

8149
02:55:04,479 --> 02:55:06,389
yes, then we're going to expect the lift
back up. So, we cover into him. It's why

8150
02:55:06,389 --> 02:55:06,399
back up. So, we cover into him. It's why
 

8151
02:55:06,399 --> 02:55:08,070
back up. So, we cover into him. It's why
we have to respect. So here we had

8152
02:55:08,070 --> 02:55:08,080
we have to respect. So here we had
 

8153
02:55:08,080 --> 02:55:10,950
we have to respect. So here we had
initial balance point of control and a

8154
02:55:10,950 --> 02:55:10,960
initial balance point of control and a
 

8155
02:55:10,960 --> 02:55:13,510
initial balance point of control and a
huge buyer. Are we going to expect price

8156
02:55:13,510 --> 02:55:13,520
huge buyer. Are we going to expect price
 

8157
02:55:13,520 --> 02:55:15,590
huge buyer. Are we going to expect price
to go lower? No. So we are going to

8158
02:55:15,590 --> 02:55:15,600
to go lower? No. So we are going to
 

8159
02:55:15,600 --> 02:55:17,349
to go lower? No. So we are going to
cover into him. If we go lower and

8160
02:55:17,349 --> 02:55:17,359
cover into him. If we go lower and
 

8161
02:55:17,359 --> 02:55:20,150
cover into him. If we go lower and
reject it, we can add back on in size.

8162
02:55:20,150 --> 02:55:20,160
reject it, we can add back on in size.
 

8163
02:55:20,160 --> 02:55:23,110
reject it, we can add back on in size.
Right? So we trade level to level

8164
02:55:23,110 --> 02:55:23,120
Right? So we trade level to level
 

8165
02:55:23,120 --> 02:55:26,550
Right? So we trade level to level
especially in a rotational market. It is

8166
02:55:26,550 --> 02:55:26,560
especially in a rotational market. It is
 

8167
02:55:26,560 --> 02:55:29,269
especially in a rotational market. It is
so so important that you understand

8168
02:55:29,269 --> 02:55:29,279
so so important that you understand
 

8169
02:55:29,279 --> 02:55:31,269
so so important that you understand
that. Do not have these huge

8170
02:55:31,269 --> 02:55:31,279
that. Do not have these huge
 

8171
02:55:31,279 --> 02:55:34,070
that. Do not have these huge
expectations. If we got beneath this,

8172
02:55:34,070 --> 02:55:34,080
expectations. If we got beneath this,
 

8173
02:55:34,080 --> 02:55:36,630
expectations. If we got beneath this,
right? Let's say you took 60 70% off

8174
02:55:36,630 --> 02:55:36,640
right? Let's say you took 60 70% off
 

8175
02:55:36,640 --> 02:55:38,790
right? Let's say you took 60 70% off
here and we traded under and we rejected

8176
02:55:38,790 --> 02:55:38,800
here and we traded under and we rejected
 

8177
02:55:38,800 --> 02:55:40,469
here and we traded under and we rejected
this. You could have put that money back

8178
02:55:40,469 --> 02:55:40,479
this. You could have put that money back
 

8179
02:55:40,479 --> 02:55:42,150
this. You could have put that money back
on and look for that. But we didn't.

8180
02:55:42,150 --> 02:55:42,160
on and look for that. But we didn't.
 

8181
02:55:42,160 --> 02:55:43,750
on and look for that. But we didn't.
Instead, we've come right back to here.

8182
02:55:43,750 --> 02:55:43,760
Instead, we've come right back to here.
 

8183
02:55:43,760 --> 02:55:45,590
Instead, we've come right back to here.

to be dirty like I talked about, they
might finish this move. They might even

8188
02:55:49,510 --> 02:55:49,520
might finish this move. They might even
 

8189
02:55:49,520 --> 02:55:51,510
might finish this move. They might even
do this. They might be really disgusting

8190

8221
02:56:47,200 --> 02:56:50,230

So 592 was an outstanding buyer on the

8222
02:56:50,230 --> 02:56:50,240
So 592 was an outstanding buyer on the
 

8223
02:56:50,240 --> 02:56:53,110
So 592 was an outstanding buyer on the
book. He wasn't outstanding.

8224
02:56:53,110 --> 02:56:53,120
book. He wasn't outstanding.
 

8225
02:56:53,120 --> 02:56:55,750
book. He wasn't outstanding.
He'd already been filled. All right. So

8226
02:56:55,750 --> 02:56:55,760
He'd already been filled. All right. So
 

8227
02:56:55,760 --> 02:56:57,269
He'd already been filled. All right. So
he'd already been filled which means

8228
02:56:57,269 --> 02:56:57,279
he'd already been filled which means
 

8229
02:56:57,279 --> 02:57:00,790
he'd already been filled which means
he'd created volume. If there

8230
02:57:00,790 --> 02:57:00,800
he'd created volume. If there
 

8231
02:57:00,800 --> 02:57:03,830
he'd created volume. If there

aggressive buyer. We aggressively move
 

8253
02:57:29,040 --> 02:57:30,950
aggressive buyer. We aggressively move
away from there. When we come back to

8254
02:57:30,950 --> 02:57:30,960
away from there. When we come back to
 

8255
02:57:30,960 --> 02:57:34,389
away from there. When we come back to
this same area, we expect him to show

8256
02:57:34,389 --> 02:57:34,399
this same area, we expect him to show
 

8257
02:57:34,399 --> 02:57:37,030
this same area, we expect him to show

We moved away, we came back to him.
 

8261

We moved away, we came back to him.
Sellers got trapped. We move away, we

02:57:40,070 --> 02:57:40,080
Sellers got trapped. We move away, we

came back to him. Sellers got trapped.
We move away, we come back to him. We're

8266
02:57:43,750 --> 02:57:43,760
We move away, we come back to him. We're
 

8267
02:57:43,760 --> 02:57:45,670
We move away, we come back to him. We're
going to assume he's still there. We're

8268
02:57:45,670 --> 02:57:45,680
going to assume he's still there. We're
 

8269
02:57:45,680 --> 02:57:47,110
going to assume he's still there. We're
going to make some assumptions to

8270
02:57:47,110 --> 02:57:47,120
going to make some assumptions to
 

8271
02:57:47,120 --> 02:57:49,190
going to make some assumptions to
protect ourselves that he's still there,

8272
02:57:49,190 --> 02:57:49,200
protect ourselves that he's still there,
 

8273
02:57:49,200 --> 02:57:51,349
protect ourselves that he's still there,
right? Level to level. We're not going

8274
02:57:51,349 --> 02:57:51,359
right? Level to level. We're not going
 

8275
02:57:51,359 --> 02:57:52,550
right? Level to level. We're not going
to assume he's not. We're going to

8276
02:57:52,550 --> 02:57:52,560
to assume he's not. We're going to
 

8277
02:57:52,560 --> 02:57:54,710
to assume he's not. We're going to
position oursel so that if he's not

8278
02:57:54,710 --> 02:57:54,720
position oursel so that if he's not
 

8279
02:57:54,720 --> 02:57:56,550
position oursel so that if he's not
there, we can get runners all the way

8280
02:57:56,550 --> 02:57:56,560
there, we can get runners all the way
 

8281
02:57:56,560 --> 02:57:58,389
there, we can get runners all the way
down. Or if he's not there and we retest

8282
02:57:58,389 --> 02:57:58,399
down. Or if he's not there and we retest
 

8283
02:57:58,399 --> 02:58:00,150
down. Or if he's not there and we retest
it, we can add back in. But we are going

8284
02:58:00,150 --> 02:58:00,160
it, we can add back in. But we are going
 

8285
02:58:00,160 --> 02:58:02,389

do I have a method of determining the

8406
03:00:27,110 --> 03:00:27,120
do I have a method of determining the
 

8407
03:00:27,120 --> 03:00:29,750
do I have a method of determining the
size of what volume bubbles on your NT

8408
03:00:29,750 --> 03:00:29,760
size of what volume bubbles on your NT
 

8409
03:00:29,760 --> 03:00:31,510
size of what volume bubbles on your NT
bubble chart? Uh, I can't remember what

8410
03:00:31,510 --> 03:00:31,520
bubble chart? Uh, I can't remember what
 

8411
03:00:31,520 --> 03:00:34,710
bubble chart? Uh, I can't remember what
I have it set to. I think um, anything

8412
03:00:34,710 --> 03:00:34,720
I have it set to. I think um, anything
 

8413
03:00:34,720 --> 03:00:40,630
I have it set to. I think um, anything
over 50. No, it must be less than that.

8414
03:00:40,630 --> 03:00:40,640

 

8415
03:00:40,640 --> 03:00:42,070

But obviously the bigger the bubble, it

8416
03:00:42,070 --> 03:00:42,080
But obviously the bigger the bubble, it
 

8417
03:00:42,080 --> 03:00:44,389
But obviously the bigger the bubble, it
might be over 25s.

8418
03:00:44,389 --> 03:00:44,399
might be over 25s.
 

8419
03:00:44,399 --> 03:00:47,110
might be over 25s.
Might be over 25s. Uh all in one go.

8420
03:00:47,110 --> 03:00:47,120
Might be over 25s. Uh all in one go.
 

8421

03:01:17,600 --> 03:01:20,230
now? Right. This is the current week,
right? So we're expanding

8444
03:01:20,230 --> 03:01:20,240
right? So we're expanding
 

8445
03:01:20,240 --> 03:01:22,389
right? So we're expanding
out of the previous day. So we failed.

8446
03:01:22,389 --> 03:01:22,399
out of the previous day. So we failed.
 

8447
03:01:22,399 --> 03:01:24,070
out of the previous day. So we failed.
Remember previous day value area low. We

8448
03:01:24,070 --> 03:01:24,080
Remember previous day value area low. We
 

8449
03:01:24,080 --> 03:01:25,910
Remember previous day value area low. We
reclaimed. We're above previous day

8450
03:01:25,910 --> 03:01:25,920
reclaimed. We're above previous day
 

8451
03:01:25,920 --> 03:01:28,150
reclaimed. We're above previous day
value area high. We're in expansion, but

8452
03:01:28,150 --> 03:01:28,160
value area high. We're in expansion, but
 

8453
03:01:28,160 --> 03:01:30,150
value area high. We're in expansion, but
we're into nodes from the current week.

8454
03:01:30,150 --> 03:01:30,160
we're into nodes from the current week.
 

8455
03:01:30,160 --> 03:01:32,150
we're into nodes from the current week.
Remember, we're above this. We expect to

8456
03:01:32,150 --> 03:01:32,160
Remember, we're above this. We expect to
 

8457
03:01:32,160 --> 03:01:34,469
Remember, we're above this. We expect to
trade to here, this red box which we're

8458
03:01:34,469 --> 03:01:34,479
trade to here, this red box which we're
 

8459
03:01:34,479 --> 03:01:36,790
trade to here, this red box which we're
now trading in. If we get above this, we

8460
03:01:36,790 --> 03:01:36,800
now trading in. If we get above this, we
 

8461
03:01:36,800 --> 03:01:38,230
now trading in. If we get above this, we
can maybe fill in some of this into

8462
03:01:38,230 --> 03:01:38,240
can maybe fill in some of this into
 

8463
03:01:38,240 --> 03:01:39,910
can maybe fill in some of this into
here, this low volume node, which will

8464
03:01:39,910 --> 03:01:39,920
here, this low volume node, which will
 

8465
03:01:39,920 --> 03:01:43,429
here, this low volume node, which will
be 175. Be asking a lot. But I wouldn't,

8466
03:01:43,429 --> 03:01:43,439
be 175. Be asking a lot. But I wouldn't,

8471
03:01:47,040 --> 03:01:48,630
but it's still pullback, right? Because
where's the volume? Where's most of the

03:01:48,630 --> 03:01:48,640
where's the volume? Where's most of the

continue. Um I think next week might be
a little bit more tricky. I think we

8590
03:04:11,190 --> 03:04:11,200
a little bit more tricky. I think we
 

8591
03:04:11,200 --> 03:04:14,710
a little bit more tricky. I think we
probably build out range early next

8592
03:04:14,710 --> 03:04:14,720
probably build out range early next
 

8593
03:04:14,720 --> 03:04:17,110
probably build out range early next
week. We'll see where we close today. I

8594
03:04:17,110 --> 03:04:17,120
week. We'll see where we close today. I
 

8595
03:04:17,120 --> 03:04:18,389
week. We'll see where we close today. I
think we're just going to have a fail

8596
03:04:18,389 --> 03:04:18,399
think we're just going to have a fail
 

8597
03:04:18,399 --> 03:04:19,750
think we're just going to have a fail
breakout the low and an inside bar

8598
03:04:19,750 --> 03:04:19,760
breakout the low and an inside bar
 

8599
03:04:19,760 --> 03:04:21,190
breakout the low and an inside bar
today. Hopefully we don't get through

8600
03:04:21,190 --> 03:04:21,200
today. Hopefully we don't get through
 

8601
03:04:21,200 --> 03:04:22,950
today. Hopefully we don't get through
that previous day high, otherwise it's

8602
03:04:22,950 --> 03:04:22,960
that previous day high, otherwise it's
 

8603
03:04:22,960 --> 03:04:24,389
that previous day high, otherwise it's
going to start getting messy into next

8604
03:04:24,389 --> 03:04:24,399
going to start getting messy into next
 

8605
03:04:24,399 --> 03:04:28,309
going to start getting messy into next
week, but we'll see. Um I will remind

8609
03:04:32,880 --> 03:04:35,429
all of you this here that we do, it is
not your life. All right? It is not your

8611
03:04:35,439 --> 03:04:38,630

life. It is just a job. Maybe it's a

8612
03:04:38,630 --> 03:04:38,640
life. It is just a job. Maybe it's a
 

8613
03:04:38,640 --> 03:04:40,070
life. It is just a job. Maybe it's a
side hustle. Maybe it's something new

side hustle. Maybe it's something new
that you're learning. Maybe it's your

full-time gig. But it is just a job. If

03:04:45,030 --> 03:04:45,040
full-time gig. But it is just a job. If
