1
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,230

How's it going, team? Move this down.

2
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
How's it going, team? Move this down.
 

3
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,429
How's it going, team? Move this down.
All right, it's going to be a shorter

4
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
All right, it's going to be a shorter
 

5
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,830
All right, it's going to be a shorter
stream again today. Um, still, as you

6
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
stream again today. Um, still, as you
 

7
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,070
stream again today. Um, still, as you
can hear, feeling absolutely dreadful.

8
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
can hear, feeling absolutely dreadful.
 

9
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,229
can hear, feeling absolutely dreadful.
So, this uh whatever this virus or flu

10
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
So, this uh whatever this virus or flu
 

11
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,589
So, this uh whatever this virus or flu
is, it's uh it's not going away.

12
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
is, it's uh it's not going away.
 

13
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,390
is, it's uh it's not going away.
It's only getting worse, unfortunately.

14
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
It's only getting worse, unfortunately.
 

15
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,630
It's only getting worse, unfortunately.
But let's uh make sure you are set up

16
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
But let's uh make sure you are set up
 

17
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,750
But let's uh make sure you are set up
for today. All right, I'm going to start

18
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
for today. All right, I'm going to start
 

19
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,110
for today. All right, I'm going to start
on the daily chart as always. And you

20
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
on the daily chart as always. And you
 

21
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,550
on the daily chart as always. And you
can see in the daily we are still

22
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
can see in the daily we are still
 

23
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,070
can see in the daily we are still
technically making from pivot high,

24
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
technically making from pivot high,
 

25
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,190
technically making from pivot high,
lower lows, lower highs, lower lows,

26
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
lower lows, lower highs, lower lows,
 

27
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,390
lower lows, lower highs, lower lows,
lower highs. Right. What we're going to

28
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
lower highs. Right. What we're going to
 

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,790
lower highs. Right. What we're going to
do today at the moment is start with an

30
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,800
do today at the moment is start with an
 

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,630
do today at the moment is start with an
inside bar. So yesterday was a big very

32
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
inside bar. So yesterday was a big very
 

33
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,030
inside bar. So yesterday was a big very
very low volume drift higher. All right,

34
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
very low volume drift higher. All right,
 

35
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,150
very low volume drift higher. All right,
there was absolutely no volume

36
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
there was absolutely no volume
 

37
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,509
there was absolutely no volume
yesterday. If you look at yesterday's

38
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:51,519
yesterday. If you look at yesterday's
 

39
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,030
yesterday. If you look at yesterday's
volume compared to the last three days

40
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
volume compared to the last three days
 

41
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,790
volume compared to the last three days
of sell volume that there was just

42
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
of sell volume that there was just
 

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,030
of sell volume that there was just
nothing. No one's at the charts this

44
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
nothing. No one's at the charts this
 

45
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,550
nothing. No one's at the charts this
week. All right, because it's holiday

46
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
week. All right, because it's holiday
 

47
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,030
week. All right, because it's holiday
week. So you need to be careful.

48
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
week. So you need to be careful.
 

49
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,229
week. So you need to be careful.
Um but we are now building an inside

50
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
Um but we are now building an inside
 

51
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,710
Um but we are now building an inside
bar. Did we look above and fail

52
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
bar. Did we look above and fail
 

53
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,750
bar. Did we look above and fail
overnight? No. Right. So we're watching

54
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
overnight? No. Right. So we're watching
 

55
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,670
overnight? No. Right. So we're watching
I would be watching for two well three

56
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
I would be watching for two well three
 

57
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,589
I would be watching for two well three
potential plays today.

58
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
potential plays today.
 

59
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,070
potential plays today.
One would be a look above and a fail

60
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
One would be a look above and a fail
 

61
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,509
One would be a look above and a fail
back inside the range. That would be

62
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
back inside the range. That would be
 

63
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,949
back inside the range. That would be
probably the most common thing I would

64
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
probably the most common thing I would
 

65
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,110
probably the most common thing I would
see highly likely to happen today. All

66
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
see highly likely to happen today. All
 

67
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,350
see highly likely to happen today. All
right, a look above previous day's high.

68
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
right, a look above previous day's high.
 

69
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,030
right, a look above previous day's high.
I don't know how high it wants to get. I

70
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
I don't know how high it wants to get. I
 

71
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,710
I don't know how high it wants to get. I
wouldn't imagine if bears have got any

72
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
wouldn't imagine if bears have got any
 

73
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,149
wouldn't imagine if bears have got any
sense that they let it get anywhere near

74
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
sense that they let it get anywhere near
 

75
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,309
sense that they let it get anywhere near
the 300s, but some kind of look above

76
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:30,319
the 300s, but some kind of look above
 

77
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,070
the 300s, but some kind of look above
and fail back inside previous days

78
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
and fail back inside previous days
 

79
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,550
and fail back inside previous days
range. I would say it's fairly probable.

80
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
range. I would say it's fairly probable.
 

81
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,190
range. I would say it's fairly probable.
If we get above and we hold previous

82
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
If we get above and we hold previous
 

83
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,630
If we get above and we hold previous
days high and we start to build out,

84
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
days high and we start to build out,
 

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,550
days high and we start to build out,
that's a very bullish move to come back

86
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
that's a very bullish move to come back
 

87
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,710
that's a very bullish move to come back
up maybe to this low volume node, 300,

88
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
up maybe to this low volume node, 300,
 

89
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,430
up maybe to this low volume node, 300,
400. Wouldn't have to be doing that

90
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
400. Wouldn't have to be doing that
 

91
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,190
400. Wouldn't have to be doing that
today, but it's something I'd be aware

92
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
today, but it's something I'd be aware
 

93
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,630
today, but it's something I'd be aware
of if we're going to base it above

94
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
of if we're going to base it above
 

95
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,030
of if we're going to base it above
previous days high. The last thing we

96
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
previous days high. The last thing we
 

97
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,430
previous days high. The last thing we
can think about is a pullback probably

98
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:53,440
can think about is a pullback probably
 

99
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,110
can think about is a pullback probably
somewhere into where we can find some

100
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
somewhere into where we can find some
 

101
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,030
somewhere into where we can find some
structure for that move higher. All

102
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
structure for that move higher. All
 

103
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,030
structure for that move higher. All
right, so those are the three things I

104
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
right, so those are the three things I
 

105
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,190
right, so those are the three things I
would consider. Most of the action is

106
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
would consider. Most of the action is
 

107
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,630
would consider. Most of the action is
going to take place in here today. I

108
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
going to take place in here today. I
 

109
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,990
going to take place in here today. I
don't think we're going to be either

110
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
don't think we're going to be either
 

111
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,589
don't think we're going to be either
side of that range unless some news uh

112
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599
side of that range unless some news uh
 

113
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,830
side of that range unless some news uh
driver like the 10 10 a.m. news changes

114
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
driver like the 10 10 a.m. news changes
 

115
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,350
driver like the 10 10 a.m. news changes
something.

116
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
something.
 

117
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,270
something.
Okay, let's get into the hourlys.

118
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
Okay, let's get into the hourlys.
 

119
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,990
Okay, let's get into the hourlys.
You can see here we are still sat inside

120
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
You can see here we are still sat inside
 

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,069
You can see here we are still sat inside
previous week's value and previous days

122
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
previous week's value and previous days
 

123
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,870
previous week's value and previous days
value now as well. In fact, I'm just

124
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
value now as well. In fact, I'm just
 

125
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,270
value now as well. In fact, I'm just
going to mark out make sure that

126
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
going to mark out make sure that
 

127
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,950
going to mark out make sure that
previous state level was accurate. Give

128
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
previous state level was accurate. Give
 

129
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:53,990
previous state level was accurate. Give
me just a moment here. It's 9:30.

130
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000

 

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,230

All right, there we go.

132
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
All right, there we go.
 

133
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,469
All right, there we go.
Okay, so we're trading inside. Oh, don't

134
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
Okay, so we're trading inside. Oh, don't
 

135
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,310
Okay, so we're trading inside. Oh, don't
do that. We're trading trading inside of

136
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
do that. We're trading trading inside of
 

137
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,469
do that. We're trading trading inside of
the previous week value area towards the

138
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
the previous week value area towards the
 

139
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,909
the previous week value area towards the
upper side of it. We've rejected

140
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
upper side of it. We've rejected
 

141
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,670
upper side of it. We've rejected
previous week value area high up here.

142
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
previous week value area high up here.
 

143
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,510
previous week value area high up here.
We've created a previous day value area

144
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
We've created a previous day value area
 

145
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,950
We've created a previous day value area
high up here. We have previous day value

146
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
high up here. We have previous day value
 

147
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,550
high up here. We have previous day value
area low and previous week point of

148
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
area low and previous week point of
 

149
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,189
area low and previous week point of
control below us. So if bulls are going

150
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
control below us. So if bulls are going
 

151
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,590
control below us. So if bulls are going
to defend, all right, then we're going

152
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
to defend, all right, then we're going
 

153
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,670
to defend, all right, then we're going
to think about a rotation down into here

154
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
to think about a rotation down into here
 

155
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,990
to think about a rotation down into here
and then looking to defend that. If they

156
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
and then looking to defend that. If they
 

157
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,350
and then looking to defend that. If they
fail to defend that, what we thinking

158
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
fail to defend that, what we thinking
 

159
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,629
fail to defend that, what we thinking
about? We'll probably look below and

160
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
about? We'll probably look below and
 

161
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,230
about? We'll probably look below and
fail. All right, probably a little look

162
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
fail. All right, probably a little look
 

163
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,390
fail. All right, probably a little look
underneath into some RBS structure back

164
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
underneath into some RBS structure back
 

165
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,310
underneath into some RBS structure back
inside and fail. I expect the rotation

166
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
inside and fail. I expect the rotation
 

167
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,550
inside and fail. I expect the rotation
to happen in here today. That would be

168
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,560
to happen in here today. That would be
 

169
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,350
to happen in here today. That would be
my expectation for today.

170
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
my expectation for today.
 

171
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,550
my expectation for today.
So, I'd be thinking about buying um sort

172
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
So, I'd be thinking about buying um sort
 

173
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,270
So, I'd be thinking about buying um sort
of 740 down to let's call it 600

174
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
of 740 down to let's call it 600
 

175
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,070
of 740 down to let's call it 600
somewhere down there once we get down

176
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
somewhere down there once we get down
 

177
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,469
somewhere down there once we get down
there if structure forms for that kind

178
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:44,479
there if structure forms for that kind
 

179
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,029
there if structure forms for that kind
of move. And I would think about selling

180
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
of move. And I would think about selling
 

181
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,510
of move. And I would think about selling
um sort of above previous day value area

182
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
um sort of above previous day value area
 

183
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,110
um sort of above previous day value area
high if it has the strength to get above

184
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
high if it has the strength to get above
 

185
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,110
high if it has the strength to get above
somewhere into like these 100s where we

186
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
somewhere into like these 100s where we
 

187
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,350
somewhere into like these 100s where we
get a bit thicker and then reselling

188
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
get a bit thicker and then reselling
 

189
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,189
get a bit thicker and then reselling
this for that rotation back down. I

190
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
this for that rotation back down. I
 

191
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,629
this for that rotation back down. I
don't really want to trade in the

192
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
don't really want to trade in the
 

193
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,950
don't really want to trade in the
midpoint which is where we're opening

194
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
midpoint which is where we're opening
 

195
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,909
midpoint which is where we're opening
up. Of course it is in no man's land,

196
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
up. Of course it is in no man's land,
 

197
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,350
up. Of course it is in no man's land,
right? Don't really want to execute in

198
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
right? Don't really want to execute in
 

199
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,029
right? Don't really want to execute in
no man's land right now, right? Because

200
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
no man's land right now, right? Because
 

201
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,629
no man's land right now, right? Because
this is your range.

202
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639

 

203
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,230

We don't really want to be executing

204
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
We don't really want to be executing
 

205
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,070
We don't really want to be executing
here, right? We want to be fading tops

206
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
here, right? We want to be fading tops
 

207
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,390
here, right? We want to be fading tops
and buying dips down here. If the market

208
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400
and buying dips down here. If the market
 

209
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,110
and buying dips down here. If the market
gets very heavy for some reason, if this

210
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
gets very heavy for some reason, if this
 

211
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,710
gets very heavy for some reason, if this
is a twolegg and they're ready to sell

212
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
is a twolegg and they're ready to sell
 

213
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,110
is a twolegg and they're ready to sell
it again, right, you need to be aware of

214
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
it again, right, you need to be aware of
 

215
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,790
it again, right, you need to be aware of
getting stuck under here because that is

216
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
getting stuck under here because that is
 

217
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,629
getting stuck under here because that is
going to really open the door to use all

218
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
going to really open the door to use all
 

219
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,029
going to really open the door to use all
this liquidity. So, you cannot just

220
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
this liquidity. So, you cannot just
 

221
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,670
this liquidity. So, you cannot just
willingly buy this on dips down here. We

222
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
willingly buy this on dips down here. We
 

223
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,670
willingly buy this on dips down here. We
need to show you some form of structure

224
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
need to show you some form of structure
 

225
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,579
need to show you some form of structure
to get involved in.

226
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:37,589

 

227
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:38,790

[clears throat]

228
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
[clears throat]
 

229
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,870
[clears throat]
All right.

230
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
All right.
 

231
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,350
All right.
Zoom this out a bit. As you can see,

232
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
Zoom this out a bit. As you can see,
 

233
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,070
Zoom this out a bit. As you can see,
overnight very clearly, we projected up

234
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
overnight very clearly, we projected up
 

235
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,790
overnight very clearly, we projected up
here twice and uh trying to create some

236
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
here twice and uh trying to create some
 

237
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,309
here twice and uh trying to create some
form of range up here at the moment. All

238
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
form of range up here at the moment. All
 

239
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,670
form of range up here at the moment. All
right.

240
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
right.
 

241
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,110
right.
If they can hold this, they're probably

242
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
If they can hold this, they're probably
 

243
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,390
If they can hold this, they're probably
going to look for that squeeze and then

244
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
going to look for that squeeze and then
 

245
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,309
going to look for that squeeze and then
a fail up. There would be what I'd be

246
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
a fail up. There would be what I'd be
 

247
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,749
a fail up. There would be what I'd be
thinking about off the morning drive. If

248
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
thinking about off the morning drive. If
 

249
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,270
thinking about off the morning drive. If
they squeeze up at the morning drive and

250
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
they squeeze up at the morning drive and
 

251
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,029
they squeeze up at the morning drive and
they sell into here, I'd be interested

252
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
they sell into here, I'd be interested
 

253
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,189
they sell into here, I'd be interested
in that count. Well, potentially trying

254
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
in that count. Well, potentially trying
 

255
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,790
in that count. Well, potentially trying
to trying to time the protren short.

256
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
to trying to time the protren short.
 

257
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,790
to trying to time the protren short.
Um, let's have a quick look at ES. I'd

258
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
Um, let's have a quick look at ES. I'd
 

259
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,390
Um, let's have a quick look at ES. I'd
imagine it's exactly the same. Yeah,

260
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
imagine it's exactly the same. Yeah,
 

261
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,909
imagine it's exactly the same. Yeah,
surprise surprise. No difference there.

262
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
surprise surprise. No difference there.
 

263
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,110
surprise surprise. No difference there.
Let's go to In fact, that's actually

264
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120
Let's go to In fact, that's actually
 

265
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,469
Let's go to In fact, that's actually
come right into it supply and that 720

266
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
come right into it supply and that 720
 

267
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,710
come right into it supply and that 720
level.

268
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
level.
 

269
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,790
level.
So, even better area of resistance up

270
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
So, even better area of resistance up
 

271
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,749
So, even better area of resistance up
there. Let's go to the spiders. Right,

272
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
there. Let's go to the spiders. Right,
 

273
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,550
there. Let's go to the spiders. Right,
spiders have a call uh or they did

274
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,560
spiders have a call uh or they did
 

275
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,589
spiders have a call uh or they did
yesterday. I haven't checked this

276
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
yesterday. I haven't checked this
 

277
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,710
yesterday. I haven't checked this
morning. Set 670 was a call wall. All

278
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
morning. Set 670 was a call wall. All
 

279
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,629
morning. Set 670 was a call wall. All
right, it's a big options level. All the

280
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:34,639
right, it's a big options level. All the
 

281
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,390
right, it's a big options level. All the
time we're under that. We're probably

282
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
time we're under that. We're probably
 

283
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,830
time we're under that. We're probably
looking for a rotation back down to

284
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
looking for a rotation back down to
 

285
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,990
looking for a rotation back down to
somewhere sensible after such a giant

286
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
somewhere sensible after such a giant
 

287
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,029
somewhere sensible after such a giant
move. So, I'd be watching that 670 on

288
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
move. So, I'd be watching that 670 on
 

289
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,670
move. So, I'd be watching that 670 on
the spy. We can we can set a little

290
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:45,680
the spy. We can we can set a little
 

291
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:55,525
the spy. We can we can set a little
price alert there just in front of it.

292
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:55,535

Not quite as uh frothy up here, but you

298
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
Not quite as uh frothy up here, but you
 

299
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,070
Not quite as uh frothy up here, but you
can see we've come into this kind of

300
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
can see we've come into this kind of
 

301
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,550
can see we've come into this kind of
level where we failed from. All right,

302
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
level where we failed from. All right,
 

303
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,070
level where we failed from. All right,
so you'd imagine this is going to be

304
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
so you'd imagine this is going to be
 

305
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,670
so you'd imagine this is going to be
where we're going to fail from. And it's

306
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
where we're going to fail from. And it's
 

307
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,430
where we're going to fail from. And it's
just where the bulls catch that rotation

308
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
just where the bulls catch that rotation
 

309
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,950
just where the bulls catch that rotation
or we do this move down. That would be

310
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
or we do this move down. That would be
 

311
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,950
or we do this move down. That would be
my expectation.

312
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960
my expectation.
 

313
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,909
my expectation.
Let's have a look at the mag.

314
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
Let's have a look at the mag.
 

315
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,110
Let's have a look at the mag.
Some video has been weak today. All

316
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
Some video has been weak today. All
 

317
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,230
Some video has been weak today. All
right. So, straight away you can see

318
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
right. So, straight away you can see
 

319
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,710
right. So, straight away you can see
Apple gapping down. The big drive

320
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
Apple gapping down. The big drive
 

321
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,350
Apple gapping down. The big drive
yesterday was approaching alltime highs

322
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
yesterday was approaching alltime highs
 

323
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,589
yesterday was approaching alltime highs
and uh

324
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
and uh
 

325
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,029
and uh
little bit of a gap down here is whether

326
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
little bit of a gap down here is whether
 

327
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,949
little bit of a gap down here is whether
it can find a bid into sort of 73s.

328
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
it can find a bid into sort of 73s.
 

329
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,670
it can find a bid into sort of 73s.
Amazon, same kind of story.

330
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
Amazon, same kind of story.
 

331
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,550
Amazon, same kind of story.
Came in and tested this R level. Can it

332
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,560
Came in and tested this R level. Can it
 

333
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,029
Came in and tested this R level. Can it
catch a bid to complete that move? It's

334
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
catch a bid to complete that move? It's
 

335
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,469
catch a bid to complete that move? It's
got a long way to go to get back up to

336
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
got a long way to go to get back up to
 

337
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,829
got a long way to go to get back up to
the highs. So, Amazon, that's the big

338
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
the highs. So, Amazon, that's the big
 

339
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,430
the highs. So, Amazon, that's the big
difference between that and Apple.

340
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
difference between that and Apple.
 

341
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,910
difference between that and Apple.
Amazon been being absolutely destroyed.

342
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
Amazon been being absolutely destroyed.
 

343
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,949
Amazon been being absolutely destroyed.
It's probably a good buy soon if not

344
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
It's probably a good buy soon if not
 

345
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,630
It's probably a good buy soon if not
already. Let's have a little zoom out.

346
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
already. Let's have a little zoom out.
 

347
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,910
already. Let's have a little zoom out.
Yeah, it's pretty good. This is where

348
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:53,920
Yeah, it's pretty good. This is where
 

349
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,310
Yeah, it's pretty good. This is where
the start of the origin of the move is.

350
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
the start of the origin of the move is.
 

351
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,150
the start of the origin of the move is.
So, be interested how we get when we get

352
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,160
So, be interested how we get when we get
 

353
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,350
So, be interested how we get when we get
down to sort of the low 200s if we can.

354
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
down to sort of the low 200s if we can.
 

355
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,509
down to sort of the low 200s if we can.
Another gap down there on Amazon.

356
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
Another gap down there on Amazon.
 

357
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,110
Another gap down there on Amazon.
Google, remember that's been

358
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
Google, remember that's been
 

359
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,630
Google, remember that's been
ridiculously strong on a squeeze.

360
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
ridiculously strong on a squeeze.
 

361
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,870
ridiculously strong on a squeeze.
Big gap up again on Google. I mean, this

362
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
Big gap up again on Google. I mean, this
 

363
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,430
Big gap up again on Google. I mean, this
is this is getting ridiculous. Um, we're

364
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
is this is getting ridiculous. Um, we're
 

365
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,190
is this is getting ridiculous. Um, we're
probably about three standard deviation

366
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
probably about three standard deviation
 

367
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,670
probably about three standard deviation
now on the daily. This is very, very

368
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
now on the daily. This is very, very
 

369
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,269
now on the daily. This is very, very
dangerous at this point. It needs to

370
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
dangerous at this point. It needs to
 

371
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,310
dangerous at this point. It needs to
come back to here to retest it. Um, we

372
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,320
come back to here to retest it. Um, we
 

373
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,389
come back to here to retest it. Um, we
can have a look on the daily very

374
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:26,399
can have a look on the daily very
 

375
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,550
can have a look on the daily very
quickly before uh we do anything else.

376
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
quickly before uh we do anything else.
 

377
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,590
quickly before uh we do anything else.
But yeah, that's frothy meta. Very

378
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
But yeah, that's frothy meta. Very
 

379
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,190
But yeah, that's frothy meta. Very
strong. Remember, I'm long meta. All

380
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,200
strong. Remember, I'm long meta. All
 

381
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,389
strong. Remember, I'm long meta. All
right, I bought the 80s down here. Only

382
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
right, I bought the 80s down here. Only
 

383
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,070
right, I bought the 80s down here. Only
a feeler, not big size. I did call it

384
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
a feeler, not big size. I did call it
 

385
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,829
a feeler, not big size. I did call it
out in Discord. Told you I'd got long

386
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:39,839
out in Discord. Told you I'd got long
 

387
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,430
out in Discord. Told you I'd got long
meta for a feler. So, already up. 40

388
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
meta for a feler. So, already up. 40
 

389
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,829
meta for a feler. So, already up. 40
bucks a share, but it is only a feeler.

390
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
bucks a share, but it is only a feeler.
 

391
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,350
bucks a share, but it is only a feeler.
I need it to come and base out and prove

392
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
I need it to come and base out and prove
 

393
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,710
I need it to come and base out and prove
to me. I'm not sure it's done selling,

394
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
to me. I'm not sure it's done selling,
 

395
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,990
to me. I'm not sure it's done selling,
but I wanted to get something on. The

396
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
but I wanted to get something on. The
 

397
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,150
but I wanted to get something on. The
reason that being it had been absolutely

398
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,160
reason that being it had been absolutely
 

399
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,150
reason that being it had been absolutely
decimated back into a point of interest

400
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
decimated back into a point of interest
 

401
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,350
decimated back into a point of interest
for me. So, I wanted to get something on

402
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
for me. So, I wanted to get something on
 

403
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,710
for me. So, I wanted to get something on
here. If it fails deeper down here,

404
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
here. If it fails deeper down here,
 

405
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,630
here. If it fails deeper down here,
obviously I'll cut it and then re get

406
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
obviously I'll cut it and then re get
 

407
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,150
obviously I'll cut it and then re get
involved.

408
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,160
involved.
 

409
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,790
involved.
Uh Microsoft. So, we got mixed bag so

410
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:02,800
Uh Microsoft. So, we got mixed bag so
 

411
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,670
Uh Microsoft. So, we got mixed bag so
far. Microsoft gapping down, weakness

412
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
far. Microsoft gapping down, weakness
 

413
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,310
far. Microsoft gapping down, weakness
there. Uh Nvidia, they're really weak

414
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
there. Uh Nvidia, they're really weak
 

415
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,590
there. Uh Nvidia, they're really weak
one right now. All right, that got

416
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
one right now. All right, that got
 

417
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,630
one right now. All right, that got
absolutely destroyed. All

418
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,640
absolutely destroyed. All
 

419
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,509
absolutely destroyed. All
right, had the chance to try and base

420
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519
right, had the chance to try and base
 

421
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,190
right, had the chance to try and base
above this level here that we talked

422
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200
above this level here that we talked
 

423
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,269
above this level here that we talked
about yesterday pre-market. It had to

424
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:19,279
about yesterday pre-market. It had to
 

425
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,110
about yesterday pre-market. It had to
get back above this zone here. It

426
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
get back above this zone here. It
 

427
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,030
get back above this zone here. It
couldn't, right? Kept squeezing up,

428
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040
couldn't, right? Kept squeezing up,
 

429
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,310
couldn't, right? Kept squeezing up,
failing, squeezing up, failing,

430
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
failing, squeezing up, failing,
 

431
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,829
failing, squeezing up, failing,
squeezing up, failing back down to the

432
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
squeezing up, failing back down to the
 

433
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,190
squeezing up, failing back down to the
bottom side of the range. If they sell

434
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
bottom side of the range. If they sell
 

435
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,790
bottom side of the range. If they sell
72s and 70 break, it's probably going to

436
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
72s and 70 break, it's probably going to
 

437
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,990
72s and 70 break, it's probably going to
be a bit nasty because we've got

438
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
be a bit nasty because we've got
 

439
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,030
be a bit nasty because we've got
liquidity 68s and 64s to go and clear

440
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
liquidity 68s and 64s to go and clear
 

441
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,750
liquidity 68s and 64s to go and clear
up. So, a mixed bag. You got what, three

442
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
up. So, a mixed bag. You got what, three
 

443
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,670
up. So, a mixed bag. You got what, three
green, four red right now. We can have a

444
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
green, four red right now. We can have a
 

445
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,269
green, four red right now. We can have a
look just slightly outside. Imagine

446
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:41,279
look just slightly outside. Imagine
 

447
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,230
look just slightly outside. Imagine
there's going to be weakness in the

448
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
there's going to be weakness in the
 

449
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,150
there's going to be weakness in the
other chip names. Yeah, AMD gapping

450
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
other chip names. Yeah, AMD gapping
 

451
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,829
other chip names. Yeah, AMD gapping
down, Oracle probably doing the same.

452
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:45,839
down, Oracle probably doing the same.
 

453
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,949
down, Oracle probably doing the same.
Yeah, Oracle gapping down. So, a little

454
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
Yeah, Oracle gapping down. So, a little
 

455
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,430
Yeah, Oracle gapping down. So, a little
bit of weakness um across the board here

456
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
bit of weakness um across the board here
 

457
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,150
bit of weakness um across the board here
on some other names. Um let's just go to

458
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
on some other names. Um let's just go to
 

459
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,790
on some other names. Um let's just go to
Google quickly so you can see what I'm

460
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
Google quickly so you can see what I'm
 

461
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,069
Google quickly so you can see what I'm
talking about.

462
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079

 

463
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,550

All right, that's not healthy.

464
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
All right, that's not healthy.
 

465
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,310
All right, that's not healthy.
Look where we are premarket. I would

466
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320
Look where we are premarket. I would
 

467
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,389
Look where we are premarket. I would
imagine

468
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
imagine
 

469
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,389
imagine

Yeah, it's a it's a third standard.
Remember, Ballinger bands are two

474
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
Remember, Ballinger bands are two

Remember, Ballinger bands are two
standard deviation from the 20-day. We

476
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
standard deviation from the 20-day. We
 

477
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,230
standard deviation from the 20-day. We
are now above a 100% move from that

478
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
are now above a 100% move from that
 

479
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,750
are now above a 100% move from that
Ballinger band. We're above a third

480
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
Ballinger band. We're above a third
 

481
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,590
Ballinger band. We're above a third
standard deviation. This is not healthy.

482
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600

483
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,790

It is not It cannot sustain a rally like

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
It is not It cannot sustain a rally like
 

485
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,269
It is not It cannot sustain a rally like
this. So, do not be surprised. Maybe

486
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
this. So, do not be surprised. Maybe
 

487
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,190
this. So, do not be surprised. Maybe
they do a rally for a few more days, but

488
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
they do a rally for a few more days, but
 

489
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,030
they do a rally for a few more days, but
this is going to crash and crash hard

490
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
this is going to crash and crash hard
 

491
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,949
this is going to crash and crash hard
when it's ready. I know it's a mega cap,

492
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:32,959
when it's ready. I know it's a mega cap,
 

493
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,150
when it's ready. I know it's a mega cap,
but you cannot go gap up,

494
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
but you cannot go gap up,
 

495
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,750
but you cannot go gap up,
squeeze, gap up, squeeze without coming

496
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:41,760
squeeze, gap up, squeeze without coming
 

497
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,910

And for me, that really sums up this

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
And for me, that really sums up this
 

501
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,550

00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600
Ukraine peace deal with Russia
 

629
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,670
Ukraine peace deal with Russia
announced. Has it actually been agreed

630
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:09,680
announced. Has it actually been agreed
 

631
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,150
announced. Has it actually been agreed
though? Because Trump tried to announce

632
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
though? Because Trump tried to announce
 

633
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,670
though? Because Trump tried to announce
it and Europe and everyone said no. Let

634
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,680
it and Europe and everyone said no. Let
 

635
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,470
it and Europe and everyone said no. Let
me check that.

636
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,480

 

637
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,269

Where are you saying that?

638
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:27,279

 

639
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:38,150

Not saying that

640
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,160

 

641
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,389

Ukraine supports the essence of the

642
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
Ukraine supports the essence of the
 

643
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,030
Ukraine supports the essence of the
framework. It's not a done deal.

644
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,040
framework. It's not a done deal.
 

645
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,030
framework. It's not a done deal.
Yeah. Exactly. This is what keeps

646
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
Yeah. Exactly. This is what keeps
 

647
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,350
Yeah. Exactly. This is what keeps
happening. You got to understand America

648
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
happening. You got to understand America
 

649
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,670
happening. You got to understand America
keeps floating ideas which are not

650
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680
keeps floating ideas which are not
 

651
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,829
keeps floating ideas which are not
acceptable by Europe um or by anyone

652
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839
acceptable by Europe um or by anyone
 

653
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,110
acceptable by Europe um or by anyone
other than Russia. So it's not going to

654
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
other than Russia. So it's not going to
 

655
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,310
other than Russia. So it's not going to
get done until everyone agrees. So just

656
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,320
get done until everyone agrees. So just
 

657
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,749
get done until everyone agrees. So just
be careful saying things like that. Make

658
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:01,759
be careful saying things like that. Make
 

659
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,030
be careful saying things like that. Make
sure you understand the actual

660
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,040
sure you understand the actual
 

661
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,670

preferred move, we can fade nearer a
supply block, which would be much, much

788
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,200
supply block, which would be much, much
 

789
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,590
supply block, which would be much, much
better than trying to buy the dip in

790
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,600
better than trying to buy the dip in
 

791
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,470
better than trying to buy the dip in
this market. But let's see.

792
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480

 

793
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,990

And I'll probably only be here an hour

794
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000
And I'll probably only be here an hour
 

795
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,190
And I'll probably only be here an hour
or so, folks. Probably

796
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
or so, folks. Probably
 

797
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,117
or so, folks. Probably
really not doing too good right now.

798
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:55,127
really not doing too good right now.
 

799
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:55,909

811
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,870

817
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,549

00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
be working with funded next. They have
 

819
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,789
be working with funded next. They have
just launched a deal.

820
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
just launched a deal.
 

821
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,190
just launched a deal.
I'll read it out to you.

822
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,200

 

823
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,150

For new users, you will get 30% off the

827
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,830
50k and 100k legacy accounts and 20% off
the 25k legacy account. My advice would

828
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:29,840
the 25k legacy account. My advice would
 

829
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,830
the 25k legacy account. My advice would
be do the 50k. It's the best account by

830
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:31,840
be do the 50k. It's the best account by
 

831
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,549
be do the 50k. It's the best account by
far. All right, so 30% off that. There

832
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
far. All right, so 30% off that. There
 

833
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,190
far. All right, so 30% off that. There
is now no 40% consistency rule once

834
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,200
is now no 40% consistency rule once
 

835

845
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,029
are resets, and you'll have to use the
link in chat to get it. All right, it's

846
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039
link in chat to get it. All right, it's
 

847
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,510
link in chat to get it. All right, it's
pinned to chat and use code FCT30, but

848
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:53,520
pinned to chat and use code FCT30, but
 

849
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,870
pinned to chat and use code FCT30, but
the link is pinned to chat. If you want

850
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:54,880
the link is pinned to chat. If you want
 

851

to get that deal, that's what you need
 

853
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,310
to get that deal, that's what you need
to do. Which means a 50k account is

854
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,320
to do. Which means a 50k account is
 

855
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,510
to do. Which means a 50k account is
currently 111

856
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:01,520
currently 111
 

857
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,070
currently 111
bucks. All right, 111 bucks. And that's

858
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,080
bucks. All right, 111 bucks. And that's
 

859
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,750
bucks. All right, 111 bucks. And that's
not a monthly fee. There's no activation

860
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:05,760
not a monthly fee. There's no activation
 

861
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,990
not a monthly fee. There's no activation
fee. It's a onetime fee. So, it takes

862
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,000
fee. It's a onetime fee. So, it takes
 

863
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,950
fee. It's a onetime fee. So, it takes
you three months to pass a 50k account.

864
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:10,960
you three months to pass a 50k account.
 

865
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,190
you three months to pass a 50k account.
So be it. Um, it's a 1:1 riskreward

866
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,200
So be it. Um, it's a 1:1 riskreward
 

867
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,150
So be it. Um, it's a 1:1 riskreward
ratio on those 50k accounts.

868
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:16,160
ratio on those 50k accounts.
 

869
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,029
ratio on those 50k accounts.
So you need to make 2500 and as long as

870
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:19,039
So you need to make 2500 and as long as
 

871
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,909
So you need to make 2500 and as long as
you want and you've got 2500 end of day

872
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
you want and you've got 2500 end of day
 

873
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,669
you want and you've got 2500 end of day
draw down to risk. I don't think there's

874
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:23,679
draw down to risk. I don't think there's
 

875
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,270
draw down to risk. I don't think there's
a better account out there right now.

876
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,280
a better account out there right now.
 

877
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,830

980
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:31,919
you can take a big old fat payout on day
 

981
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,830
you can take a big old fat payout on day

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,750
have heard me talk about this before,
like when we open up in no man's land.

1092
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:45,760
like when we open up in no man's land.
 

1093
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,190
like when we open up in no man's land.
I'm not really interested if I'm going

1094
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,200
I'm not really interested if I'm going
 

1095
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,110
I'm not really interested if I'm going
to be a buyer today. All right, I want

1096
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
to be a buyer today. All right, I want
 

1097
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,110
to be a buyer today. All right, I want
to be a buyer

1098
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,120
to be a buyer
 

1099
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,029
to be a buyer
at least at value area low 750, 700s,

1100
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:55,039
at least at value area low 750, 700s,
 

1101
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,669
at least at value area low 750, 700s,
maybe a look below even into 600s and a

1102
00:24:57,669 --> 00:24:57,679
maybe a look below even into 600s and a
 

1103
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,190
maybe a look below even into 600s and a
reclaim. If I'm going to be a buyer, I'm

1104
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200
reclaim. If I'm going to be a buyer, I'm
 

1105
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,549
reclaim. If I'm going to be a buyer, I'm
going to be a buyer down there. I'm not

1106
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:00,559
going to be a buyer down there. I'm not
 

1107
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,070
going to be a buyer down there. I'm not
going to buy the top of this range up

1108
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,080
going to buy the top of this range up
 

1109
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,149
going to buy the top of this range up
here. I'm not really interested buying

1110
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:04,159
here. I'm not really interested buying
 

1111
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,830
here. I'm not really interested buying
the top of this range up here when we're

1112
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:05,840
the top of this range up here when we're
 

1113
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,029
the top of this range up here when we're
in a major sell and supply is up here,

1114
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:09,039
in a major sell and supply is up here,
 

1115
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,950
in a major sell and supply is up here,
higher time frame supply and here. So

1116
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:10,960
higher time frame supply and here. So
 

1117
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,510
higher time frame supply and here. So
any look up into here, I'm interested in

1118
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
any look up into here, I'm interested in
 

1119
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,830
any look up into here, I'm interested in
shorting. If they just puke this today,

1120
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:15,840
shorting. If they just puke this today,
 

1121
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,430
shorting. If they just puke this today,
it is what it is. The the sell

1122
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:17,440
it is what it is. The the sell
 

1123
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,990
it is what it is. The the sell
opportunity, right, was on this failure

1124
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,000
opportunity, right, was on this failure
 

1125
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,070
opportunity, right, was on this failure
to move higher here. Pre-market is this

1126
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,080
to move higher here. Pre-market is this
 

1127
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,909
to move higher here. Pre-market is this
8:30. There's your high. There's your

1128
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:23,919
8:30. There's your high. There's your
 

1129
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,590
8:30. There's your high. There's your
failure to move higher. There are the

1130
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:25,600
failure to move higher. There are the
 

1131
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,310
failure to move higher. There are the
key levels. There's the lower high, but

1132
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,320
key levels. There's the lower high, but
 

1133
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,750
key levels. There's the lower high, but
selling the bottom of this range. Yes,

1134
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:29,760
selling the bottom of this range. Yes,
 

1135
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,590
selling the bottom of this range. Yes,
it could come down to here, but could

1136
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:31,600
it could come down to here, but could
 

1137
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,750
it could come down to here, but could
also come up to here. So, our risk,

1138
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:33,760
also come up to here. So, our risk,
 

1139
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,630
also come up to here. So, our risk,
right, is one one. It's not a great

1140
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:36,640
right, is one one. It's not a great
 

1141
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,830
right, is one one. It's not a great
location. Remember, we're always talking

1142
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:37,840
location. Remember, we're always talking
 

1143
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,830
location. Remember, we're always talking
about location and momentum before any

1144
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:39,840
about location and momentum before any
 

1145
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,532
about location and momentum before any
trade.

1146
00:25:42,532 --> 00:25:42,542
trade.
 

1147
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:47,117
trade.
[snorts]

1148
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:47,127

 

1149
00:25:47,127 --> 00:25:49,590

[cough]

1150
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:49,600

 

1151
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,710

Oh, I'm glad you're happy, Rosco.

1152
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:52,720
Oh, I'm glad you're happy, Rosco.
 

1153
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,789
Oh, I'm glad you're happy, Rosco.
Uh yeah, I made more than that. I took

1154
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:54,799
Uh yeah, I made more than that. I took
 

1155
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,510
Uh yeah, I made more than that. I took
uh $25,000 out on that on that first

1156
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:57,520
uh $25,000 out on that on that first
 

1157
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,269
uh $25,000 out on that on that first
payout.

1158
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,279
payout.
 

1159
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,230
payout.
Left a good chunk in. And um I'm going

1160
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:02,240
Left a good chunk in. And um I'm going
 

1161
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,909
Left a good chunk in. And um I'm going
to get I actually did it on a 100k

1162
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:03,919
to get I actually did it on a 100k
 

1163
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,430
to get I actually did it on a 100k
account because I didn't realize how

1164
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,440
account because I didn't realize how
 

1165
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,070
account because I didn't realize how
good the 50ks were. So, I'm got some

1166
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,080
good the 50ks were. So, I'm got some
 

1167
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,190
good the 50ks were. So, I'm got some
50ks in the works now. Get those passed.

1168
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,200
50ks in the works now. Get those passed.
 

1169
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,710
50ks in the works now. Get those passed.
Link them all together. I'll try and get

1170
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:12,720
Link them all together. I'll try and get
 

1171
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,789
Link them all together. I'll try and get
six 50ks and just go 6K every 5 days is

1172
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:16,799
six 50ks and just go 6K every 5 days is
 

1173
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,070
six 50ks and just go 6K every 5 days is
probably a bit tough to start with. But

1174
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,080
probably a bit tough to start with. But
 

1175
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,909
probably a bit tough to start with. But
if I can get to day 30, I think there's

1176
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:19,919
if I can get to day 30, I think there's
 

1177
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,870
if I can get to day 30, I think there's
a good chance of getting 50 plus,000 out

1178
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:22,880
a good chance of getting 50 plus,000 out
 

1179
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,230
a good chance of getting 50 plus,000 out
of those 6Ks fairly easily,

1180
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,240

 

1181
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,190

especially if uh the market's moving.

1182
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,200
especially if uh the market's moving.
 

1183
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,710
especially if uh the market's moving.
Okay, back down towards these lows.

1184
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:32,720
Okay, back down towards these lows.
 

1185
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,549
Okay, back down towards these lows.
Remember, we're thinking about if you're

1186
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:34,559
Remember, we're thinking about if you're
 

1187
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,230
Remember, we're thinking about if you're
short this, I don't like I can

1188
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:36,240
short this, I don't like I can
 

1189
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,990
short this, I don't like I can
understand being short this. It's just

1190
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,000
understand being short this. It's just
 

1191
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,070
understand being short this. It's just
the location's not ideal, but the

1192
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,080
the location's not ideal, but the
 

1193
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,630
the location's not ideal, but the
momentum is there at the moment. You are

1194
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:42,640
momentum is there at the moment. You are
 

1195
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,149
momentum is there at the moment. You are
seeing that bare flag. There is a fail

1196
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:44,159
seeing that bare flag. There is a fail
 

1197
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,149
seeing that bare flag. There is a fail
at New York open. There is a reason to

1198
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:46,159
at New York open. There is a reason to
 

1199
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,430
at New York open. There is a reason to
come lower right now, which is what

1200
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:47,440
come lower right now, which is what
 

1201
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:55,269
come lower right now, which is what
you're seeing.

1202
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:55,279

 

1203
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,269

What size do I trade? I actually trade a

1204
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:57,279
What size do I trade? I actually trade a
 

1205
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,510
What size do I trade? I actually trade a
a mini on those 50ks because it's not a

1206
00:26:59,510 --> 00:26:59,520
a mini on those 50ks because it's not a
 

1207
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,510
a mini on those 50ks because it's not a
trading draw down. [snorts]

1208
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,520
trading draw down. [snorts]
 

1209
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,870
trading draw down. [snorts]
So, if we can get a good setup and get a

1210
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:02,880
So, if we can get a good setup and get a
 

1211
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,549
So, if we can get a good setup and get a
mini in.

1212
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:06,559

 

1213
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,470

Lots of sellers here on the tape. I'm

Okay.

Oh wow, what a breakdown. All right,

Oh wow, what a breakdown. All right,
 

1225
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:07,750
Oh wow, what a breakdown. All right,
coming into level of interest

1226
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:07,760

coming [snorts] into these level of

coming [snorts] into these level of
interest. Then previous week point of

interest. Then previous week point of
 

1231
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,630

1242
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,080
right. It can go all the way down to 600
 

1243
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,590
right. It can go all the way down to 600
if it wants here. It's very very

1244
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:27,600
if it wants here. It's very very
 

1245
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,029
if it wants here. It's very very
possible if they move lower and reclaim

1246
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:31,039
possible if they move lower and reclaim
 

1247
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,669
possible if they move lower and reclaim
and obviously there's that move uh back

1248
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:33,679
and obviously there's that move uh back
 

1249
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,710
and obviously there's that move uh back
upside which is very possible back

1250
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:36,720
upside which is very possible back
 

1251
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,710
upside which is very possible back
through previous day value area low. At

1252
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:38,720
through previous day value area low. At
 

1253
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,990
through previous day value area low. At
the moment, you're just seeing strong

1254
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,000
the moment, you're just seeing strong
 

1255
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,310
the moment, you're just seeing strong
selling if they want to go 600s and they

1256
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:42,320
selling if they want to go 600s and they
 

1257
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,590
selling if they want to go 600s and they
will absolutely go to 600s.

1258
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:47,600

 

1259
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,029

So, I'll be watching to see if they

1260
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:49,039
So, I'll be watching to see if they
 

1261
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,830
So, I'll be watching to see if they
reclaim value otherwise. And probably a

1262
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:51,840
reclaim value otherwise. And probably a
 

1263
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,830
reclaim value otherwise. And probably a
move all the way back down to where we

1264
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:53,840
move all the way back down to where we
 

1265
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:01,110
move all the way back down to where we
once came from.

1266
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,120

 

1267
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,710

That ATR picked up, didn't it?

1268
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:04,720
That ATR picked up, didn't it?
 

1269
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,789
That ATR picked up, didn't it?
Oh, yeah. It did. 50 plus points while I

1270
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:06,799
Oh, yeah. It did. 50 plus points while I
 

1271

Oh, yeah. It did. 50 plus points while I

1272
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,000

 

1273
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,549

I'd watch previous day value area low

1274
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:14,559
I'd watch previous day value area low
 

1275
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,590
I'd watch previous day value area low

We lack structure. So, all we did was a

00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:20,480
We lack structure. So, all we did was a
 

1747
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,910
We lack structure. So, all we did was a
rotation. And if you go back to the

1748
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:21,920
rotation. And if you go back to the
 

1749
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,990
rotation. And if you go back to the
start of the stream,

start of the stream,
 

1751
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,670
start of the stream,
we talked about the rotations in this

1752
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:25,680
we talked about the rotations in this
 

1753
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,670
we talked about the rotations in this
market being probably this RBS

1754
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:29,680
market being probably this RBS
 

1755
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,190
market being probably this RBS
or if they wanted to drift through. So

1756
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,200
or if they wanted to drift through. So
 

1757
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,630
or if they wanted to drift through. So
fail here, back down to here. Now, if

1758
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:32,640
fail here, back down to here. Now, if
 

1759
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,150
fail here, back down to here. Now, if
they reclaim this, actually gets pretty

1760
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,160
they reclaim this, actually gets pretty
 

1761
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,550
they reclaim this, actually gets pretty
bullish at that point.

1762
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:36,560
bullish at that point.
 

1763
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,470

00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:13,359
uh 0.80%
 

1879
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,430
uh 0.80%
up. So they are doing completely

1880
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:15,440
up. So they are doing completely
 

1881
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,270
up. So they are doing completely
opposite things right now. You have

1882
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:17,280
opposite things right now. You have
 

1883
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,030
opposite things right now. You have
strength in the names which are not chip

1884
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:19,040
strength in the names which are not chip
 

1885
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,030
strength in the names which are not chip
related basically. So anything chip

1886
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,040
related basically. So anything chip
 

1887
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,870
related basically. So anything chip
related is getting absolutely hammered.

1888
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:22,880
related is getting absolutely hammered.
 

1889
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,549
related is getting absolutely hammered.
Anything non-chip related looks all

Anything non-chip related looks all

Anything non-chip related looks all
right. Looks all right. [snorts]

right. Looks all right. [snorts]

Why are you doing this?

Why are you doing this?
The energy today. Okay. Right down to

The energy today. Okay. Right down to

The energy today. Okay. Right down to

don't defend this level that you're at

00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:50,800
don't defend this level that you're at
 

1903
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,150
don't defend this level that you're at
now, then you're probably going to see

1904
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:52,160
now, then you're probably going to see
 

1905
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,649
now, then you're probably going to see
new lows.

1906

1911
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,910

is where bulls stepped in. I'd say this

1912
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:11,920
is where bulls stepped in. I'd say this
 

1913
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,349
is where bulls stepped in. I'd say this
level you're at now, 80s. It has to

1914
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:13,359
level you're at now, 80s. It has to
 

1915
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:14,710
level you're at now, 80s. It has to
hold. If they don't hold 80s, I would

1916
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:14,720
hold. If they don't hold 80s, I would
 

1917
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:23,270
hold. If they don't hold 80s, I would
imagine you're going to get new lows.

00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:23,280

 

1919
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,390

At least that's what I'm looking at.

1920
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:24,400
At least that's what I'm looking at.
 

1921
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:35,295
At least that's what I'm looking at.
That's what I'm seeing.

Still they're selling it very aggressive

Still they're selling it very aggressive

1929
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,790

These levels are matching up. Where have

These levels are matching up. Where have

1933
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,510

How do I interpret that or consumer

How do I interpret that or consumer
 

1935

1957
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,150

Like you have to think think when you

1958
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:04,160
Like you have to think think when you
 

1959
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,589
Like you have to think think when you
look at stuff like that even with that

look at stuff like that even with that

look at stuff like that even with that
that fear and greed index it doesn't

that fear and greed index it doesn't
 

1963
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,589
that fear and greed index it doesn't
mean

1964
00:52:09,589 --> 00:52:09,599
mean
 

1965
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,349
mean
anything. Do you know what I mean? Like

1966
00:52:11,349 --> 00:52:11,359
anything. Do you know what I mean? Like
 

1967
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,670
anything. Do you know what I mean? Like
it doesn't mean anything.

1968
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:13,680
it doesn't mean anything.
 

1969

it doesn't mean anything.
We all know people are having a hard

right? It's like the most obvious thing.
 

1975
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,470
right? It's like the most obvious thing.
People are having a hard time right now.

People are having a hard time right now.
 

1977

people are feeling it. So, consumer

1986
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:33,200
people are feeling it. So, consumer
 

1987
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,910
people are feeling it. So, consumer
confidence is going to be down.

And the range rotation continues then.

2008
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:02,800
And the range rotation continues then.
 

2009
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,790

So buyers defending

2014
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:47,599
So buyers defending
 

2015
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:55,030
So buyers defending
defending your current point of control.

00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:55,040

 

2017
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,670

Exactly, JD. There's no breadth.

2018
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:57,680
Exactly, JD. There's no breadth.
 

2019

Exactly, JD. There's no breadth.
Exactly. It's strong on not even seven

2020
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:00,400
Exactly. It's strong on not even seven
 

2021
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,990
Exactly. It's strong on not even seven
stocks really. It's strong on like five

2022
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:02,000
stocks really. It's strong on like five
 

2023
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,069
stocks really. It's strong on like five
stocks or something.

2024
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:04,079
stocks or something.
 

2025
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,870
stocks or something.
That's exactly it.

2026
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:06,880
That's exactly it.
 

2027
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,750
That's exactly it.
If you look at like uh QQQ,

2028
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:11,760

 

2029
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:19,270

is it NQE? QQQ.

2030
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:19,280

 

2031
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,589

We're still not reclaiming.

2032
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:21,599
We're still not reclaiming.
 

2033
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,190
We're still not reclaiming.
This is equally weighted. If everything

2034
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:23,200
This is equally weighted. If everything
 

2035
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,589
This is equally weighted. If everything
was equally weighted, right? So, I think

2036
00:54:25,589 --> 00:54:25,599
was equally weighted, right? So, I think
 

2037
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,750
was equally weighted, right? So, I think
there's more room downside. It's just

2357
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,150
great. But in here now, this is going to
just rotate and chop people up.

2358
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:30,160
just rotate and chop people up.
 

2359
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,430
just rotate and chop people up.
It's done its move. They've probably

2360
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:31,440
It's done its move. They've probably
 

2361
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:42,309
It's done its move. They've probably
made their money for the day. [snorts]

2362
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:42,319

 

2363
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:46,069

Yeah, don't blame me.

2364
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:46,079

 

2365
01:03:46,079 --> 01:04:06,470

Don't blame me, Peter.

2366
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:06,480

 

2367
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,910

There's just no follow through either

2368
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:07,920
There's just no follow through either
 

2369
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,510
There's just no follow through either
side.

2370
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:11,520

 

2371
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,950

And the range is actually pretty big.

2372
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:12,960
And the range is actually pretty big.
 

2373
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,950
And the range is actually pretty big.
The ATR is still pretty big.

2374
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:16,960
The ATR is still pretty big.
 

2375
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,870
The ATR is still pretty big.
No acceptance over previous days value.

2376
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:18,880
No acceptance over previous days value.
 

2377
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,430
No acceptance over previous days value.
No acceptance underneath previous week

2378
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:21,440
No acceptance underneath previous week
 

2379
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,510
No acceptance underneath previous week
point control.

2380
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:25,520

 

2381
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,750

This looks nah.

2382
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:27,760
This looks nah.
 

2383
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:42,230
This looks nah.
Just nah.

2384
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:42,240

 

2385
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,270

back to value. Can't get through value.

2386
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:45,280
back to value. Can't get through value.
 

2387
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,710
back to value. Can't get through value.
It's current point of control on the day

2388
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:46,720
It's current point of control on the day
 

2389
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,589
It's current point of control on the day
here now as well. Just a thick traded

2390
01:04:49,589 --> 01:04:49,599
here now as well. Just a thick traded
 

2391
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,029
here now as well. Just a thick traded
level. Until we move away from that,

2392
01:04:51,029 --> 01:04:51,039
level. Until we move away from that,
 

2393
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:53,270
level. Until we move away from that,
there's uh there's literally nothing you

2394
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:53,280
there's uh there's literally nothing you
 

2395
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:59,990
there's uh there's literally nothing you
can do with this.

2396
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,000

 

2397
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,990

Uh yeah, it's going live. The funded

2398
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:02,000
Uh yeah, it's going live. The funded
 

2399
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,349
Uh yeah, it's going live. The funded
next one going live today.

2400
01:05:05,349 --> 01:05:05,359
next one going live today.
 

2401
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:11,190
next one going live today.
Just waiting for the artwork.

2402
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:11,200

 

2403
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,069

Oh, come on, market.

2404
01:05:14,069 --> 01:05:14,079
Oh, come on, market.
 

2405
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:15,430
Oh, come on, market.
Probably going to get out of here in the

2406
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:15,440
Probably going to get out of here in the
 

2407
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,029
Probably going to get out of here in the
next 10 minutes, folks. Market's not

2408
01:05:17,029 --> 01:05:17,039
next 10 minutes, folks. Market's not
 

2409
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:19,109
next 10 minutes, folks. Market's not
doing anything, and I feel dreadfully

2410
01:05:19,109 --> 01:05:19,119
doing anything, and I feel dreadfully
 

2411
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:25,109
doing anything, and I feel dreadfully
ill.

2412
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:25,119

 

2413
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:26,470

Thought they'd come back up to test this

2414
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:26,480
Thought they'd come back up to test this
 

2415
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,069
Thought they'd come back up to test this
side of value, but at the moment,

2416
01:05:28,069 --> 01:05:28,079
side of value, but at the moment,
 

2417
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:29,990
side of value, but at the moment,
there's just no, not even able to do

2418
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:30,000
there's just no, not even able to do
 

2419
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,549
there's just no, not even able to do
that on the rotation. They're just stuck

2420
01:05:32,549 --> 01:05:32,559
that on the rotation. They're just stuck
 

2421
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:47,990
that on the rotation. They're just stuck
doing nothing.

2422
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:48,000

 

2423
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,309

made money on the short and then long

2424
01:05:50,309 --> 01:05:50,319
made money on the short and then long
 

2425
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:53,670
made money on the short and then long
and then retest weekly pivot created a

2426
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:53,680
and then retest weekly pivot created a
 

2427
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,789
and then retest weekly pivot created a
higher low and rotation from there. This

2428
01:05:56,789 --> 01:05:56,799
higher low and rotation from there. This
 

2429
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,510
higher low and rotation from there. This
one,

2430
01:05:59,510 --> 01:05:59,520
one,
 

2431
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,309
one,
yes, that made sense. We said 80s,

2432
01:06:02,309 --> 01:06:02,319
yes, that made sense. We said 80s,
 

2433
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:03,670
yes, that made sense. We said 80s,
didn't we? Drifted just below, but

2434
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:03,680
didn't we? Drifted just below, but
 

2435
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,069
didn't we? Drifted just below, but
there's no close below 80s.

2436
01:06:06,069 --> 01:06:06,079
there's no close below 80s.
 

2437
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,549
there's no close below 80s.
But now I don't know. [clears throat]

2438
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:08,559
But now I don't know. [clears throat]
 

2439
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:11,270
But now I don't know. [clears throat]
Don't know what they want to do. I guess

2440
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:11,280
Don't know what they want to do. I guess
 

2441
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,630
Don't know what they want to do. I guess
it depends if they're done selling the

2442
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:12,640
it depends if they're done selling the
 

2443
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:19,160
it depends if they're done selling the
chips or not.

2444
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:19,170

 

2445
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:25,055

[cough and clears throat]

2446
01:06:25,055 --> 01:06:25,065

 

2447
01:06:25,065 --> 01:06:36,630

[snorts]

2448
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:36,640

 

2449
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,309

maybe up to test value like we talked

2450
01:06:38,309 --> 01:06:38,319
maybe up to test value like we talked
 

2451
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:40,950
maybe up to test value like we talked
about in VWAP.

2452
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:40,960
about in VWAP.
 

2453
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,630
about in VWAP.
It's not a shorted one up here. That's

2454
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:42,640
It's not a shorted one up here. That's
 

2455
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,789
It's not a shorted one up here. That's
the problem. The shorts much higher

2456
01:06:44,789 --> 01:06:44,799
the problem. The shorts much higher
 

2457
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:48,549
the problem. The shorts much higher
right now.

2458
01:06:48,549 --> 01:06:48,559

 

2459
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,069

And you're starting to get multi-time

2460
01:06:50,069 --> 01:06:50,079
And you're starting to get multi-time
 

2461
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:52,950
And you're starting to get multi-time
frames spike,

2462
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:52,960
frames spike,
 

2463
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,230
frames spike,
which is going to be a problem as well

2464
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:56,240
which is going to be a problem as well
 

2465
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,870
which is going to be a problem as well
because that last pullback into 680 or

2466
01:06:58,870 --> 01:06:58,880
because that last pullback into 680 or
 

2467
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,549
because that last pullback into 680 or
that low 600 which held could

2468
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:00,559
that low 600 which held could
 

2469
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,230
that low 600 which held could
technically be a higher low or is

2470
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:02,240
technically be a higher low or is
 

2471
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:10,309
technically be a higher low or is
technically a higher low on an H1.

2472
01:07:10,309 --> 01:07:10,319

 

2473
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:11,910

So shorts don't have control until

2474
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:11,920
So shorts don't have control until
 

2475
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,670
So shorts don't have control until
that's taken out.

2476
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:15,680

 

2477
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,109

If we go back to what we talked about at

2478
01:07:17,109 --> 01:07:17,119
If we go back to what we talked about at
 

2479
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:21,910
If we go back to what we talked about at
the beginning of the day.

2480
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:21,920

 

2481
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,390

Oh, wrong one. If we go back to the very

2482
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:24,400
Oh, wrong one. If we go back to the very
 

2483
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,910
Oh, wrong one. If we go back to the very
beginning of the day, we talked about

2484
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:27,920
beginning of the day, we talked about
 

2485
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,990
beginning of the day, we talked about
this move here probably being the

2486
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:30,000
this move here probably being the
 

2487
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,990
this move here probably being the
rotation between these. All right. So,

2488
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:34,000
rotation between these. All right. So,
 

2489
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,109
rotation between these. All right. So,
first leg, second leg, right? What

2490
01:07:37,109 --> 01:07:37,119
first leg, second leg, right? What
 

2491
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,190
first leg, second leg, right? What
happens now is important. Does it do

2492
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:39,200
happens now is important. Does it do
 

2493
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,670
happens now is important. Does it do
this or does it reclaim for the squeeze?

2494
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:41,680
this or does it reclaim for the squeeze?
 

2495
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,950
this or does it reclaim for the squeeze?
And I doubt it makes the decision today

2496
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:44,960
And I doubt it makes the decision today
 

2497
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,670
And I doubt it makes the decision today
to be honest. I think we just build the

2498
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:47,680
to be honest. I think we just build the
 

2499
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,670
to be honest. I think we just build the
liquidity today and it makes that

2500
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:49,680
liquidity today and it makes that
 

2501
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,589
liquidity today and it makes that
decision

2502
01:07:51,589 --> 01:07:51,599
decision
 

2503
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:54,309
decision
maybe not even tomorrow, maybe uh after

2504
01:07:54,309 --> 01:07:54,319
maybe not even tomorrow, maybe uh after
 

2505
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:55,990
maybe not even tomorrow, maybe uh after
the holidays. We'll see. It's kind of

2506
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:56,000
the holidays. We'll see. It's kind of
 

2507
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,710
the holidays. We'll see. It's kind of
how they set it up into the holidays is

2508
01:07:58,710 --> 01:07:58,720
how they set it up into the holidays is
 

2509
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,109
how they set it up into the holidays is
pretty tough I would say

2510
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:01,119
pretty tough I would say
 

2511
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:16,149
pretty tough I would say
to make that decision.

2512
01:08:16,149 --> 01:08:16,159

 

2513
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:18,709

Is there a downside to getting two or

2514
01:08:18,709 --> 01:08:18,719
Is there a downside to getting two or
 

2515
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,189
Is there a downside to getting two or
three accounts that refund on passing?

2516
01:08:21,189 --> 01:08:21,199
three accounts that refund on passing?
 

2517
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:22,950
three accounts that refund on passing?
Well, the downside is if you're spending

2518
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:22,960
Well, the downside is if you're spending
 

2519
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,870
Well, the downside is if you're spending
money

2520
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:24,880
money
 

2521
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,789
money
and uh you're a newbie, you're saying,

2522
01:08:26,789 --> 01:08:26,799
and uh you're a newbie, you're saying,
 

2523
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:28,550
and uh you're a newbie, you're saying,
and and you don't pass them, it's going

2524
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:28,560
and and you don't pass them, it's going
 

2525
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,990
and and you don't pass them, it's going
to cost you money. That would be the

2526
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:30,000
to cost you money. That would be the
 

2527
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:37,669
to cost you money. That would be the
downside. That's that's the risk, right?

2528
01:08:37,669 --> 01:08:37,679

 

2529
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:39,030

because I don't play options. There we

2530
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:39,040
because I don't play options. There we
 

2531
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,390
because I don't play options. There we
go. Simple as that. Because I don't I

2532
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:42,400
go. Simple as that. Because I don't I
 

2533
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:46,070
go. Simple as that. Because I don't I
make my money trading trading uh

futures and I roll it into ETFs and

2536
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:48,560
futures and I roll it into ETFs and
 

2537
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,990
futures and I roll it into ETFs and
stocks. I don't trade options. Just not

2538
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:52,000
stocks. I don't trade options. Just not
 

2539
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,590
stocks. I don't trade options. Just not
my thing. I don't want to deal with

2540
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:55,600
my thing. I don't want to deal with
 

2541
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,950
my thing. I don't want to deal with
theta and gamma exposure and time decay

2542
01:08:58,950 --> 01:08:58,960
theta and gamma exposure and time decay
 

2543
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,749
theta and gamma exposure and time decay
and no more right things.

2544
01:09:01,749 --> 01:09:01,759
and no more right things.
 

2545
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:10,229
and no more right things.
I don't mind taking leaps.

2546
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:10,239

 

2547
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:11,910

Okay, back towards previous week point

2548
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:11,920
Okay, back towards previous week point
 

2549
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,829
Okay, back towards previous week point
control again. Market's still not

2550
01:09:13,829 --> 01:09:13,839
control again. Market's still not
 

2551
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:17,590
control again. Market's still not
moving.

2552
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:17,600

 

2553
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,430

Range starting to tighten a little bit

2554
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:19,440
Range starting to tighten a little bit
 

2555
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,590
Range starting to tighten a little bit
here, but it's still pretty decent.

2556
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:21,600
here, but it's still pretty decent.
 

2557
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:32,550
here, but it's still pretty decent.
Still looking at 50 point M1 candles.

2558
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:32,560

 

2559
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,829

Do they soak here again? [snorts]

2560
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:37,839

 

2561
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:43,189

I'd say Nvidia 170 is going to be key.

2562
01:09:43,189 --> 01:09:43,199
I'd say Nvidia 170 is going to be key.
 

2563
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:46,709
I'd say Nvidia 170 is going to be key.
Bouncing around there at the moment.

2564
01:09:46,709 --> 01:09:46,719
Bouncing around there at the moment.
 

2565
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:48,709
Bouncing around there at the moment.
Look somewhat key at the moment. I would

2566
01:09:48,709 --> 01:09:48,719
Look somewhat key at the moment. I would
 

2567
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:53,990
Look somewhat key at the moment. I would
say

2568
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:54,000

 

2569
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,149

protect the edge of this range and trade

2570
01:09:56,149 --> 01:09:56,159
protect the edge of this range and trade
 

2571
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:57,590
protect the edge of this range and trade
back upside.

2572
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:57,600
back upside.
 

2573
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:14,790
back upside.
Yes, they do. And it's that 170.

2574
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:14,800

 

2575
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,070

You're going to go into chop between

2576
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:16,080
You're going to go into chop between
 

2577
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:22,790
You're going to go into chop between
these levels. Now,

2578
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:22,800

 

2579
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,510

what do I think of the 100k deal? You

2580
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:25,520
what do I think of the 100k deal? You
 

2581
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,910
what do I think of the 100k deal? You
get $3,000. you need to make six, but

2582
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:27,920
get $3,000. you need to make six, but
 

2583
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,310
get $3,000. you need to make six, but
it's relatively cheap.

2584
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:30,320
it's relatively cheap.
 

2585
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,950
it's relatively cheap.
Um, [sighs] I mean, yeah, look, the 50k

2586
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:32,960
Um, [sighs] I mean, yeah, look, the 50k
 

2587
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,110
Um, [sighs] I mean, yeah, look, the 50k
and the 25k are the easiest to pass. If

2588
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:35,120
and the 25k are the easiest to pass. If
 

2589
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,950
and the 25k are the easiest to pass. If
you want the extra little bit of wiggle

2590
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:36,960
you want the extra little bit of wiggle
 

2591
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,470
you want the extra little bit of wiggle
room, it's worth it. Is it a harder

2592
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:38,480
room, it's worth it. Is it a harder
 

2593
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,630
room, it's worth it. Is it a harder
pass? Definitely. It's very cheap,

2594
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:40,640
pass? Definitely. It's very cheap,
 

2595
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,750
pass? Definitely. It's very cheap,
though, but

2596
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:43,760
though, but
 

2597
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,350
though, but
it's basically the same price as the

2598
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:45,360
it's basically the same price as the
 

2599
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,270
it's basically the same price as the
50ks if you pass it, but you get an

2600
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:47,280
50ks if you pass it, but you get an
 

2601
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:51,030
50ks if you pass it, but you get an
extra what, $500 of draw. It's not that

2602
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:51,040
extra what, $500 of draw. It's not that
 

2603
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:55,430
extra what, $500 of draw. It's not that
much. Um,

2604
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:55,440

 

2605
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,950

just personal preference.

2606
01:10:58,950 --> 01:10:58,960
just personal preference.
 

2607
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,229
just personal preference.
It probably comes in about the same

2608
01:11:00,229 --> 01:11:00,239
It probably comes in about the same
 

2609
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:02,470
It probably comes in about the same
price, does it? Depends how depends how

2610
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:02,480
price, does it? Depends how depends how
 

2611
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,390
price, does it? Depends how depends how
much you want that extra $500 to draw

2612
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:04,400
much you want that extra $500 to draw
 

2613
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:14,229
much you want that extra $500 to draw
down.

2614
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:14,239

 

2615
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:15,990

First shot made sense, but do you think

2616
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:16,000
First shot made sense, but do you think
 

2617
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,470
First shot made sense, but do you think
taking the retest of globe XV up and 5

2618
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:18,480
taking the retest of globe XV up and 5
 

2619
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,390
taking the retest of globe XV up and 5
minute 20 was good idea? Alex felt a bit

2620
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:22,400
minute 20 was good idea? Alex felt a bit
 

2621
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,310
minute 20 was good idea? Alex felt a bit
risky after the squeeze up. You took

2622
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:24,320
risky after the squeeze up. You took
 

2623
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,709
risky after the squeeze up. You took
this one. Yeah, I think that's fine.

2624
01:11:26,709 --> 01:11:26,719
this one. Yeah, I think that's fine.
 

2625
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,870
this one. Yeah, I think that's fine.
There's your shelf. That's where That's

2626
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:28,880
There's your shelf. That's where That's
 

2627
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,630
There's your shelf. That's where That's
your structure where we broke down from.

2628
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:30,640
your structure where we broke down from.
 

2629
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,030
your structure where we broke down from.
That's the retest of it. As long as you

2630
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:33,040
That's the retest of it. As long as you
 

2631
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,870
That's the retest of it. As long as you
I mean, as long as you had a risk, a

2632
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:34,880
I mean, as long as you had a risk, a
 

2633
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,030
I mean, as long as you had a risk, a
reason to something to risk off. That

2634
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:37,040
reason to something to risk off. That
 

2635
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,149
reason to something to risk off. That
made sense. Definitely. That made sense.

2636
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:40,159
made sense. Definitely. That made sense.
 

2637
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:43,590
made sense. Definitely. That made sense.
Now, nothing makes sense to me. This

2638
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:43,600
Now, nothing makes sense to me. This
 

2639
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,189
Now, nothing makes sense to me. This
short made sense, but the location

2640
01:11:45,189 --> 01:11:45,199
short made sense, but the location
 

2641
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:47,990
short made sense, but the location
wasn't ideal. This long from here was

2642
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:48,000
wasn't ideal. This long from here was
 

2643
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,550
wasn't ideal. This long from here was
great long, but again didn't offer great

2644
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:50,560
great long, but again didn't offer great
 

2645
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,310
great long, but again didn't offer great
structure. And this short makes sense.

2646
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:52,320
structure. And this short makes sense.
 

2647
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:57,350
structure. And this short makes sense.
Now, I don't think anything makes sense.

2648
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:57,360

 

2649
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,630

Remember, we talked about coming back up

2650
01:11:58,630 --> 01:11:58,640
Remember, we talked about coming back up
 

2651
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,790
Remember, we talked about coming back up
to this shelf.

2652
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:00,800
to this shelf.
 

2653
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,149
to this shelf.
All it's done is test structure.

2654
01:12:02,149 --> 01:12:02,159
All it's done is test structure.
 

2655
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,470
All it's done is test structure.
Remember, like we built liquidity,

2656
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:04,480
Remember, like we built liquidity,
 

2657
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,390
Remember, like we built liquidity,
we failed. All right, Alex is in the

2658
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:06,400
we failed. All right, Alex is in the
 

2659
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,310
we failed. All right, Alex is in the
bathroom, but you get the big failure.

2660
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:08,320
bathroom, but you get the big failure.
 

2661
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,430
bathroom, but you get the big failure.
600 was the level, right? The RBS zone.

2662
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:11,440
600 was the level, right? The RBS zone.
 

2663
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,430
600 was the level, right? The RBS zone.
They bid, they go back to where we've

2664
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:13,440
They bid, they go back to where we've
 

2665
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,350
They bid, they go back to where we've
got no structure. So, we bid back to

2666
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:15,360
got no structure. So, we bid back to
 

2667
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,910
got no structure. So, we bid back to
structure bid structure fail. It's where

2668
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:17,920
structure bid structure fail. It's where
 

2669
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,910
structure bid structure fail. It's where
sellers took control. Back down to where

2670
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:19,920
sellers took control. Back down to where
 

2671
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,070
sellers took control. Back down to where
we bid off. Okay. Now, we're doing the

2672
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:22,080
we bid off. Okay. Now, we're doing the
 

2673
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,430
we bid off. Okay. Now, we're doing the

Vid is still holding that 170. And

2769
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:28,390
Vid is still holding that 170. And
that's the key level bidding off 170.

2771
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,390

to previous day value area low. Can they

2772
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:30,400
to previous day value area low. Can they
 

2773
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,709
to previous day value area low. Can they
complete this squeeze up now? It's the

complete this squeeze up now? It's the
 

2775
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:35,830
complete this squeeze up now? It's the
question. Can they run all these stops

2776
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:35,840
question. Can they run all these stops
 

2777
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,149
question. Can they run all these stops
through here and retest this? If they

through here and retest this? If they
 

2779
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,709
through here and retest this? If they
reclaim this can get nasty, but again,

2780

reclaim this can get nasty, but again,
 

2781
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:42,229
reclaim this can get nasty, but again,
it's just a range. I wouldn't want to be

01:15:42,229 --> 01:15:42,239
it's just a range. I wouldn't want to be
 

2783
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:43,910
it's just a range. I wouldn't want to be
bullish up here. I want to I want to buy

2784
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:43,920
bullish up here. I want to I want to buy
 

2785
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,550
bullish up here. I want to I want to buy
down here like I talked about, but I'm

2786
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:46,560
down here like I talked about, but I'm
 

2787
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:47,990
down here like I talked about, but I'm
just not well enough. That was probably

2788
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:48,000
just not well enough. That was probably
 

2789
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,750
just not well enough. That was probably
a decent risk buy here because you don't

2790
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:49,760
a decent risk buy here because you don't
 

2791
01:15:49,760 --> 01:16:00,950
a decent risk buy here because you don't
have to risk a lot.

2792

2793
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,110

2801
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:32,229

2803
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:34,390

Five minute or was pretty good this

2804
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:34,400
Five minute or was pretty good this
 

2805
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,750
Five minute or was pretty good this
morning. Really good actually. That sat.

01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:37,760
morning. Really good actually. That sat.
 

2807
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,470
morning. Really good actually. That sat.
Yeah. Failed look above really good the

2808
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:40,480
Yeah. Failed look above really good the
 

2809
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:47,669
Yeah. Failed look above really good the
five minute this morning.

2810

2811
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:48,950

So just remember I think you're in a

2812
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:48,960
So just remember I think you're in a
 

2813
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,430
So just remember I think you're in a
range rotation. So, you know, even this

2814
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:51,440
range rotation. So, you know, even this
 

2815
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,950
range rotation. So, you know, even this
move up, maybe they come up to here if

2816
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:52,960
move up, maybe they come up to here if
 

2817
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,149
move up, maybe they come up to here if
they get really lucky, but you probably

2818
01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:54,159
they get really lucky, but you probably
 

2819
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:55,750
they get really lucky, but you probably
get sold. Maybe they clear out some

2820
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:55,760
get sold. Maybe they clear out some
 

2821
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,110
get sold. Maybe they clear out some
stops if you get very lucky and then

2822
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:57,120
stops if you get very lucky and then
 

2823
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,590
stops if you get very lucky and then
they get sold into. I don't think we're

2824
01:16:59,590 --> 01:16:59,600
they get sold into. I don't think we're
 

2825
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,470
they get sold into. I don't think we're
going to see a sustained move outside

2826
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:02,480
going to see a sustained move outside
 

2827
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,669
going to see a sustained move outside
today. It makes sense for this to be an

2828
01:17:05,669 --> 01:17:05,679
today. It makes sense for this to be an
 

2829
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:08,390
today. It makes sense for this to be an
inside day with look above and look

01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:08,400
inside day with look above and look
 

2831

2893
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:50,709

I'll probably take Friday off though to
 

2899
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,390
I'll probably take Friday off though to
be honest if I'm feeling like this

2900
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:02,400
be honest if I'm feeling like this
 

2901
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,830
be honest if I'm feeling like this
because it means I won't get to

2902
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:03,840
because it means I won't get to
 

2903
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,350
because it means I won't get to
celebrate Thanksgiving. So, I'll

2904
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:05,360
celebrate Thanksgiving. So, I'll
 

2905
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,229
celebrate Thanksgiving. So, I'll
probably take Thursday, Friday off. This

2906
01:20:08,229 --> 01:20:08,239
probably take Thursday, Friday off. This
 

2907
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:10,229
probably take Thursday, Friday off. This
has put me behind schedule on making the

2908
01:20:10,229 --> 01:20:10,239
has put me behind schedule on making the
 

2909
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,270
has put me behind schedule on making the
course for you guys as well.

2910
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:11,280

01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:26,560
Okay, so they're trying to break out.

There's your squeeze.
I would say there sell up here probably

I would say there sell up here probably
 

2923
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,270
I would say there sell up here probably
maybe run these stops and a sell up here

2924
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:33,280
maybe run these stops and a sell up here
 

2925
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,870
maybe run these stops and a sell up here
if they get through this. Maybe a big

if they get through this. Maybe a big
 

2927
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,790
if they get through this. Maybe a big
squeeze and then a sell up high. You

2928
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:36,800
squeeze and then a sell up high. You
 

2929
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,310
squeeze and then a sell up high. You
have to see. Have to keep your eye on a

01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:38,320
have to see. Have to keep your eye on a
 

2931

2935
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,669

what you have to do. You have to expect
 

2937
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:49,750
what you have to do. You have to expect
rotations on days like this. Today

2938
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:49,760

 

2939
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,270

meta looking really good. I'm kind of

2940
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:51,280
meta looking really good. I'm kind of
 

2941
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:54,149
meta looking really good. I'm kind of
gutted I didn't size more into that. Got

2942
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:54,159
gutted I didn't size more into that. Got
 

2943
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:57,350
gutted I didn't size more into that. Got
a feeler on it and that's it.

2944
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:57,360
a feeler on it and that's it.
 

2945
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:02,790
a feeler on it and that's it.
I'm already up 5% on it on a swing.

2947
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:29,669

Kind of annoying.

2948
01:21:29,669 --> 01:21:29,679

 

2949
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:36,470

Battle eights here. Failing eights here.

2950

2951
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,990

Do they hold this pullback where they

2952
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:38,000
Do they hold this pullback where they
 

2953
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,669
Do they hold this pullback where they
just broke out from? I guess is is the

2954
01:21:39,669 --> 01:21:39,679
just broke out from? I guess is is the
 

2955
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:41,430
just broke out from? I guess is is the
question or not? At the moment, it's

2956
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:41,440
question or not? At the moment, it's
 

2957
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:42,870
question or not? At the moment, it's
looking like a failed breakout like we

2958
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:42,880
looking like a failed breakout like we
 

2959
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,510
looking like a failed breakout like we
talked about.

2960
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:45,520
talked about.
 

2961
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:52,470

Big failed breakout.

back to run point of control. This is
 

2965
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:55,590
back to run point of control. This is
why I saying the edge of rotation. I'm

2966
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:55,600
why I saying the edge of rotation. I'm
 

2967
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:56,790
why I saying the edge of rotation. I'm
surprised they didn't run the stops

2968
01:21:56,790 --> 01:21:56,800
surprised they didn't run the stops
 

2969
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:57,990
surprised they didn't run the stops
first. They might come back for it

2970
01:21:57,990 --> 01:21:58,000
first. They might come back for it
 

2971
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,390
first. They might come back for it
later. Now,

2972
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:00,400
later. Now,
 

2973
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:03,030
later. Now,
here's your value

2974
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:03,040
here's your value
 

2975
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,110

01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,350
this is the previous week's value,
right? That's your previous week's

2994
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:23,360
right? That's your previous week's
 

2995
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,870
right? That's your previous week's
rotation.

2996
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:26,880

 

2997
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,229

Where's previous day? This is your

2998
01:22:28,229 --> 01:22:28,239
Where's previous day? This is your
 

2999
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:32,550
Where's previous day? This is your
previous day's rotation.

3000
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:32,560

 

3001
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,790

This is your current day rotation, your

3002
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:34,800
This is your current day rotation, your
 

3003
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,189
This is your current day rotation, your
developing rotation.

3004
01:22:37,189 --> 01:22:37,199
developing rotation.
 

3005
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:38,550
developing rotation.
Right? You can see how we've built

3006
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:38,560
Right? You can see how we've built
 

3007
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,189
Right? You can see how we've built
liquidity. We're not finding bears are

3008
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:41,199
liquidity. We're not finding bears are
 

3009
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:43,750
liquidity. We're not finding bears are
not finding acceptance underneath here.

3010
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:43,760
not finding acceptance underneath here.
 

3011
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,189
not finding acceptance underneath here.
All right? So bears are not finding

3012
01:22:45,189 --> 01:22:45,199
All right? So bears are not finding
 

3013
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,669
All right? So bears are not finding
acceptance underneath here. Bulls are

3014
01:22:47,669 --> 01:22:47,679
acceptance underneath here. Bulls are
 

3015
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:50,390
acceptance underneath here. Bulls are
not finding acceptance over here. So

3016
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:50,400
not finding acceptance over here. So
 

3017
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,070
not finding acceptance over here. So
your rotation is going to keep taking

3018
01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:52,080
your rotation is going to keep taking
 

3019
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,390
your rotation is going to keep taking
place in this zone. If we get under here

3020
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:54,400
place in this zone. If we get under here
 

3021
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,629
place in this zone. If we get under here
and hold that, bears will take control

3022
01:22:56,629 --> 01:22:56,639
and hold that, bears will take control
 

3023
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,470
and hold that, bears will take control
for a rotation lower. If we get above

3024
01:22:58,470 --> 01:22:58,480
for a rotation lower. If we get above
 

3025
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,629
for a rotation lower. If we get above
here and hold this, bulls will take

3026
01:23:00,629 --> 01:23:00,639
here and hold this, bulls will take
 

3027
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:03,030
here and hold this, bulls will take
control for rotation higher. But what

3028
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:03,040
control for rotation higher. But what
 

3029
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,350
control for rotation higher. But what
normally happens in these plays will be

3030
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:05,360
normally happens in these plays will be
 

3031
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,790
normally happens in these plays will be
bulls will get trapped looking for a

3032
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:06,800
bulls will get trapped looking for a
 

3033
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,790
bulls will get trapped looking for a
rotation and get dumped on or bears will

3034
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:08,800
rotation and get dumped on or bears will
 

3035
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,070
rotation and get dumped on or bears will
get trapped looking for that rotation

3036
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:10,080
get trapped looking for that rotation
 

3037
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,470
get trapped looking for that rotation
and get dumped on. What I would say is

3038
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:12,480
and get dumped on. What I would say is
 

3039
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,870
and get dumped on. What I would say is
momentum is with bears. So I'd be more

3040
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:14,880
momentum is with bears. So I'd be more
 

3041
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,830
momentum is with bears. So I'd be more
inclined to look for that than I would

3042
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:17,840
inclined to look for that than I would
 

3043
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,470
inclined to look for that than I would
for that today. And I'd be more inclined

3044
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:20,480
for that today. And I'd be more inclined
 

3045
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:23,830
for that today. And I'd be more inclined
to look for this than I would for this.

3046
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:23,840
to look for this than I would for this.
 

3047
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,310
to look for this than I would for this.
But we'll just see. Hopefully that makes

3048
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:26,320
But we'll just see. Hopefully that makes
 

3049
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,470
But we'll just see. Hopefully that makes
sense to you all. All right. Like we

3050
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:28,480
sense to you all. All right. Like we
 

3051
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,990
sense to you all. All right. Like we
talked about the very start of the day,

3052
01:23:29,990 --> 01:23:30,000
talked about the very start of the day,
 

3053
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,270
talked about the very start of the day,
the levels I've given you have played

3054
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:31,280
the levels I've given you have played
 

3055
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,750
the levels I've given you have played
out. 600 rotation down, probably bid

3056
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:33,760
out. 600 rotation down, probably bid
 

3057
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,830
out. 600 rotation down, probably bid
off, probably build an inside bar. That

3058
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:35,840
off, probably build an inside bar. That
 

3059
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:40,229
off, probably build an inside bar. That
all comes from looking at the daily,

3060
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:40,239
all comes from looking at the daily,
 

3061
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:43,830
all comes from looking at the daily,
right? This all comes from understanding

3062
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:43,840
right? This all comes from understanding
 

3063
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,310
right? This all comes from understanding
we're probably just going to rebalance,

3064
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:46,320
we're probably just going to rebalance,
 

3065
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,310
we're probably just going to rebalance,
right? We have not got above, right?

3066
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:48,320
right? We have not got above, right?
 

3067
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,709
right? We have not got above, right?
We're not in breakout, right? There's

3068
01:23:50,709 --> 01:23:50,719
We're not in breakout, right? There's
 

3069
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:52,470
We're not in breakout, right? There's
your swing. We're not in breakout.

3070
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:52,480
your swing. We're not in breakout.
 

3071
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:53,910
your swing. We're not in breakout.
There's your previous day. What have we

3072
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:53,920
There's your previous day. What have we
 

3073
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,350
There's your previous day. What have we
just done? We've all we've done is come

3074
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:55,360
just done? We've all we've done is come
 

3075
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,830
just done? We've all we've done is come
to Friday's high. That's all we've done.

3076
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:57,840
to Friday's high. That's all we've done.
 

3077
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,590
to Friday's high. That's all we've done.
We've just repriced. We are probably

3078
01:23:59,590 --> 01:23:59,600
We've just repriced. We are probably
 

3079
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,270
We've just repriced. We are probably
going to build in here because what that

3080
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:01,280
going to build in here because what that
 

3081
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,430
going to build in here because what that
allows

3082
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:03,440
allows
 

3083
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,550
allows
if too many bulls get in here or if they

3084
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:06,560
if too many bulls get in here or if they
 

3085
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,830
if too many bulls get in here or if they
do this move next week or Friday maybe

3086
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:09,840
do this move next week or Friday maybe
 

3087
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,910
do this move next week or Friday maybe
it allows downside pressure. If too many

3088
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:11,920
it allows downside pressure. If too many
 

3089
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,470
it allows downside pressure. If too many
bears sold the lows and they do want to

3090
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:14,480
bears sold the lows and they do want to
 

3091
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,709
bears sold the lows and they do want to
print this higher, right? Then this

3092
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:16,719
print this higher, right? Then this
 

3093
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,270
print this higher, right? Then this
breakout here will be amazing because

3094
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:19,280
breakout here will be amazing because
 

3095
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,550
breakout here will be amazing because
you're going to have bears stuck here

3096
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:20,560
you're going to have bears stuck here
 

3097
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,229
you're going to have bears stuck here
and bears stuck here and then they can

3098
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:22,239
and bears stuck here and then they can
 

3099
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:24,550
and bears stuck here and then they can
get a squeeze and this can still be sold

3100
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:24,560
get a squeeze and this can still be sold
 

3101
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,030
get a squeeze and this can still be sold
into and you cannot rule this out and

3102
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:27,040
into and you cannot rule this out and
 

3103
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,790
into and you cannot rule this out and
that's still being sold into. It's very

3104
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:28,800
that's still being sold into. It's very
 

3105
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,550
that's still being sold into. It's very
very possible on a higher time frame.

3106
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:30,560
very possible on a higher time frame.
 

3107
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,070
very possible on a higher time frame.
Look at the balance that we've created

3108
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:32,080
Look at the balance that we've created
 

3109
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,629
Look at the balance that we've created
here now. We've spent so much time here

3110
01:24:34,629 --> 01:24:34,639
here now. We've spent so much time here
 

3111
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,390
here now. We've spent so much time here
and especially

3112
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:36,400
and especially
 

3113
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,950
and especially
who remembers this level 25,000s to

3114
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:38,960
who remembers this level 25,000s to
 

3115
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,830
who remembers this level 25,000s to
700s. Well, that's basically all we're

3116
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:41,840
700s. Well, that's basically all we're
 

3117
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:45,030
700s. Well, that's basically all we're
doing. Hello. Hello. Hello. All right.

3118
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:45,040
doing. Hello. Hello. Hello. All right.
 

3119
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:47,030
doing. Hello. Hello. Hello. All right.
It's the same level over and over and

3120
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:47,040
It's the same level over and over and
 

3121
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,550
It's the same level over and over and
over again. They're going to keep

3122
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:48,560
over again. They're going to keep
 

3123
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,709
over again. They're going to keep
rotating because they know how key this

3124
01:24:50,709 --> 01:24:50,719
rotating because they know how key this
 

3125
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:53,990
rotating because they know how key this
is for dependence on what happens next.

3126
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:54,000
is for dependence on what happens next.
 

3127
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,149
is for dependence on what happens next.
this. Remember how we built liquidity

3128
01:24:56,149 --> 01:24:56,159
this. Remember how we built liquidity
 

3129
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:59,030
this. Remember how we built liquidity
here in September, October to get to

3130
01:24:59,030 --> 01:24:59,040
here in September, October to get to
 

3131
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,110
here in September, October to get to
alltime highs. We can do the same here

3132
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:01,120
alltime highs. We can do the same here
 

3133
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,510
alltime highs. We can do the same here
for Santa Claus or we can do the same

3134
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:03,520
for Santa Claus or we can do the same
 

3135
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,390
for Santa Claus or we can do the same
for saying, "Hey, good night retail.

3136
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:06,400
for saying, "Hey, good night retail.
 

3137
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,629
for saying, "Hey, good night retail.
We're out here." Right? Hopefully that

3138
01:25:08,629 --> 01:25:08,639
We're out here." Right? Hopefully that
 

3139
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:10,070
We're out here." Right? Hopefully that
makes sense to you all. I am now going

3140
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:10,080
makes sense to you all. I am now going
 

3141
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,310
makes sense to you all. I am now going
to leave here. Um I'm really sorry

3142
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:12,320
to leave here. Um I'm really sorry
 

3143
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:16,149
to leave here. Um I'm really sorry
folks. I I was really really hoping

3144
01:25:16,149 --> 01:25:16,159
folks. I I was really really hoping
 

3145
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:18,310
folks. I I was really really hoping
I'd be well enough this week to trade uh

3146
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:18,320

yesterday was decreased volume. If we
pin this in and then sellers come in,

3232

pin this in and then sellers come in,
 

3233
