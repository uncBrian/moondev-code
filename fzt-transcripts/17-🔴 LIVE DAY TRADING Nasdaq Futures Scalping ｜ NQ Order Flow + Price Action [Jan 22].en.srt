00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
that move back up, which had happened
 

17
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,189
that move back up, which had happened
very quick off Trump's news.

18
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,199

 

19
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,629

they're coming to a deal with Greenland
 

23
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,749
they're coming to a deal with Greenland
and there's no longer going to be

24
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
and there's no longer going to be
 

25
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,749
and there's no longer going to be
tariffs. What a surprise. Just a one

26
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
tariffs. What a surprise. Just a one
 

27
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,270
tariffs. What a surprise. Just a one
huge massive bluff from him again. Okay,

28
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
huge massive bluff from him again. Okay,
 

29
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,110
huge massive bluff from him again. Okay,
so what do we have? Well, we filled the

30
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,120
so what do we have? Well, we filled the
 

31
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,550
so what do we have? Well, we filled the
gap on the daily, right? We're going to

32
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
gap on the daily, right? We're going to
 

33
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,430
gap on the daily, right? We're going to
start off in the daily as always. gap

34
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
start off in the daily as always. gap
 

35
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,909
start off in the daily as always. gap
filled on the daily. We can see that gap

36
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
filled on the daily. We can see that gap
 

37
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,830
filled on the daily. We can see that gap
was filled

38
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:53,840
was filled
 

39
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,710
was filled
right into here into just just under

40
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
right into here into just just under
 

41
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,710
right into here into just just under
700. All right. So, it's worth watching

42
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
700. All right. So, it's worth watching
 

43
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,589
700. All right. So, it's worth watching
that gap. If we're able to base above

44
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:01,599
that gap. If we're able to base above
 

45
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,230
that gap. If we're able to base above
that gap, we do have some levels to

46
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
that gap, we do have some levels to
 

47
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,909
that gap, we do have some levels to
drive for above. The one thing we need

48
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
drive for above. The one thing we need
 

49
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,990
drive for above. The one thing we need
to be very, very, very aware of, which

50
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
to be very, very, very aware of, which
 

51
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,150
to be very, very, very aware of, which
I've talked about numerous times, is we

52
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
I've talked about numerous times, is we
 

53
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,790
I've talked about numerous times, is we
have an old range up here. Week one,

54
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
have an old range up here. Week one,
 

55
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,790
have an old range up here. Week one,
week two, week three, week four. Okay,

56
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
week two, week three, week four. Okay,
 

57
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,230
week two, week three, week four. Okay,
this is where we failed to find

58
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
this is where we failed to find
 

59
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,029
this is where we failed to find
acceptance above it. We are still in

60
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
acceptance above it. We are still in
 

61
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,110
acceptance above it. We are still in
this like big old wedge right now. All

62
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
this like big old wedge right now. All
 

63
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,430
this like big old wedge right now. All
right, nothing's actually changed. We

64
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
right, nothing's actually changed. We
 

65
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,070
right, nothing's actually changed. We
had the chance to break down. All right,

66
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
had the chance to break down. All right,
 

67
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,070
had the chance to break down. All right,
and come and try and attack 900, but we

68
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
and come and try and attack 900, but we
 

69
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,670
and come and try and attack 900, but we
caught a bid down here in this blue box

70
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
caught a bid down here in this blue box
 

71
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,389
caught a bid down here in this blue box
like we talked about. Never was able to

72
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
like we talked about. Never was able to
 

73
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,469
like we talked about. Never was able to
break this and roll. So, we've gone back

74
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
break this and roll. So, we've gone back
 

75
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,909
break this and roll. So, we've gone back
to range, filled the gap. So, the

76
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
to range, filled the gap. So, the
 

77
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,230
to range, filled the gap. So, the
question now is, do we go back inside

78
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240
question now is, do we go back inside
 

79
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,630
question now is, do we go back inside
this old box? Right? If we consider this

80
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
this old box? Right? If we consider this
 

81
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,910
this old box? Right? If we consider this
an old box, are we going to rotate back

82
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
an old box, are we going to rotate back
 

83
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,550
an old box, are we going to rotate back
inside here? All right. Or are we just

84
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
inside here? All right. Or are we just
 

85
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,990
inside here? All right. Or are we just
going to poke our head through and say,

86
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
going to poke our head through and say,
 

87
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,509
going to poke our head through and say,
"No, we don't want to go back in that

88
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519
"No, we don't want to go back in that
 

89
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,190
"No, we don't want to go back in that
value and come back down." All right,

90
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
value and come back down." All right,
 

91
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,350
value and come back down." All right,
these are the two things that can happen

92
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
these are the two things that can happen
 

93
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,190
these are the two things that can happen
today is what we're thinking about

94
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
today is what we're thinking about
 

95
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,190
today is what we're thinking about
today. All right, so we need to be aware

96
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
today. All right, so we need to be aware
 

97
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,870
today. All right, so we need to be aware
of that. Let's have a look on the hourly

98
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
of that. Let's have a look on the hourly
 

99
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,990
of that. Let's have a look on the hourly
chart. Get some more details on this.

100
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
chart. Get some more details on this.
 

101
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,750
chart. Get some more details on this.
Okay, so you can see previous week's

102
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760
Okay, so you can see previous week's
 

103
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,750
Okay, so you can see previous week's
value. Make sure this is big enough for

104
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,760
value. Make sure this is big enough for
 

105
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,190
value. Make sure this is big enough for
you guys to see. Let's move this up a

106
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
you guys to see. Let's move this up a
 

107
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,190
you guys to see. Let's move this up a
bit.

108
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
bit.
 

109
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,110
bit.
Okay, here's previous week value area

110
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,120
Okay, here's previous week value area
 

111
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,790
Okay, here's previous week value area
low. We're currently trading around it

112
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800
low. We're currently trading around it
 

113
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,389
low. We're currently trading around it
right now. All right, so see this level

114
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399
right now. All right, so see this level
 

115
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,470
right now. All right, so see this level
right here with this node right here.

116
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
right here with this node right here.
 

117
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,310
right here with this node right here.
And we're very, very thin on this drive

118
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
And we're very, very thin on this drive
 

119
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,870
And we're very, very thin on this drive
up leaving current week's value. All

120
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
up leaving current week's value. All
 

121
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,949
up leaving current week's value. All
right, so support really, really strong

122
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:24,959
right, so support really, really strong
 

123
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,470
right, so support really, really strong
support isn't down until sort of

124
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
support isn't down until sort of
 

125
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,829
support isn't down until sort of
25,440ish,

126
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839

 

127
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,590

right? Previous day value area high,

128
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
right? Previous day value area high,
 

129
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,110
right? Previous day value area high,
previous day point of control, current

130
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120
previous day point of control, current
 

131
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,030
previous day point of control, current
week value. This is really strong

132
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
week value. This is really strong
 

133
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,350
week value. This is really strong
support. This is an overnight. Make sure

134
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
support. This is an overnight. Make sure
 

135
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,790
support. This is an overnight. Make sure
this is overnight. Yeah, this is the

136
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
this is overnight. Yeah, this is the
 

137
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,590
this is overnight. Yeah, this is the
overnight squeeze into previous week's

138
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,600
overnight squeeze into previous week's
 

139
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,110
overnight squeeze into previous week's
value. If we hold bids here, right, and

140
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
value. If we hold bids here, right, and
 

141
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,949
value. If we hold bids here, right, and
we want to continue to squeeze, then

142
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
we want to continue to squeeze, then
 

143
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,269
we want to continue to squeeze, then
this right here is what it's a naked EC.

144
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
this right here is what it's a naked EC.
 

145
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,269
this right here is what it's a naked EC.
All right, so if we can rotate, this

146
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
All right, so if we can rotate, this
 

147
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,389
All right, so if we can rotate, this
will be target up towards the 900s. If

148
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
will be target up towards the 900s. If
 

149
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,949
will be target up towards the 900s. If
this is a poke inside and an absolute

150
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
this is a poke inside and an absolute
 

151
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,310
this is a poke inside and an absolute
failure, all right, if we fail this

152
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
failure, all right, if we fail this
 

153
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,550
failure, all right, if we fail this
node, which so far we're looking like

154
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
node, which so far we're looking like
 

155
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,470
node, which so far we're looking like
we're getting stuck around these two

156
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,480
we're getting stuck around these two
 

157
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,790
we're getting stuck around these two
nodes. If we fail here and fail to get

158
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
nodes. If we fail here and fail to get
 

159
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,230
nodes. If we fail here and fail to get
acceptance back into previous week

160
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
acceptance back into previous week
 

161
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,350
acceptance back into previous week
value, there is a trade back down to

162
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
value, there is a trade back down to
 

163
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,710
value, there is a trade back down to
here. You can see this pivot here. Let's

164
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
here. You can see this pivot here. Let's
 

165
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,790
here. You can see this pivot here. Let's
just move this out. There is a trade

166
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,800
just move this out. There is a trade
 

167
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,750
just move this out. There is a trade
back down inside this range possibly to

168
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
back down inside this range possibly to
 

169
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,829
back down inside this range possibly to
come and back test some of this. And

170
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:19,839
come and back test some of this. And
 

171
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,670
come and back test some of this. And
then we can see do buyers want to step

172
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
then we can see do buyers want to step
 

173
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,269
then we can see do buyers want to step
back in again or is this a complete

174
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
back in again or is this a complete
 

175
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,829
back in again or is this a complete
collapse again? So, a couple couple ways

176
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
collapse again? So, a couple couple ways
 

177
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,470
collapse again? So, a couple couple ways
to trade this. Um what don't I like? I

178
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
to trade this. Um what don't I like? I
 

179
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,389
to trade this. Um what don't I like? I
don't like trading in here. uh

180
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:30,399
don't like trading in here. uh
 

181
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,870
don't like trading in here. uh
unfortunately like I'd be willing to

182
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
unfortunately like I'd be willing to
 

183
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,630
unfortunately like I'd be willing to
place a buy here if we show a lot of

184
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
place a buy here if we show a lot of
 

185
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,069
place a buy here if we show a lot of
strength here and there's a squeeze up.

186
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
strength here and there's a squeeze up.
 

187
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,310
strength here and there's a squeeze up.
I'll think about it. But I want to be

188
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
I'll think about it. But I want to be
 

189
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,949
I'll think about it. But I want to be
very careful because we already know

190
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
very careful because we already know
 

191
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,069
very careful because we already know
what happens in here. Chop, chop, chop,

192
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
what happens in here. Chop, chop, chop,
 

193
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,110
what happens in here. Chop, chop, chop,
chop, and chop. Right? That's what

194
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
chop, and chop. Right? That's what
 

195
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,190
chop, and chop. Right? That's what
happens in this box. We talked about it

196
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
happens in this box. We talked about it
 

197
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,190
happens in this box. We talked about it
yesterday. Acceptance out of this box,

198
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200
yesterday. Acceptance out of this box,
 

199
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,870
yesterday. Acceptance out of this box,
then we're probably looking for a big

200
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
then we're probably looking for a big
 

201
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,550
then we're probably looking for a big
old squeeze to alltime highs unless we

202
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
old squeeze to alltime highs unless we
 

203
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,790
old squeeze to alltime highs unless we
get a fail break and a sort of reversion

204
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
get a fail break and a sort of reversion
 

205
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,150
get a fail break and a sort of reversion
back down. At the moment it's starting

206
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
back down. At the moment it's starting
 

207
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,990
back down. At the moment it's starting
to look like this might be the failed

208
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
to look like this might be the failed
 

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,430
to look like this might be the failed
breakout side again twice like a woff

210
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
breakout side again twice like a woff
 

211
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,910
breakout side again twice like a woff
okay this might be the spring and now we

212
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:07,920
okay this might be the spring and now we
 

213
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,910
okay this might be the spring and now we
need to see do we find acceptance so

214
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
need to see do we find acceptance so
 

215
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,310
need to see do we find acceptance so
want to be careful for the rotation all

216
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320
want to be careful for the rotation all
 

217
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,069
want to be careful for the rotation all
right this is not a day where I want to

218
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
right this is not a day where I want to
 

219
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,350
right this is not a day where I want to
be big big risk on if we move up to the

220
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
be big big risk on if we move up to the
 

221
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,790
be big big risk on if we move up to the
fiveminute chart we can just see how

222
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:18,800
fiveminute chart we can just see how
 

223
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,509
fiveminute chart we can just see how
we've got here right here was

224
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:23,519
we've got here right here was
 

225
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,750
we've got here right here was
the Trump news I think it was right here

226
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
the Trump news I think it was right here
 

227
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,910
the Trump news I think it was right here
2:00 yeah this is the Trump news huge

228
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:27,920
2:00 yeah this is the Trump news huge
 

229
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,310
2:00 yeah this is the Trump news huge
spike we managed to base above the old

230
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
spike we managed to base above the old
 

231
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,470
spike we managed to base above the old
pivot. All right, remember this was

232
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
pivot. All right, remember this was
 

233
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,790
pivot. All right, remember this was
resistance. This blue box was

234
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
resistance. This blue box was
 

235
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,269
resistance. This blue box was
resistance. It was red. It now becomes

236
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
resistance. It was red. It now becomes
 

237
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,829
resistance. It was red. It now becomes
support. All right, we find bids off it

238
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
support. All right, we find bids off it
 

239
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,710
support. All right, we find bids off it
into the close. Asia goes sideways. We

240
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
into the close. Asia goes sideways. We
 

241
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,870
into the close. Asia goes sideways. We
hold that pivot, that strong pivot 450

242
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
hold that pivot, that strong pivot 450
 

243
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,670
hold that pivot, that strong pivot 450
gets held. Uh, sorry. Yeah, Asia holds a

244
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:47,680
gets held. Uh, sorry. Yeah, Asia holds a
 

245
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,750
gets held. Uh, sorry. Yeah, Asia holds a
pivot. London drives back upside. We're

246
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
pivot. London drives back upside. We're
 

247
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,069
pivot. London drives back upside. We're
now at the 20-day on the mean reversion.

248
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
now at the 20-day on the mean reversion.
 

249
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,110
now at the 20-day on the mean reversion.
That's the other thing we need to talk

250
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
That's the other thing we need to talk
 

251
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,790
That's the other thing we need to talk
about. We're right back at the mean of

252
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
about. We're right back at the mean of
 

253
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,150
about. We're right back at the mean of
the Ballingers. So maybe if we uh just

254
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
the Ballingers. So maybe if we uh just
 

255
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,670
the Ballingers. So maybe if we uh just
talk about this a minute, we're right

256
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
talk about this a minute, we're right
 

257
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,110
talk about this a minute, we're right
back at the mean. If we think about

258
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
back at the mean. If we think about
 

259
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,030
back at the mean. If we think about
where the Ballingers are, right? Failed

260
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
where the Ballingers are, right? Failed
 

261
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,350
where the Ballingers are, right? Failed
to find acceptance underneath it. Top

262
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
to find acceptance underneath it. Top
 

263
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,310
to find acceptance underneath it. Top
Ballinger here, mean here. So 50% move

264
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
Ballinger here, mean here. So 50% move
 

265
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,350
Ballinger here, mean here. So 50% move
to here, 50% move to here, or 100% each

266
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
to here, 50% move to here, or 100% each
 

267
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,470
to here, 50% move to here, or 100% each
side, however you want to think about

268
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
side, however you want to think about
 

269
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,550
side, however you want to think about
that. All right, this is your range.

270
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
that. All right, this is your range.
 

271
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,310
that. All right, this is your range.
We've got room in the upside. We've

272
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
We've got room in the upside. We've
 

273
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,990
We've got room in the upside. We've
already covered the downside. So we're

274
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
already covered the downside. So we're
 

275
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,430
already covered the downside. So we're
right back to the mean.

276
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
right back to the mean.
 

277
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,230
right back to the mean.
Okay, going into the lower time frame

278
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
Okay, going into the lower time frame
 

279
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,069
Okay, going into the lower time frame
charts now.

280
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079

 

281
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,670

Uh

282
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,680
Uh
 

283
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,590
Uh
this right here is a node. This gray box

284
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
this right here is a node. This gray box
 

285
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,750
this right here is a node. This gray box
is our gap. If you want to mark out any

286
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
is our gap. If you want to mark out any
 

287
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,949
is our gap. If you want to mark out any
of these levels, I'll leave them here

288
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959
of these levels, I'll leave them here
 

289
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,389
of these levels, I'll leave them here
for you. But you can see this is the

290
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:36,399
for you. But you can see this is the
 

291
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,949
for you. But you can see this is the
strong support right now. Sort of five

292
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
strong support right now. Sort of five
 

293
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,990
strong support right now. Sort of five
520s down to 450s is a level of interest

294
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
520s down to 450s is a level of interest
 

295
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,310
520s down to 450s is a level of interest
for me. If they are willing to hold bids

296
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
for me. If they are willing to hold bids
 

297
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,870
for me. If they are willing to hold bids
down there or even if they're willing to

298
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
down there or even if they're willing to
 

299
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,550
down there or even if they're willing to
hold this previous week value and old

300
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
hold this previous week value and old
 

301
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,470
hold this previous week value and old
gap and then we're looking for that move

302
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
gap and then we're looking for that move
 

303
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,269
gap and then we're looking for that move
to 900. If we lose this, all right, if

304
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
to 900. If we lose this, all right, if
 

305
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,790
to 900. If we lose this, all right, if
we well, if we lose this, there's

306
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
we well, if we lose this, there's
 

307
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,550
we well, if we lose this, there's
probably a filter here. If we lose that,

308
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
probably a filter here. If we lose that,
 

309
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,710
probably a filter here. If we lose that,
there's another rotation down. We have

310
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
there's another rotation down. We have
 

311
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,310
there's another rotation down. We have
to be willing to play both sides at the

312

to be willing to play both sides at the
 

313
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,750
to be willing to play both sides at the
moment. It's just the market conditions

314
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:01,760
moment. It's just the market conditions
 

315
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,590

we're in. That's the market conditions
 

317
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,350
we're in. That's the market conditions
we're in. All right, let's have a look

318
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,360
we're in. All right, let's have a look
 

319
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,949
we're in. All right, let's have a look
at the ES and the ETFs, which are going

320
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
at the ES and the ETFs, which are going
 

321
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,190
at the ES and the ETFs, which are going
to look very, very similar.

322
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200

 

323
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,190

Same story here on the ES. If we just

324
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
Same story here on the ES. If we just
 

325
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,629
Same story here on the ES. If we just
think about this pivot we talked about

326
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
think about this pivot we talked about
 

327
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,550
think about this pivot we talked about
the whole time, this kind of pivot level

328
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560
the whole time, this kind of pivot level
 

329
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,949
the whole time, this kind of pivot level
here, right? Here's the Trump news.

00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959
here, right? Here's the Trump news.
 

331
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,629
here, right? Here's the Trump news.
Here's the pullback. We hold the pivot.

332
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
Here's the pullback. We hold the pivot.
 

333
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,110
Here's the pullback. We hold the pivot.
We hold it twice. We're now bullish and

334
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
We hold it twice. We're now bullish and
 

335
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,629
We hold it twice. We're now bullish and

336
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
they're trying to complete gap fill. Gap
 

337
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,230

fill for ES, by the way, is going to be

339
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,629

up into here. 976. So, it's not quite

340
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:28,639
up into here. 976. So, it's not quite
 

341
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,310
up into here. 976. So, it's not quite
there yet, but it's not far away. So,

343
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,230
there yet, but it's not far away. So,
yeah, we have to watch that. Let's set a

00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,240
yeah, we have to watch that. Let's set a

All right. Oh, I don't know what that

talking about on the cues where we have
this box. All right. Most of the box is

382
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:23,519
this box. All right. Most of the box is
 

383
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,829
this box. All right. Most of the box is
sort of 930.

00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:25,839
sort of 930.
 

385

00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
volume is trapped in there. So, do we
 

391
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,790
volume is trapped in there. So, do we
reject this and rotate that down or are

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:36,800
reject this and rotate that down or are
 

393

reject this and rotate that down or are
we going to hold and just do one of

we going to hold and just do one of
 

395
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,110
we going to hold and just do one of
these again and build out for a week or

396
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,120
these again and build out for a week or
 

397
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,550
these again and build out for a week or
two into earnings and then you know

398
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560
two into earnings and then you know
 

399
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,870
two into earnings and then you know
what's coming after that if we're able

400
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
what's coming after that if we're able
 

401
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,030
what's coming after that if we're able
to do it. So, all to play for. Same

Taking uh pressure off the market. We
 

417
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,790
Taking uh pressure off the market. We
zoom out of here. All right, we need to

418

zoom out of here. All right, we need to
 

419
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,150
zoom out of here. All right, we need to
see is the Dixie now going to collapse

420
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
see is the Dixie now going to collapse
 

421
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,910
see is the Dixie now going to collapse
and break down or is it going to try and

422
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920
and break down or is it going to try and
 

423
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,430
and break down or is it going to try and
reclaim this same range?

424
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,440
reclaim this same range?
 

425
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,590
reclaim this same range?
VIX got absolutely smoked. All right,

426
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:15,600
VIX got absolutely smoked. All right,
 

427
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,110
VIX got absolutely smoked. All right,
back down into this old pivot. So, we

428
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,120
back down into this old pivot. So, we
 

429
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,710
back down into this old pivot. So, we
can make this blue again. All right, so

430
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
can make this blue again. All right, so
 

431
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,790
can make this blue again. All right, so
that big spike up on VIX got sold into

432
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
that big spike up on VIX got sold into
 

433
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,629
that big spike up on VIX got sold into
these now turned to resistance levels

434
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:22,639
these now turned to resistance levels
 

435
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,150
these now turned to resistance levels
because we traded through them the other

436
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
because we traded through them the other
 

437
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,310
because we traded through them the other
way. You can see how I trade all the

438
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:26,320
way. You can see how I trade all the
 

439
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,389
way. You can see how I trade all the
levels become important all the time and

440
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:28,399
levels become important all the time and
 

441
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,069
levels become important all the time and
we are probably back into sort of some

442
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:30,079
we are probably back into sort of some
 

443
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,310
we are probably back into sort of some
form of trend here on VIX. So, we had

444
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320
form of trend here on VIX. So, we had
 

445
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,150
form of trend here on VIX. So, we had
this channel. We had a channel breakout.

446
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
this channel. We had a channel breakout.
 

447
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,670
this channel. We had a channel breakout.
All right. And we're back into channel.

448
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
All right. And we're back into channel.
 

449
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,310
All right. And we're back into channel.
So, all the time VIX keeps fading under

450
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320
So, all the time VIX keeps fading under
 

451
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,910
So, all the time VIX keeps fading under
these key levels. It's already filled

452
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
these key levels. It's already filled
 

453
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,750
these key levels. It's already filled
its gap pretty much. If we get down into

454
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:43,760
its gap pretty much. If we get down into
 

455
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,189
its gap pretty much. If we get down into
these, it just means the market's going

456
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:45,199
these, it just means the market's going
 

457
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,150
these, it just means the market's going
to continue to squeeze up.

458
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
to continue to squeeze up.
 

459
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,870
to continue to squeeze up.
All right. MAG, how we doing for time?

460
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:50,880
All right. MAG, how we doing for time?
 

461
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,230
All right. MAG, how we doing for time?
Not too bad. I got to get a bit of a

462
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240
Not too bad. I got to get a bit of a
 

463
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,230
Not too bad. I got to get a bit of a
move on here. Apple finding a bid

464
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240

right. Gap is all the way up here to
 

471
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,430
right. Gap is all the way up here to
55s. We gapped down on Tuesday. We lost

472
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
55s. We gapped down on Tuesday. We lost

haven't even got back up there, but we
 

477
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,189
haven't even got back up there, but we
are inside previous day's range right

are inside previous day's range right
 

479
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,949

809
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,270

Seeing some selling here on the tape. So

810
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,280
Seeing some selling here on the tape. So
 

811
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,270
Seeing some selling here on the tape. So
underneath current or previous week

812
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,280
underneath current or previous week
 

813
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,190
underneath current or previous week
value

814
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,200
value
 

815
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,510
value
there. It's possible move down to 53s if

816
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:25,520
there. It's possible move down to 53s if
 

817
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,350
there. It's possible move down to 53s if
they really want it. And below why is

818
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,360
they really want it. And below why is
 

819
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,510
they really want it. And below why is
the weekly developing profile way way

820
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,520
the weekly developing profile way way
 

821
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,430
the weekly developing profile way way
lower. Right. Here's lower time frame

822
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,440
lower. Right. Here's lower time frame
 

823
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,310
lower. Right. Here's lower time frame
algo tag.

824
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,320
algo tag.
 

825
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,070
algo tag.
So, previous day high is down here into

826
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080
So, previous day high is down here into
 

827
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,909
So, previous day high is down here into
50s. VWAP is hanging out underneath.

828
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:39,919
50s. VWAP is hanging out underneath.
 

829
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,750
50s. VWAP is hanging out underneath.
We can move significantly lower if they

830
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:41,760
We can move significantly lower if they
 

831
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,350
We can move significantly lower if they
really want to, but I'd imagine they'll

832
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:43,360
really want to, but I'd imagine they'll
 

833
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,029
really want to, but I'd imagine they'll
look for a sweep in a bit, but we will

834
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:45,039
look for a sweep in a bit, but we will
 

835
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,990
look for a sweep in a bit, but we will
see.

potential trigger if we're going to
 

927
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,510

Make sure that lines up. Yeah. 699. We

938
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:08,559
Make sure that lines up. Yeah. 699. We
 

939
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,110
Make sure that lines up. Yeah. 699. We
go. It's still not through that value

940
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,120
go. It's still not through that value
 

941
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,190
go. It's still not through that value
yet.

942
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:15,200

 

943
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:26,310

Still rejecting so far. So no trigger.

944
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:26,320

 

945
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,190

still rejecting previous week value.

946
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,200

 

947
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,110

If we get very heavy here and start to

948
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,120
If we get very heavy here and start to
 

949
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,549
If we get very heavy here and start to
get underneath the week before

950
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:36,559
get underneath the week before
 

951
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,350
get underneath the week before
650. Yeah, if we trade start trading

952
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,360
650. Yeah, if we trade start trading
 

953
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,190
650. Yeah, if we trade start trading
under 650 aggressively, there is

954
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,200
under 650 aggressively, there is
 

955
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,789
under 650 aggressively, there is
potentially the move back down to these

956
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:42,799
potentially the move back down to these
 

957
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,430
potentially the move back down to these
sort of 500s and 480s. So that's the

958
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:45,440
sort of 500s and 480s. So that's the
 

959
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,110
sort of 500s and 480s. So that's the
other side of it. If they really start

960
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,120
other side of it. If they really start
 

961
00:26:47,120 --> 00:27:23,750
other side of it. If they really start
getting aggressive under 650

962
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:23,760

 

963
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,070

Okay.

964
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,080
Okay.
 

965
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,789
Okay.
So, I'm just watching the hourly here

966
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:28,799
So, I'm just watching the hourly here
 

967
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,710
So, I'm just watching the hourly here
and see like where we've got stuck and

968
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:30,720
and see like where we've got stuck and
 

969
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,230
and see like where we've got stuck and
where we'd need to find acceptance. We

970
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,240
where we'd need to find acceptance. We
 

971
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,029
where we'd need to find acceptance. We
just went over this pre-market, right?

972
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:35,039
just went over this pre-market, right?
 

973
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,710
just went over this pre-market, right?
So, if it's going to find acceptance,

974
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:36,720
So, if it's going to find acceptance,
 

975
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,190
So, if it's going to find acceptance,
it's got to reclaim this to do this. If

976
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,200
it's got to reclaim this to do this. If
 

977
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,230
it's got to reclaim this to do this. If
it keeps rejecting this, this here is

978
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:42,240
it keeps rejecting this, this here is
 

979
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,830
it keeps rejecting this, this here is
the next level where they might want to

980
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:43,840
the next level where they might want to
 

981
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,350
the next level where they might want to
bid off. So, you have to be careful

982
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,360
bid off. So, you have to be careful
 

983
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,830
bid off. So, you have to be careful
here. Be willing to like watch this both

984
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:47,840
here. Be willing to like watch this both
 

985
00:27:47,840 --> 00:28:05,990
here. Be willing to like watch this both
ways while they make up their minds.

986
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,000

 

987
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,990

Lots of selling coming down here and not

988
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,000
Lots of selling coming down here and not
 

989
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,230
Lots of selling coming down here and not
getting that flush yet.

990
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:10,240
getting that flush yet.
 

991
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,149
getting that flush yet.
They're still bidding at 650. Still

992
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:12,159
They're still bidding at 650. Still
 

993
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,430
They're still bidding at 650. Still
waiting to get filled. Have they moved

994
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:13,440
waiting to get filled. Have they moved
 

995
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,190
waiting to get filled. Have they moved
any lower? There's some at 635s. So into

996
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:17,200
any lower? There's some at 635s. So into
 

997
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,830
any lower? There's some at 635s. So into
VWAP we come then. So this is the 650.

998
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:19,840
VWAP we come then. So this is the 650.
 

999
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,350
VWAP we come then. So this is the 650.
This is where we expected it to go.

1000
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360
This is where we expected it to go.
 

1001
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,510
This is where we expected it to go.
Previous day high and VWAP. The question

1002
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:23,520
Previous day high and VWAP. The question
 

1003
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,190
Previous day high and VWAP. The question
is do they bid here or we going to see a

1004
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:25,200
is do they bid here or we going to see a
 

1005
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,110
is do they bid here or we going to see a
bigger flush now all the way down into

1006
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,120
bigger flush now all the way down into
 

1007
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,750
bigger flush now all the way down into
these levels? Very very very possible

1008
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:29,760
these levels? Very very very possible
 

1009
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:36,149
these levels? Very very very possible
that they do that.

1010
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:36,159

 

1011
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,430

So all the selling started at 670. So

1012
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,440
So all the selling started at 670. So
 

1013
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,990
So all the selling started at 670. So
670 down to this level now is all sell

1014
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,000
670 down to this level now is all sell
 

1015
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,070
670 down to this level now is all sell
side. All right. It is all aggressive

1016
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,080
side. All right. It is all aggressive
 

1017
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,070
side. All right. It is all aggressive
selling.

1018
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,080
selling.
 

1019
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,470
selling.
QQQ coming into a pivot. So they have

1020
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:48,480
QQQ coming into a pivot. So they have
 

1021
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,389
QQQ coming into a pivot. So they have
got a chance to bid off here buyers if

1022
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:50,399
got a chance to bid off here buyers if
 

1023
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,990
got a chance to bid off here buyers if
they want. Where we are now. Did we just

1024
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,000
they want. Where we are now. Did we just
 

1025
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,230
they want. Where we are now. Did we just
sweep? Yes, we've swept. So a reclaim

1026
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:54,240
sweep? Yes, we've swept. So a reclaim
 

1027
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,870
sweep? Yes, we've swept. So a reclaim
now. They've got a chance. If they stay

1028
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:56,880
now. They've got a chance. If they stay
 

1029
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,029
now. They've got a chance. If they stay
heavy versus 650, then I would imagine

1030
00:28:59,029 --> 00:28:59,039
heavy versus 650, then I would imagine
 

1031
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,549
heavy versus 650, then I would imagine
we come down here. But if they start

1032
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:00,559
we come down here. But if they start
 

1033
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,230
we come down here. But if they start
reclaiming, definitely if they reclaim

1034
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:02,240
reclaiming, definitely if they reclaim
 

1035
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,590
reclaiming, definitely if they reclaim
up here, it's going to be a giant

1036
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:03,600
up here, it's going to be a giant
 

1037
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,950
up here, it's going to be a giant
squeeze over 670 probably. So buyers

1038
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:06,960
squeeze over 670 probably. So buyers
 

1039
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,110
squeeze over 670 probably. So buyers
came in over 670, sellers came in under

1040
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,120
came in over 670, sellers came in under
 

1041
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,110
came in over 670, sellers came in under
670. That's kind of your level at the

1042
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,120
670. That's kind of your level at the
 

1043
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,190
670. That's kind of your level at the
moment that they're dictating which way

1044
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,200
moment that they're dictating which way
 

1045
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,029
moment that they're dictating which way
we go. So still just waiting to see what

1046
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:15,039
we go. So still just waiting to see what
 

1047
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,590
we go. So still just waiting to see what
they want to do here.

1048
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:19,600

 

1049
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,669

Let's put some volume on here as well.

1050
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:25,679

 

1051
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,389

There we go. That probably lines up

1052
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:28,399
There we go. That probably lines up
 

1053
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,909
There we go. That probably lines up
pretty well. Yeah, not bad to that 670.

1054
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:31,919
pretty well. Yeah, not bad to that 670.
 

1055
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,549
pretty well. Yeah, not bad to that 670.
Okay, watching here.

1056
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:34,559
Okay, watching here.
 

1057
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:41,029
Okay, watching here.
Here's the drive.

1058
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:41,039

 

1059
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,789

I still adding liquidity lower at the

1060
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:42,799
I still adding liquidity lower at the
 

1061
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,269
I still adding liquidity lower at the
moment.

1062
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:45,279
moment.
 

1063
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,510
moment.
We are definitely not able to get back

1064
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:47,520
We are definitely not able to get back
 

1065
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,669
We are definitely not able to get back
over those 670s yet. We are holding

1066
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:49,679
over those 670s yet. We are holding
 

1067
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,389
over those 670s yet. We are holding
around the VWAP. ES

1068
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:52,399
around the VWAP. ES
 

1069
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,510
around the VWAP. ES

sellers will want to defend this to
complete a rotation down here. I'm going

1094
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,000
complete a rotation down here. I'm going
 

1095
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,430
complete a rotation down here. I'm going
to wait to see how we act here. Would

1096
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:31,440
to wait to see how we act here. Would
 

1097
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,190
to wait to see how we act here. Would
not be surprised to see a squeeze up

1098
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:33,200
not be surprised to see a squeeze up
 

1099
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,470
not be surprised to see a squeeze up
today, but just waiting at the moment

1100
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:36,480
today, but just waiting at the moment
 

1101
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,310
today, but just waiting at the moment
coming into these levels now. They're

1102
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,320
coming into these levels now. They're
 

1103
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,310
coming into these levels now. They're
approaching it and do they resell this?

1104
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,320
approaching it and do they resell this?
 

1105
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,389
approaching it and do they resell this?
Do we see some sellers step in here and

1106
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:42,399
Do we see some sellers step in here and
 

1107
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,310
Do we see some sellers step in here and
slap this back down or not? ES trying to

1108
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,320
slap this back down or not? ES trying to
 

1109
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,870
slap this back down or not? ES trying to
reclaim it New York open as well. So,

1110
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:46,880
reclaim it New York open as well. So,
 

1111
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,029
reclaim it New York open as well. So,
this is a good drive now into the 70s.

1112
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:49,039
this is a good drive now into the 70s.
 

1113
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,310
this is a good drive now into the 70s.
Watching here to see if we're going to

1114
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:50,320
Watching here to see if we're going to
 

1115
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,909
Watching here to see if we're going to
go through this PC and start to be

1116
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:51,919
go through this PC and start to be
 

1117
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,230
go through this PC and start to be
aggressive.

1118
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:56,240

 

1119
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,389

They trigger this long back upside here.

1120
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:58,399
They trigger this long back upside here.
 

1121
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,990
They trigger this long back upside here.
If the next dip holds, I'm going to join

1122
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,000
If the next dip holds, I'm going to join
 

1123
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,630
If the next dip holds, I'm going to join
long for a squeeze back up towards 95

1124
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:02,640
long for a squeeze back up towards 95
 

1125
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,750
long for a squeeze back up towards 95
and then see if we can get through

1126
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:03,760
and then see if we can get through
 

1127
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,029
and then see if we can get through
value. Here we go.

1128
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:07,039
value. Here we go.
 

1129
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:12,870
value. Here we go.
Are you going to fill on a dip?

1130
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:12,880

 

1131
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,389

What's this buyer doing here? Just want

1132
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:14,399
What's this buyer doing here? Just want
 

1133
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:15,830
What's this buyer doing here? Just want
to be careful. This buyer is faking

1134
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:15,840
to be careful. This buyer is faking
 

1135
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,230
to be careful. This buyer is faking
around 70. He's just pulled his order to

1136
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,240
around 70. He's just pulled his order to
 

1137
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,029
around 70. He's just pulled his order to
55. Not in yet. Was very, very close to

1138
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:21,039
55. Not in yet. Was very, very close to
 

1139
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,630
55. Not in yet. Was very, very close to
buying there and then didn't like what I

1140
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:22,640
buying there and then didn't like what I
 

1141
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,230
buying there and then didn't like what I
saw on the tape.

1142
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:24,240
saw on the tape.
 

1143
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,830
saw on the tape.
Someone's spoofing.

1144
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:27,840

 

1145
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,590

All right, into value area low. So maybe

1146
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:29,600
All right, into value area low. So maybe
 

1147
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,789
All right, into value area low. So maybe
they rebid 50 here.

1148
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:32,799
they rebid 50 here.
 

1149
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,950
they rebid 50 here.
Still no trade. Watching carefully. I'm

1150
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:34,960
Still no trade. Watching carefully. I'm
 

1151
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,710
Still no trade. Watching carefully. I'm
interested.

1152
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,720
interested.
 

1153
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,549
interested.
Yeah, they bid in front of 50. So this

1154
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:38,559
Yeah, they bid in front of 50. So this
 

1155
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,110
Yeah, they bid in front of 50. So this
buyer stepped in this time at 60. So 60

1156
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,120
buyer stepped in this time at 60. So 60
 

1157
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,509
buyer stepped in this time at 60. So 60
to 85 is the rotation. Squeeze will

1158
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:43,519
to 85 is the rotation. Squeeze will
 

1159
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,430
to 85 is the rotation. Squeeze will
happen over

1160
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:45,440
happen over
 

1161
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:53,669
happen over
probably 80. Definitely over 90.

1162
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:53,679

 

1163
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,750

Is this buy legit? It keeps up bidding

1164
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:55,760
Is this buy legit? It keeps up bidding
 

1165
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,110
Is this buy legit? It keeps up bidding
and then pulling. It just pulled again,

1166
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,120
and then pulling. It just pulled again,
 

1167
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,789
and then pulling. It just pulled again,
flashed and pulled, flashed again, and

1168

flashed and pulled, flashed again, and
 

1169
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,549
flashed and pulled, flashed again, and
then came in on the market. What is

1170
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:00,559
then came in on the market. What is
 

1171
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,990

1176
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:07,039
Here we go. So, into the 700s. Can we
 

1177
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,430
Here we go. So, into the 700s. Can we
get acceptance over that now? If we can

1178
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:09,440
get acceptance over that now? If we can
 

1179
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,950
get acceptance over that now? If we can
get acceptance over that, we're going to

1180
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:10,960
get acceptance over that, we're going to
 

1181
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,190
get acceptance over that, we're going to
start rocketing.

1182
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,200
start rocketing.
 

1183
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,070
start rocketing.
ES going for higher day, which is great.

1184
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,080
ES going for higher day, which is great.
 

1185
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,750
ES going for higher day, which is great.
Come on. We got to get back over 700s

1186
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:17,760
Come on. We got to get back over 700s
 

1187
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,190
Come on. We got to get back over 700s
and then start squeezing. We need to go

1188
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:19,200
and then start squeezing. We need to go
 

1189
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,350
and then start squeezing. We need to go
back over previous week value if we're

1190
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:21,360
back over previous week value if we're
 

1191
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,470
back over previous week value if we're
going to really start squeezing. So,

1192
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,480
going to really start squeezing. So,
 

1193
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,110
going to really start squeezing. So,
I'll trim some into this just in case.

1194
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,120
I'll trim some into this just in case.
 

1195
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,190
I'll trim some into this just in case.
Long from 62 at the moment. It might

1196
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,200
Long from 62 at the moment. It might
 

1197
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:40,230
Long from 62 at the moment. It might
come all the way back down.

1198
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:40,240

 

1199
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:53,110

Make your mind up.

1200

1201
00:32:53,120 --> 00:33:01,269

big trading day. Zoom this in.

00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:01,279

 

1203
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,630

We're still holding pivots. Well,

1204
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:02,640
We're still holding pivots. Well,
 

1205
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,269
We're still holding pivots. Well,
holding 20-day well on QQQ. I think we

1206
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:05,279
holding 20-day well on QQQ. I think we
 

1207
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,590
holding 20-day well on QQQ. I think we
want to go back above value area low

1208
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:07,600
want to go back above value area low
 

1209
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,750
want to go back above value area low
here to squeeze. If we get back above

1210
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:09,760
here to squeeze. If we get back above
 

1211
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,110
here to squeeze. If we get back above
this, we will squeeze. Obviously, if we

1212
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,120
this, we will squeeze. Obviously, if we
 

1213
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,710
this, we will squeeze. Obviously, if we
get new over New York open

1214
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:14,720
get new over New York open
 

1215
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,470
get new over New York open

60 is the level where buyers keep buying
dips at the moment. If that breaks, then

1218
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:19,440
dips at the moment. If that breaks, then
 

1219
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,549
dips at the moment. If that breaks, then
we're going to see more of a flush.

1220
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:20,559
we're going to see more of a flush.
 

1221

If ES can get going for the gap fill,

1228
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:30,320
If ES can get going for the gap fill,
 

1229
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,470
If ES can get going for the gap fill,
then Q's might find a bid with this.

1230
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:32,480
then Q's might find a bid with this.

1281
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,790
to get acceptance lower, there is room
for a full rotation. It's why it cannot

1282
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:48,800
for a full rotation. It's why it cannot
 

1283
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,829
for a full rotation. It's why it cannot
just be uh willing to force in. I'm

1287
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,950
really I want to see the flow zones
turn. I'll start adding heavy above here

1288
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:54,960
turn. I'll start adding heavy above here
 

1289
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,349
turn. I'll start adding heavy above here
if we start supporting bids back up, but

1290
00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:57,359
if we start supporting bids back up, but
 

1291

1297
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:11,270

not a good look.

break through 50s and 60s to squeeze up

1408
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,040
break through 50s and 60s to squeeze up
 

1409
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,670
break through 50s and 60s to squeeze up
to 90s. Here they go. They're trying.

1410
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:45,680
to 90s. Here they go. They're trying.
 

1411
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,109
to 90s. Here they go. They're trying.
They're trying to get back into value.

1412
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:47,119
They're trying to get back into value.
 

1413
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,030
They're trying to get back into value.
Low volume node here is being protected

1414
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,040
Low volume node here is being protected
 

1415
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,470
Low volume node here is being protected
so far. They need to get through that

1416
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:50,480
so far. They need to get through that
 

1417
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,750
so far. They need to get through that
for that squeeze up. It's being

1418
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:51,760
for that squeeze up. It's being

coming in here and getting caught so

1422
00:38:55,109 --> 00:38:55,119
coming in here and getting caught so
 

1423
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:02,310
coming in here and getting caught so
far.

1424
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,320

 

1425
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:12,870

This is ugly start to the day.

1426
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:12,880

 

1427
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,310

I'm starting to wonder if I should have

1428
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:14,320
I'm starting to wonder if I should have
 

1429
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,230
I'm starting to wonder if I should have
just sold 50s when I said if we flip

1430
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:16,240
just sold 50s when I said if we flip
 

1431
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,750
just sold 50s when I said if we flip
50s, we should probably sell for that

1432
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:17,760
50s, we should probably sell for that
 

1433
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,190
50s, we should probably sell for that
move all the way down. I'm starting to

1434
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,200
move all the way down. I'm starting to
 

1435
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,550
move all the way down. I'm starting to
wonder if I'm going to regret this. And

1436
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:20,560
wonder if I'm going to regret this. And
 

1437
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,589
wonder if I'm going to regret this. And
we're going to come all the way down

1438
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:21,599
we're going to come all the way down
 

1439
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,069
we're going to come all the way down
now. That might be a miss. Did talk

1440
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:26,079
now. That might be a miss. Did talk
 

1441
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,829
now. That might be a miss. Did talk
about it. That might have been the miss

1442
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:27,839
about it. That might have been the miss
 

1443
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,190
about it. That might have been the miss
of the day. Oh my gosh. Is this going to

1444
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:31,200
of the day. Oh my gosh. Is this going to
 

1445
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,190
of the day. Oh my gosh. Is this going to
be three days in a row, Alex, where you

1446
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200
be three days in a row, Alex, where you
 

1447
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,349
be three days in a row, Alex, where you
miss a big trade.

1448
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:35,359
miss a big trade.
 

1449
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,910
miss a big trade.
I think it is. I think it is. I think

1450
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:37,920
I think it is. I think it is. I think
 

1451
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,430
I think it is. I think it is. I think
I've just missed that. I said got to be

1452
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:39,440
I've just missed that. I said got to be
 

1453
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,589
I've just missed that. I said got to be
willing to flip by if we lose 50s. I

1454
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:41,599
willing to flip by if we lose 50s. I
 

1455
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,950
willing to flip by if we lose 50s. I
didn't take that re rebid back in for a

1456
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:44,960
didn't take that re rebid back in for a
 

1457
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,990
didn't take that re rebid back in for a
sale. And I feel like I'm about to

1458
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,000
sale. And I feel like I'm about to
 

1459
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,077
sale. And I feel like I'm about to
regret that big time.

1460
00:39:52,077 --> 00:39:52,087

 

1461
00:39:52,087 --> 00:39:53,589

[sighs]

1462
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:53,599

1463
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,670
[sighs]
Man,

1464
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:57,680

 

1465
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,430

that might sting. If we're going to fade

1466
00:39:59,430 --> 00:39:59,440
that might sting. If we're going to fade
 

1467
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:14,950
that might sting. If we're going to fade
all day, that's going to really sting.

1468
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:14,960

 

1469
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:30,390

Annoyed myself. Annoyed myself.

1470
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:30,400

 

1471
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,150

Did anyone take that short for that 50

1472
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,160
Did anyone take that short for that 50
 

1473
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,510
Did anyone take that short for that 50
flip? I think you're going to get a fade

1474
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:33,520
flip? I think you're going to get a fade
 

1475
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:33,990
flip? I think you're going to get a fade
now.

1476
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,000
now.
 

1477
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,928
now.

Jeez Louise.

Jeez Louise.
All right, sellers came in at 610.

All right, sellers came in at 610.
 

1485
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,990
All right, sellers came in at 610.
That's the level that sellers want to

1486

That's the level that sellers want to
 

1487
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,270
That's the level that sellers want to
defend right now. They came in at 610.

1488
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:55,280
defend right now. They came in at 610.
 

1489

Uh that's your opening range. So if we

1490
00:40:57,349 --> 00:40:57,359
Uh that's your opening range. So if we
 

1491
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,630
Uh that's your opening range. So if we
get back inside the opening range,

1492
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:58,640
get back inside the opening range,
 

1493
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,750
get back inside the opening range,
there's a squeeze. Otherwise, you're

1494
00:40:59,750 --> 00:40:59,760
there's a squeeze. Otherwise, you're
 

1495
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,109
there's a squeeze. Otherwise, you're
looking for downside pressure all the

1496
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:01,119
looking for downside pressure all the
 

1497
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,390
looking for downside pressure all the
way down into here now.

1498
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:04,400
way down into here now.
 

1499
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,430
way down into here now.
All the way down into there.

1500
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:09,440

 

1501
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,430

Yeah, nice. Nice you guys who did it. I

1502
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:11,440
Yeah, nice. Nice you guys who did it. I
 

1503
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,230
Yeah, nice. Nice you guys who did it. I
mean, I called it just that's when I get

1504
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:14,240
mean, I called it just that's when I get
 

1505
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,670
mean, I called it just that's when I get
very upset. This is what happens when

1506
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:15,680
very upset. This is what happens when
 

1507
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,670
very upset. This is what happens when
it's three days in a row. Now I probably

1508
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:17,680
it's three days in a row. Now I probably
 

1509
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,230
it's three days in a row. Now I probably
can't trade for the rest of the day. I

1510
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:20,240
can't trade for the rest of the day. I
 

1511
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,910
can't trade for the rest of the day. I
need to be very careful. I said it

1512
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:21,920
need to be very careful. I said it
 

1513
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,390
need to be very careful. I said it
yesterday. Missed the fade. Tuesday,

1514
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:24,400
yesterday. Missed the fade. Tuesday,
 

1515
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,710
yesterday. Missed the fade. Tuesday,
three attempts. Yesterday, the same

three attempts. Yesterday, the same
 

1517
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,150
three attempts. Yesterday, the same
thing. And now I've just called it and

1518
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:28,160
thing. And now I've just called it and
 

1519
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,589
thing. And now I've just called it and
hesitated and missed it. What happens

1520
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:29,599
hesitated and missed it. What happens
 

1521
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,030
hesitated and missed it. What happens
when you hesitate? You miss you miss

1522
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,040
when you hesitate? You miss you miss
 

1523
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,670
when you hesitate? You miss you miss
good moves.

1524
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:35,680

 

1525
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,670

Is what it is. is what it is. All right,

1526
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:37,680
Is what it is. is what it is. All right,
 

1527

Is what it is. is what it is. All right,
Vick's coming back up to that pivot

1528
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:40,720
Vick's coming back up to that pivot
 

1529
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,550
Vick's coming back up to that pivot
and previous day value area high will be

1530
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:42,560
and previous day value area high will be
 

1531
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,150
and previous day value area high will be
your target. Now, if you can fade all

1532
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:44,160
your target. Now, if you can fade all
 

1533
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,550
your target. Now, if you can fade all
the way down, you'd be looking for this

1534
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:46,560
the way down, you'd be looking for this
 

1535
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,309
the way down, you'd be looking for this
block down here. I wouldn't be looking

1536
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:48,319
block down here. I wouldn't be looking
 

1537
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,990
block down here. I wouldn't be looking
for a fade under that. I'd be looking to

1538
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:50,000
for a fade under that. I'd be looking to
 

1539
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,829
for a fade under that. I'd be looking to
cover into those areas. All right,

1540
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:51,839
cover into those areas. All right,
 

1541
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,270
cover into those areas. All right,
covering into those areas. They're still

1542
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:53,280
covering into those areas. They're still
 

1543
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,589
covering into those areas. They're still
selling these lows here

1544
00:41:57,589 --> 00:41:57,599

 

1545
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,190

and obviously cover on the way down.

1546
00:41:59,190 --> 00:41:59,200
and obviously cover on the way down.
 

1547
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,990
and obviously cover on the way down.
This is a pretty good move. You're what,

1548
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:02,000
This is a pretty good move. You're what,
 

1549
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,390
This is a pretty good move. You're what,
80 points up from that 50s already.

1550
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:06,400
80 points up from that 50s already.
 

1551
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,589
80 points up from that 50s already.
And you're probably going to get they're

00:42:07,589 --> 00:42:07,599
And you're probably going to get they're
 

1553
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,790
And you're probably going to get they're
still bidding at 550 down here.

1554
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:10,800
still bidding at 550 down here.

00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:23,920

 

1563
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,430

Yeah. Well done everyone.

1564
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:27,440
Yeah. Well done everyone.
 

1565
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,270
Yeah. Well done everyone.
Well done everyone.

1566
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:31,280

 

1567
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,030

It's not that hard to flip bias. I said

1568
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:33,040
It's not that hard to flip bias. I said
 

1569
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,109
It's not that hard to flip bias. I said
I had to flip the bias, but it's just

1570
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:35,119
I had to flip the bias, but it's just
 

1571
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,030
I had to flip the bias, but it's just
that I didn't do it. I didn't execute

1572
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,040
that I didn't do it. I didn't execute
 

1573
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,790
that I didn't do it. I didn't execute
it. That's what's annoying. It's not

1574
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:38,800
it. That's what's annoying. It's not
 

1575
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,950
it. That's what's annoying. It's not
money. It's not like money lost. It's

1576
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:40,960
money. It's not like money lost. It's
 

1577
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,950
money. It's not like money lost. It's
It's money missed. Is that right way

1578
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:42,960
It's money missed. Is that right way
 

1579
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,870
It's money missed. Is that right way
putting it? Frustrating. It's

1580
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:44,880
putting it? Frustrating. It's
 

1581
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,790
putting it? Frustrating. It's
frustrating for me knowing that I had it

1582
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:46,800
frustrating for me knowing that I had it
 

1583
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,510
frustrating for me knowing that I had it
planned out and didn't take it. It is

1584
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:49,520
planned out and didn't take it. It is
 

1585
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,990
planned out and didn't take it. It is
what it is. All right. So, we into the

1586
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,000
what it is. All right. So, we into the
 

1587
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,349
what it is. All right. So, we into the
top of this shelf here. We can see this

1588
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:53,359
top of this shelf here. We can see this
 

1589
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:54,710
top of this shelf here. We can see this
like little node here developing.

1590
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:54,720
like little node here developing.
 

1591
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,990
like little node here developing.
Otherwise, they're going to trade up to

1592
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,000
Otherwise, they're going to trade up to
 

1593
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,150
Otherwise, they're going to trade up to
600. So, sellers will want to protect

1594
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,160
600. So, sellers will want to protect
 

1595
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,510
600. So, sellers will want to protect
this load this node around sort of 85.

1596
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:01,520
this load this node around sort of 85.
 

1597
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,870
this load this node around sort of 85.
Otherwise, they're going to see a trade

1598
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:02,880
Otherwise, they're going to see a trade
 

1599
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,470
Otherwise, they're going to see a trade
up to 6 and 610. There's a clear target

1600
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:06,480
up to 6 and 610. There's a clear target
 

1601
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,630
up to 6 and 610. There's a clear target
down here, folks.

1602
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:08,640
down here, folks.
 

1603
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:18,710
down here, folks.
Clear target back down below right now.

1604
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:18,720

 

1605
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,030

I'd watch this node 85. If they scream

1606
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:21,040
I'd watch this node 85. If they scream
 

1607
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,309
I'd watch this node 85. If they scream
through it, they'll come and fill some

1608
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:22,319
through it, they'll come and fill some
 

1609
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:53,430
through it, they'll come and fill some
above.

1610
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:53,440

 

1611
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,990

So, still tapping into this node. You

1612
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:56,000
So, still tapping into this node. You
 

1613
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,390
So, still tapping into this node. You
can see this like top of here. If they

1614
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:58,400
can see this like top of here. If they
 

1615
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,230
can see this like top of here. If they
can defend this, sellers will look to

1616
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:00,240
can defend this, sellers will look to
 

1617
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,990
can defend this, sellers will look to
rotate down. If not, there is a squeeze

1618
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,000
rotate down. If not, there is a squeeze
 

1619
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,390
rotate down. If not, there is a squeeze
back up. Lower time frame squeeze

1620
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:04,400
back up. Lower time frame squeeze
 

1621
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,990
back up. Lower time frame squeeze
obviously. All right. It'll be a lower

1622
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,000
obviously. All right. It'll be a lower
 

1623
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,550
obviously. All right. It'll be a lower
time frame squeeze. And maybe they look

1624
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:08,560
time frame squeeze. And maybe they look
 

1625
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,589
time frame squeeze. And maybe they look
for those sort of 610s kind of levels,

1626
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:11,599
for those sort of 610s kind of levels,
 

1627
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,030
for those sort of 610s kind of levels,
which is what they're trying to do right

1628
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:13,040
which is what they're trying to do right
 

1629
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:19,030
which is what they're trying to do right
now.

1630
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:19,040

 

1631
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,870

Filling [snorts] some of that imbalance.

1632
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:24,880

 

1633
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,309

Here they go. They're going for those

1634
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:26,319
Here they go. They're going for those
 

1635
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,309
Here they go. They're going for those
610s now. We just talked about it.

1636
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:28,319
610s now. We just talked about it.
 

1637
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,589
610s now. We just talked about it.
Here's the 600 test. So through the 85s.

1638
00:44:31,589 --> 00:44:31,599
Here's the 600 test. So through the 85s.
 

1639
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,589
Here's the 600 test. So through the 85s.
I'm grabbing a piece of this up to 610s.

1640
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:33,599
I'm grabbing a piece of this up to 610s.
 

1641
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,470
I'm grabbing a piece of this up to 610s.
And we can watch that orb.

1642
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:36,480
And we can watch that orb.
 

1643
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,829
And we can watch that orb.
All right. And if we get acceptance back

1644
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:37,839
All right. And if we get acceptance back
 

1645
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,270
All right. And if we get acceptance back
through that, it means we don't fill

1646
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:39,280
through that, it means we don't fill
 

1647
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,790
through that, it means we don't fill
this. All right. So we're coming back

1648
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:40,800
this. All right. So we're coming back
 

1649
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,829
this. All right. So we're coming back
towards this level now. This and this.

1650
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:43,839
towards this level now. This and this.
 

1651
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,589
towards this level now. This and this.
Sellers will want to defend this for

1652
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:45,599
Sellers will want to defend this for
 

1653
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,510
Sellers will want to defend this for
this. If they can't and we see this, we

1654
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:47,520
this. If they can't and we see this, we
 

1655
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,750
this. If they can't and we see this, we
go rotation back up. This would be a dip

1656
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:49,760
go rotation back up. This would be a dip
 

1657
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,990
go rotation back up. This would be a dip
which is bought. Uh I would say sellers

1658
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:52,000
which is bought. Uh I would say sellers
 

1659
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,470
which is bought. Uh I would say sellers
are now caught under 73 on the day. All

1660
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:54,480
are now caught under 73 on the day. All
 

1661
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,630
are now caught under 73 on the day. All
right, sellers got caught under 73 on

1662
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:56,640
right, sellers got caught under 73 on
 

1663
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,950
right, sellers got caught under 73 on
the day under here. So, this is the

1664
00:44:58,950 --> 00:44:58,960
the day under here. So, this is the
 

1665
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,950
the day under here. So, this is the
level that buyers must absorb. Sellers

1666
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:00,960
level that buyers must absorb. Sellers
 

1667
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,870
level that buyers must absorb. Sellers
want to get under it. Come on,

1668
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:02,880
want to get under it. Come on,
 

1669
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,670
want to get under it. Come on,
rectangle. Where are you? Right, this is

1670
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:05,680
rectangle. Where are you? Right, this is
 

1671
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,030
rectangle. Where are you? Right, this is
the level where sellers are currently

1672
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:07,040
the level where sellers are currently
 

1673
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,069
the level where sellers are currently
caught underneath.

1674
00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:10,079
caught underneath.
 

1675
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,069
caught underneath.
Oh, Alex.

1676
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:12,079
Oh, Alex.
 

1677
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,630
Oh, Alex.
Well, at least I made some.

1678
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:16,640

 

1679
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,109

Here's 610s. All right, out of this now

1680
00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:19,119
Here's 610s. All right, out of this now
 

1681
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,710
Here's 610s. All right, out of this now
and wait to see if we get acceptance.

1682
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:20,720
and wait to see if we get acceptance.
 

1683
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,150
and wait to see if we get acceptance.
So, managed to lock in a little bit

1684
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,160
So, managed to lock in a little bit
 

1685
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,750
So, managed to lock in a little bit
there. paid myself a little bit on the

1686
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:23,760
there. paid myself a little bit on the
 

1687
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,270
there. paid myself a little bit on the
way up. At least it's better than a kick

1688
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:25,280
way up. At least it's better than a kick
 

1689
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,069
way up. At least it's better than a kick
in the bollocks for the day, but I am

1690
00:45:28,069 --> 00:45:28,079
in the bollocks for the day, but I am
 

1691
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,829
in the bollocks for the day, but I am
upset with myself there. I didn't flip.

1692
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:31,839
upset with myself there. I didn't flip.
 

1693
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:33,670
upset with myself there. I didn't flip.
Okay, back towards the same level that

1694
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:33,680
Okay, back towards the same level that
 

1695
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,270
Okay, back towards the same level that
we sold down from. So, your opening

1696
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:35,280
we sold down from. So, your opening
 

1697
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,150
we sold down from. So, your opening
range now being reclaimed. ES coming

1698
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,160
range now being reclaimed. ES coming
 

1699
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,870
range now being reclaimed. ES coming
into its 24-hour VWAP. Watch this pivot

1700
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:40,880
into its 24-hour VWAP. Watch this pivot
 

1701
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,950
into its 24-hour VWAP. Watch this pivot
very, very carefully on ES. I'd say

1702
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:42,960
very, very carefully on ES. I'd say
 

1703
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,589
very, very carefully on ES. I'd say
46es.

1704
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:45,599
46es.
 

1705
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,589
46es.
VIX getting stuck into that pivot as

1706
00:45:47,589 --> 00:45:47,599
VIX getting stuck into that pivot as
 

1707
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,349
VIX getting stuck into that pivot as
well around the 1625s.

1708
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:51,359
well around the 1625s.
 

1709
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,430
well around the 1625s.
So buyers will want to protect this now

1710
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:53,440
So buyers will want to protect this now
 

1711
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,870
So buyers will want to protect this now
and they will want to get back inside

1712
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:54,880
and they will want to get back inside
 

1713
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,829
and they will want to get back inside
the rotation for the day. That's their

1714
00:45:57,829 --> 00:45:57,839
the rotation for the day. That's their
 

1715
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:03,030
the rotation for the day. That's their
job.

1716
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,040

 

1717
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,910

If we squeeze then we'll need to get ES

1718
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:05,920
If we squeeze then we'll need to get ES
 

1719
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,190
If we squeeze then we'll need to get ES
will need to go through the VW up which

1720
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:07,200
will need to go through the VW up which
 

1721
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,750
will need to go through the VW up which
is not able to do yet and we will need

1722
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:09,760
is not able to do yet and we will need
 

1723
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,670
is not able to do yet and we will need
to reclaim all of these levels above. So

1724
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:11,680
to reclaim all of these levels above. So
 

1725
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,270
to reclaim all of these levels above. So
this is still just a pullback which get

1726
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:13,280
this is still just a pullback which get
 

1727
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,190
this is still just a pullback which get
sold into. Sellers must get it

1728
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:15,200
sold into. Sellers must get it
 

1729
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,990
sold into. Sellers must get it
underneath this gray box here. That's

1730
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:18,000
underneath this gray box here. That's
 

1731
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,550
underneath this gray box here. That's
really where uh the sellers are stuck

1732
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:20,560
really where uh the sellers are stuck
 

1733
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,990
really where uh the sellers are stuck
underneath there. If they can't do that,

1734
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:22,000
underneath there. If they can't do that,
 

1735
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:30,470
underneath there. If they can't do that,
there might be another leg up.

1736
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:30,480

 

1737
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,069

SPY testing the level we broke down

1738
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:32,079
SPY testing the level we broke down
 

1739
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,309
SPY testing the level we broke down
from. QQQ not there yet. So have to pay

1740
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:34,319
from. QQQ not there yet. So have to pay
 

1741
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,870
from. QQQ not there yet. So have to pay
attention to SPY. SPY is reacting very

1742
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:36,880
attention to SPY. SPY is reacting very
 

1743
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,470
attention to SPY. SPY is reacting very
well to the levels. If you look at like

1744
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:38,480
well to the levels. If you look at like
 

1745
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,470
well to the levels. If you look at like
the pre-market low, we've just traded

1746
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:40,480
the pre-market low, we've just traded
 

1747
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,069
the pre-market low, we've just traded
back into it, which is also lower time

1748
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:42,079
back into it, which is also lower time
 

1749
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,750
back into it, which is also lower time
frame algo. It's also previous day high

1750
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:43,760
frame algo. It's also previous day high
 

1751
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,589
frame algo. It's also previous day high
and it's also the 20-day moving average.

1752
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:45,599
and it's also the 20-day moving average.
 

1753
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,030
and it's also the 20-day moving average.
We're not trading through it yet. So

1754
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:47,040
We're not trading through it yet. So
 

1755
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,950
We're not trading through it yet. So
far, there's a reaction from there. Q's

1756
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:48,960
far, there's a reaction from there. Q's
 

1757
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,790
far, there's a reaction from there. Q's
are nowhere near there. Still have

1758
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:50,800
are nowhere near there. Still have
 

1759
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,750
are nowhere near there. Still have
strength.

1760
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:53,760
strength.
 

1761
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,589
strength.
So, inside value. Now, do we go back

1762
00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:55,599
So, inside value. Now, do we go back
 

1763
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:11,349
So, inside value. Now, do we go back
through this node for 40s,

1764
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:11,359

 

1765
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:21,910

volatile market

1766
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:21,920

 

1767
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,829

trying to lift through 20 to go and test

1768
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:23,839
trying to lift through 20 to go and test
 

1769
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,030
trying to lift through 20 to go and test
40 at the moment.

1770
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:25,040
40 at the moment.
 

1771
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,550
40 at the moment.
It's not able to do it. They're stacking

1772
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:26,560
It's not able to do it. They're stacking
 

1773
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,910
It's not able to do it. They're stacking
at 25s to 35s. Bids are at 600 right

1774
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:29,920
at 25s to 35s. Bids are at 600 right
 

1775
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:37,030
at 25s to 35s. Bids are at 600 right
now.

1776
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:37,040

 

1777
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,030

Here we go. They're trying to fill the

1778
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:39,040
Here we go. They're trying to fill the
 

1779
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,190
Here we go. They're trying to fill the
25 now and they should try and get up to

1780
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:41,200
25 now and they should try and get up to
 

1781
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,069
25 now and they should try and get up to
40 if they can. And sellers came in

1782
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:44,079
40 if they can. And sellers came in
 

1783
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,030
40 if they can. And sellers came in
aggressively at 40. 40 to 50 is the next

1784
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,040
aggressively at 40. 40 to 50 is the next
 

1785
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,550
aggressively at 40. 40 to 50 is the next
big node that they will need to trade

1786
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:48,560
big node that they will need to trade
 

1787
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,750
big node that they will need to trade
through these buyers if we're going to

1788
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:49,760
through these buyers if we're going to
 

1789
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,670
through these buyers if we're going to
find acceptance in current days range.

1790
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:51,680
find acceptance in current days range.
 

1791
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,270
find acceptance in current days range.
Obviously, we're outside of previous

1792
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:53,280
Obviously, we're outside of previous
 

1793
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,870
Obviously, we're outside of previous
weak value area low. So, they're going

1794
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:54,880
weak value area low. So, they're going
 

1795
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,150
weak value area low. So, they're going
to want to reclaim all of that if

1796
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:56,160
to want to reclaim all of that if
 

1797
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,190
to want to reclaim all of that if
they're going to be very, very

1798
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:57,200
they're going to be very, very
 

1799
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,430
they're going to be very, very
aggressive today. Until that point,

1800
00:47:59,430 --> 00:47:59,440
aggressive today. Until that point,
 

1801
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,030
aggressive today. Until that point,
technically, we can trade down. And this

1802
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,040
technically, we can trade down. And this
 

1803
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,750
technically, we can trade down. And this
is relief back upside into where these

1804
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:03,760
is relief back upside into where these
 

1805
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,349
is relief back upside into where these
sellers were at 40. All right. This is

1806
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:05,359
sellers were at 40. All right. This is
 

1807
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,710
sellers were at 40. All right. This is
relief back upside into where the

1808
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:06,720
relief back upside into where the
 

1809
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,710
relief back upside into where the
sellers were at 40. We have an imbalance

1810
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:08,720
sellers were at 40. We have an imbalance
 

1811
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:19,750
sellers were at 40. We have an imbalance
at 34,

1812
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:19,760

 

1813
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,270

which they just rejected. There's the

1814
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:21,280
which they just rejected. There's the
 

1815
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,870
which they just rejected. There's the
big sell back down to this gray box.

1816
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:22,880
big sell back down to this gray box.
 

1817
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,230
big sell back down to this gray box.
Remember, this is the key level. This

1818
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:24,240
Remember, this is the key level. This
 

1819
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,270
Remember, this is the key level. This
gray box is your key level,

1820
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:27,280
gray box is your key level,
 

1821
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,790
gray box is your key level,
right? Because we've got sellers stuck

1822
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:28,800
right? Because we've got sellers stuck
 

1823
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,950
right? Because we've got sellers stuck
underneath this gray box. This is your

1824
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:30,960
underneath this gray box. This is your
 

1825
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,470
underneath this gray box. This is your
key level. If we sell through this, then

1826
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:32,480
key level. If we sell through this, then
 

1827
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,750
key level. If we sell through this, then
you're going to see continuation back

1828
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:33,760
you're going to see continuation back
 

1829
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,829
you're going to see continuation back
down to previous day value area high.

1830
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:35,839
down to previous day value area high.
 

1831
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,510
down to previous day value area high.
This is the key level. Now, buyers must

1832
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:37,520
This is the key level. Now, buyers must
 

1833
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,589
This is the key level. Now, buyers must
protect that and sellers must trade

1834
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:39,599
protect that and sellers must trade
 

1835
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:46,549
protect that and sellers must trade
through it.

1836
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:46,559

 

1837
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,990

There are bids lower here.

1838
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:50,000
There are bids lower here.
 

1839
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,950
There are bids lower here.
I'm going to looks like we're going to

1840
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:50,960
I'm going to looks like we're going to
 

1841
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,069
I'm going to looks like we're going to
trade through it at the moment unless

1842
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:52,079
trade through it at the moment unless
 

1843
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,790
trade through it at the moment unless
they get restuck here.

1844
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:54,800
they get restuck here.
 

1845
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:10,790
they get restuck here.
What's this upside for the 605s?

1846
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:10,800

 

1847
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,549

They're adding liquidity much lower now

1848
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:12,559
They're adding liquidity much lower now
 

1849
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,829
They're adding liquidity much lower now
into 530 and 520 all the way down.

1850
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:17,839
into 530 and 520 all the way down.
 

1851
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,430
into 530 and 520 all the way down.
Might very well be that this is sold

1852
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:19,440
Might very well be that this is sold
 

1853
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,990
Might very well be that this is sold
through at this point.

1854
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:24,000

 

1855
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,510

They're adding lots of liquidity for it

1856
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:25,520
They're adding lots of liquidity for it
 

1857
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:32,549
They're adding lots of liquidity for it
to come and take out.

1858
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:32,559

 

1859
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,390

SP didn't get to be up. ES didn't get to

1860
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:34,400
SP didn't get to be up. ES didn't get to
 

1861
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,950
SP didn't get to be up. ES didn't get to
VW up. We are back down into these pivot

1862
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:36,960
VW up. We are back down into these pivot
 

1863
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,630
VW up. We are back down into these pivot
lows

1864
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:38,640

1865
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,109

rejecting pre-market levels on the

rejecting pre-market levels on the
 

1867
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,109
rejecting pre-market levels on the
spiders. QQQ never got there. So, we're

1868
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:43,119

1869
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,790
spiders. QQQ never got there. So, we're

shelf there and buyers stuck at 80s. So

2345
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,270
require an insane amount of patience
from me now. And I'm not convinced I'm

from me now. And I'm not convinced I'm
 

2347
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,950
from me now. And I'm not convinced I'm
going to trade it. If if I'm still

2348
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:16,960
going to trade it. If if I'm still
 

2349
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,670
going to trade it. If if I'm still
feeling like this, I won't trade it. If

2350
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:19,680
feeling like this, I won't trade it. If
 

2351
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,670

I can shake this feeling off, I'll trade

01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:50,880
Oh, what I feel inside like like a form
 

2379
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,950
Oh, what I feel inside like like a form
of anger for myself, a form of

2380
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:52,960
of anger for myself, a form of
 

2381
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,630
of anger for myself, a form of
frustration,

2382
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:54,640
frustration,
 

2383
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,430
frustration,
um

2384
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:57,440
um
 

2385
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,430
um
like any of those sort of low frequency

2386
01:06:59,430 --> 01:06:59,440
like any of those sort of low frequency
 

2387
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,510
like any of those sort of low frequency
feelings which are all basically

2388
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:01,520
feelings which are all basically
 

2389
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,710
feelings which are all basically
feelings of pain, anything like that, if

2390
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:04,720
feelings of pain, anything like that, if
 

2391
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,230
feelings of pain, anything like that, if
I'm feeling any of those, whether it's

2392
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:06,240
I'm feeling any of those, whether it's
 

2393
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,750
I'm feeling any of those, whether it's
to do with trading or not, I have to be

2394
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:07,760
to do with trading or not, I have to be
 

2395
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,670
to do with trading or not, I have to be
really careful.

2396
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:09,680
really careful.
 

2397
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,510
really careful.
Okay. So, coming to test these 80s we

2398
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:11,520
Okay. So, coming to test these 80s we
 

2399
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,870
Okay. So, coming to test these 80s we
just talked about. It's where the buyer

2400
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:12,880
just talked about. It's where the buyer
 

2401
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:18,950
just talked about. It's where the buyer
is stuck.

2402
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:18,960

 

2403
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,510

and rejecting it again.

2404
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:21,520
and rejecting it again.
 

2405
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,950
and rejecting it again.
So the buyer [snorts] remains stuck

2406
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:22,960
So the buyer [snorts] remains stuck
 

2407
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,230
So the buyer [snorts] remains stuck
there. He's actually at 7975

2408
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:26,240
there. He's actually at 7975
 

2409
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,589
there. He's actually at 7975
is like the exact tick 32 I have on it.

2410
01:07:29,589 --> 01:07:29,599
is like the exact tick 32 I have on it.
 

2411
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:31,430
is like the exact tick 32 I have on it.
So he's still stuck there and he just

2412
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:31,440
So he's still stuck there and he just
 

2413
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:36,470
So he's still stuck there and he just
became a seller.

2414
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:36,480

 

2415
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,150

2474
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:40,640
that. If they're going to get this
 

2475
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,669
that. If they're going to get this
going, it's going to have to break

2476
01:08:41,669 --> 01:08:41,679
going, it's going to have to break
 

2477
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:44,149
going, it's going to have to break

01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:48,159
hold above this. Can't just fade back
 

2483
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:49,990
hold above this. Can't just fade back
inside. Nothing will change if it fades

2484
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:50,000
inside. Nothing will change if it fades
 

2485
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,777
inside. Nothing will change if it fades
back inside.

2486
01:08:51,777 --> 01:08:51,787

01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:10,950
Okay, still not through the 80s. Still
rejecting up there. All right, we just

2500
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:10,960
rejecting up there. All right, we just
 

2501
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,470
rejecting up there. All right, we just
put in a wick and rejected. We need to

2502
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:12,480
put in a wick and rejected. We need to
 

2503
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,149
put in a wick and rejected. We need to
get back above this and base if they're

2504
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:14,159
get back above this and base if they're
 

2505
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:15,749
get back above this and base if they're
going to curl it, which they're now

01:09:15,749 --> 01:09:15,759
going to curl it, which they're now
 

2507
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:18,630
going to curl it, which they're now
trying to do. Okay, let's see. See if

2508
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:18,640
trying to do. Okay, let's see. See if
 

2509
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:25,349
trying to do. Okay, let's see. See if
they go back for these 600s and VWAP.

2510
01:09:25,349 --> 01:09:25,359

 

2511
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,990

And I'd be watching SPY

2512
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:28,000
And I'd be watching SPY
 

2513
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:34,789
And I'd be watching SPY
over 8850s. Really

2514
01:09:34,789 --> 01:09:34,799

 

2515
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,630

still in this gray box. We poked above

2516
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:36,640
still in this gray box. We poked above
 

2517
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,110
still in this gray box. We poked above
it. We're still in the gray box. Still

2518
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:39,120
it. We're still in the gray box. Still
 

2519
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,070
it. We're still in the gray box. Still
can't get a close above it.

2520
01:09:42,070 --> 01:09:42,080
can't get a close above it.
 

2521
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:46,149
can't get a close above it.
So buyers will now want to bend 63s.

2522
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:46,159
So buyers will now want to bend 63s.
 

2523
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:47,669
So buyers will now want to bend 63s.
We can't do that. This is just going to

01:09:47,669 --> 01:09:47,679
We can't do that. This is just going to
 

2525
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:52,870
We can't do that. This is just going to
be a little trap above here.

Can feel the frustration in me today. Be
a trap above here. If they get under

2530
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:56,560
a trap above here. If they get under
 

2531
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,550
a trap above here. If they get under
here, this will fade. Right. Buyers need

01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,510

01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:04,880
little trap. If they get under here,
 

2539
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:05,830
little trap. If they get under here,
they're probably going to try and

they're probably going to try and
 

2541
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:12,343
they're probably going to try and
rotate. This is very key.

65s and 80. That's where the buyers
 

2657
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:11,669
65s and 80. That's where the buyers
their outlying delta is 65s and 80.

2658
01:13:11,669 --> 01:13:11,679

 

2659
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,510

So if we're not above that, they're

2660
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:13,520
So if we're not above that, they're
 

2661
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,189
So if we're not above that, they're
stuck, right? If we're above that,

2662
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:15,199
stuck, right? If we're above that,
 

2663
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:17,830
stuck, right? If we're above that,
they're comfortable. ES is trying to

2664
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:17,840
they're comfortable. ES is trying to
 

2665
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,390
they're comfortable. ES is trying to
curl spy off its 5day moving average.

2666
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:20,400
curl spy off its 5day moving average.
 

2667
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,510
curl spy off its 5day moving average.
Probably going to want to test the

2668
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:21,520
Probably going to want to test the
 

2669
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,030
Probably going to want to test the
20-day if we can get going. All right,

2670
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:23,040
20-day if we can get going. All right,
 

2671
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,189
20-day if we can get going. All right,
let's see. I don't like the bottom of

2672
01:13:25,189 --> 01:13:25,199
let's see. I don't like the bottom of
 

2673
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:26,550
let's see. I don't like the bottom of
this auction, I'm going to be honest.

2674
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:26,560
this auction, I'm going to be honest.
 

2675
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,910
this auction, I'm going to be honest.
But I will be willing to play this if

2676
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:27,920
But I will be willing to play this if
 

2677
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,430
But I will be willing to play this if
we're going to start to squeeze and base

2678
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:29,440
we're going to start to squeeze and base
 

2679
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,430
we're going to start to squeeze and base
above

2680
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:31,440
above
 

2681
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,390
above
back into these 79s and 80s. Are we

2682
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:34,400
back into these 79s and 80s. Are we
 

2683
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,750
back into these 79s and 80s. Are we
going to base above here? This is the

2684
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:35,760
going to base above here? This is the
 

2685
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,270
going to base above here? This is the
where they got stuck last time. So

2686
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:37,280
where they got stuck last time. So
 

2687
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:43,669
where they got stuck last time. So
looking to see if we can hold now.

2688
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:43,679

 

2689
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,189

Going to be very careful with ES

2690
01:13:45,189 --> 01:13:45,199
Going to be very careful with ES
 

2691
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:48,790
Going to be very careful with ES
approaching VW.

2692
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:48,800

 

2693
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,189

I want to see a pullback hold. really

2694
01:13:51,189 --> 01:13:51,199
I want to see a pullback hold. really
 

2695
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:52,630
I want to see a pullback hold. really
much more comfortable if we can have a

2696
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:52,640
much more comfortable if we can have a
 

2697
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,990
much more comfortable if we can have a
pullback that holds rather than just

2698
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:54,000
pullback that holds rather than just
 

2699
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,950
pullback that holds rather than just
coming in for these wicks

2700
01:13:58,950 --> 01:13:58,960

 

2701
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:04,070

in balance now.

2702
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:04,080

 

2703
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,830

Want to see this buyer step up now and

2704
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:05,840
Want to see this buyer step up now and
 

2705
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:11,990
Want to see this buyer step up now and
squeeze.

2706
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:12,000

 

2707
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:18,470

Come on, mate. Lift it 600. Let's see.

2708
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:18,480

 

2709
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:21,110

Yes. It's not even getting to be what?

2710
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:21,120
Yes. It's not even getting to be what?
 

2711
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:27,910
Yes. It's not even getting to be what?
Come on.

2712
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:27,920

 

2713
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,950

Nice. There we go. Lovely.

2714
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:30,960
Nice. There we go. Lovely.
 

2715
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,149
Nice. There we go. Lovely.
I'm going to trim some into this

2716
01:14:32,149 --> 01:14:32,159
I'm going to trim some into this
 

2717
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:35,350
I'm going to trim some into this
imbalance at 600 just to be careful

2718
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:35,360
imbalance at 600 just to be careful
 

2719
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,350
imbalance at 600 just to be careful
and then see if we can get up into here

2720
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:37,360
and then see if we can get up into here
 

2721
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:41,830
and then see if we can get up into here
and then see if we can rotate.

2722
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:41,840

 

2723
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,189

Scalping my way through this because

2724
01:14:43,189 --> 01:14:43,199
Scalping my way through this because
 

2725
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,270
Scalping my way through this because
we're early. We don't know. I don't like

2726
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:45,280
we're early. We don't know. I don't like
 

2727
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,550
we're early. We don't know. I don't like
the bottom of the auction. I'm not

2728
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:46,560
the bottom of the auction. I'm not
 

2729
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,910
the bottom of the auction. I'm not
convinced the bottom is in yet. So, I'm

2730
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:47,920
convinced the bottom is in yet. So, I'm
 

2731
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,830
convinced the bottom is in yet. So, I'm
just scalping this up, paying myself on

2732
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:49,840
just scalping this up, paying myself on
 

2733
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,590
just scalping this up, paying myself on
the way. If it goes, it goes and we're

2734
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:51,600
the way. If it goes, it goes and we're
 

2735
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,350
the way. If it goes, it goes and we're
happy. But if it doesn't, and it needs

2736
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:53,360
happy. But if it doesn't, and it needs
 

2737
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,189
happy. But if it doesn't, and it needs
to come and clean out this, then I

2738
01:14:55,189 --> 01:14:55,199
to come and clean out this, then I
 

2739
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,790
to come and clean out this, then I
understand because this bottom of the

2740
01:14:56,790 --> 01:14:56,800
understand because this bottom of the
 

2741
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,149
understand because this bottom of the
auction does not look very good.

2742
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:00,159
auction does not look very good.
 

2743
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:01,590
auction does not look very good.
I'm not sure. I'm not convinced we're

2744
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:01,600
I'm not sure. I'm not convinced we're
 

2745
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,270
I'm not sure. I'm not convinced we're
done selling yet. But I'm putting this

2746
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:03,280
done selling yet. But I'm putting this
 

2747
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,430
done selling yet. But I'm putting this
long scalping some out into 600. And if

2748
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:05,440
long scalping some out into 600. And if
 

2749
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,990
long scalping some out into 600. And if
we can lift back into 15s and 20s,

2750
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:08,000
we can lift back into 15s and 20s,
 

2751
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,229
we can lift back into 15s and 20s,
great. But

2752
01:15:10,229 --> 01:15:10,239
great. But
 

2753
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:17,189
great. But
see,

2754
01:15:17,189 --> 01:15:17,199

 

2755
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:19,350

start there at 600 again. 80s the level

2756
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:19,360
start there at 600 again. 80s the level
 

2757
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,630
start there at 600 again. 80s the level
now. They've got to hold the dip. If

2758
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:20,640
now. They've got to hold the dip. If
 

2759
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,149
now. They've got to hold the dip. If
they don't hold the dip in 80s, I'll

2760
01:15:22,149 --> 01:15:22,159
they don't hold the dip in 80s, I'll
 

2761
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:24,229
they don't hold the dip in 80s, I'll
probably get out of this. Got to flip

2762
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:24,239
probably get out of this. Got to flip
 

2763
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:25,669
probably get out of this. Got to flip
this gray box into some support

2764
01:15:25,669 --> 01:15:25,679
this gray box into some support
 

2765
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:27,350
this gray box into some support
structure at 80s. If they don't hold

2766
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:27,360
structure at 80s. If they don't hold
 

2767
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,110
structure at 80s. If they don't hold
80s, I'll probably cut and then I'll

2768
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:29,120
80s, I'll probably cut and then I'll
 

2769
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,590
80s, I'll probably cut and then I'll
look to see how we act at 65. So far,

2770
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:31,600
look to see how we act at 65. So far,
 

2771
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:37,189
look to see how we act at 65. So far,
holding 80s nicely.

make that very, very clear. You must pay
 

2789
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:08,012
make that very, very clear. You must pay

01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,030
Spy into that pre-market low pivot.
Rejecting that as well. be very careful.

I would trim a big chunk of your

01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:00,800
I would trim a big chunk of your
 

2817
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,510
I would trim a big chunk of your
position here. If they want to sell this

2818
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:03,520
position here. If they want to sell this
 

2819
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,189
position here. If they want to sell this
on the higher time frame, they will. All

on the higher time frame, they will. All
 

2821
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:09,110
on the higher time frame, they will. All

2822
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:09,120
right. So, if we look at spiders
 

2823
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,950

Oh, wrong chart. Right here. There we

if we go to ES

2836
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:28,000
if we go to ES

into view up and selling. All right, I'm
 

2839
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:31,030
into view up and selling. All right, I'm
out of this now, by the way, folks.

2840
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:31,040
out of this now, by the way, folks.
 

2841
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,030
out of this now, by the way, folks.
Obviously, I'm not going to sit through

2842
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:33,040
Obviously, I'm not going to sit through
 

2843
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:37,669
Obviously, I'm not going to sit through
this.

2844
01:17:37,669 --> 01:17:37,679

 

2845
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:39,110

Like I said, I don't like the bottom of

2846
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:39,120
Like I said, I don't like the bottom of
 

2847
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,470
Like I said, I don't like the bottom of
this auction. It's very possible they

2848
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:40,480
this auction. It's very possible they
 

2849
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:41,910
this auction. It's very possible they
come and clean this up. There's not

2850
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:41,920
come and clean this up. There's not
 

2851
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:47,990
come and clean this up. There's not
enough excess down there in my mind.

2852
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:48,000

 

2853
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,270

And they might have just used this to

2854
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:49,280
And they might have just used this to
 

2855
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,030
And they might have just used this to
resell. So, we hit VW up and then got

2856
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:51,040
resell. So, we hit VW up and then got
 

2857
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,950
resell. So, we hit VW up and then got
the sell. So, no confirmation through

2858
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:52,960
the sell. So, no confirmation through
 

2859
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,470
the sell. So, no confirmation through
the tens. Remember I said through 10.

2860
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:54,480
the tens. Remember I said through 10.
 

2861
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,910
the tens. Remember I said through 10.
It's got a base above 10 to get it

2862
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:55,920
It's got a base above 10 to get it
 

2863
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,030
It's got a base above 10 to get it
going. No confirmation through the tens.

2864
01:17:59,030 --> 01:17:59,040
going. No confirmation through the tens.
 

2865
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,950
going. No confirmation through the tens.
And we can probably clean up the low of

2866
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:00,960
And we can probably clean up the low of
 

2867
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,790
And we can probably clean up the low of
day here

2868
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:02,800
day here
 

2869
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,229
day here
because there's not a good auction at

2870
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:04,239
because there's not a good auction at
 

2871
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:07,270
because there's not a good auction at
that low of day right now. It's uh

2872
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:07,280
that low of day right now. It's uh
 

2873
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,709
that low of day right now. It's uh
there's not enough excess. Remember

2874
01:18:08,709 --> 01:18:08,719
there's not enough excess. Remember
 

2875
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,310
there's not enough excess. Remember
yesterday we were talked about excess.

2876
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:10,320
yesterday we were talked about excess.
 

2877
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,390
yesterday we were talked about excess.
So same kind of thing here. Sellers will

2878
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:12,400
So same kind of thing here. Sellers will
 

2879
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,030
So same kind of thing here. Sellers will
want to now defend 65 and create a new

2880
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:15,040
want to now defend 65 and create a new
 

2881
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,270

low on the day and flush down towards

2882
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:17,280
low on the day and flush down towards
 

2883
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:26,950
low on the day and flush down towards
516s.

2884
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:26,960

 

2885
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,550

cannot imagine buyers just being able to

2886
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:28,560
cannot imagine buyers just being able to
 

2887
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,990
cannot imagine buyers just being able to
hold these lows. I mean, it's possible,

2888
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:30,000
hold these lows. I mean, it's possible,
 

2889
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,149
hold these lows. I mean, it's possible,
but it would be a very ugly uh low of

2890
01:18:32,149 --> 01:18:32,159
but it would be a very ugly uh low of
 

2891
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,790
but it would be a very ugly uh low of
date auction. I would imagine this gets

2892
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:34,800
date auction. I would imagine this gets
 

2893
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,750
date auction. I would imagine this gets
resold on on the push up towards uh 65s.

2894
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:39,760
resold on on the push up towards uh 65s.
 

2895
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,470
resold on on the push up towards uh 65s.
We will see. It's been a wishy-washy uh

2896
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:42,480
We will see. It's been a wishy-washy uh
 

2897
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,990
We will see. It's been a wishy-washy uh
market the last few days. Here's the

2898
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:44,000
market the last few days. Here's the
 

2899
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:50,149
market the last few days. Here's the
push up to towards that level.

2900
01:18:50,149 --> 01:18:50,159

 

2901
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:56,310

point of control here.

2902
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:56,320

 

2903
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:00,470

There's the push to 65s.

2904
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:00,480

 

2905
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,950

They're going to break this higher. Nah,

2906
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:02,960
They're going to break this higher. Nah,
 

2907
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,790
They're going to break this higher. Nah,
surely not. Surely you clean up low of

01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:04,800
surely not. Surely you clean up low of
 

2909
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,709
surely not. Surely you clean up low of
day.

2910
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:06,719
day.
 

2911
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,950
day.
Surely you clean up low of day, NQ. That

2912
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:08,960
Surely you clean up low of day, NQ. That
 

2913
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,390
Surely you clean up low of day, NQ. That
is disgusting. If you're going to knock

2914
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:10,400
is disgusting. If you're going to knock
 

2915
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,830
is disgusting. If you're going to knock
me out and run higher, that is really

2916
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:11,840
me out and run higher, that is really
 

2917
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,750

horrible. I'm sure you're going to clean
 

2919
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,350
horrible. I'm sure you're going to clean
up low of day. You can't leave it like

2920
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:15,360
up low of day. You can't leave it like
 

2921
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:23,910
up low of day. You can't leave it like
that. It's gross.

2922
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:23,920

 

2923
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:29,110

Fix

2924
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:29,120

 

2925
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,990

fix is fading now as well at 16. This is

2926
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:32,000
fix is fading now as well at 16. This is
 

2927
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,830
fix is fading now as well at 16. This is
uh actually really horrible action at

2928
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:33,840
uh actually really horrible action at
 

2929
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,790
uh actually really horrible action at
the lows. I'm going to tell you that

2930
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:36,800
the lows. I'm going to tell you that
 

2931
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,510
the lows. I'm going to tell you that
that auction at the low is gross. I know

2932
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:39,520
that auction at the low is gross. I know
 

2933
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,590
that auction at the low is gross. I know
there's a shelf, but there's no excess.

2934
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:41,600
there's a shelf, but there's no excess.
 

2935
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,910
there's a shelf, but there's no excess.
This is horrible to This is just like

01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:43,920
This is horrible to This is just like
 

2937
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,669
This is horrible to This is just like
yesterday at the high when it knocked me

2938
01:19:45,669 --> 01:19:45,679
yesterday at the high when it knocked me
 

2939
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:46,870
yesterday at the high when it knocked me
out.

2940
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:46,880
out.
 

2941
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:57,669
out.
Mother,

2942
01:19:57,669 --> 01:19:57,679

 

2943
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:00,950

there's no excess down here.

2944
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:00,960
there's no excess down here.
 

2945
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,310
there's no excess down here.
Get rid of this now. I traded through it

2946
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:02,320
Get rid of this now. I traded through it
 

2947
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:11,830
Get rid of this now. I traded through it
too many times.

2948
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:11,840

 

2949
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,550

Really?

2950
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:14,560
Really?
 

2951
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:21,830
Really?
Really?

2952
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:21,840

 

2953
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,390

I'm guessing 618's a massive gamut level

2954
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:24,400
I'm guessing 618's a massive gamut level
 

2955
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,510
I'm guessing 618's a massive gamut level
on QQQ.

2956
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:27,520
on QQQ.
 

2957
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,310
on QQQ.
I'm guessing that is a huge gamma level

2958
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:30,320
I'm guessing that is a huge gamma level
 

2959
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,149
I'm guessing that is a huge gamma level
today. Fact that they've done just done

2960
01:20:32,149 --> 01:20:32,159
today. Fact that they've done just done
 

2961
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:49,350
today. Fact that they've done just done
what they've done.

2962
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:49,360

 

2963
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:56,709

I do not feel comfortable now.

2964
01:20:56,709 --> 01:20:56,719

 

2965
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:58,310

Yes, back to that pre-market level

2966
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:58,320
Yes, back to that pre-market level
 

2967
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:01,510
Yes, back to that pre-market level
again. I do not feel comfortable longing

2968
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:01,520
again. I do not feel comfortable longing
 

2969
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,750
again. I do not feel comfortable longing
QQQ now knowing that it just came down

2970
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:03,760
QQQ now knowing that it just came down
 

2971
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,870
QQQ now knowing that it just came down
and didn't sweep all that liquidity. Um,

2972
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:06,880
and didn't sweep all that liquidity. Um,
 

2973
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:10,790
and didn't sweep all that liquidity. Um,
and I feel like it's probably going to

2974
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:10,800
and I feel like it's probably going to
 

2975
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,149
and I feel like it's probably going to
just piss me off and just rocket now.

2976
01:21:14,149 --> 01:21:14,159
just piss me off and just rocket now.
 

2977
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,790
just piss me off and just rocket now.
So I was positioned long here. Took some

2978
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:16,800
So I was positioned long here. Took some
 

2979
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,830
So I was positioned long here. Took some
off out of it. Doesn't sweep. So I'm

2980
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:19,840
off out of it. Doesn't sweep. So I'm
 

2981
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,270
off out of it. Doesn't sweep. So I'm
waiting for the sweep now to get back

2982
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:21,280
waiting for the sweep now to get back
 

2983
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,270
waiting for the sweep now to get back
long. Doesn't sweep. Creates more stops

2984
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:23,280
long. Doesn't sweep. Creates more stops
 

2985
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,430
long. Doesn't sweep. Creates more stops
down here. Driving back upside right

2986
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:25,440
down here. Driving back upside right
 

2987
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,510
down here. Driving back upside right
now. It is possible they come and

2988
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:27,520
now. It is possible they come and
 

2989
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,550
now. It is possible they come and
revisit this. But uh like I talked about

2990
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:30,560
revisit this. But uh like I talked about
 

2991
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,390
revisit this. But uh like I talked about
this spy level is key and it's starting

2992
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:32,400
this spy level is key and it's starting
 

2993
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,149
this spy level is key and it's starting
to try and get through it here. So be

2994
01:21:34,149 --> 01:21:34,159
to try and get through it here. So be
 

2995
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:35,590
to try and get through it here. So be
watching this. So is it previous day

2996
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:35,600
watching this. So is it previous day
 

2997
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,189
watching this. So is it previous day
high or previous week high on spy?

2998
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:37,199
high or previous week high on spy?
 

2999
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:38,709
high or previous week high on spy?
Previous day high on spy. Watch this

3000
01:21:38,709 --> 01:21:38,719
Previous day high on spy. Watch this
 

3001
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:40,950
Previous day high on spy. Watch this
level into 88s. We trade through that.

3002
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:40,960
level into 88s. We trade through that.
 

3003
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,310
level into 88s. We trade through that.
We probably get going here on the

3004
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:42,320
We probably get going here on the
 

3005
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,709
We probably get going here on the
market. I can't believe it. Knocked me

3006
01:21:44,709 --> 01:21:44,719
market. I can't believe it. Knocked me
 

3007
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:46,310
market. I can't believe it. Knocked me
out, didn't sweep, and then went

3008
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:46,320
out, didn't sweep, and then went
 

3009
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:49,510
out, didn't sweep, and then went
straight back up.

3010
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:49,520
straight back up.
 

3011
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,430
straight back up.
It is yesterday all over again, but

3012
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:51,440
It is yesterday all over again, but
 

3013
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:56,310
It is yesterday all over again, but
reversed.

3014
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:56,320

 

3015
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,070

Do I have another go at this is the

3016
01:21:58,070 --> 01:21:58,080
Do I have another go at this is the
 

3017
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,310
Do I have another go at this is the
question.

3018
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:00,320
question.
 

3019
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:13,189
question.
Do I have another stab?

3020
01:22:13,189 --> 01:22:13,199

 

3021
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:20,057

ression down here now.

615 is gam on QQQ is it I mean that

3030
01:22:38,629 --> 01:22:38,639
615 is gam on QQQ is it I mean that
 

3031
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:42,310
615 is gam on QQQ is it I mean that
makes sense but just how we've reacted

3032
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:42,320
makes sense but just how we've reacted
 

3033
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:47,189
makes sense but just how we've reacted
5 10 15 20 25 30 35 for 40 minutes at

3037
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,950

it's not like there's a giant pivot it

3038
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:54,960
it's not like there's a giant pivot it
 

3039
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,910
it's not like there's a giant pivot it
there. There's not there's not much

01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:57,920
there. There's not there's not much

there.
 

3043
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,510
there.
It's like the after hours close and

3044
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:01,520
It's like the after hours close and
 

3045
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:09,189
It's like the after hours close and
that's it.

3046
01:23:09,189 --> 01:23:09,199

 

3047
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:11,590

What are these guys doing? What are they

3048
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:11,600
What are these guys doing? What are they
 

3049
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,149
What are these guys doing? What are they
doing?

3050
01:23:14,149 --> 01:23:14,159
doing?
 

3051
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,709
doing?
What are they doing? ES can't get

3052
01:23:16,709 --> 01:23:16,719
What are they doing? ES can't get
 

3053
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:18,470
What are they doing? ES can't get
through. Oh, yeah. ES can't get through

3054
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:18,480
through. Oh, yeah. ES can't get through
 

3055
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:34,550
through. Oh, yeah. ES can't get through
it. Speed up.

3056
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:34,560

 

3057
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,790

That dip just got bought up again in

3058
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:36,800
That dip just got bought up again in
 

3059
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,629
That dip just got bought up again in
front of the uh the 80s or at the 80s

3060
01:23:40,629 --> 01:23:40,639
front of the uh the 80s or at the 80s
 

3061
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:42,950
front of the uh the 80s or at the 80s
but in front of the 65s. This might go

3062
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:42,960
but in front of the 65s. This might go
 

3063
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,149
but in front of the 65s. This might go
now. They might have caught enough in

3064
01:23:44,149 --> 01:23:44,159
now. They might have caught enough in
 

3065
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:50,470
now. They might have caught enough in
that last move.

3066
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:50,480

 

3067
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:51,750

They're trying to bid it up. They need

3068
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:51,760
They're trying to bid it up. They need
 

3069
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,990
They're trying to bid it up. They need
the 600 break and then we got 630 on

3070
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:54,000
the 600 break and then we got 630 on
 

3071
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,390
the 600 break and then we got 630 on
deck. Probably

3072
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:56,400
deck. Probably
 

3073
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:03,830
deck. Probably
there's 600.

3074
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:03,840

 

3075
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,430

They break this, they'll squeeze up and

3076
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:05,440
They break this, they'll squeeze up and
 

3077
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:14,790
They break this, they'll squeeze up and
look for sort of 630, 625, 630, 644.

3078
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:14,800

 

3079
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:19,030

It's very ugly.

3080
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:19,040

 

3081
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,790

I do not like the lower day. It's the

3082
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:20,800
I do not like the lower day. It's the
 

3083
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,149
I do not like the lower day. It's the
one thing that's making me very

3084
01:24:22,149 --> 01:24:22,159
one thing that's making me very
 

3085
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:23,830
one thing that's making me very
uncomfortable about thinking about the

3086
01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:23,840
uncomfortable about thinking about the
 

3087
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:32,070
uncomfortable about thinking about the
long right now.

3088
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:32,080

 

3089
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,870

Back down to these 80s again

3090
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:34,880
Back down to these 80s again
 

3091
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:44,310
Back down to these 80s again
and the shelf down at 65.

3092
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:44,320

 

3093
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,790

If we'd put in a new low of day and had

3094
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:46,800
If we'd put in a new low of day and had
 

3095
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,629
If we'd put in a new low of day and had
excess, I'd be thinking about a long

3096
01:24:48,629 --> 01:24:48,639
excess, I'd be thinking about a long
 

3097
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:50,550
excess, I'd be thinking about a long
here.

3098
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:50,560
here.
 

3099
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,310
here.
If we'd done that, I would be thinking

3100
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:52,320
If we'd done that, I would be thinking
 

3101
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,910
If we'd done that, I would be thinking
about a long here. That's where my

3102
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:53,920
about a long here. That's where my
 

3103
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:57,350
about a long here. That's where my
head's at right now. But we haven't. And

3104
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:57,360
head's at right now. But we haven't. And
 

3105
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:00,229
head's at right now. But we haven't. And
so, it's kind of making me question why

3106
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:00,239
so, it's kind of making me question why
 

3107
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:11,669
so, it's kind of making me question why
we're doing this dance.

3108
01:25:11,669 --> 01:25:11,679

 

3109
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:13,830

SPY cannot get through that pre-market

3110
01:25:13,830 --> 01:25:13,840
SPY cannot get through that pre-market
 

3111
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:19,270
SPY cannot get through that pre-market
either.

3112
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:19,280

 

3113
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,030

Very unconvinced right now of this

3114
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:21,040
Very unconvinced right now of this
 

3115
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,629
Very unconvinced right now of this
market.

3116
01:25:22,629 --> 01:25:22,639
market.
 

3117
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:24,070
market.
It might need to trade sideways for a

3118
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:24,080
It might need to trade sideways for a
 

3119
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:29,430
It might need to trade sideways for a
bit longer until it makes a decision.

3120
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:29,440

 

3121
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,030

Trapping more balls possibly to take out

3122
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:31,040
Trapping more balls possibly to take out
 

3123
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,270
Trapping more balls possibly to take out
lower date. I mean, it's possible, but

3124
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:33,280
lower date. I mean, it's possible, but
 

3125
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:34,950
lower date. I mean, it's possible, but
uh it's possible the other way around as

3126
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:34,960
uh it's possible the other way around as
 

3127
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:38,470
uh it's possible the other way around as
well.

3128
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:38,480

 

3129
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,030

Don't have much edge here.

3130
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:41,040
Don't have much edge here.
 

3131
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,709
Don't have much edge here.
All I know is we're holding value area

3132
01:25:42,709 --> 01:25:42,719
All I know is we're holding value area
 

3133
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,470
All I know is we're holding value area
low, but we haven't come and taken these

3134
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:44,480
low, but we haven't come and taken these
 

3135
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,550
low, but we haven't come and taken these
lowhanging fruits. There is not much

3136
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:46,560
lowhanging fruits. There is not much
 

3137
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,229
lowhanging fruits. There is not much
excess there, and we're getting stuck

3138
01:25:48,229 --> 01:25:48,239
excess there, and we're getting stuck
 

3139
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:49,910
excess there, and we're getting stuck
here time and time again. So, this is

3140
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:49,920
here time and time again. So, this is
 

3141
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,669
here time and time again. So, this is
just it keeps just rotating this until

3142
01:25:51,669 --> 01:25:51,679
just it keeps just rotating this until
 

3143
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:53,830
just it keeps just rotating this until
it's ready.

3144
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:53,840
it's ready.
 

3145
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:57,990
it's ready.
That's all I know.

3146
01:25:57,990 --> 01:25:58,000

 

3147
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,229

But we are now starting to protect 80

3148
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:00,239
But we are now starting to protect 80
 

3149
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,470
But we are now starting to protect 80
and definitely not not letting it under

3150
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:02,480
and definitely not not letting it under
 

3151
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:36,950
and definitely not not letting it under
65s.

3152
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:36,960

 

3153
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:41,350

Both sides now stacked on the big ass.

3154
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:41,360
Both sides now stacked on the big ass.
 

3155
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,030
Both sides now stacked on the big ass.
It's gone to sleep. Something's going to

3156
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:43,040
It's gone to sleep. Something's going to
 

3157
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,270
It's gone to sleep. Something's going to
give soon. We can't stay here forever.

3158
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:45,280
give soon. We can't stay here forever.
 

3159
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:50,870
give soon. We can't stay here forever.
Something will absolutely give soon.

3160
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:50,880

 

3161
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,390

Cannot just sit like this forever. There

3162
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:52,400
Cannot just sit like this forever. There
 

3163
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,030
Cannot just sit like this forever. There
you go. There's the thing giving.

3164
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:55,040
you go. There's the thing giving.
 

3165
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,270
you go. There's the thing giving.
So tens again. Remember 10 is the orb.

3166
01:26:57,270 --> 01:26:57,280
So tens again. Remember 10 is the orb.
 

3167
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,830
So tens again. Remember 10 is the orb.
If we go back inside the orb,

3168
01:26:59,830 --> 01:26:59,840
If we go back inside the orb,
 

3169
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,070
If we go back inside the orb,
we're looking for VWOP and then above.

3170
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:02,080
we're looking for VWOP and then above.
 

3171
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,669
we're looking for VWOP and then above.
There we go. Back inside the orb. Now

3172
01:27:03,669 --> 01:27:03,679
There we go. Back inside the orb. Now
 

3173
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:06,390
There we go. Back inside the orb. Now
looking for VWOP and above. There's VWAP

3174
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:06,400
looking for VWOP and above. There's VWAP
 

3175
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,790
looking for VWOP and above. There's VWAP
and value area high would be 630s if

3176
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:08,800
and value area high would be 630s if
 

3177
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,070
and value area high would be 630s if
we're going to test that. We've actually

3178
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:10,080
we're going to test that. We've actually
 

3179
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,990
we're going to test that. We've actually
got a node at 40s which I'm looking at.

3180
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:12,000
got a node at 40s which I'm looking at.
 

3181
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,189
got a node at 40s which I'm looking at.
And sellers came in at 39 earlier today.

3182
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:15,199
And sellers came in at 39 earlier today.
 

3183
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:17,189
And sellers came in at 39 earlier today.
So relief up here. Can we trade through

3184
01:27:17,189 --> 01:27:17,199
So relief up here. Can we trade through
 

3185
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:20,149
So relief up here. Can we trade through
VWAP and now get going? It's very

3186
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:20,159
VWAP and now get going? It's very
 

3187
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:21,430
VWAP and now get going? It's very
upsetting for me. I would have sized

3188
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:21,440
upsetting for me. I would have sized
 

3189
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,669
upsetting for me. I would have sized
into this if the low of day had a better

3190
01:27:23,669 --> 01:27:23,679
into this if the low of day had a better
 

3191
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:25,750
into this if the low of day had a better
auction on it. Buyers getting a little

3192
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:25,760
auction on it. Buyers getting a little
 

3193
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,430
auction on it. Buyers getting a little
bit caught here at 20s. Be careful if

3194
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:27,440
bit caught here at 20s. Be careful if
 

3195
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:40,149
bit caught here at 20s. Be careful if
you're long in this.

3196
01:27:40,149 --> 01:27:40,159

 

3197
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:42,950

There we go. There's 20s. Let's see if

3198
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:42,960
There we go. There's 20s. Let's see if
 

3199
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,910
There we go. There's 20s. Let's see if
they can lift now to 30s into these

3200
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:45,920
they can lift now to 30s into these
 

3201
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,350
they can lift now to 30s into these
nodes here. And then if we get very

3202
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:47,360
nodes here. And then if we get very
 

3203
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,550
nodes here. And then if we get very
lucky, we get up to 76s.

3204
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:50,560
lucky, we get up to 76s.
 

3205
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:59,189
lucky, we get up to 76s.
Tiny size in this cuz I don't trust it.

3206
01:27:59,189 --> 01:27:59,199

 

3207
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:01,590

is 30s value area high on the day

3208
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:01,600
is 30s value area high on the day
 

3209
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,430
is 30s value area high on the day
through this node. Right. Next thing

3210
01:28:03,430 --> 01:28:03,440
through this node. Right. Next thing
 

3211
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,110
through this node. Right. Next thing
that we're aiming for is all the way up

3212
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:05,120
that we're aiming for is all the way up
 

3213
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,070
that we're aiming for is all the way up
here into 73s.

3214
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:08,080
here into 73s.
 

3215
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,830
here into 73s.
Man, why couldn't they have just done a

3216
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:09,840
Man, why couldn't they have just done a
 

3217
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,270
Man, why couldn't they have just done a
better auction at the lows?

3218
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:13,280
better auction at the lows?
 

3219
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,629
better auction at the lows?
I would pay yourself here because we've

3220
01:28:14,629 --> 01:28:14,639
I would pay yourself here because we've
 

3221
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:16,390
I would pay yourself here because we've
just swept all this liquidity here,

3222
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:16,400
just swept all this liquidity here,
 

3223
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,950
just swept all this liquidity here,
right? And we come into value high on

3224
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:18,960
right? And we come into value high on
 

3225
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,790
right? And we come into value high on
the day. If they want to go into a

3226
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:20,800
the day. If they want to go into a
 

3227
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,950
the day. If they want to go into a
rotation, if they want to go into

3228
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:22,960
rotation, if they want to go into
 

3229
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:28,470
rotation, if they want to go into
rotation, they can just pin us in here.

3230
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:28,480

 

3231
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:56,149

Oh, I'm so upset. I'm so upset.

3232
01:28:56,149 --> 01:28:56,159

 

3233
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:58,310

So, rejection of value so far, but we're

3234
01:28:58,310 --> 01:28:58,320
So, rejection of value so far, but we're
 

3235
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:01,110
So, rejection of value so far, but we're
now finding that bullish momentum

3236
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:01,120
now finding that bullish momentum
 

3237
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,709
now finding that bullish momentum
into the weekly gap. Obviously, this

3238
01:29:02,709 --> 01:29:02,719
into the weekly gap. Obviously, this
 

3239
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:05,430
into the weekly gap. Obviously, this
gray box is a big weekly gap. Sellers

3240
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:05,440
gray box is a big weekly gap. Sellers
 

3241
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,310
gray box is a big weekly gap. Sellers
got stuck under here. All right. Mo most

3242
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:08,320
got stuck under here. All right. Mo most
 

3243
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:09,910
got stuck under here. All right. Mo most
of the selling happened under 62

3244
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:09,920
of the selling happened under 62
 

3245
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:14,470
of the selling happened under 62
certainly under 50 under here but what I

3246
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:14,480
certainly under 50 under here but what I
 

3247
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,669
certainly under 50 under here but what I
would have liked to have seen what would

3248
01:29:15,669 --> 01:29:15,679
would have liked to have seen what would
 

3249
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:17,990
would have liked to have seen what would
have made this like a a B setup let's

3250
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:18,000
have made this like a a B setup let's
 

3251
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,149
have made this like a a B setup let's
say rather than a C setup well it would

3252
01:29:20,149 --> 01:29:20,159
say rather than a C setup well it would
 

3253
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:24,950
say rather than a C setup well it would
have been this here all right complete

3254
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:24,960
have been this here all right complete
 

3255
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,590
have been this here all right complete
low hanging fruit clean this out reclaim

3256
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:27,600
low hanging fruit clean this out reclaim
 

3257
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,070
low hanging fruit clean this out reclaim
let shorts chase in and then go upside

3258
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:30,080
let shorts chase in and then go upside
 

3259
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,830
let shorts chase in and then go upside
unfortunately we haven't got that but it

3260
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:31,840
unfortunately we haven't got that but it
 

3261
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,669
unfortunately we haven't got that but it
just is what it is we can only trade

3262
01:29:33,669 --> 01:29:33,679
just is what it is we can only trade
 

3263
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:37,590
just is what it is we can only trade
with what we've

3264
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:37,600

 

3265
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,350

And we are getting very close to these

3266
01:29:39,350 --> 01:29:39,360
And we are getting very close to these
 

3267
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,229
And we are getting very close to these
pivots up here now as well. All right.

3268
01:29:42,229 --> 01:29:42,239
pivots up here now as well. All right.
 

3269
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:45,270
pivots up here now as well. All right.
So these sort of pivots 660 650. All

3270
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:45,280
So these sort of pivots 660 650. All
 

3271
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:48,550
So these sort of pivots 660 650. All
right. Let me put a little line

3272
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:48,560
right. Let me put a little line
 

3273
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,830
right. Let me put a little line
in here. We want to be careful with this

3274
01:29:51,830 --> 01:29:51,840
in here. We want to be careful with this
 

3275
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,270
in here. We want to be careful with this
here where we broke down from this

3276
01:29:53,270 --> 01:29:53,280
here where we broke down from this
 

3277
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,350
here where we broke down from this
morning. Right where I should have short

3278
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:55,360
morning. Right where I should have short
 

3279
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,270
morning. Right where I should have short
from this morning.

3280
01:29:57,270 --> 01:29:57,280
from this morning.
 

3281
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:59,030
from this morning.
Want to be very careful of that pivot as

3282
01:29:59,030 --> 01:29:59,040
Want to be very careful of that pivot as
 

3283
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:08,629
Want to be very careful of that pivot as

01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:37,910
tonight, not tomorrow.
I guess it's tonight, but it's on

3302
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:37,920
I guess it's tonight, but it's on
 

3303
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,390
I guess it's tonight, but it's on
tomorrow's uh candle. I guess that's

3304
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:40,400
tomorrow's uh candle. I guess that's
 

3305
01:30:40,400 --> 01:31:11,189
tomorrow's uh candle. I guess that's
what you mean.

3306
01:31:11,189 --> 01:31:11,199

 

3307
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:12,709

might need to build some liquidity here

3308
01:31:12,709 --> 01:31:12,719
might need to build some liquidity here
 

3309
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:14,709
might need to build some liquidity here
if we are to expand back upside just

3310
01:31:14,709 --> 01:31:14,719
if we are to expand back upside just
 

3311
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:30,070
if we are to expand back upside just
based on those pre-market levels.

3312
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:30,080

 

3313
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:33,030

value area high again. Now the 630s.

3322
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:48,960
value area high again. Now the 630s.
 

3323
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,229
value area high again. Now the 630s.
Like I said, if we get through here,

3324
01:31:50,229 --> 01:31:50,239
Like I said, if we get through here,
 

3325
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:52,629
Like I said, if we get through here,
there is room. There's a 640 where the

3326
01:31:52,629 --> 01:31:52,639
there is room. There's a 640 where the
 

3327
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:54,790
there is room. There's a 640 where the
big sellers came in. 640 650 was the

3328
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:54,800
big sellers came in. 640 650 was the
 

3329
01:31:54,800 --> 01:32:03,430
big sellers came in. 640 650 was the
pivot, right? 640 650 was the pivot.

3330
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:03,440

 

3331
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:06,229

They are trying. They are trying. Here

3332
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:06,239
They are trying. They are trying. Here
 

3333
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:08,390
They are trying. They are trying. Here
comes the move for 640 to test where

3334
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:08,400
comes the move for 640 to test where
 

3335
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:21,430
comes the move for 640 to test where
that seller was.

3336
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:21,440

 

3337
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,350

Yeah, I did participate, but I'm small

3338
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:23,360
Yeah, I did participate, but I'm small
 

3339
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:27,189
Yeah, I did participate, but I'm small
size.

3340
01:32:27,189 --> 01:32:27,199

 

3341
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:28,870

I'm I've just been small size on that

3342
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:28,880
I'm I've just been small size on that
 

3343
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:37,590
I'm I've just been small size on that
move up.

3344
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:37,600

 

3345
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,189

640 is coming up here is where that

3346
01:32:39,189 --> 01:32:39,199
640 is coming up here is where that
 

3347
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:42,070
640 is coming up here is where that
seller was. And remember 50s is the

3348
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:42,080
seller was. And remember 50s is the
 

3349
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:47,430
seller was. And remember 50s is the
pivot from here.

3350
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:47,440

 

3351
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:50,310

And if we think about this move today,

3352
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:50,320
And if we think about this move today,
 

3353
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:51,990
And if we think about this move today,
we've also got to think about the fib on

3354
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:52,000
we've also got to think about the fib on
 

3355
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,510
we've also got to think about the fib on
it.

3356
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:55,520

 

3357
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,510

I don't like that top flat top and flat

3358
01:32:57,510 --> 01:32:57,520
I don't like that top flat top and flat
 

3359
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,350
I don't like that top flat top and flat
bottoms. Those are not nice into 50%

3360
01:32:59,350 --> 01:32:59,360
bottoms. Those are not nice into 50%
 

3361
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,750
bottoms. Those are not nice into 50%
here. So you want to be paying yourself.

3362
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:01,760
here. So you want to be paying yourself.
 

3363
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,470
here. So you want to be paying yourself.
We got a flat top and a flat bottom on

3364
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:04,480
We got a flat top and a flat bottom on
 

3365
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:27,990
We got a flat top and a flat bottom on
this market in the New York session.

3366
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:28,000

 

3367
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,709

Okay. What we have to be aware of is

3368
01:33:30,709 --> 01:33:30,719
Okay. What we have to be aware of is
 

3369
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:34,709
Okay. What we have to be aware of is
this here

3370
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:34,719

 

3371
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:38,310

and this here. And I don't like this. So

3372
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:38,320
and this here. And I don't like this. So
 

3373
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,870
and this here. And I don't like this. So
I still think this is possible. But if

3374
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:40,880
I still think this is possible. But if
 

3375
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,709
I still think this is possible. But if
they are just going to leave this for

3376
01:33:42,709 --> 01:33:42,719
they are just going to leave this for
 

3377
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:45,350
they are just going to leave this for
whatever reason, this is the next move.

3378
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:45,360
whatever reason, this is the next move.
 

3379
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,430
whatever reason, this is the next move.
And then over here would be this. and we

3380
01:33:47,430 --> 01:33:47,440
And then over here would be this. and we
 

3381
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:48,870
And then over here would be this. and we
would need to respect previous week

3382
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:48,880
would need to respect previous week
 

3383
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,629
would need to respect previous week
value area low which we could not get

3384
01:33:50,629 --> 01:33:50,639
value area low which we could not get
 

3385
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:53,590
value area low which we could not get
back inside yet. So this is saying that

3386
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:53,600
back inside yet. So this is saying that
 

3387
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:54,950
back inside yet. So this is saying that
they don't want to go back into the old

3388
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:54,960
they don't want to go back into the old
 

3389
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,750
they don't want to go back into the old
balance right now. This old balance that

3390
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:57,760
balance right now. This old balance that
 

3391
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:00,470
balance right now. This old balance that
we left which we've traded away from.

3392
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:00,480
we left which we've traded away from.
 

3393
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,990
we left which we've traded away from.
They don't want to get back inside it

3394
01:34:01,990 --> 01:34:02,000
They don't want to get back inside it
 

3395
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,830
They don't want to get back inside it
yet.

3396
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:03,840
yet.
 

3397
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,350
yet.
So first attempt this morning was

3398
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:05,360
So first attempt this morning was
 

3399
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,870
So first attempt this morning was
rejected. That's first attempt on the

3400
01:34:06,870 --> 01:34:06,880
rejected. That's first attempt on the
 

3401
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:37,990
rejected. That's first attempt on the
week.

3402
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:38,000

 

3403
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,189

hanging around BW right now. Market

3404
01:34:41,189 --> 01:34:41,199
hanging around BW right now. Market
 

3405
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:51,350
hanging around BW right now. Market
feels very sleepy at this point.

3406
01:34:51,350 --> 01:34:51,360

 

3407
01:34:51,360 --> 01:35:15,030

Another node here.

3408
01:35:15,030 --> 01:35:15,040

 

3409
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,470

40s is still the level where those

3410
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:16,480
40s is still the level where those
 

3411
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,590
40s is still the level where those
sellers were. It's where they're trying

3412
01:35:17,590 --> 01:35:17,600
sellers were. It's where they're trying
 

3413
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,350
sellers were. It's where they're trying
to test to see if that seller is going

3414
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:19,360
to test to see if that seller is going
 

3415
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:23,430
to test to see if that seller is going
to be there.

3416
01:35:23,430 --> 01:35:23,440

 

3417
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:26,229

1450 if they lift

3418
01:35:26,229 --> 01:35:26,239
1450 if they lift
 

3419
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:31,830
1450 if they lift
and then previous day high 53s.

3420
01:35:31,830 --> 01:35:31,840

 

3421
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,990

It's trying. It is trying. Here we go.

3422
01:35:33,990 --> 01:35:34,000
It's trying. It is trying. Here we go.
 

3423
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,430
It's trying. It is trying. Here we go.
Here's the 40s test. This is where the

3424
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:35,440
Here's the 40s test. This is where the
 

3425
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,070
Here's the 40s test. This is where the
seller came in this morning

3426
01:35:38,070 --> 01:35:38,080
seller came in this morning
 

3427
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:40,870
seller came in this morning
here to 50. They're lifting. So they can

3428
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:40,880
here to 50. They're lifting. So they can
 

3429
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:44,149
here to 50. They're lifting. So they can
they push 40 to 50 now. offering 60s now

3430
01:35:44,149 --> 01:35:44,159
they push 40 to 50 now. offering 60s now
 

3431
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:49,669
they push 40 to 50 now. offering 60s now
as well. Imbalance here up into 61s

3432
01:35:49,669 --> 01:35:49,679
as well. Imbalance here up into 61s
 

3433
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:55,030
as well. Imbalance here up into 61s
from 9:43 this morning.

3434
01:35:55,030 --> 01:35:55,040

 

3435
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:59,990

Here we go.

3436
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:00,000

 

3437
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,390

Make sure you're selling your profits on

3438
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:02,400
Make sure you're selling your profits on
 

3439
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:16,310
Make sure you're selling your profits on
the way. I'm out of this at this point.

3440

3441
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,830

question is, do they put in a giant

squeeze or do they start reselling this
 

3445
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,430
squeeze or do they start reselling this

it's messy though.

up. If they keep holding, they can
squeeze him. If they let go of this,

squeeze him. If they let go of this,
 

3575
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:36,950
squeeze him. If they let go of this,
there's a move down to 20s. Big if

3585
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:55,430

maybe down to VW up for that pullback.

maybe down to VW up for that pullback.

It's possible.

That was aggressive there. As soon as we

3610
01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:39,520
That was aggressive there. As soon as we
 

3611
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,950
That was aggressive there. As soon as we
broke that, I was like, "Yep, I'm having

Let me explain something to you. If I
 

3623
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:03,109

3625
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:05,030
say if we let go of 40, we're going to
trade down to VWAP. Where do you think

3626
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:05,040
trade down to VWAP. Where do you think
 

3627
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:08,629

Obviously at the level that we're

3638
01:44:17,910 --> 01:44:17,920
Obviously at the level that we're
 

3639
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:20,629
Obviously at the level that we're

3642
01:44:23,270 --> 01:44:23,280
that level. Maybe it's your first day
 

3643
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,030
that level. Maybe it's your first day
here, but

3644
01:44:25,030 --> 01:44:25,040
here, but
 

3645
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:28,629
here, but
I will not guess bottoms on markets. I

3646
01:44:28,629 --> 01:44:28,639
I will not guess bottoms on markets. I
 

3647
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:31,830
I will not guess bottoms on markets. I
will let volume prove to me that

3648
01:44:31,830 --> 01:44:31,840
will let volume prove to me that
 

3649
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,229
will let volume prove to me that
participants are stuck. I will let

3650
01:44:34,229 --> 01:44:34,239
participants are stuck. I will let
 

3651
01:44:34,239 --> 01:44:35,750
participants are stuck. I will let

3652
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:35,760

3653
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,229

prove to me that participants are stuck.

3654
01:44:38,229 --> 01:44:38,239
prove to me that participants are stuck.
 

3655
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:40,390
prove to me that participants are stuck.
And then I will trade down to the next

3656
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:40,400
And then I will trade down to the next
 

3657
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:41,990
And then I will trade down to the next
level. All right. If they want to tag

3658
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:42,000

3659
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,910

3663
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,910

clean this up. This is not a very nice

3664
01:44:47,910 --> 01:44:47,920
clean this up. This is not a very nice
 

3665
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:49,350
clean this up. This is not a very nice
looking market right now. It needs

3666
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:49,360
looking market right now. It needs
 

3667
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:53,590
looking market right now. It needs
cleaning up both sides in my opinion.

3668
01:44:53,590 --> 01:44:53,600
cleaning up both sides in my opinion.
 

3669

Can't base above that. There's no follow

Can't base above that. There's no follow
through. Base above that, then you're

through. Base above that, then you're
 

3771
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:59,979

it again or is this a failure of value

it again or is this a failure of value
 

3891
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:32,550
it again or is this a failure of value
lower? So, we're going to search for

01:50:32,550 --> 01:50:32,560
lower? So, we're going to search for
 

3893
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:35,510
lower? So, we're going to search for
value higher, which will be where? Well,

3894
01:50:35,510 --> 01:50:35,520
value higher, which will be where? Well,
 

3895
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:38,229
value higher, which will be where? Well,
it would be where we found value for the

3896
01:50:38,229 --> 01:50:38,239
it would be where we found value for the
 

3897
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:41,270
it would be where we found value for the

last four or five weeks up in here. And

then what would not surprise me

then what would not surprise me
 

3901
01:50:44,239 --> 01:50:49,270
then what would not surprise me
is if we do this.

Okay. And then we go, hey,

surprised to see us back in that death

01:51:32,950 --> 01:51:32,960
But trading NQ minis on H1 won't work
 

3921
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:34,310
But trading NQ minis on H1 won't work
for me. My accounts won't be able to

3922
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:34,320
for me. My accounts won't be able to
 

3923
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:38,390
for me. My accounts won't be able to
handle that. You don't trade them. Uh

3924
01:51:38,390 --> 01:51:38,400
handle that. You don't trade them. Uh
 

3925
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,390
handle that. You don't trade them. Uh
try to make sense of this for you. You

3926
01:51:40,390 --> 01:51:40,400
try to make sense of this for you. You
 

3927
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,709
try to make sense of this for you. You
need to create a story line. All right?

3928
01:51:42,709 --> 01:51:42,719
need to create a story line. All right?
 

3929
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:45,750
need to create a story line. All right?
So if you come to the market with me

3930
01:51:45,750 --> 01:51:45,760
So if you come to the market with me
 

3931
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:48,870
So if you come to the market with me
each day at 9:15 market time, what do I

3932
01:51:48,870 --> 01:51:48,880
each day at 9:15 market time, what do I
 

3933
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:51,510
each day at 9:15 market time, what do I
do? Start on the daily. I think about

3934
01:51:51,510 --> 01:51:51,520
do? Start on the daily. I think about
 

3935
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:53,430
do? Start on the daily. I think about
what my narrative is in on the daily.

3936
01:51:53,430 --> 01:51:53,440
what my narrative is in on the daily.
 

3937
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,830
what my narrative is in on the daily.
Then I move to an hourly. I look at

3938
01:51:55,830 --> 01:51:55,840
Then I move to an hourly. I look at
 

3939
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,830
Then I move to an hourly. I look at
value. I create a story line. Are we

3940
01:51:57,830 --> 01:51:57,840
value. I create a story line. Are we
 

3941
01:51:57,840 --> 01:51:59,669
value. I create a story line. Are we
leaving value? Are we searching for

3942
01:51:59,669 --> 01:51:59,679
leaving value? Are we searching for
 

3943
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:01,669
leaving value? Are we searching for
value? Do we have trapped sellers? Do we

3944
01:52:01,669 --> 01:52:01,679
value? Do we have trapped sellers? Do we
 

3945
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:03,189
value? Do we have trapped sellers? Do we
have trapped buyers? Are they above us?

3946
01:52:03,189 --> 01:52:03,199
have trapped buyers? Are they above us?
 

3947
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:04,950
have trapped buyers? Are they above us?
Are they below us? I create a story out

3948
01:52:04,950 --> 01:52:04,960
Are they below us? I create a story out
 

3949
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,390
Are they below us? I create a story out
of that. Then we look at the five

3950
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:06,400
of that. Then we look at the five
 

3951
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,910
of that. Then we look at the five
minute. What have we done overnight?

3952
01:52:07,910 --> 01:52:07,920
minute. What have we done overnight?
 

3953
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:09,430
minute. What have we done overnight?
Who's in control of the market? Where

3954
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:09,440
Who's in control of the market? Where
 

3955
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:11,750
Who's in control of the market? Where
are they stuck? Then we move down into

3956
01:52:11,750 --> 01:52:11,760
are they stuck? Then we move down into
 

3957
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:14,470
are they stuck? Then we move down into
the M1 or you can stay on M5, whatever

3958
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:14,480
the M1 or you can stay on M5, whatever
 

3959
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:16,229
the M1 or you can stay on M5, whatever
is comfortable with you. And you trade

3960
01:52:16,229 --> 01:52:16,239
is comfortable with you. And you trade
 

3961
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:18,870
is comfortable with you. And you trade
your story line. Today the story line

3962
01:52:18,870 --> 01:52:18,880
your story line. Today the story line
 

3963
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:20,550
your story line. Today the story line
had to be willing to flip. We talked

3964
01:52:20,550 --> 01:52:20,560
had to be willing to flip. We talked
 

3965
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:22,390
had to be willing to flip. We talked
about it like I'm bullish if we hold

3966
01:52:22,390 --> 01:52:22,400
about it like I'm bullish if we hold
 

3967
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:24,629
about it like I'm bullish if we hold
previous week's value for a rotation

3968
01:52:24,629 --> 01:52:24,639
previous week's value for a rotation
 

3969
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:26,629
previous week's value for a rotation
back upside to the naked point of

3970
01:52:26,629 --> 01:52:26,639
back upside to the naked point of
 

3971
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:28,709
back upside to the naked point of
control. If we lose value and we lose

3972
01:52:28,709 --> 01:52:28,719
control. If we lose value and we lose
 

3973
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:31,510
control. If we lose value and we lose
650, I should be bearish for the move

3974
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:31,520
650, I should be bearish for the move
 

3975
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:33,910
650, I should be bearish for the move
back down to previous day value area

3976
01:52:33,910 --> 01:52:33,920
back down to previous day value area
 

3977
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:35,669
back down to previous day value area
high. Obviously, I didn't take that.

3978
01:52:35,669 --> 01:52:35,679
high. Obviously, I didn't take that.
 

3979
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:39,430
high. Obviously, I didn't take that.
Hopefully, lots of you guys did.

3980
01:52:39,430 --> 01:52:39,440
Hopefully, lots of you guys did.
 

3981
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:41,189
Hopefully, lots of you guys did.
You don't need to trade the H1, but it

3982
01:52:41,189 --> 01:52:41,199
You don't need to trade the H1, but it
 

3983
01:52:41,199 --> 01:52:46,870
You don't need to trade the H1, but it
will help you create the narrative.

4043
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:09,750
25150
will open the door to 25,000. Okay. So

4044
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:09,760
will open the door to 25,000. Okay. So
 

4045
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:15,510
will open the door to 25,000. Okay. So
let's see what we got

4046
01:54:15,510 --> 01:54:15,520

 

4047
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:18,070

opened up this week. Shorter trading

4048
01:54:18,070 --> 01:54:18,080
opened up this week. Shorter trading
 

4049
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:22,629
opened up this week. Shorter trading
week. Remember we had to defend 9700 900

4050
01:54:22,629 --> 01:54:22,639
week. Remember we had to defend 9700 900
 

4051
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:25,270
week. Remember we had to defend 9700 900
700. We open up underneath it. Okay.

4052
01:54:25,270 --> 01:54:25,280
700. We open up underneath it. Okay.
 

4053
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:27,669
700. We open up underneath it. Okay.
Underneath it. Underneath those levels.

4054
01:54:27,669 --> 01:54:27,679
Underneath it. Underneath those levels.
 

4055
01:54:27,679 --> 01:54:30,709
Underneath it. Underneath those levels.
What did I say? I was looking at

4056
01:54:30,709 --> 01:54:30,719
What did I say? I was looking at
 

4057
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:33,750
What did I say? I was looking at
580 to 500 zone to be defended. Okay. We

4058
01:54:33,750 --> 01:54:33,760
580 to 500 zone to be defended. Okay. We
 

4059
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:36,470
580 to 500 zone to be defended. Okay. We
can't reclaim it on Tuesday's push right

4060
01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:36,480
can't reclaim it on Tuesday's push right
 

4061
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:38,390
can't reclaim it on Tuesday's push right
here or Sunday. Is it Sunday's push?

4062
01:54:38,390 --> 01:54:38,400
here or Sunday. Is it Sunday's push?
 

4063
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,950
here or Sunday. Is it Sunday's push?
Sunday's push. We can't reclaim it and

4064
01:54:40,950 --> 01:54:40,960
Sunday's push. We can't reclaim it and
 

4065
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:43,830
Sunday's push. We can't reclaim it and
we can't reclaim it on Monday.

4066
01:54:43,830 --> 01:54:43,840
we can't reclaim it on Monday.
 

4067
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:48,790
we can't reclaim it on Monday.
Then we said

4068
01:54:48,790 --> 01:54:48,800

 

4069
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:53,350

350 old naked point of control 350 right

4070
01:54:53,350 --> 01:54:53,360
350 old naked point of control 350 right
 

4071
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:55,990
350 old naked point of control 350 right
here. Right this zone here. If we fail

4072
01:54:55,990 --> 01:54:56,000
here. Right this zone here. If we fail
 

4073
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,950
here. Right this zone here. If we fail
350, rotation will start to take place

4074
01:54:58,950 --> 01:54:58,960
350, rotation will start to take place
 

4075
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:03,750
350, rotation will start to take place
for 150 to 25,000. So we fail 350 and we

4076
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:03,760
for 150 to 25,000. So we fail 350 and we
 

4077
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:07,990
for 150 to 25,000. So we fail 350 and we
trade to under 150 and then 25,000. So

4078
01:55:07,990 --> 01:55:08,000
trade to under 150 and then 25,000. So
 

4079
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,790
trade to under 150 and then 25,000. So
we see every bearish sector happen early

4080
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:10,800
we see every bearish sector happen early
 

4081
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,550
we see every bearish sector happen early
in the week. Right? We've hit all the

4082
01:55:12,550 --> 01:55:12,560
in the week. Right? We've hit all the
 

4083
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:18,550

01:59:43,589 --> 01:59:43,599
without bookmap or footprint. I do need
 

4231
01:59:43,599 --> 01:59:45,109
without bookmap or footprint. I do need
at least one of those. But I could

4232
01:59:45,109 --> 01:59:45,119
at least one of those. But I could
 

4233
01:59:45,119 --> 01:59:47,430
at least one of those. But I could
probably make do without one of them for

4234
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:47,440
probably make do without one of them for
 

4235
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:49,750
probably make do without one of them for
sure. But they just give me so much

4236
01:59:49,750 --> 01:59:49,760
sure. But they just give me so much
 

4237
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:51,430
sure. But they just give me so much
edge.

4238
01:59:51,430 --> 01:59:51,440
edge.
 

4239
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:54,470
edge.
So much edge in the market that you

4240
01:59:54,470 --> 01:59:54,480
So much edge in the market that you
 

4241
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:56,470
So much edge in the market that you
won't get elsewhere. You can't see where

4242
01:59:56,470 --> 01:59:56,480
won't get elsewhere. You can't see where
 

4243
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:58,470
won't get elsewhere. You can't see where
the buyers and sellers are stuck to the

4244
01:59:58,470 --> 01:59:58,480
the buyers and sellers are stuck to the
 

4245
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:00,870
the buyers and sellers are stuck to the
tick without some form of data like

4246
02:00:00,870 --> 02:00:00,880
tick without some form of data like
 

4247
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:02,070
tick without some form of data like
that. You're not going to see it in

4248
02:00:02,070 --> 02:00:02,080
that. You're not going to see it in
 

4249
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:04,229
that. You're not going to see it in
candles. But I mean, you you don't need

4250
02:00:04,229 --> 02:00:04,239
candles. But I mean, you you don't need
 

4251
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:05,830
candles. But I mean, you you don't need
to start off that way. I think the first

4252
02:00:05,830 --> 02:00:05,840
to start off that way. I think the first
 

4253
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:07,109
to start off that way. I think the first
thing you need to learn when you come

4254
02:00:07,109 --> 02:00:07,119
thing you need to learn when you come
 

4255
02:00:07,119 --> 02:00:09,430
thing you need to learn when you come
into the market is understand structure,

used to understanding
 

4269
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:23,750
used to understanding
even like basic EMA principles like when

even like basic EMA principles like when
 

4271

we're trading down and hugging them like
 

4273
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:28,390

this is like when I get annoyed myself.
 

4275
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:31,189
this is like when I get annoyed myself.
We go into a cell, we reject flow zones

4276
02:00:31,189 --> 02:00:31,199
We go into a cell, we reject flow zones
 

4277
02:00:31,199 --> 02:00:34,390
We go into a cell, we reject flow zones
once, twice, three times, four times.

4278

once, twice, three times, four times.
 

4279
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:36,149
once, twice, three times, four times.
Like all I had to do was sell that.

4280
02:00:36,149 --> 02:00:36,159
Like all I had to do was sell that.
 

4281
02:00:36,159 --> 02:00:37,669
Like all I had to do was sell that.
We're now hugging it back the other way.

4282
02:00:37,669 --> 02:00:37,679
We're now hugging it back the other way.
 

4283

All the time we're holding this. We're

4286
02:00:41,350 --> 02:00:41,360
All the time we're holding this. We're
 

4287
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:42,629
All the time we're holding this. We're
buying. We let go of this. It probably

4288
02:00:42,629 --> 02:00:42,639
buying. We let go of this. It probably
 

4289
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:45,910
buying. We let go of this. It probably
goes into a sell again.

4290
02:00:45,910 --> 02:00:45,920
goes into a sell again.
 

4291
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:47,910
goes into a sell again.
So, I would learn basic principles

4292
02:00:47,910 --> 02:00:47,920
So, I would learn basic principles
 

4293
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:49,830
So, I would learn basic principles
first, which is why I say do the 20our

4294
02:00:49,830 --> 02:00:49,840
first, which is why I say do the 20our
 

4295
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:51,669
first, which is why I say do the 20our
course. Well, do everything for free on

4303
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:00,950
learn, you'll get the,
you know, you'll learn more than most

4304
02:01:00,950 --> 02:01:00,960
you know, you'll learn more than most
 

4305
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,470
you know, you'll learn more than most
people will ever learn and you'll have a

4306
02:01:02,470 --> 02:01:02,480
people will ever learn and you'll have a
 

4307

people will ever learn and you'll have a
good understanding of how the market

good understanding of how the market
moves. Then look at order flow once you

4480
02:05:04,149 --> 02:05:04,159
Um, we will probably trade through that
 

4481
02:05:04,159 --> 02:05:05,510
Um, we will probably trade through that
now if we trade up there because we've

4482
02:05:05,510 --> 02:05:05,520
now if we trade up there because we've
 

4483
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:09,030
now if we trade up there because we've
already been up there. Um,

4484
02:05:09,030 --> 02:05:09,040
already been up there. Um,
 

4485
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:12,149
already been up there. Um,
yeah, 660 to

4486
02:05:12,149 --> 02:05:12,159
yeah, 660 to
 

4487
02:05:12,159 --> 02:05:15,270
yeah, 660 to
670

4488
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:15,280

 

4489
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:19,030

here,

4490
02:05:19,030 --> 02:05:19,040

 

4491
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:21,589

right? This block here is where we

4492
02:05:21,589 --> 02:05:21,599
right? This block here is where we
 

4493
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:23,109
right? This block here is where we
traded aggressively away from them. The

4494
02:05:23,109 --> 02:05:23,119
traded aggressively away from them. The
 

4495
02:05:23,119 --> 02:05:24,709
traded aggressively away from them. The
buyers got stuck at the highs. Buyers

4496
02:05:24,709 --> 02:05:24,719
buyers got stuck at the highs. Buyers
 

4497
02:05:24,719 --> 02:05:26,550
buyers got stuck at the highs. Buyers
are stuck at 89 and above. We can

4498
02:05:26,550 --> 02:05:26,560
are stuck at 89 and above. We can
 

4499
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:28,709
are stuck at 89 and above. We can
actually call it 84 and above. So, this

4500
02:05:28,709 --> 02:05:28,719
actually call it 84 and above. So, this
 

4501
02:05:28,719 --> 02:05:30,950
actually call it 84 and above. So, this
block trades up to 70 is where the

4502
02:05:30,950 --> 02:05:30,960
block trades up to 70 is where the
 

4503
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:32,310
block trades up to 70 is where the
sellers came in this morning. You can

4504
02:05:32,310 --> 02:05:32,320
sellers came in this morning. You can
 

4505
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:33,750
sellers came in this morning. You can
see if they reoffer there. If they don't

4506
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:33,760
see if they reoffer there. If they don't
 

4507
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:35,270
see if they reoffer there. If they don't
reoffer there, we probably come up and

4508
02:05:35,270 --> 02:05:35,280
reoffer there, we probably come up and
 

4509
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:46,310
reoffer there, we probably come up and
test 88 all the way up to 700. Right.

4510
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:46,320

Let's get it up to 450 plus. Smash that
 

4709
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:22,870
Let's get it up to 450 plus. Smash that

4710
02:11:22,870 --> 02:11:22,880

02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:25,430
like button and then we're going to do
some giveaways on stream. Give you guys

4712
02:11:25,430 --> 02:11:25,440
some giveaways on stream. Give you guys
 

4713
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:35,830
some giveaways on stream. Give you guys
some accounts.

4714
02:11:35,830 --> 02:11:35,840

 

4715
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:40,229

What do I think it's going to do? Well,

4716
02:11:40,229 --> 02:11:40,239
What do I think it's going to do? Well,
 

4717
02:11:40,239 --> 02:11:41,669
What do I think it's going to do? Well,
it really depends if we can find

4718
02:11:41,669 --> 02:11:41,679
it really depends if we can find
 

4719
02:11:41,679 --> 02:11:43,750
it really depends if we can find
acceptance above this. If we're willing

4720
02:11:43,750 --> 02:11:43,760
acceptance above this. If we're willing
 

4721
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:45,990
acceptance above this. If we're willing
to find acceptance here, then I think

4722
02:11:45,990 --> 02:11:46,000
to find acceptance here, then I think
 

4723
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:47,589
to find acceptance here, then I think
it's got a shot of doing this and coming

4724
02:11:47,589 --> 02:11:47,599
it's got a shot of doing this and coming
 

4725
02:11:47,599 --> 02:11:49,189
it's got a shot of doing this and coming
back inside there. And then it might

4726
02:11:49,189 --> 02:11:49,199
back inside there. And then it might
 

4727
02:11:49,199 --> 02:11:51,030
back inside there. And then it might
very well have a force breakout inside

4728
02:11:51,030 --> 02:11:51,040
very well have a force breakout inside
 

4729
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:54,629
very well have a force breakout inside
that. If we keep getting stuck here, all

4730
02:11:54,629 --> 02:11:54,639
that. If we keep getting stuck here, all
 

4731
02:11:54,639 --> 02:11:55,750
that. If we keep getting stuck here, all
right, we're going to have to pay

4732
02:11:55,750 --> 02:11:55,760
right, we're going to have to pay
 

4733
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:57,669
right, we're going to have to pay
attention to a rotation. If it does a

4734
02:11:57,669 --> 02:11:57,679
attention to a rotation. If it does a
 

4735
02:11:57,679 --> 02:11:59,430
attention to a rotation. If it does a
false break and a rotation down to here

4736
02:11:59,430 --> 02:11:59,440
false break and a rotation down to here
 

4737
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:00,790
false break and a rotation down to here
under this, you'll probably see

4738
02:12:00,790 --> 02:12:00,800
under this, you'll probably see
 

4739
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:04,149
under this, you'll probably see
weakness. But, you know, I'd be somewhat

4740
02:12:04,149 --> 02:12:04,159
weakness. But, you know, I'd be somewhat
 

4741
02:12:04,159 --> 02:12:06,149
weakness. But, you know, I'd be somewhat
careful. This is a scalpy day. This is

4742
02:12:06,149 --> 02:12:06,159
careful. This is a scalpy day. This is
 

4743
02:12:06,159 --> 02:12:08,149
careful. This is a scalpy day. This is
not a day to sit and hold forever at the

4744
02:12:08,149 --> 02:12:08,159
not a day to sit and hold forever at the
 

4745
02:12:08,159 --> 02:12:11,350
not a day to sit and hold forever at the
moment.

4746
02:12:11,350 --> 02:12:11,360

 

4747
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:13,270

All I know right now is we're above

4748
02:12:13,270 --> 02:12:13,280
All I know right now is we're above
 

4749
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:15,030
All I know right now is we're above
previous days value high. So, we're

4750
02:12:15,030 --> 02:12:15,040
previous days value high. So, we're
 

4751
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:17,430
previous days value high. So, we're
shifting value up,

4752
02:12:17,430 --> 02:12:17,440
shifting value up,
 

4753
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:19,350
shifting value up,
but we can't get above previous week's

4754
02:12:19,350 --> 02:12:19,360
but we can't get above previous week's
 

4755
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:22,390
but we can't get above previous week's
value. So, we failed and we haven't done

4756
02:12:22,390 --> 02:12:22,400
value. So, we failed and we haven't done
 

4757
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:24,790
value. So, we failed and we haven't done
a clean retest and we haven't taken this

4758
02:12:24,790 --> 02:12:24,800
a clean retest and we haven't taken this
 

4759
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:27,510
a clean retest and we haven't taken this
out. So, I think we're going to do a

4760
02:12:27,510 --> 02:12:27,520
out. So, I think we're going to do a
 

4761
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:29,830
out. So, I think we're going to do a
dance in here. That's my feeling at the

4762
02:12:29,830 --> 02:12:29,840
dance in here. That's my feeling at the
 

4763
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:33,189
dance in here. That's my feeling at the
moment. We do a dance. Build liquidity.

4764
02:12:33,189 --> 02:12:33,199
moment. We do a dance. Build liquidity.
 

4765
02:12:33,199 --> 02:12:36,149
moment. We do a dance. Build liquidity.
It's a build liquidity kind of day. We

4766
02:12:36,149 --> 02:12:36,159
It's a build liquidity kind of day. We
 

4767
02:12:36,159 --> 02:12:38,229
It's a build liquidity kind of day. We
haven't taken out either side of initial

4768
02:12:38,229 --> 02:12:38,239
haven't taken out either side of initial
 

4769
02:12:38,239 --> 02:12:41,189
haven't taken out either side of initial
balance. Right. Both both IBS have been

4770
02:12:41,189 --> 02:12:41,199
balance. Right. Both both IBS have been
 

4771
02:12:41,199 --> 02:12:43,589
balance. Right. Both both IBS have been
left completely clean. Same on ES.

4772
02:12:43,589 --> 02:12:43,599
left completely clean. Same on ES.
 

4773
02:12:43,599 --> 02:12:46,149
left completely clean. Same on ES.
Completely clean. Both sides need

4774
02:12:46,149 --> 02:12:46,159
Completely clean. Both sides need
 

4775
02:12:46,159 --> 02:12:47,910
Completely clean. Both sides need
repairing in my mind because they don't

4776
02:12:47,910 --> 02:12:47,920
repairing in my mind because they don't
 

4777
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:49,750
repairing in my mind because they don't
have

4778
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:49,760
have
 

4779
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:56,310
have
trap players. Enough trap players

4780
02:12:56,310 --> 02:12:56,320

 

4781
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:58,310

just got here. How do you do today? Any

4782
02:12:58,310 --> 02:12:58,320
just got here. How do you do today? Any
 

4783
02:12:58,320 --> 02:12:59,910
just got here. How do you do today? Any
lowhanging fruit winners? Dean, I've

4784
02:12:59,910 --> 02:12:59,920
lowhanging fruit winners? Dean, I've
 

4785
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:02,709
lowhanging fruit winners? Dean, I've
missed an absolute sitter, mate. I

4786
02:13:02,709 --> 02:13:02,719
missed an absolute sitter, mate. I
 

4787
02:13:02,719 --> 02:13:04,149
missed an absolute sitter, mate. I
missed a sitter. You're getting here

4788
02:13:04,149 --> 02:13:04,159
missed a sitter. You're getting here
 

4789
02:13:04,159 --> 02:13:05,510
missed a sitter. You're getting here
just in time. I probably just stopped

4790
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:05,520
just in time. I probably just stopped
 

4791
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:06,629
just in time. I probably just stopped
moaning about it and you're going to

4792
02:13:06,629 --> 02:13:06,639
moaning about it and you're going to
 

4793
02:13:06,639 --> 02:13:08,069
moaning about it and you're going to
make me moan about it again. I'm just

4794
02:13:08,069 --> 02:13:08,079
make me moan about it again. I'm just
 

4795
02:13:08,079 --> 02:13:09,830
make me moan about it again. I'm just
playing. Uh, we should have been short

4796
02:13:09,830 --> 02:13:09,840
playing. Uh, we should have been short
 

4797
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:11,510
playing. Uh, we should have been short
here. So, we were waiting to see if we

4798
02:13:11,510 --> 02:13:11,520
here. So, we were waiting to see if we
 

4799
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:13,030
here. So, we were waiting to see if we
found acceptance here for the long and I

4800
02:13:13,030 --> 02:13:13,040
found acceptance here for the long and I
 

4801
02:13:13,040 --> 02:13:14,390
found acceptance here for the long and I
said if we fail this, we need to be

4802
02:13:14,390 --> 02:13:14,400
said if we fail this, we need to be
 

4803
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:15,990
said if we fail this, we need to be
thinking about short down to previous

4804
02:13:15,990 --> 02:13:16,000
thinking about short down to previous
 

4805
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:17,750
thinking about short down to previous
day value. I think lots of guys got this

4806
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:17,760
day value. I think lots of guys got this
 

4807
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:19,990
day value. I think lots of guys got this
short. I think I took a little scalp

4808
02:13:19,990 --> 02:13:20,000
short. I think I took a little scalp
 

4809
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:23,109
short. I think I took a little scalp
long here, short back in. We never hit

4810
02:13:23,109 --> 02:13:23,119
long here, short back in. We never hit
 

4811
02:13:23,119 --> 02:13:25,589
long here, short back in. We never hit
target annoyingly. And then I had this

4812
02:13:25,589 --> 02:13:25,599
target annoyingly. And then I had this
 

4813
02:13:25,599 --> 02:13:28,870
target annoyingly. And then I had this
attempt long from here, stopped back out

4814
02:13:28,870 --> 02:13:28,880
attempt long from here, stopped back out
 

4815
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:30,629
attempt long from here, stopped back out
and it went again. And then I rejoined

4816
02:13:30,629 --> 02:13:30,639
and it went again. And then I rejoined
 

4817
02:13:30,639 --> 02:13:32,310
and it went again. And then I rejoined
long here and I just sold on that push.

4818
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:32,320
long here and I just sold on that push.
 

4819
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:33,430
long here and I just sold on that push.
Didn't hold long enough because I didn't

4820
02:13:33,430 --> 02:13:33,440
Didn't hold long enough because I didn't
 

4821
02:13:33,440 --> 02:13:36,629
Didn't hold long enough because I didn't
trust it. So, it's been an okay day. Um,

4822
02:13:36,629 --> 02:13:36,639
trust it. So, it's been an okay day. Um,
 

4823
02:13:36,639 --> 02:13:38,870
trust it. So, it's been an okay day. Um,
and then I took

4824
02:13:38,870 --> 02:13:38,880
and then I took
 

4825
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:43,750
and then I took
this short here to here as well.

4826
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:43,760
this short here to here as well.
 

4827
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:45,669
this short here to here as well.
So what I took I can show you what I

4828
02:13:45,669 --> 02:13:45,679
So what I took I can show you what I
 

4829
02:13:45,679 --> 02:13:48,310
So what I took I can show you what I
took.

4830
02:13:48,310 --> 02:13:48,320
took.
 

4831
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:53,109
took.
I was long or

4832
02:13:53,109 --> 02:13:53,119

 

4833
02:13:53,119 --> 02:14:00,390

just a scalp here

4834
02:14:00,390 --> 02:14:00,400

 

4835
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:06,550

and then I was

4836
02:14:06,550 --> 02:14:06,560

 

4837
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:12,870

along here.

4838
02:14:12,870 --> 02:14:12,880

 

4839
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:18,310

And then I was long again.

4840
02:14:18,310 --> 02:14:18,320

 

4841
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:23,270

Scalpy kind of day. Very small in here.

4842
02:14:23,270 --> 02:14:23,280

 

4843
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:29,350

And then I was short

4844
02:14:29,350 --> 02:14:29,360

 

4845
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:33,430

under 40 or this move here.

4846
02:14:33,430 --> 02:14:33,440
under 40 or this move here.
 

4847
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:36,470
under 40 or this move here.
And that's all I've done.

4848
02:14:36,470 --> 02:14:36,480
And that's all I've done.
 

4849
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:39,109
And that's all I've done.
Small trades. Not not not the biggest

4850
02:14:39,109 --> 02:14:39,119
Small trades. Not not not the biggest
 

4851
02:14:39,119 --> 02:14:42,310
Small trades. Not not not the biggest
trade. 40 pointer.

4852
02:14:42,310 --> 02:14:42,320
trade. 40 pointer.
 

4853
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:47,270
trade. 40 pointer.
How big is that? Even see 21 points. 40

4854
02:14:47,270 --> 02:14:47,280
How big is that? Even see 21 points. 40
 

4855
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:52,470
How big is that? Even see 21 points. 40

4857
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:54,870
points. 40 points. 40 80 120 140 points
I got out today. Basically,

4858
02:14:54,870 --> 02:14:54,880
I got out today. Basically,
 

4859
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:56,550
I got out today. Basically,
this this here was the was the killer

4860
02:14:56,550 --> 02:14:56,560
this this here was the was the killer
 

4861
02:14:56,560 --> 02:14:59,589
this this here was the was the killer
move. And this if it didn't if it

4862
02:14:59,589 --> 02:14:59,599
move. And this if it didn't if it
 

4863
02:14:59,599 --> 02:15:00,870
move. And this if it didn't if it
if [snorts] this was clean, we would be

4864
02:15:00,870 --> 02:15:00,880
if [snorts] this was clean, we would be
 

4865
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:03,189
if [snorts] this was clean, we would be
in it, right? If we cleaned this up and

4866
02:15:03,189 --> 02:15:03,199
in it, right? If we cleaned this up and
 

4867
02:15:03,199 --> 02:15:04,870
in it, right? If we cleaned this up and
did this, we'd be in this sitting in

4868
02:15:04,870 --> 02:15:04,880
did this, we'd be in this sitting in
 

4869
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:06,310
did this, we'd be in this sitting in
trend long to come out the other side.

4870
02:15:06,310 --> 02:15:06,320
trend long to come out the other side.
 

4871
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:08,470
trend long to come out the other side.
If we'd cleaned this up, I'd be long to

4872
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:08,480
If we'd cleaned this up, I'd be long to
 

4873
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:11,510
If we'd cleaned this up, I'd be long to
take this out.

4874
02:15:11,510 --> 02:15:11,520
take this out.
 

4875
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:13,990
take this out.
It is what it is.

4876
02:15:13,990 --> 02:15:14,000
It is what it is.
 

4877
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,870
It is what it is.
It is what it is.

4878
02:15:16,870 --> 02:15:16,880
It is what it is.
 

4879
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:18,870
It is what it is.
Long to that pullback into here. Nice,

4880
02:15:18,870 --> 02:15:18,880
Long to that pullback into here. Nice,
 

4881
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:22,069
Long to that pullback into here. Nice,
Tyson. Nice. So, 50 60 points. You might

4882
02:15:22,069 --> 02:15:22,079
Tyson. Nice. So, 50 60 points. You might
 

4883
02:15:22,079 --> 02:15:23,990
Tyson. Nice. So, 50 60 points. You might
well like like I said, if we can get

4884
02:15:23,990 --> 02:15:24,000
well like like I said, if we can get
 

4885
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,229
well like like I said, if we can get
acceptance over here, where are those

4886
02:15:26,229 --> 02:15:26,239
acceptance over here, where are those
 

4887
02:15:26,239 --> 02:15:29,430
acceptance over here, where are those
buyers caught? The the buyers are up at

4888
02:15:29,430 --> 02:15:29,440
buyers caught? The the buyers are up at
 

4889
02:15:29,440 --> 02:15:31,750
buyers caught? The the buyers are up at
90s, right? So how we react there is

4890
02:15:31,750 --> 02:15:31,760
90s, right? So how we react there is
 

4891
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:33,109
90s, right? So how we react there is
going to be key. But if you can get

4892
02:15:33,109 --> 02:15:33,119
going to be key. But if you can get
 

4893
02:15:33,119 --> 02:15:36,149
going to be key. But if you can get
through 90s,

4894
02:15:36,149 --> 02:15:36,159
through 90s,
 

4895
02:15:36,159 --> 02:15:38,149
through 90s,
get through here and get through value,

4896
02:15:38,149 --> 02:15:38,159
get through here and get through value,
 

4897
02:15:38,159 --> 02:15:40,390
get through here and get through value,
then I think we make a new high day.

4898
02:15:40,390 --> 02:15:40,400
then I think we make a new high day.
 

4899
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:42,310
then I think we make a new high day.
Right? If we get through 90s and we get

4900
02:15:42,310 --> 02:15:42,320
Right? If we get through 90s and we get
 

4901
02:15:42,320 --> 02:15:43,830
Right? If we get through 90s and we get
through previous week value, we will

4902
02:15:43,830 --> 02:15:43,840
through previous week value, we will
 

4903
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:55,750
through previous week value, we will
make a new high day in my mind.

4904
02:15:55,750 --> 02:15:55,760

 

4905
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:59,910

Flow zone still holding bullish.

4906
02:15:59,910 --> 02:15:59,920

 

4907
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:03,189

Okay, we need 25ish

4908
02:16:03,189 --> 02:16:03,199
Okay, we need 25ish
 

4909
02:16:03,199 --> 02:16:05,350
Okay, we need 25ish
27 more likes here, folks, and then

4910
02:16:05,350 --> 02:16:05,360
27 more likes here, folks, and then
 

4911
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:09,830
27 more likes here, folks, and then
we'll do some giveaways on stream.

4912
02:16:09,830 --> 02:16:09,840

 

4913
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:11,990

Nice, Tyson. Another big day for you.

4914
02:16:11,990 --> 02:16:12,000
Nice, Tyson. Another big day for you.
 

4915
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:15,750
Nice, Tyson. Another big day for you.
Love it.

4916
02:16:15,750 --> 02:16:15,760

 

4917
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:18,709

How do I set my anchor VP? Uh, just from

4918
02:16:18,709 --> 02:16:18,719
How do I set my anchor VP? Uh, just from
 

4919
02:16:18,719 --> 02:16:21,430
How do I set my anchor VP? Uh, just from
the 930.

4920
02:16:21,430 --> 02:16:21,440
the 930.
 

4921
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:23,030
the 930.
So,

4922
02:16:23,030 --> 02:16:23,040
So,
 

4923
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:24,790
So,
in here,

4924
02:16:24,790 --> 02:16:24,800
in here,
 

4925
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:26,470
in here,
anchored volume profile, and just click

4926
02:16:26,470 --> 02:16:26,480
anchored volume profile, and just click
 

4927
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:32,469
anchored volume profile, and just click
on 930. That's all I do.

4928
02:16:32,469 --> 02:16:32,479

 

4929
02:16:32,479 --> 02:16:40,709

Yeah, still stuck at that New York open.

4930
02:16:40,709 --> 02:16:40,719

 

4931
02:16:40,719 --> 02:16:42,709

Where can I get the order indicator that

4932
02:16:42,709 --> 02:16:42,719
Where can I get the order indicator that
 

4933
02:16:42,719 --> 02:16:45,990
Where can I get the order indicator that
is above your head? That's Bookmap

4934
02:16:45,990 --> 02:16:46,000
is above your head? That's Bookmap
 

4935
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,230
is above your head? That's Bookmap
Bookmap Pro. You can get it on I think

4936
02:16:48,230 --> 02:16:48,240
Bookmap Pro. You can get it on I think
 

4937
02:16:48,240 --> 02:16:49,509
Bookmap Pro. You can get it on I think
there might be a link down below, but

4938
02:16:49,509 --> 02:16:49,519
there might be a link down below, but
 

4939
02:16:49,519 --> 02:16:52,549
there might be a link down below, but
you can get it.

4940
02:16:52,549 --> 02:16:52,559
you can get it.
 

4941
02:16:52,559 --> 02:16:58,950
you can get it.
It's a paid indicator, paid platform.

4942
02:16:58,950 --> 02:16:58,960

 

4943
02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:00,070

Alex, when you're looking for trapped

4944
02:17:00,070 --> 02:17:00,080
Alex, when you're looking for trapped
 

4945
02:17:00,080 --> 02:17:02,150
Alex, when you're looking for trapped
traders, does price have to move a

4946
02:17:02,150 --> 02:17:02,160
traders, does price have to move a
 

4947
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:04,469
traders, does price have to move a
certain number of points against them

4948
02:17:04,469 --> 02:17:04,479
certain number of points against them
 

4949
02:17:04,479 --> 02:17:06,070
certain number of points against them
before you decide they're trapped? It's

4950
02:17:06,070 --> 02:17:06,080
before you decide they're trapped? It's
 

4951
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:08,309
before you decide they're trapped? It's
a good question, Rob. It's more about

4952
02:17:08,309 --> 02:17:08,319
a good question, Rob. It's more about
 

4953
02:17:08,319 --> 02:17:10,070
a good question, Rob. It's more about
where they come in and volume. All

4954
02:17:10,070 --> 02:17:10,080
where they come in and volume. All
 

4955
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:12,070
where they come in and volume. All
right, so

4956
02:17:12,070 --> 02:17:12,080
right, so
 

4957
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:22,070
right, so
let's look at now.

4958
02:17:22,070 --> 02:17:22,080

 

4959
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:24,389

Right.

4960
02:17:24,389 --> 02:17:24,399
Right.
 

4961
02:17:24,399 --> 02:17:27,990
Right.
If we have

4962
02:17:27,990 --> 02:17:28,000

 

4963
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:32,790

volume built out,

4964
02:17:32,790 --> 02:17:32,800

 

4965
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:37,509

let's say here

4966
02:17:37,509 --> 02:17:37,519

 

4967
02:17:37,519 --> 02:17:39,669

with a spike and lots of buyers caught

4968
02:17:39,669 --> 02:17:39,679
with a spike and lots of buyers caught
 

4969
02:17:39,679 --> 02:17:42,790
with a spike and lots of buyers caught
in here, and then we move under these

4970
02:17:42,790 --> 02:17:42,800
in here, and then we move under these
 

4971
02:17:42,800 --> 02:17:45,349
in here, and then we move under these
levels, we can use their pain to rotate

4972
02:17:45,349 --> 02:17:45,359
levels, we can use their pain to rotate
 

4973
02:17:45,359 --> 02:17:48,950
levels, we can use their pain to rotate
down. Right? So, it's not so much the

4974
02:17:48,950 --> 02:17:48,960
down. Right? So, it's not so much the
 

4975
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:51,030
down. Right? So, it's not so much the
points, it's the amount of participants

4976
02:17:51,030 --> 02:17:51,040
points, it's the amount of participants
 

4977
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:53,669
points, it's the amount of participants
that are trapped. So, why didn't I love

4978
02:17:53,669 --> 02:17:53,679
that are trapped. So, why didn't I love
 

4979
02:17:53,679 --> 02:17:55,589
that are trapped. So, why didn't I love
the low of day? I wonder what it would

4980
02:17:55,589 --> 02:17:55,599
the low of day? I wonder what it would
 

4981
02:17:55,599 --> 02:17:57,110
the low of day? I wonder what it would
show on here compared to Ninja. It' be

4982
02:17:57,110 --> 02:17:57,120
show on here compared to Ninja. It' be
 

4983
02:17:57,120 --> 02:17:59,750
show on here compared to Ninja. It' be
interesting.

4984
02:17:59,750 --> 02:17:59,760
interesting.
 

4985
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:01,669
interesting.
This

4986
02:18:01,669 --> 02:18:01,679
This
 

4987
02:18:01,679 --> 02:18:03,750
This
is not a good auction at the lows.

4988
02:18:03,750 --> 02:18:03,760
is not a good auction at the lows.
 

4989
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:06,150
is not a good auction at the lows.
Right, we have buying delta down here at

4990
02:18:06,150 --> 02:18:06,160
Right, we have buying delta down here at
 

4991
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:08,629
Right, we have buying delta down here at
these lows. It's not what I want to see.

4992
02:18:08,629 --> 02:18:08,639
these lows. It's not what I want to see.
 

4993
02:18:08,639 --> 02:18:11,910
these lows. It's not what I want to see.
What I want to see at these lows is a

4994
02:18:11,910 --> 02:18:11,920
What I want to see at these lows is a
 

4995
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:15,429
What I want to see at these lows is a
longer wick and this be all red, right?

4996
02:18:15,429 --> 02:18:15,439
longer wick and this be all red, right?
 

4997
02:18:15,439 --> 02:18:17,349
longer wick and this be all red, right?
I want to see this all be sellers

4998
02:18:17,349 --> 02:18:17,359
I want to see this all be sellers
 

4999
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:18,950
I want to see this all be sellers
because then what does it mean? It means

5000
02:18:18,950 --> 02:18:18,960
because then what does it mean? It means
 

5001
02:18:18,960 --> 02:18:20,950
because then what does it mean? It means
under here if we've got, remember this

5002
02:18:20,950 --> 02:18:20,960
under here if we've got, remember this
 

5003
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:22,950
under here if we've got, remember this
is delta. So whatever this showing is

5004
02:18:22,950 --> 02:18:22,960
is delta. So whatever this showing is
 

5005
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:25,190
is delta. So whatever this showing is
aggressive players or market players,

5006
02:18:25,190 --> 02:18:25,200
aggressive players or market players,
 

5007
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:26,709
aggressive players or market players,
people hitting the market. So if we see

5008
02:18:26,709 --> 02:18:26,719
people hitting the market. So if we see
 

5009
02:18:26,719 --> 02:18:29,669
people hitting the market. So if we see
aggressive sellers, but we move up, what

5010
02:18:29,669 --> 02:18:29,679
aggressive sellers, but we move up, what
 

5011
02:18:29,679 --> 02:18:32,150
aggressive sellers, but we move up, what
does it mean? It means a passive buyer,

5012
02:18:32,150 --> 02:18:32,160
does it mean? It means a passive buyer,
 

5013
02:18:32,160 --> 02:18:34,950
does it mean? It means a passive buyer,
right? A limit buyer is absorbing to

5014
02:18:34,950 --> 02:18:34,960
right? A limit buyer is absorbing to
 

5015
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:36,629
right? A limit buyer is absorbing to
move higher. That is a good end of

5016
02:18:36,629 --> 02:18:36,639
move higher. That is a good end of
 

5017
02:18:36,639 --> 02:18:38,629
move higher. That is a good end of
auction. Then what we've seen here is

5018
02:18:38,629 --> 02:18:38,639
auction. Then what we've seen here is
 

5019
02:18:38,639 --> 02:18:41,030
auction. Then what we've seen here is
not a good end of auction. That is not a

5020
02:18:41,030 --> 02:18:41,040
not a good end of auction. That is not a
 

5021
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:43,509
not a good end of auction. That is not a
good end of auction. And that's why I

5022
02:18:43,509 --> 02:18:43,519
good end of auction. And that's why I
 

5023
02:18:43,519 --> 02:18:45,669
good end of auction. And that's why I
felt very uncomfortable about holding

5024
02:18:45,669 --> 02:18:45,679
felt very uncomfortable about holding
 

5025
02:18:45,679 --> 02:18:48,309
felt very uncomfortable about holding
the long position.

5026
02:18:48,309 --> 02:18:48,319
the long position.
 

5027
02:18:48,319 --> 02:18:51,589
the long position.
We're now going to scream upside.

5028
02:18:51,589 --> 02:18:51,599
We're now going to scream upside.
 

5029
02:18:51,599 --> 02:18:52,950
We're now going to scream upside.
Remember I said where the buyers are

5030
02:18:52,950 --> 02:18:52,960
Remember I said where the buyers are
 

5031
02:18:52,960 --> 02:18:55,030
Remember I said where the buyers are
caught up here. They're caught right

5032
02:18:55,030 --> 02:18:55,040
caught up here. They're caught right
 

5033
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:57,190
caught up here. They're caught right
here

5034
02:18:57,190 --> 02:18:57,200
here
 

5035
02:18:57,200 --> 02:19:07,750
here
around these 90s. You see these guys,

5036
02:19:07,750 --> 02:19:07,760

 

5037
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:10,309

right? All these guys got caught. That's

5038
02:19:10,309 --> 02:19:10,319
right? All these guys got caught. That's
 

5039
02:19:10,319 --> 02:19:11,990
right? All these guys got caught. That's
their pain point. So if they they are

5040
02:19:11,990 --> 02:19:12,000
their pain point. So if they they are
 

5041
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,349
their pain point. So if they they are
either going to get out there or we're

5042
02:19:13,349 --> 02:19:13,359
either going to get out there or we're
 

5043
02:19:13,359 --> 02:19:14,950
either going to get out there or we're
going to trade above and do what? Fill

5044
02:19:14,950 --> 02:19:14,960
going to trade above and do what? Fill
 

5045
02:19:14,960 --> 02:19:17,030
going to trade above and do what? Fill
this imbalance. What do we have at high

5046
02:19:17,030 --> 02:19:17,040
this imbalance. What do we have at high
 

5047
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:19,429
this imbalance. What do we have at high
of day? Not a good auction either.

5048
02:19:19,429 --> 02:19:19,439
of day? Not a good auction either.
 

5049
02:19:19,439 --> 02:19:21,030
of day? Not a good auction either.
There's not many buyers caught up at

5050
02:19:21,030 --> 02:19:21,040
There's not many buyers caught up at
 

5051
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:22,709
There's not many buyers caught up at
these high days, right? This is just

5052
02:19:22,709 --> 02:19:22,719
these high days, right? This is just
 

5053
02:19:22,719 --> 02:19:24,309
these high days, right? This is just
strong selling to open the day. Big

5054
02:19:24,309 --> 02:19:24,319
strong selling to open the day. Big
 

5055
02:19:24,319 --> 02:19:26,870
strong selling to open the day. Big
print selling. So, we might well come

5056
02:19:26,870 --> 02:19:26,880
print selling. So, we might well come
 

5057
02:19:26,880 --> 02:19:28,870
print selling. So, we might well come
and fill

5058
02:19:28,870 --> 02:19:28,880
and fill
 

5059
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:30,870
and fill
this imbalance, right? It's a huge

5060
02:19:30,870 --> 02:19:30,880
this imbalance, right? It's a huge
 

5061
02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:32,389
this imbalance, right? It's a huge
sellside imbalance. There are so many

5062
02:19:32,389 --> 02:19:32,399
sellside imbalance. There are so many
 

5063
02:19:32,399 --> 02:19:33,750
sellside imbalance. There are so many
orders there, we just moved away from

5064
02:19:33,750 --> 02:19:33,760
orders there, we just moved away from
 

5065
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:35,270
orders there, we just moved away from
it. We might well come and fill it.

5066
02:19:35,270 --> 02:19:35,280
it. We might well come and fill it.
 

5067
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:37,349
it. We might well come and fill it.
Would not surprise me. So, it's not so

5068
02:19:37,349 --> 02:19:37,359
Would not surprise me. So, it's not so
 

5069
02:19:37,359 --> 02:19:38,870
Would not surprise me. So, it's not so
much about the points that we move away

5070
02:19:38,870 --> 02:19:38,880
much about the points that we move away
 

5071
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:40,629
much about the points that we move away
from. It's more about how they're

5072
02:19:40,629 --> 02:19:40,639
from. It's more about how they're
 

5073
02:19:40,639 --> 02:19:42,309
from. It's more about how they're
trapped. How many are trapped? What does

5074
02:19:42,309 --> 02:19:42,319
trapped. How many are trapped? What does
 

5075
02:19:42,319 --> 02:19:44,150
trapped. How many are trapped? What does
it look like? What does it feel like?

5076
02:19:44,150 --> 02:19:44,160
it look like? What does it feel like?
 

5077
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:45,910
it look like? What does it feel like?
How's the volume been built out when we

5078
02:19:45,910 --> 02:19:45,920
How's the volume been built out when we
 

5079
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:48,790
How's the volume been built out when we
combine that with like this? All right,

5080
02:19:48,790 --> 02:19:48,800
combine that with like this? All right,
 

5081
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:50,230
combine that with like this? All right,
let's say we just talked about this

5082
02:19:50,230 --> 02:19:50,240
let's say we just talked about this
 

5083
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:52,550
let's say we just talked about this
level here, this node. Let's say that

5084
02:19:52,550 --> 02:19:52,560
level here, this node. Let's say that
 

5085
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:54,230
level here, this node. Let's say that
these are all buyers caught and we can

5086
02:19:54,230 --> 02:19:54,240
these are all buyers caught and we can
 

5087
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:55,750
these are all buyers caught and we can
see it on the footprint and we do this.

5088
02:19:55,750 --> 02:19:55,760
see it on the footprint and we do this.
 

5089
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:57,110
see it on the footprint and we do this.
Then what we going to trade for? Well,

5090
02:19:57,110 --> 02:19:57,120
Then what we going to trade for? Well,
 

5091
02:19:57,120 --> 02:19:58,550
Then what we going to trade for? Well,
we can trade down here. The problem is

5092
02:19:58,550 --> 02:19:58,560
we can trade down here. The problem is
 

5093
02:19:58,560 --> 02:20:00,790
we can trade down here. The problem is
we're counter trend. What's really nice

5094
02:20:00,790 --> 02:20:00,800
we're counter trend. What's really nice
 

5095
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:03,429
we're counter trend. What's really nice
is if we build out bigger and do

5096
02:20:03,429 --> 02:20:03,439
is if we build out bigger and do
 

5097
02:20:03,439 --> 02:20:05,429
is if we build out bigger and do
something like that, then that's where

5098
02:20:05,429 --> 02:20:05,439
something like that, then that's where
 

5099
02:20:05,439 --> 02:20:07,429
something like that, then that's where
we get the big moves. That's very

5100
02:20:07,429 --> 02:20:07,439
we get the big moves. That's very
 

5101
02:20:07,439 --> 02:20:13,190
we get the big moves. That's very
similar to yesterday.

5102
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:13,200

 

5103
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:21,910

Move that.

5104
02:20:21,910 --> 02:20:21,920

 

5105
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:26,230

It's the same thing as yesterday.

5106
02:20:26,230 --> 02:20:26,240
It's the same thing as yesterday.
 

5107
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:28,230
It's the same thing as yesterday.
Is this yesterday? That's Friday. Where

5108
02:20:28,230 --> 02:20:28,240
Is this yesterday? That's Friday. Where
 

5109
02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:34,950
Is this yesterday? That's Friday. Where
have I gone?

5110
02:20:34,950 --> 02:20:34,960

 

5111
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:37,830

This move here yesterday.

5112
02:20:37,830 --> 02:20:37,840
This move here yesterday.
 

5113
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:43,270
This move here yesterday.
Same thing. All right. Even Woff

5114
02:20:43,270 --> 02:20:43,280
Same thing. All right. Even Woff
 

5115
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:46,870
Same thing. All right. Even Woff
spring sign of strength trap players. We

5116
02:20:46,870 --> 02:20:46,880
spring sign of strength trap players. We
 

5117
02:20:46,880 --> 02:20:48,150
spring sign of strength trap players. We
knew that there were buyers trapped

5118
02:20:48,150 --> 02:20:48,160
knew that there were buyers trapped
 

5119
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:49,750
knew that there were buyers trapped
above 80s yesterday. I can remember

5120
02:20:49,750 --> 02:20:49,760
above 80s yesterday. I can remember
 

5121
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:51,429
above 80s yesterday. I can remember
saying it. So, it's more about

5122
02:20:51,429 --> 02:20:51,439
saying it. So, it's more about
 

5123
02:20:51,439 --> 02:20:53,030
saying it. So, it's more about
aggressively leaving the level and

5124
02:20:53,030 --> 02:20:53,040
aggressively leaving the level and
 

5125
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:54,870
aggressively leaving the level and
joining for that. If there's a lot of

5126
02:20:54,870 --> 02:20:54,880
joining for that. If there's a lot of
 

5127
02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:57,590
joining for that. If there's a lot of
volume built, we will often aggressively

5128
02:20:57,590 --> 02:20:57,600
volume built, we will often aggressively
 

5129
02:20:57,600 --> 02:20:59,349
volume built, we will often aggressively
leave without looking back. If there's

5130
02:20:59,349 --> 02:20:59,359
leave without looking back. If there's
 

5131
02:20:59,359 --> 02:21:00,790
leave without looking back. If there's
not enough volume built, you'll get a

5132
02:21:00,790 --> 02:21:00,800
not enough volume built, you'll get a
 

5133
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:03,910
not enough volume built, you'll get a
retest. So, like here, we offered

5134
02:21:03,910 --> 02:21:03,920
retest. So, like here, we offered
 

5135
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:12,070
retest. So, like here, we offered
retests, right?

5136
02:21:12,070 --> 02:21:12,080

 

5137
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:14,389

Right. I would imagine if we'd done

5138
02:21:14,389 --> 02:21:14,399
Right. I would imagine if we'd done
 

5139
02:21:14,399 --> 02:21:17,429
Right. I would imagine if we'd done
something like this, we wouldn't retest.

5140
02:21:17,429 --> 02:21:17,439
something like this, we wouldn't retest.
 

5141
02:21:17,439 --> 02:21:18,710
something like this, we wouldn't retest.
We would never come back for that

5142
02:21:18,710 --> 02:21:18,720
We would never come back for that
 

5143
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:20,469
We would never come back for that
because there'd be so many trapped.

5144
02:21:20,469 --> 02:21:20,479
because there'd be so many trapped.
 

5145
02:21:20,479 --> 02:21:21,830
because there'd be so many trapped.
They'll just be forced to cover and

5146
02:21:21,830 --> 02:21:21,840
They'll just be forced to cover and
 

5147
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:23,349
They'll just be forced to cover and
cover and cover and cover and cover and

5148
02:21:23,349 --> 02:21:23,359
cover and cover and cover and cover and
 

5149
02:21:23,359 --> 02:21:25,830
cover and cover and cover and cover and
then we just keep bidding up.

5150
02:21:25,830 --> 02:21:25,840
then we just keep bidding up.
 

5151
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:28,070
then we just keep bidding up.
Um, which is kind of probably what we

5152
02:21:28,070 --> 02:21:28,080
Um, which is kind of probably what we
 

5153
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:31,110
Um, which is kind of probably what we
got on that news print yesterday. Okay.

5154
02:21:31,110 --> 02:21:31,120
got on that news print yesterday. Okay.
 

5155
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:33,349
got on that news print yesterday. Okay.
So, so from here once the news comes

5156
02:21:33,349 --> 02:21:33,359
So, so from here once the news comes
 

5157
02:21:33,359 --> 02:21:36,870
So, so from here once the news comes
out, it's a rush to cover. We're never

5158
02:21:36,870 --> 02:21:36,880
out, it's a rush to cover. We're never
 

5159
02:21:36,880 --> 02:21:39,030
out, it's a rush to cover. We're never
coming back for this when there's a rush

5160
02:21:39,030 --> 02:21:39,040
coming back for this when there's a rush
 

5161
02:21:39,040 --> 02:21:41,349
coming back for this when there's a rush
to cover. There's no reason to. They're

5162
02:21:41,349 --> 02:21:41,359
to cover. There's no reason to. They're
 

5163
02:21:41,359 --> 02:21:43,190
to cover. There's no reason to. They're
all gone. Then we're not coming back to

5164
02:21:43,190 --> 02:21:43,200
all gone. Then we're not coming back to
 

5165
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:49,510
all gone. Then we're not coming back to
fill that in. Not anytime soon.

5166
02:21:49,510 --> 02:21:49,520

 

5167
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:50,950

All right, Tyson, you might look good

5168
02:21:50,950 --> 02:21:50,960
All right, Tyson, you might look good
 

5169
02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:52,469
All right, Tyson, you might look good
here, mate. We're coming in for this

5170
02:21:52,469 --> 02:21:52,479
here, mate. We're coming in for this
 

5171
02:21:52,479 --> 02:21:54,070
here, mate. We're coming in for this
previous week close level, the 90s.

5172
02:21:54,070 --> 02:21:54,080
previous week close level, the 90s.
 

5173
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:55,270
previous week close level, the 90s.
Remember, this is the area we just

5174
02:21:55,270 --> 02:21:55,280
Remember, this is the area we just
 

5175
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:57,590
Remember, this is the area we just
talked about and show you here. This is

5176
02:21:57,590 --> 02:21:57,600
talked about and show you here. This is
 

5177
02:21:57,600 --> 02:21:59,270
talked about and show you here. This is
where all the buyers are caught. So,

5178
02:21:59,270 --> 02:21:59,280
where all the buyers are caught. So,
 

5179
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:00,870
where all the buyers are caught. So,
just exactly what we just talked about.

5180
02:22:00,870 --> 02:22:00,880
just exactly what we just talked about.
 

5181
02:22:00,880 --> 02:22:02,309
just exactly what we just talked about.
All these buyers, this is where they got

5182
02:22:02,309 --> 02:22:02,319
All these buyers, this is where they got
 

5183
02:22:02,319 --> 02:22:04,230
All these buyers, this is where they got
caught earlier. So if they are still

5184
02:22:04,230 --> 02:22:04,240
caught earlier. So if they are still
 

5185
02:22:04,240 --> 02:22:06,070
caught earlier. So if they are still
there, they will might become sellers.

5186
02:22:06,070 --> 02:22:06,080
there, they will might become sellers.
 

5187
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:07,590
there, they will might become sellers.
If they're already out, we have the

5188
02:22:07,590 --> 02:22:07,600
If they're already out, we have the
 

5189
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:20,469
If they're already out, we have the
chance to trade through it. All right.

5190
02:22:20,469 --> 02:22:20,479

 

5191
02:22:20,479 --> 02:22:25,990

I'd say start off at 50K, even 25K.

5240
02:23:30,389 --> 02:23:30,399
I'd say start off at 50K, even 25K.

5245
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:34,790
They like they're just going to be
harder for you to pass. They just

5246
02:23:34,790 --> 02:23:34,800
harder for you to pass. They just
 

5247
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:37,030
harder for you to pass. They just
require more size. And with the trailing

5248
02:23:37,030 --> 02:23:37,040
require more size. And with the trailing
 

5249
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:38,309
require more size. And with the trailing
draw down, it makes it harder and

5250
02:23:38,309 --> 02:23:38,319
draw down, it makes it harder and
 

5251
02:23:38,319 --> 02:23:46,230

the way, is at its New York open. It

5258
02:23:52,710 --> 02:23:52,720

5263
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:59,030

02:24:01,510 --> 02:24:01,520
Sellers have come in here at 66s. So,
 

5267
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:03,830
Sellers have come in here at 66s. So,
buyers want to defend these 66es at the

moment.
 

5271
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:07,590
moment.
Level right here. We can like kind of

5272
02:24:07,590 --> 02:24:07,600
Level right here. We can like kind of
 

5273
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:10,309
Level right here. We can like kind of
flip this right now. Right. This needs

5274
02:24:10,309 --> 02:24:10,319
flip this right now. Right. This needs
 

5275
02:24:10,319 --> 02:24:11,910
flip this right now. Right. This needs
to be an important level for buyers to

5276
02:24:11,910 --> 02:24:11,920
to be an important level for buyers to
 

5277
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:13,830
to be an important level for buyers to
bid off. If they can't bid off it, you

5278
02:24:13,830 --> 02:24:13,840
bid off. If they can't bid off it, you
 

5279
02:24:13,840 --> 02:24:18,790
bid off. If they can't bid off it, you
might see a collapse of it.

5280
02:24:18,790 --> 02:24:18,800

 

5281

02:24:28,230 --> 02:24:28,240
peek at a 30 minute if I just want to

02:24:39,270 --> 02:24:39,280
coming right into a big big pivot level,
 

5299
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:41,110
coming right into a big big pivot level,
guys. So, we're trading back into last

5300
02:24:41,110 --> 02:24:41,120
guys. So, we're trading back into last
 

5301
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:43,270
guys. So, we're trading back into last
Friday's kind of levels here. Uh

5302
02:24:43,270 --> 02:24:43,280
Friday's kind of levels here. Uh
 

5303
02:24:43,280 --> 02:24:44,950
Friday's kind of levels here. Uh
Friday's low would be all the way down

5304
02:24:44,950 --> 02:24:44,960
Friday's low would be all the way down
 

5305
02:24:44,960 --> 02:24:47,190
Friday's low would be all the way down
at 15:30, but we're in the congestion

5306
02:24:47,190 --> 02:24:47,200
at 15:30, but we're in the congestion
 

5307
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:50,790
at 15:30, but we're in the congestion
block from Friday and Thursday and

5308
02:24:50,790 --> 02:24:50,800
block from Friday and Thursday and
 

5309
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:53,830
block from Friday and Thursday and
Tuesday and

5310
02:24:53,830 --> 02:24:53,840
Tuesday and
 

5311
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:57,110
Tuesday and
maybe Monday the 12th and Friday the

5312
02:24:57,110 --> 02:24:57,120
maybe Monday the 12th and Friday the
 

5313
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:59,429
maybe Monday the 12th and Friday the
9th. So, we're into like quite a big

5314
02:24:59,429 --> 02:24:59,439
9th. So, we're into like quite a big
 

5315
02:24:59,439 --> 02:25:01,349
9th. So, we're into like quite a big
kind of area we're trading into at the

5316
02:25:01,349 --> 02:25:01,359
kind of area we're trading into at the
 

5317
02:25:01,359 --> 02:25:03,270
kind of area we're trading into at the
moment. So, we'll see. If we don't flush

5318
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:03,280
moment. So, we'll see. If we don't flush
 

5319
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:05,030
moment. So, we'll see. If we don't flush
through all this, I would expect the VIX

5320
02:25:05,030 --> 02:25:05,040
through all this, I would expect the VIX
 

5321
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:07,349
through all this, I would expect the VIX
to potentially find a bit of a bid.

5322
02:25:07,349 --> 02:25:07,359
to potentially find a bit of a bid.
 

5323
02:25:07,359 --> 02:25:12,309
to potentially find a bit of a bid.

I don't really talk about them much
 

5481
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:40,630
I don't really talk about them much
unless you guys ask, but you'll see all

5482
02:28:40,630 --> 02:28:40,640
unless you guys ask, but you'll see all
 

5483
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:42,630
unless you guys ask, but you'll see all
the links down below, all the firms that

5484
02:28:42,630 --> 02:28:42,640
the links down below, all the firms that
 

5485
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:44,870
the links down below, all the firms that
I work with. Code FCT for most of them

5486
02:28:44,870 --> 02:28:44,880
I work with. Code FCT for most of them
 

5487
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:46,230
I work with. Code FCT for most of them
other than take profit trader, you can

5488
02:28:46,230 --> 02:28:46,240
other than take profit trader, you can
 

5489
02:28:46,240 --> 02:28:48,950
other than take profit trader, you can
use code flow zone over there.

5490
02:28:48,950 --> 02:28:48,960
use code flow zone over there.
 

5491
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:51,670
use code flow zone over there.
Right.

5492
02:28:51,670 --> 02:28:51,680
Right.
 

5493
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:54,070
Right.
Market's still holding this level. We've

5494
02:28:54,070 --> 02:28:54,080
Market's still holding this level. We've
 

5495
02:28:54,080 --> 02:29:01,030
Market's still holding this level. We've
got like 25 minutes left till lunch.

5496
02:29:01,030 --> 02:29:01,040

 

5497
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:03,510

You're welcome, Dominic. Glad it's

5498
02:29:03,510 --> 02:29:03,520
You're welcome, Dominic. Glad it's
 

5499
02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:07,030
You're welcome, Dominic. Glad it's
helped.

5500
02:29:07,030 --> 02:29:07,040

 

5501
02:29:07,040 --> 02:29:14,309

Glad it's helped.

5502
02:29:14,309 --> 02:29:14,319

 

5503
02:29:14,319 --> 02:29:16,230

On the 5minute footprint, would you now

5504
02:29:16,230 --> 02:29:16,240
On the 5minute footprint, would you now
 

5505
02:29:16,240 --> 02:29:27,670
On the 5minute footprint, would you now
say buyers are trapped?

5506
02:29:27,670 --> 02:29:27,680

 

5507
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:29,990

Yes, but we're still supporting the bid.

5508
02:29:29,990 --> 02:29:30,000
Yes, but we're still supporting the bid.
 

5509
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,790
Yes, but we're still supporting the bid.
Yeah. So, we have definitely over this

5510
02:29:32,790 --> 02:29:32,800
Yeah. So, we have definitely over this
 

5511
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:36,309
Yeah. So, we have definitely over this
level here from 71

5512
02:29:36,309 --> 02:29:36,319
level here from 71
 

5513
02:29:36,319 --> 02:29:38,630
level here from 71
up to here, we have buyers caught, but

5514
02:29:38,630 --> 02:29:38,640
up to here, we have buyers caught, but
 

5515
02:29:38,640 --> 02:29:40,469
up to here, we have buyers caught, but
we're not breaking down yet, are we? So,

5516
02:29:40,469 --> 02:29:40,479
we're not breaking down yet, are we? So,
 

5517
02:29:40,479 --> 02:29:42,070
we're not breaking down yet, are we? So,
we have to look left. All right, this

5518
02:29:42,070 --> 02:29:42,080
we have to look left. All right, this
 

5519
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:44,870
we have to look left. All right, this
was the bid support,

5520
02:29:44,870 --> 02:29:44,880
was the bid support,
 

5521
02:29:44,880 --> 02:29:46,550
was the bid support,
right? This was kind of the overunder

5522
02:29:46,550 --> 02:29:46,560
right? This was kind of the overunder
 

5523
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:47,990
right? This was kind of the overunder
these kind of levels here. So we're

5524
02:29:47,990 --> 02:29:48,000
these kind of levels here. So we're
 

5525
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:49,990
these kind of levels here. So we're
still holding. So like yes, there's

5526
02:29:49,990 --> 02:29:50,000
still holding. So like yes, there's
 

5527
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:51,590
still holding. So like yes, there's
buyers caught here, but we need to do

5528
02:29:51,590 --> 02:29:51,600
buyers caught here, but we need to do
 

5529
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:53,510
buyers caught here, but we need to do
this to trade away from it. Does that

5530
02:29:53,510 --> 02:29:53,520
this to trade away from it. Does that
 

5531
02:29:53,520 --> 02:29:55,830
this to trade away from it. Does that
make sense,

5532
02:29:55,830 --> 02:29:55,840
make sense,
 

5533
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:57,750
make sense,
right? So we're still structure can

5534
02:29:57,750 --> 02:29:57,760
right? So we're still structure can
 

5535
02:29:57,760 --> 02:29:59,429
right? So we're still structure can
still be positive here. Definitely they

5536
02:29:59,429 --> 02:29:59,439
still be positive here. Definitely they
 

5537
02:29:59,439 --> 02:30:00,790
still be positive here. Definitely they
are there on some caught up there.

5538
02:30:00,790 --> 02:30:00,800
are there on some caught up there.
 

5539
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:02,870
are there on some caught up there.
There's no doubt about it. But if we

5540
02:30:02,870 --> 02:30:02,880
There's no doubt about it. But if we
 

5541
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:05,110
There's no doubt about it. But if we
come to this, look at how key this pivot

5542
02:30:05,110 --> 02:30:05,120
come to this, look at how key this pivot
 

5543
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:06,630
come to this, look at how key this pivot
is. So what what we're saying right now

5544
02:30:06,630 --> 02:30:06,640
is. So what what we're saying right now
 

5545
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:09,190
is. So what what we're saying right now
is above here buyers are caught. But we

5546
02:30:09,190 --> 02:30:09,200
is above here buyers are caught. But we
 

5547
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:11,670
is above here buyers are caught. But we
need to let go of low volume node of

5548
02:30:11,670 --> 02:30:11,680
need to let go of low volume node of
 

5549
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:14,230
need to let go of low volume node of
this shelf and trade away from it. We're

5550
02:30:14,230 --> 02:30:14,240
this shelf and trade away from it. We're
 

5551
02:30:14,240 --> 02:30:15,750
this shelf and trade away from it. We're
not trading away from it yet. You don't

5552
02:30:15,750 --> 02:30:15,760
not trading away from it yet. You don't
 

5553
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:17,110
not trading away from it yet. You don't
want to like jump the gun. Look at the

5554
02:30:17,110 --> 02:30:17,120
want to like jump the gun. Look at the
 

5555
02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:19,190
want to like jump the gun. Look at the
flow zones. We're supporting the bid,

5556
02:30:19,190 --> 02:30:19,200
flow zones. We're supporting the bid,
 

5557
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:20,389
flow zones. We're supporting the bid,
right? We're supporting the bid. You got

5558
02:30:20,389 --> 02:30:20,399
right? We're supporting the bid. You got
 

5559
02:30:20,399 --> 02:30:21,830
right? We're supporting the bid. You got
to also remember the difference between

5560
02:30:21,830 --> 02:30:21,840
to also remember the difference between
 

5561
02:30:21,840 --> 02:30:23,830
to also remember the difference between
this and like some of the trades we took

5562
02:30:23,830 --> 02:30:23,840
this and like some of the trades we took
 

5563
02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:25,750
this and like some of the trades we took
earlier is we've now built structure.

5564
02:30:25,750 --> 02:30:25,760
earlier is we've now built structure.
 

5565
02:30:25,760 --> 02:30:27,510
earlier is we've now built structure.
When we came up here earlier and I

5566
02:30:27,510 --> 02:30:27,520
When we came up here earlier and I
 

5567
02:30:27,520 --> 02:30:29,510
When we came up here earlier and I
shorted this for the move down, we were

5568
02:30:29,510 --> 02:30:29,520
shorted this for the move down, we were
 

5569
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:31,110
shorted this for the move down, we were
a straight squeeze up and we didn't have

5570
02:30:31,110 --> 02:30:31,120
a straight squeeze up and we didn't have
 

5571
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:32,550
a straight squeeze up and we didn't have
much structure. Look at the difference

5572
02:30:32,550 --> 02:30:32,560
much structure. Look at the difference
 

5573
02:30:32,560 --> 02:30:36,230
much structure. Look at the difference
now.

5574
02:30:36,230 --> 02:30:36,240

 

5575
02:30:36,240 --> 02:30:38,790

They've got structure to bid off, right?

5576
02:30:38,790 --> 02:30:38,800
They've got structure to bid off, right?
 

5577
02:30:38,800 --> 02:30:40,309
They've got structure to bid off, right?
So, if we come down into here and they

5578
02:30:40,309 --> 02:30:40,319
So, if we come down into here and they
 

5579
02:30:40,319 --> 02:30:41,590
So, if we come down into here and they
keep bidding, they can complete the

5580
02:30:41,590 --> 02:30:41,600
keep bidding, they can complete the
 

5581
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:43,830
keep bidding, they can complete the
rotation. You need to see it start to

5582
02:30:43,830 --> 02:30:43,840
rotation. You need to see it start to
 

5583
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:45,590
rotation. You need to see it start to
lose some of these. So, structure is

5584
02:30:45,590 --> 02:30:45,600
lose some of these. So, structure is
 

5585
02:30:45,600 --> 02:30:47,110
lose some of these. So, structure is
important.

5586
02:30:47,110 --> 02:30:47,120
important.
 

5587
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:48,469
important.
The difference between that and like

5588
02:30:48,469 --> 02:30:48,479
The difference between that and like
 

5589
02:30:48,479 --> 02:30:49,990
The difference between that and like
maybe yesterday and the day before we

5590
02:30:49,990 --> 02:30:50,000
maybe yesterday and the day before we
 

5591
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,630
maybe yesterday and the day before we
lacked structure, right? Some of these

5592
02:30:52,630 --> 02:30:52,640
lacked structure, right? Some of these
 

5593
02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:54,790
lacked structure, right? Some of these
amazing shorts. This is something really

5594
02:30:54,790 --> 02:30:54,800
amazing shorts. This is something really
 

5595
02:30:54,800 --> 02:30:56,710
amazing shorts. This is something really
important for you guys to understand.

5596
02:30:56,710 --> 02:30:56,720
important for you guys to understand.
 

5597
02:30:56,720 --> 02:31:02,630
important for you guys to understand.
This where is the structure in here?

5598
02:31:02,630 --> 02:31:02,640

 

5599
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:04,710

No structure, right? So when we trap

5600
02:31:04,710 --> 02:31:04,720
No structure, right? So when we trap
 

5601
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:06,230
No structure, right? So when we trap
buyers up here and we leave it, well,

5602
02:31:06,230 --> 02:31:06,240
buyers up here and we leave it, well,
 

5603
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:07,510
buyers up here and we leave it, well,
where are we going to come to? Well, at

5604
02:31:07,510 --> 02:31:07,520
where are we going to come to? Well, at
 

5605
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:10,550
where are we going to come to? Well, at
the very minimum here.

5606
02:31:10,550 --> 02:31:10,560
the very minimum here.
 

5607
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:12,309
the very minimum here.
And if we lose that all the way back

5608
02:31:12,309 --> 02:31:12,319
And if we lose that all the way back
 

5609
02:31:12,319 --> 02:31:14,550
And if we lose that all the way back
down,

5610
02:31:14,550 --> 02:31:14,560
down,
 

5611
02:31:14,560 --> 02:31:16,150
down,
right? because we didn't build

5612
02:31:16,150 --> 02:31:16,160
right? because we didn't build
 

5613
02:31:16,160 --> 02:31:18,150
right? because we didn't build
structure. Think about it like building

5614
02:31:18,150 --> 02:31:18,160
structure. Think about it like building
 

5615
02:31:18,160 --> 02:31:20,630
structure. Think about it like building
foundations of a house, right? If we'

5616
02:31:20,630 --> 02:31:20,640
foundations of a house, right? If we'
 

5617
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:23,670
foundations of a house, right? If we'
done this D nice pullback, reclaimed,

5618
02:31:23,670 --> 02:31:23,680
done this D nice pullback, reclaimed,
 

5619
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:26,469
done this D nice pullback, reclaimed,
pullback, reclaimed, right? Then this

5620
02:31:26,469 --> 02:31:26,479
pullback, reclaimed, right? Then this
 

5621
02:31:26,479 --> 02:31:27,750
pullback, reclaimed, right? Then this
here, this flush probably would have

5622
02:31:27,750 --> 02:31:27,760
here, this flush probably would have
 

5623
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:29,750
here, this flush probably would have
only come to there, right? And maybe

5624
02:31:29,750 --> 02:31:29,760
only come to there, right? And maybe
 

5625
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:31,110
only come to there, right? And maybe
they get stuck again and maybe it comes

5626
02:31:31,110 --> 02:31:31,120
they get stuck again and maybe it comes
 

5627
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:33,349
they get stuck again and maybe it comes
to here and it would not be this

5628
02:31:33,349 --> 02:31:33,359
to here and it would not be this
 

5629
02:31:33,359 --> 02:31:36,150
to here and it would not be this
straight move down. Structure matters

5630
02:31:36,150 --> 02:31:36,160
straight move down. Structure matters
 

5631
02:31:36,160 --> 02:31:37,910
straight move down. Structure matters
like the building blocks of the market

5632
02:31:37,910 --> 02:31:37,920
like the building blocks of the market
 

5633
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:42,309
like the building blocks of the market
matter.

5634
02:31:42,309 --> 02:31:42,319

 

5635
02:31:42,319 --> 02:31:44,389

Same here.

5636
02:31:44,389 --> 02:31:44,399
Same here.
 

5637
02:31:44,399 --> 02:31:46,389
Same here.
This was the last piece of structure we

I didn't execute

5740
02:34:10,790 --> 02:34:10,800
I didn't execute
 

5741
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:13,670
I didn't execute
super well missing this this morning. I

5742
02:34:13,670 --> 02:34:13,680
super well missing this this morning. I
 

5743
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:16,150
super well missing this this morning. I
we had like what one trade there, one

5744
02:34:16,150 --> 02:34:16,160
we had like what one trade there, one
 

5745
02:34:16,160 --> 02:34:17,830
we had like what one trade there, one
trade there, and then had to join late

5746
02:34:17,830 --> 02:34:17,840
trade there, and then had to join late
 

5747
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:19,670
trade there, and then had to join late
there because I didn't like that. And

5748
02:34:19,670 --> 02:34:19,680
there because I didn't like that. And
 

5749
02:34:19,680 --> 02:34:21,349
there because I didn't like that. And
then that short down and I'm not in this

5750
02:34:21,349 --> 02:34:21,359
then that short down and I'm not in this
 

5751
02:34:21,359 --> 02:34:24,389
then that short down and I'm not in this
now. It's too late for me to long now at

5752
02:34:24,389 --> 02:34:24,399
now. It's too late for me to long now at
 

5753
02:34:24,399 --> 02:34:25,830
now. It's too late for me to long now at
this point. And we're not losing

5754
02:34:25,830 --> 02:34:25,840
this point. And we're not losing
 

5755
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:28,389
this point. And we're not losing
structure for me to short. So, you know,

5756
02:34:28,389 --> 02:34:28,399
structure for me to short. So, you know,
 

5757
02:34:28,399 --> 02:34:31,670
structure for me to short. So, you know,
until we see until I see something like

5758
02:34:31,670 --> 02:34:31,680
until we see until I see something like
 

5759
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:34,150
until we see until I see something like
this, there's nothing really for me to

5760
02:34:34,150 --> 02:34:34,160
this, there's nothing really for me to
 

5761
02:34:34,160 --> 02:34:36,469
this, there's nothing really for me to
do. And it's very possible we won't see

5762
02:34:36,469 --> 02:34:36,479
do. And it's very possible we won't see
 

5763
02:34:36,479 --> 02:34:39,030
do. And it's very possible we won't see
that and we continue to rotate. So I

5764
02:34:39,030 --> 02:34:39,040
that and we continue to rotate. So I
 

5765
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:40,309
that and we continue to rotate. So I
just have to be willing now to be like,

5766
02:34:40,309 --> 02:34:40,319
just have to be willing now to be like,
 

5767
02:34:40,319 --> 02:34:42,389
just have to be willing now to be like,
"Okay, well I've made my money. It's not

5768
02:34:42,389 --> 02:34:42,399
"Okay, well I've made my money. It's not
 

5769
02:34:42,399 --> 02:34:44,150
"Okay, well I've made my money. It's not
the best day. There's new opportunity

5770
02:34:44,150 --> 02:34:44,160
the best day. There's new opportunity
 

5771
02:34:44,160 --> 02:34:46,150
the best day. There's new opportunity
this afternoon or tomorrow." So I'm just

5772
02:34:46,150 --> 02:34:46,160
this afternoon or tomorrow." So I'm just
 

5773
02:34:46,160 --> 02:34:49,270
this afternoon or tomorrow." So I'm just
waiting at the moment.

5774
02:34:49,270 --> 02:34:49,280
waiting at the moment.
 

5775
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:50,630
waiting at the moment.

02:41:15,840 --> 02:41:17,110
uh, Lucid, Tradeify, and Funded Next.
Not in that order, but those are the

6102
02:41:17,110 --> 02:41:17,120
Not in that order, but those are the
 

6103
02:41:17,120 --> 02:41:19,270
Not in that order, but those are the
five. That's who I advise you trade

6104
02:41:19,270 --> 02:41:19,280
five. That's who I advise you trade
 

6105
02:41:19,280 --> 02:41:30,630
five. That's who I advise you trade
with.

6106
02:41:30,630 --> 02:41:30,640

 

6107
02:41:30,640 --> 02:41:32,389

So tapping into these 90s, they've got

6108
02:41:32,389 --> 02:41:32,399
So tapping into these 90s, they've got
 

6109
02:41:32,399 --> 02:41:34,389
So tapping into these 90s, they've got
to get through these 90s and 700s. And

6110
02:41:34,389 --> 02:41:34,399
to get through these 90s and 700s. And
 

6111
02:41:34,399 --> 02:41:35,990
to get through these 90s and 700s. And
if they do that, then we can think about

6112
02:41:35,990 --> 02:41:36,000
if they do that, then we can think about
 

6113
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:37,750
if they do that, then we can think about
that higher day. Look, look at this

6114
02:41:37,750 --> 02:41:37,760
that higher day. Look, look at this
 

6115
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:39,590
that higher day. Look, look at this
imbalance up here, folks. All right,

6116
02:41:39,590 --> 02:41:39,600
imbalance up here, folks. All right,
 

6117
02:41:39,600 --> 02:41:41,750
imbalance up here, folks. All right,
this we barely traded here. This was the

6118
02:41:41,750 --> 02:41:41,760
this we barely traded here. This was the
 

6119
02:41:41,760 --> 02:41:44,150
this we barely traded here. This was the
open print,

6120
02:41:44,150 --> 02:41:44,160
open print,
 

6121
02:41:44,160 --> 02:41:46,150
open print,
right? There was no volume put in here.

6122
02:41:46,150 --> 02:41:46,160
right? There was no volume put in here.
 

6123
02:41:46,160 --> 02:41:50,870
right? There was no volume put in here.
None. It's a huge imbalance.

6124
02:41:50,870 --> 02:41:50,880

 

6125
02:41:50,880 --> 02:41:53,590

It's a huge imbalance, right? So,

6126
02:41:53,590 --> 02:41:53,600
It's a huge imbalance, right? So,
 

6127
02:41:53,600 --> 02:41:55,190
It's a huge imbalance, right? So,
someone asked what like are they stuck

6128
02:41:55,190 --> 02:41:55,200
someone asked what like are they stuck
 

6129
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:56,550
someone asked what like are they stuck
there? And we said yes. And I said, but

6130
02:41:56,550 --> 02:41:56,560
there? And we said yes. And I said, but
 

6131
02:41:56,560 --> 02:41:58,150
there? And we said yes. And I said, but
structure still holding. You can see

6132
02:41:58,150 --> 02:41:58,160
structure still holding. You can see
 

6133
02:41:58,160 --> 02:41:59,750
structure still holding. You can see
it's stuck again, but structure still

6134
02:41:59,750 --> 02:41:59,760
it's stuck again, but structure still
 

6135
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:02,309
it's stuck again, but structure still
holding until you see this move. You

6136
02:42:02,309 --> 02:42:02,319
holding until you see this move. You
 

6137
02:42:02,319 --> 02:42:07,190
holding until you see this move. You
don't want to frontr run stuff.

6138
02:42:07,190 --> 02:42:07,200

 

6139
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:08,790

People get really excited about price

6140
02:42:08,790 --> 02:42:08,800
People get really excited about price
 

6141
02:42:08,800 --> 02:42:10,710
People get really excited about price
coming into a level, but it's like

6142
02:42:10,710 --> 02:42:10,720
coming into a level, but it's like
 

6143
02:42:10,720 --> 02:42:12,630
coming into a level, but it's like
unless we react at that level, there's

6144
02:42:12,630 --> 02:42:12,640
unless we react at that level, there's
 

6145
02:42:12,640 --> 02:42:25,110
unless we react at that level, there's
nothing to get excited about.

6146
02:42:25,110 --> 02:42:25,120

 

6147
02:42:25,120 --> 02:42:26,790

That's footprint, John. That's

6148
02:42:26,790 --> 02:42:26,800
That's footprint, John. That's
 

6149
02:42:26,800 --> 02:42:29,030
That's footprint, John. That's
footprint.

6150
02:42:29,030 --> 02:42:29,040
footprint.
 

6151
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:31,429
footprint.
So, here we go. 90s again. Testing 90s

6152
02:42:31,429 --> 02:42:31,439
So, here we go. 90s again. Testing 90s
 

6153
02:42:31,439 --> 02:42:32,950
So, here we go. 90s again. Testing 90s
again. Someone's now trying to bid 90

6154
02:42:32,950 --> 02:42:32,960
again. Someone's now trying to bid 90
 

6155
02:42:32,960 --> 02:42:36,070
again. Someone's now trying to bid 90
for the squeeze up to 70705.

6156
02:42:36,070 --> 02:42:36,080
for the squeeze up to 70705.
 

6157
02:42:36,080 --> 02:42:38,389
for the squeeze up to 70705.
So, they are trying to bid 90 for that

6158
02:42:38,389 --> 02:42:38,399
So, they are trying to bid 90 for that
 

6159
02:42:38,399 --> 02:42:41,110
So, they are trying to bid 90 for that
squeeze up to 70705. ES is trying to get

6160
02:42:41,110 --> 02:42:41,120
squeeze up to 70705. ES is trying to get
 

6161
02:42:41,120 --> 02:42:50,389
squeeze up to 70705. ES is trying to get
up to its IB high here.

6162
02:42:50,389 --> 02:42:50,399

 

6163
02:42:50,399 --> 02:42:52,070

We are right at the 20-day as well,

6164
02:42:52,070 --> 02:42:52,080
We are right at the 20-day as well,
 

6165
02:42:52,080 --> 02:42:55,030
We are right at the 20-day as well,
folks. This is the other thing like

6166
02:42:55,030 --> 02:42:55,040
folks. This is the other thing like
 

6167
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:56,870
folks. This is the other thing like
these are rotations for anyone that's

6168
02:42:56,870 --> 02:42:56,880
these are rotations for anyone that's
 

6169
02:42:56,880 --> 02:43:00,710
these are rotations for anyone that's
done the course.

6170
02:43:00,710 --> 02:43:00,720

 

6171
02:43:00,720 --> 02:43:03,270

5day,

6172
02:43:03,270 --> 02:43:03,280
5day,
 

6173
02:43:03,280 --> 02:43:04,790
5day,
20-day.

6174
02:43:04,790 --> 02:43:04,800
20-day.
 

6175
02:43:04,800 --> 02:43:08,309
20-day.
Look at that rotation.

6176
02:43:08,309 --> 02:43:08,319

 

6177
02:43:08,319 --> 02:43:11,698

SMASs don't matter, they said.

6178
02:43:11,698 --> 02:43:11,708
SMASs don't matter, they said.
 

6179
02:43:11,708 --> 02:43:13,510
SMASs don't matter, they said.
[laughter]

6180
02:43:13,510 --> 02:43:13,520
[laughter]
 

6181
02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:30,389
[laughter]
Yeah, good one.

6182
02:43:30,389 --> 02:43:30,399

 

6183
02:43:30,399 --> 02:43:31,750

What determines the blue and red

6184
02:43:31,750 --> 02:43:31,760
What determines the blue and red
 

6185
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:34,230
What determines the blue and red
candles? Oh, in this chart, uh, the flow

6186
02:43:34,230 --> 02:43:34,240
candles? Oh, in this chart, uh, the flow
 

6187
02:43:34,240 --> 02:43:36,950
candles? Oh, in this chart, uh, the flow
zones, are we above or below flow zones?

6188
02:43:36,950 --> 02:43:36,960
zones, are we above or below flow zones?
 

6189
02:43:36,960 --> 02:43:39,510
zones, are we above or below flow zones?
So, it's momentum. So, when they're

6190
02:43:39,510 --> 02:43:39,520
So, it's momentum. So, when they're
 

6191
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:41,110
So, it's momentum. So, when they're
green, we have bullish momentum. When

6192
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:41,120
green, we have bullish momentum. When
 

6193
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:43,349
green, we have bullish momentum. When
they're red, they have bearish momentum.

6194
02:43:43,349 --> 02:43:43,359
they're red, they have bearish momentum.
 

6195
02:43:43,359 --> 02:43:44,790
they're red, they have bearish momentum.
Right? When they're red inside, bearish

6196
02:43:44,790 --> 02:43:44,800
Right? When they're red inside, bearish
 

6197
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:46,469
Right? When they're red inside, bearish
momentum. When they're green, bullish

6198
02:43:46,469 --> 02:43:46,479
momentum. When they're green, bullish
 

6199
02:43:46,479 --> 02:43:56,950
momentum. When they're green, bullish
momentum.

6200
02:43:56,950 --> 02:43:56,960

 

6201
02:43:56,960 --> 02:43:59,510

Can I do a dive into ES? You mean just

6202
02:43:59,510 --> 02:43:59,520
Can I do a dive into ES? You mean just
 

6203
02:43:59,520 --> 02:44:02,469
Can I do a dive into ES? You mean just
like now? Look at ES.

6204
02:44:02,469 --> 02:44:02,479
like now? Look at ES.
 

6205
02:44:02,479 --> 02:44:06,630
like now? Look at ES.
You're just coming for IB high.

6206
02:44:06,630 --> 02:44:06,640

 

6207
02:44:06,640 --> 02:44:09,670

It's actually cleaner. Look at this.

6208
02:44:09,670 --> 02:44:09,680
It's actually cleaner. Look at this.
 

6209
02:44:09,680 --> 02:44:13,110
It's actually cleaner. Look at this.
Right. Huge sell, resell, failing to

02:44:13,110 --> 02:44:13,120
Right. Huge sell, resell, failing to
 

6211
02:44:13,120 --> 02:44:15,510
Right. Huge sell, resell, failing to
make a new low. What's this? Inverted

6212
02:44:15,510 --> 02:44:15,520
make a new low. What's this? Inverted
 

6213
02:44:15,520 --> 02:44:17,510
make a new low. What's this? Inverted
head and shoulders, breakout, pullback,

6216
02:44:20,309 --> 02:44:20,319
holds the pivot, grind back up. Target
 

6217
02:44:20,319 --> 02:44:22,790
holds the pivot, grind back up. Target
is this high. It might need a flush

6218
02:44:22,790 --> 02:44:22,800
is this high. It might need a flush
 

6219
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:24,150
is this high. It might need a flush
before it does it. It might be a small

6220
02:44:24,150 --> 02:44:24,160
before it does it. It might be a small
 

6221
02:44:24,160 --> 02:44:26,150
before it does it. It might be a small
flush. Might need to trap in some more

6222
02:44:26,150 --> 02:44:26,160
flush. Might need to trap in some more
 

6223
02:44:26,160 --> 02:44:28,790
flush. Might need to trap in some more
sellers if it's going to do it.

6224
02:44:28,790 --> 02:44:28,800
sellers if it's going to do it.
 

6225
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:31,110
sellers if it's going to do it.
This is very steep. It might need to do

6226
02:44:31,110 --> 02:44:31,120
This is very steep. It might need to do
 

6227
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:32,790
This is very steep. It might need to do
something like this before it's going to

6228
02:44:32,790 --> 02:44:32,800
something like this before it's going to
 

6229
02:44:32,800 --> 02:44:35,190
something like this before it's going to
do it. We'll see. But it's the same

6230
02:44:35,190 --> 02:44:35,200
do it. We'll see. But it's the same
 

6231
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:36,469
do it. We'll see. But it's the same
story. It's just trying to get it to

6232
02:44:36,469 --> 02:44:36,479
story. It's just trying to get it to
 

6233
02:44:36,479 --> 02:44:38,950
story. It's just trying to get it to
that high.

6234
02:44:38,950 --> 02:44:38,960
that high.
 

6235
02:44:38,960 --> 02:44:40,630
that high.
Right

6236
02:44:40,630 --> 02:44:40,640
Right
 

6237
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:42,630
Right
on. We are pretty much there, folks.

6238
02:44:42,630 --> 02:44:42,640
on. We are pretty much there, folks.
 

6239
02:44:42,640 --> 02:44:53,910

We're pretty much there.

6240
02:44:53,910 --> 02:44:53,920

 

6241
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:55,910

Uh, in the course, Aaron, or there might

6242
02:44:55,910 --> 02:44:55,920
Uh, in the course, Aaron, or there might
 

6243
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:58,070
Uh, in the course, Aaron, or there might
be some videos on it. I can't remember.

6244
02:44:58,070 --> 02:44:58,080
be some videos on it. I can't remember.
 

6245
02:44:58,080 --> 02:45:01,190
be some videos on it. I can't remember.
Do I have a code for Tradeify? Yep. FZT

6246
02:45:01,190 --> 02:45:01,200
Do I have a code for Tradeify? Yep. FZT
 

6247
02:45:01,200 --> 02:45:05,910
Do I have a code for Tradeify? Yep. FZT
FCT for Tradeify.

6248
02:45:05,910 --> 02:45:05,920

 

6249
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:08,950

So here's previous week value now. So

6250
02:45:08,950 --> 02:45:08,960
So here's previous week value now. So
 

6251
02:45:08,960 --> 02:45:10,309
So here's previous week value now. So
this is the key level. Can we find

6252
02:45:10,309 --> 02:45:10,319
this is the key level. Can we find
 

6253
02:45:10,319 --> 02:45:11,510
this is the key level. Can we find
acceptance through this? We're through

6254
02:45:11,510 --> 02:45:11,520
acceptance through this? We're through
 

6255
02:45:11,520 --> 02:45:14,070
acceptance through this? We're through
the 90s. We're testing the 700s.

6256
02:45:14,070 --> 02:45:14,080

possible that they flush reflush back

6418
02:53:07,110 --> 02:53:07,120
possible that they flush reflush back
 

6419
02:53:07,120 --> 02:53:08,710
possible that they flush reflush back
down here. I would just be careful of a

6420
02:53:08,710 --> 02:53:08,720
down here. I would just be careful of a
 

6421
02:53:08,720 --> 02:53:11,910
down here. I would just be careful of a
trap happening under this like if they

6422
02:53:11,910 --> 02:53:11,920
trap happening under this like if they
 

6423
02:53:11,920 --> 02:53:13,590
trap happening under this like if they
got unfinished business. I'd be careful

6424
02:53:13,590 --> 02:53:13,600
got unfinished business. I'd be careful
 

6425
02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:15,190
got unfinished business. I'd be careful
of that kind of thing happening there

6426
02:53:15,190 --> 02:53:15,200
of that kind of thing happening there
 

6427
02:53:15,200 --> 02:53:18,710
of that kind of thing happening there
today. Now, so the type of thing they do

6428
02:53:18,710 --> 02:53:18,720
today. Now, so the type of thing they do
 

6429
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:20,630
today. Now, so the type of thing they do
if they want to come higher, I know

6430
02:53:20,630 --> 02:53:20,640
if they want to come higher, I know
 

6431
02:53:20,640 --> 02:53:22,630
if they want to come higher, I know
we've just rejected value, but if they

6432
02:53:22,630 --> 02:53:22,640
we've just rejected value, but if they
 

6433
02:53:22,640 --> 02:53:23,990
we've just rejected value, but if they
want to get acceptance, the type of

6434
02:53:23,990 --> 02:53:24,000
want to get acceptance, the type of
 

6435
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,230
want to get acceptance, the type of
thing they do is to trap under here and

6436
02:53:26,230 --> 02:53:26,240
thing they do is to trap under here and
 

6437
02:53:26,240 --> 02:53:29,349
thing they do is to trap under here and
reclaim so they have short fuel to go

6438
02:53:29,349 --> 02:53:29,359
reclaim so they have short fuel to go
 

6439
02:53:29,359 --> 02:53:31,190
reclaim so they have short fuel to go
higher. If we see strong momentum away

6440
02:53:31,190 --> 02:53:31,200
higher. If we see strong momentum away
 

6441
02:53:31,200 --> 02:53:32,550
higher. If we see strong momentum away
though, there'll be a flush back down

6442
02:53:32,550 --> 02:53:32,560
though, there'll be a flush back down
 

6443
02:53:32,560 --> 02:53:37,429
though, there'll be a flush back down
towards the VWAP.

6444
02:53:37,429 --> 02:53:37,439

 

6445
02:53:37,439 --> 02:53:38,790

I'm done for the day no matter what as

6446
02:53:38,790 --> 02:53:38,800
I'm done for the day no matter what as
 

6447
02:53:38,800 --> 02:53:40,630
I'm done for the day no matter what as
we come into lunch or at least for the

02:53:40,630 --> 02:53:40,640
we come into lunch or at least for the

6471
02:54:48,880 --> 02:54:50,309

So, here we go. It might be this little

6472
02:54:50,309 --> 02:54:50,319
So, here we go. It might be this little
 

6473
02:54:50,319 --> 02:54:54,230
So, here we go. It might be this little
trap we just talked about.

6474

6475
02:54:54,240 --> 02:54:56,469

It's all you've got to do.

6492
02:55:16,150 --> 02:55:16,160
It's all you've got to do.

6495
02:55:23,680 --> 02:55:26,070

Yeah. So, I would say there's potential

6496
02:55:26,070 --> 02:55:26,080
Yeah. So, I would say there's potential
 

6497
02:55:26,080 --> 02:55:27,910
Yeah. So, I would say there's potential
for this trap to play out here. Now,

6498
02:55:27,910 --> 02:55:27,920
for this trap to play out here. Now,
 

6499
02:55:27,920 --> 02:55:29,269
for this trap to play out here. Now,
these are the kind of things I look for

6500
02:55:29,269 --> 02:55:29,279
these are the kind of things I look for
 

6501
02:55:29,279 --> 02:55:31,030
these are the kind of things I look for
when they're trying to get to highs.

6502
02:55:31,030 --> 02:55:31,040
when they're trying to get to highs.
 

6503
02:55:31,040 --> 02:55:32,710
when they're trying to get to highs.
They do these like little sweeps and

6504
02:55:32,710 --> 02:55:32,720
They do these like little sweeps and
 

6505
02:55:32,720 --> 02:55:34,309
They do these like little sweeps and
then they reclaim. We just talked about

6506
02:55:34,309 --> 02:55:34,319
then they reclaim. We just talked about
 

6507
02:55:34,319 --> 02:55:35,670
then they reclaim. We just talked about
this. We literally just talked about it.

6508
02:55:35,670 --> 02:55:35,680
this. We literally just talked about it.
 

6509
02:55:35,680 --> 02:55:37,670
this. We literally just talked about it.
If they hold this, then you know that

6510
02:55:37,670 --> 02:55:37,680
If they hold this, then you know that
 

6511
02:55:37,680 --> 02:55:39,349
If they hold this, then you know that
they're going to come for this up here.

6512
02:55:39,349 --> 02:55:39,359
they're going to come for this up here.
 

6513
02:55:39,359 --> 02:55:41,030
they're going to come for this up here.
If they stay heavy under here on a

6514
02:55:41,030 --> 02:55:41,040
If they stay heavy under here on a
 

6515
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:42,870
If they stay heavy under here on a
rejection, then you're watching VWAP and

6516
02:55:42,870 --> 02:55:42,880
rejection, then you're watching VWAP and
 

6517
02:55:42,880 --> 02:55:45,349
rejection, then you're watching VWAP and
PC down here.

6518
02:55:45,349 --> 02:55:45,359
PC down here.
 

6519
02:55:45,359 --> 02:55:49,269
PC down here.
Um, but that is probably it for me. Um,

6520
02:55:49,269 --> 02:55:49,279
Um, but that is probably it for me. Um,
 

6521
02:55:49,279 --> 02:55:50,630
Um, but that is probably it for me. Um,
I'm going to have to take my dog out for

I'm going to have to take my dog out for
 

6523
02:55:50,640 --> 02:55:52,469
I'm going to have to take my dog out for
a walk.

6524
02:55:52,469 --> 02:55:52,479
a walk.
 

6525
02:55:52,479 --> 02:55:54,469
a walk.
How do I interpret foot footprint for

How do I interpret foot footprint for
 

6527
02:55:54,479 --> 02:55:55,830
How do I interpret foot footprint for
the trap that just happened? I didn't

6528
02:55:55,830 --> 02:55:55,840
the trap that just happened? I didn't
 

6529
02:55:55,840 --> 02:55:57,349
the trap that just happened? I didn't
even watch it to be honest, but there

6530
02:55:57,349 --> 02:55:57,359
even watch it to be honest, but there
 

6531
02:55:57,359 --> 02:56:00,710
even watch it to be honest, but there
you go. There. There you go. So, you

6532
02:56:00,710 --> 02:56:00,720
you go. There. There you go. So, you
 

6533
02:56:00,720 --> 02:56:02,710
you go. There. There you go. So, you
tell me. How do you interpret this? You

6534
02:56:02,710 --> 02:56:02,720
tell me. How do you interpret this? You
 

6535
02:56:02,720 --> 02:56:04,150
tell me. How do you interpret this? You
guys have been with me long enough. What

6536
02:56:04,150 --> 02:56:04,160
guys have been with me long enough. What
 

6537
02:56:04,160 --> 02:56:08,230
guys have been with me long enough. What
has happened under there?

6538
02:56:08,230 --> 02:56:08,240

 

6539
02:56:08,240 --> 02:56:10,309

What has happened under the 60 level?

6540
02:56:10,309 --> 02:56:10,319
What has happened under the 60 level?
 

6541
02:56:10,319 --> 02:56:13,269
What has happened under the 60 level?
The big level that we had the box,

6542
02:56:13,269 --> 02:56:13,279
The big level that we had the box,
 

6543
02:56:13,279 --> 02:56:18,950
The big level that we had the box,
right? The 60. What's happened under 60?

6544
02:56:18,950 --> 02:56:18,960

 

6545
02:56:18,960 --> 02:56:20,790

Sellers are stuck. There you go. You

6546
02:56:20,790 --> 02:56:20,800
Sellers are stuck. There you go. You
 

6547
02:56:20,800 --> 02:56:22,790
Sellers are stuck. There you go. You
guys are clever, right? So, this is

6548
02:56:22,790 --> 02:56:22,800
guys are clever, right? So, this is
 

6549
02:56:22,800 --> 02:56:25,110
guys are clever, right? So, this is
sellers marketing in. This isn't passive

6550
02:56:25,110 --> 02:56:25,120
sellers marketing in. This isn't passive
 

6551
02:56:25,120 --> 02:56:26,389
sellers marketing in. This isn't passive
selling. This is aggressive selling

6552
02:56:26,389 --> 02:56:26,399
selling. This is aggressive selling
 

6553
02:56:26,399 --> 02:56:27,830
selling. This is aggressive selling
marketing in. But where are we going?

6554
02:56:27,830 --> 02:56:27,840
marketing in. But where are we going?
 

6555
02:56:27,840 --> 02:56:30,070
marketing in. But where are we going?
We're going up. So, what does that mean?

6556
02:56:30,070 --> 02:56:30,080
We're going up. So, what does that mean?
 

6557
02:56:30,080 --> 02:56:32,550
We're going up. So, what does that mean?
That means some limit buyer, a limit

6558
02:56:32,550 --> 02:56:32,560
That means some limit buyer, a limit
 

6559
02:56:32,560 --> 02:56:35,190
That means some limit buyer, a limit
buyer or a passive buyer is absorbing

6560
02:56:35,190 --> 02:56:35,200
buyer or a passive buyer is absorbing
 

6561
02:56:35,200 --> 02:56:37,590
buyer or a passive buyer is absorbing
all of this because he wants to complete

6562
02:56:37,590 --> 02:56:37,600
all of this because he wants to complete
 

6563
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:39,670
all of this because he wants to complete
the rotation. All right, so these are

6564
02:56:39,670 --> 02:56:39,680
the rotation. All right, so these are
 

6565
02:56:39,680 --> 02:56:40,870
the rotation. All right, so these are
the kind of things that you will just

6566
02:56:40,870 --> 02:56:40,880
the kind of things that you will just
 

6567
02:56:40,880 --> 02:56:42,790
the kind of things that you will just
get used to seeing over and over again.

6568
02:56:42,790 --> 02:56:42,800
get used to seeing over and over again.
 

6569
02:56:42,800 --> 02:56:44,710
get used to seeing over and over again.
I didn't even need to see that. Like I

6570
02:56:44,710 --> 02:56:44,720
I didn't even need to see that. Like I
 

6571
02:56:44,720 --> 02:56:46,070
I didn't even need to see that. Like I
called it to you. It's likely to happen

6572
02:56:46,070 --> 02:56:46,080
called it to you. It's likely to happen
 

6573
02:56:46,080 --> 02:56:48,950
called it to you. It's likely to happen
here cuz I just I've been in this game

6574
02:56:48,950 --> 02:56:48,960
here cuz I just I've been in this game
 

6575
02:56:48,960 --> 02:56:50,790
here cuz I just I've been in this game
long enough. It doesn't have to happen.

6576
02:56:50,790 --> 02:56:50,800
long enough. It doesn't have to happen.
 

6577
02:56:50,800 --> 02:56:53,190
long enough. It doesn't have to happen.
But normally, if there's a target above

6578
02:56:53,190 --> 02:56:53,200
But normally, if there's a target above
 

6579
02:56:53,200 --> 02:56:54,550
But normally, if there's a target above
that they want to get to and they're

6580
02:56:54,550 --> 02:56:54,560
that they want to get to and they're
 

6581
02:56:54,560 --> 02:56:55,990
that they want to get to and they're
running out of steam, there's only one

6582
02:56:55,990 --> 02:56:56,000
running out of steam, there's only one
 

6583
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:57,510
running out of steam, there's only one
way that they're going to get there and

6584
02:56:57,510 --> 02:56:57,520
way that they're going to get there and
 

6585
02:56:57,520 --> 02:57:00,389
way that they're going to get there and
it's by trapping in more shorts, they

6586
02:57:00,389 --> 02:57:00,399
it's by trapping in more shorts, they
 

6587
02:57:00,399 --> 02:57:02,070
it's by trapping in more shorts, they
pile in now and they've got their stop

6588
02:57:02,070 --> 02:57:02,080
pile in now and they've got their stop
 

6589
02:57:02,080 --> 02:57:03,510
pile in now and they've got their stop
there. Guess what happens when we get

6590
02:57:03,510 --> 02:57:03,520
there. Guess what happens when we get
 

6591
02:57:03,520 --> 02:57:05,990
there. Guess what happens when we get
there? You get that push, right? So,

6592
02:57:05,990 --> 02:57:06,000
there? You get that push, right? So,
 

6593
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:07,830
there? You get that push, right? So,
exactly. It's absorption. If we trade

6594
02:57:07,830 --> 02:57:07,840
exactly. It's absorption. If we trade
 

6595
02:57:07,840 --> 02:57:09,990
exactly. It's absorption. If we trade
back under that though, that's where you

6596
02:57:09,990 --> 02:57:10,000
back under that though, that's where you
 

6597
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:15,429
back under that though, that's where you
might see this fade into here.

6598
02:57:15,429 --> 02:57:15,439

 

6599
02:57:15,439 --> 02:57:17,670
